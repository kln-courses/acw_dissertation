<plain_text><page sequence="1">The symbolic assimilation of head and sun as expressed by headrests* von Bart R. Hellinckx Abstract The way in which the headrest assimilated the head with the sun is examined. An analysis of the decoration, shape, material, and colour of a number of headrests, as well as a short survey of the funerary literature, teaches us that the assimilation of the head and the sun is realized in three ways, namely by equating the headrest symbolically to the akhet, to the sky, or to both of them. The symbolism, which is attested from the end of the First Intermediate Period onwards, has to be seen against the background of the funerary beliefs and the conception of sleep. 1 Introduction During the preparation of an article on the solar representations near the head-end of coffins1, it was noticed that the way in which the assimilation of the head and the sun is expressed by headrests had not yet been properly studied. Though many scholars have noted the parallelism between a headrest occupied by a head and the akhet or horizon hieroglyph2, most of them gave only passing attention to it. In the LA-contribution My sincere thanks are due to Prof. H. Willems for his comments, and to T.L. Sagrillo for polishing my English and for some suggestions. Of course I am fully responsable for the present, final version. 1 See now B.R. Hellinckx, Solar images near the head-end of coffins and their relationship with the mummy, forthcoming. 2 B.

To remedy this lack somewhat and to create a starting point for further investigations, the present paper will discuss what are felt to be some of the most important sources concerning the solar symbolism of the headrest. Five decorative elements that seem to assimilate the head and the sun will be the first focus of attention. 2 Analysis 2.1 Decoration 2.1.1 A male figure j|| The central pillar of a famous ivory headrest llltlk y^llF from Tutankhamun's tomb (fig. 1 )5 consists of ^?i:;|t!^^^^^P^ a male figure kneeling and holding with up- ^^SK^ raised arms the curved upper section.

Saleh, Corpus der hieroglyphisehen Inschriften aus dem Grab des Tutanchamun, 1989,184. See also the references in the following notes. 6 Only two authors have a slightly deviant opinion. Fischer, in: LA IE, col. 692, n. 67, called the figure Heh, without further comment. Sourdive, La main, 258,260,262, accepted Fischer's identification and believed Heh is depicted as the personification of eternity rather than as a cosmic deity. According to him, the object is ?une metaphore decorative" expressing ?les millions d'annees". Whereas it is undeniable that many objects from Tutankhamun's tomb are decorated with a Heh who wishes the king a long life (see e.g. one of his chairs, Cairo JE 62029: Wilkinson, Reading Egyptian Art, 38-39), the absence of the year-sign(s), as well as the supportive function of the figure seem to contradict such an interpretation. On the other hand, it is not impossible that the figure represents Heh as a sky support. For the assimilation of Heh and Shu as sky support, see H. Bonnet, RARG, 1952, 268; D. Kurth, Den Himmel stiitzen, RE 2,1975,103-104; H. Altenmiiller, in: LA E, 1977, cols. 1082-1083, s.v. Heh. That both deities are interchangeable in this role most clearly appears in scenes of the separation of heaven</page><page sequence="3">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 63 here has been explained in three different ways. Firstly, Carter's view, widely known and generally accepted, is that the object is an illustration of the separation of the sky goddess Nut from the earth god Geb by the air and light god Shu7. Most scholars assume the curved top symbolically represents the sky and the base of the headrest symbolizes the earth. It follows that when the king's head rested on the upper section, the monarch lay with his head in heaven and was identified with the sun and the stars. According to a few authors the Shu-shaped headrest expresses that the person whose head rests on the upper curve is assimilated with the sky-goddess8. This explanation seems to be based on a ?misreading" of the object because there is no external evidence that the sleeper or the deceased strove to be identified with the sky-goddess. The second interpretation is only a slightly modified variant of Carter's explanation9. It links the object with the conception that the sky goddess (whether depicted as a woman or as a cow) is supported by Shu (see e.g. the Nut-image in Seti Fs cenotaph in Abydos and and earth. Frequently an ostrich feather on the head of the god that supports Nut denotes that he is Shu; see A. Niwiriski, La seconde trouvaille de Deir el-Bahari (Sarcophages) 1.2, CG, 1995,17, fig. 7, 107, fig. 85. Sporadically, however, the head of the supporting figure is surmounted by a year-sign, the symbol of Heh, see e.g. E. Chassinat, La seconde trouvaille de Deir el-Bahari (sarcophages) 1.1, CG, 1909,29 (No. 6008), fig. 26; A. de Buck, De godsdienstige opvatting van den slaap inzonderheid in het Oude Egypte, MVEOL 4, 1939, 16, fig. 4 (pap. Greenfield). Whether the head is surmounted by a feather or a year-sign, the accompanying legend indicates that the deity represents Shu! 7 H. Carter, The Reign of Tutankhamen, in: E.D.

The sole difference with the original interpretation is that the headrest's base is not explicitly associated with the earth god. Finally, there is de Buck's explanation, almost completely neglected, that the headrest is a sunrise-image, namely the raising of the sun out of the netherworld by Shu11. In his opinion, the pillar of the headrest had been shaped as Shu in order to assimilate the king's head on the curved top with the rising sun. The defenders of the three theories usually identify the lions on the base as the ?horizon lions", i.e. the two lions that were believed to guard the two mountain peaks between which the sun rose and set12. As it was thought that these mountains were at the eastern and western extremities of the earth, the lions may be considered as indirect evidence that the headrest's base symbolizes the earth13. It should be stressed, however, that a direct connection (such as is attested between the lions and the sunrise, see e.g. the well-known 10 H.

This seems to indicate that, in addition to Heh's role as sky support (see n. 6), he can also play the role of raiser of the sun. 12 Sometimes the lion pair actually replaces the mountain peaks, see ? 2.2.2. 13 Fox, Tutankhamun's Treasure, caption of pi. 62.

Some advocates of Carter's thesis suggest that the lions might also represent the earth-god Aker14. Stricto sensu, Aker never has the form of two separate lions. He is usually represented as a double lion or as a double sphinx, i.e. the fore-quarters of two recumbent lions or sphinxes fused at the rear15. Exceptionally, these double beings are divided in two half parts16. However, as the Aker-lions are closely related to the horizon17 and as the formal difference with the horizon-lions is very small, such an identification can perhaps not be completely ruled out. As an earth-god, Aker is of course connected with the other earth god, Geb18, but as far as is known he has nothing to do with the separation of sky and earth.

Book of the Earth: Hornung, Unterweltsbiicher, 443-44, fig. 92 (divided double lion); fifth hour of Amduat: ibidem, 113, fig. 5 (divided double sphinx). 17 In some representations the sun disc rests on a double lion or a double sphinx (= Aker) instead of being flanked by two complete lions. For such depictions on Third Intermediate Period coffins, see Hellinckx, forthcoming (n. 1). For an amulet reproducing the same image, see G.A. Reisner, Amulets I, CG, 1907, 173, pi. xxii = Wilkinson, Reading Egyptian Art, 134, ill. 2 (assigned to the New Kingdom, but it is unclear on which grounds). A well-known image in the Book of the Earth shows the raising of the sun out of the underworld by the arms of Nun between the divided double lion of Aker, see Hornung, Unterweltsbiicher, 444, fig. 92. The same Afterlife Book includes two representations of the double Aker-sphinx that is surmounted by a solar bark, see Ibidem, 430, fig. 83, 465, fig. 100.

Hellinckx SAK 29 heaven and earth (fig. 2), it can easily be observed that the likeness is restricted to the Shu figure with upraised arms. The absence of the anthropomorphic figures of Geb and Nut on the headrest is remarkable as they are essential for the illustration of the myth. If one con fronts the headrest with images of Shu supporting Nut (without Geb), the depiction of the sky-goddess has again only a meagre equivalent in the object's curved top. Conversely, the headrest occupied by a head closely resembles representations of Shu lifting the sun to the sky (fig. 3): the pillar reproduces the Shu-figure, the carved decoration on the base mirrors the two lions and the head takes the place of the sun. Fig. 3a-b: The raising of the sun out of the netherworld by Shu, after de Buck, Slaap, 16, figs. 5-6 (TIP papyrus Berlin 3147 and TIP coffin Cairo JE 26198). The lack of a depiction of the sky-goddess (abbreviated as two breasts and two arms) forms no objection, as the raising of the sun by Shu is a self-contained image. Thus, de Buck's neglected interpretation is certainly the best because it provides a coherent explanation of both the male figure and the lions and is supported by very similar two dimensional representations. However, through the separation of heaven and earth not only the sun's course along the sky came into existence, it also resulted in the first sunrise19. Therefore the separation of Geb and Nut, the sun's course, and the raising of the sun are sometimes combined into a single image (fig. 4)20. Likewise, representations of the raising of the sky goddess by Shu contain elements derived from both the sun's course and the 19 Te Velde, in: StudAeg 3, 161; M. Heerma van Voss, Agypten, die 21.

It is thus possible that the three explanations are all correct, and that Tutankh amun's headrest had been designed to reflect the two basic ideas of sunrise and sky lifting21. As will be seen further on, there are other indications that headrests are connected with the raising of the sun, with the supporting of the sky or with both of them. Finally, it is important to note that, without the two lions, one might be inclined to believe the sole purpose of this headrest was to ensure Shu would raise the head of the king. The raising of the deceased's head by Shu is mentioned in Coffin Text spell 366: ?My brow is raised up (ts) by Shu ..."22. Several scholars have called attention to the headrest determinative of the verb ts and have connected it with Tutankhamun's object23. The 21 Cf. the general statement by Wilkinson, Reading Egyptian Art, 159: ?the air god Shu who supported with his upraised arms the sky and the setting and rising sun". 22 CT V, 27a. Middle Kingdom coffin New York MM A 15.2.2ab has on the exterior an inscription which reads: ?Recitation by Shu: I have come that I may ts your head for you, so that you are alive each day, like Re for eternity", see Hayes, Scepter of Egypt I, 1953, pi. 207. As the word ts has a somewhat uncommon box-like determinative with curious projections on its underside it is unclear whether it is the strong verb ts ?to tie, to attach" or the verb 3 inf. tsi ?to raise, to lift up". H. Willems, Chests of Life, MVEOL 25, 1988, 171 (S3), translates it as ?to attach". Wb. V, 405.1, on the other hand, considers words with this peculiar determinative (all from PT) as a writing of the verb 3 inf. ?aufrichten, hochheben". Signs with similar projections are dealt with by H.G. Fischer, Varia Nova, Egyptian Studies 3,1996,226-27 [reference kindly supplied by B. Van Dooren]. The projections in htp ?offering table", he explains as the legs of the offering table. When used in the word hnw ?chest", Fischer believes them to represent a pair of transverse bars which keep the chest slightly off the ground. In connection with the word ch ?brazier", he thinks they might represent stones placed beneath the flat terracotta tray. For the sign in the verb ts, I would like to propose another explanation. A box with similar projections is also used as a determinative in the word ts.t ?Kasten aus Holz" (Wb V, 404.14). Possibly it represents a chest provided with poles to be carried by bearers. Such boxes, sometimes with a gable lid, are already known from representations in Old Kingdom tombs and an actual specimen was found in the tomb of Tutankhamun, see Edwards, Treasures of Tutankhamun, 108-109. Perhaps Sethe had a similar explanation in mind when he designated ts.t as a ?(tragbarer) Kasten" and stated that it was derived from the verb tsi ?erheben", see K. Sethe, Ubersetzung und Kommentar zu den Pyramidentexten 1,1935, 92 (comment of ? 184b). If this interpretation is correct, it is understandable that a representation of such a ?lifting-chest" (we would say a ?portable chest") was used as a deter minative of the verb ?to lift". In that case the text on the MMA coffin might be another instance of Shu's role of raiser of the deceased's head. Nevertheless, it should be taken into account that, already in the PT, there appears to be some confusion between the verbs ?to raise" and ?to attach" (see Wb V, 396.12; de Buck, Slaap, 26, n. 69). 23 Miinster, Untersuchungen Gottin Isis, 100; Zandee, in: Fs Heerma van Voss, 178. There might be an other indication that the idea of the raising of the mummy's head by Shu was connected with a headrest already in the Middle Kingdom. In the mummy mask spell of the Coffin Texts (CT VI, 123e [531 ]), as well as in the later Book of the Dead version (BD 151: Luscher, Totenbuch Spruch 151,138-39, 245) it is said ?Shu has given the raising up" (stsw). Taking into account the fact that the head of the mummy covered by a mask usually rested on a headrest, de Buck, Slaap, 15, suggested that this passage alludes to the raising of the mask-covered head by a headrest that symbolizes Shu. Unfortunately, his interesting interpretation is usually overlooked by scholars discussing this spell and a much less satisfying ex planation is given, see R.O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts E, 1977, 154, n. 3; E. Hornung, Das Totenbuch der Agypter, 1979,508; P.

Hellinckx SAK 29 occurrence of the headrest-determinative in the present context indeed seems to suggest that the mythological conception of the raising of the head by Shu was associated with a headrest as early as the Middle Kingdom. Had the Shu-figure been absent from the headrest, the presence of the lions could be easily explained. As sleep takes place between ?yesterday" and ?tomorrow" it is very understandable that the head of a sleeping person rests between the lions symbolizing these temporal entities (BD 17). Although all these elements were undoubtedly in the mind of the designer, the combination of the divine figure and the two lions Fig. 4: The separation of heaven and earth, the sun's course and the sunrise, after Kurth, Den Himmel stutzen, 72, fig. 1 (TIP papyrus Louvre). proves that the symbolism is much more profound. Besides alluding to the sunrise, the object equates the head of the king with the sun that is raised out of the netherworld. 2.7.2 A pair of arms On more than thirty headrests the underside of the curved top is decorated with a pair of painted or carved hands. With most of the examples the arms continue on the pillar (fig. 5)24. Fig. 5a-b: An Old Kingdom headrest with a pair of arms, after Sourdive, La main, 231, pi. xlvii (bottom) (Paris, Louvre E 13853). While the majority of these ?chiromorphic" (handshaped) or ?brachiomorphic" (arm shaped) headrests25 are of a late Old Kingdom or First Intermediate Period date, there are a few examples of the Middle Kingdom. Some of the latter are exceptional as they have an additional representation of a sun disc between a pair of hands on the upper side of the curved top (fig. 6)26. 24 For this headrest type, see Sourdive, La main, 229-264; Perraud, Appuis-tete, 102-116, 265-270. 25 These terms, introduced by Sourdive, La main, 229, are derived from the Latin chiro- ?hand" (itself a derivate of the Greek word cheir) and brachium ?arm", as well as from the Greek morphe ?form, shape". 26 Sourdive, La main, 234 (CV 06), pi. xlix (2-3), 241 (CV 18).</page><page sequence="9">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 69 Fig. 6a-b: A Middle Kingdom headrest with two pairs of hands and the sun disc, after Sourdive, La main, 235, pi. xlix (2-3) (Cairo, JE 30967A). The decoration of these headrests was surely meant to emphasize the supportive function of the headrest, as Wilkinson suggested27, but it is rather unlikely this was the only meaning of the decoration. According to Sourdive28, the raising of the head by the arms represented on the headrest symbolizes the lifting up of the deceased to the sky. His interpretation is based on the fact that one of the recurrent wishes in the Pyramid Texts is for the dead king to be raised to the sky, an idea that was democratized" in the period to which most of the headrests belong. Because according to these texts the deceased is mainly lifted by Shu, Sourdive argued that it are in all probability his arms that are represented on the headrests29. Perraud put forward what she rightly designated ?une interpretation plus prosalque"30. Having observed that a sleeping person often automatically uses his hands and arms to support his head, she believed that the decoration represents the hands and the arms of the sleeper. Thus, in her opinion, the headrests are the realization in a durable material of what is in a sense the first and most ?primitive" headrest of all: the sleeper's own hands and arms. Concerning the peculiar Middle Kingdom examples (fig. 6), Sourdive rejected - with good reason - Vandier's theory that the hands on the upper curve represent ?the hand of Atum" or the goddess Nebet-Hetepet31. Unfortunately, his alternative explanation is not convincing. According to him, the decoration of the headrests expresses that the head is received by the ?hands of the sun", and this symbolism, he believes, is also present in the later hypocephali32. However, that the hands on the upper 27 Wilkinson, Reading Egyptian Art, 159. 28 Sourdive, La main, 255-257. 29 Sourdive, La main, 260. This identification is further supported by the fact that, at least from the Middle Kingdom onwards, the conception of the raising of the deceased's head by Shu was connected with a headrest, see CT spell 366 mentioned in ? 2.1.1, and possibly also CT spell 531 (= BD 151), see n. 23. 30 Perraud, Appuis-tete, 268-69. 31 Sourdive, La main, 257-58.

His assumption that the Middle Kingdom specimens have a similar meaning as the hypocephali is probably based on the observation that a head, whether lying on such a headrest or on a hypocephalus, rested on a kind of sun image. Although there is indeed some analogy, it is only a superficial one. Perraud's statement33 that the sun disc on the upper side of the curved top shows in a straightforward manner the assimilation of the head and the sun is probably correct, but it does not explain the connection with the hands. The hands depicted on the upper side of the curved section are probably just meant as the inside of the two hands represented on the underside34, added to visualize even more clearly the assimilation of the curved top with a pair of raising hands. The presence of the sun disc justifies a comparison with some New Kingdom or Third Intermediate Period images that show the sun being raised out of the underworld by a pair of arms (fig. 7). Although similar images from older periods are wanting, corres ponding textual formulations already occur in the Pyramid and Coffin Texts?5 The headrests thus probably express that what is resting on the curved section, viz the head, is assimilated with the sun that is raised out of the underworld. The same explanation might also pertain to the chiromorphic and brachiomorphic headrests that lack the sun disc representation. 2.1.3 A djed-pillar A headrest amulet of iron ore, found with the mummy of prince Hornakht (a son of Osorkon II and Karomama, Twenty-second Dynasty), has an incised representation of a symbol with upraised arms on either side of the stem: on one side a djed-pillar and on the other a tit-knot (fig. 8)36. Because of the latter depiction, Perraud compared the amulet with four full-sized Middle Kingdom headrests where the pillar is shaped as one or two tit knots31; other than this accidental remark, the decoration of this object has so far not been 33 Perraud, Appuis-tete, 266-67. 34 This was pointed out to me by Prof. H. Willems. 35 PT ? 1425 [565] and CT n, 37h [80]. In the former instance the deceased king says: ?I have leant on your arm, O Shu, just as Re has leant on your arm". According to the second example, Shu says with regard to the sun god: ?my arms are under him". The passage wherein the latter sentence occurs strongly reminds one of the vignette of the 12th hour of Amduat, which is usually interpreted as the locking up of the netherworld and the raising of the sun to the sky by Shu, see S. Bickel, in: A. Brodbeck (ed.), Ein agyptisches Glasperlenspiel. Fs Erik Hornung, 1998,47. 36 P.

As the weres, djed, and tit-knot are amulets that had to be placed on the mummy according to the Book of the Dead (BD 166, 155 and 156), the object can be regarded as a composite amulet, combining three important funerary amulets38. JH JpT r?h c^n I-' V_I Fig. 8a-b: Headrest-amulet of prince Hornakht, after Montet, in: Kemi 9, 50, fig. 37. Although this may be one of the reasons for the decoration, this interpretation does not take into account the upraised arms of both djed and tit-knot unless one assumes that the arms are only intended to stress the supportive function of the headrest. Another possibility is that the djed represents a support of the sky, a function of the djed thai is comparatively well-attested39. In that case, one would expect the tit-knot to also depict a sky support. Although there seems to be little evidence for this role of the f//-knot40, a representation of 38 Such ?composite amulets" are not unusual; other instances include a heart amulet inlaid with a ba (e.g. Andrews, Amulets, pi. 61e); pectorals with a heart scarab flanked by a djed and a tit-knot (e.g. E. Feucht, Pektorale nichtkoniglicher Personen, AA 22,1971, Nos. 205,205 A, 205C); wesekh collars combined with a heart scarab (e.g. F. Thill, in: F. Geus/ F. Thill (eds.), Melanges offerts a Jean Vercoutter, 1985, 331-41); a cartonnage wesekh with a djed, two tit-knots, and a (heart) scarab (e.g. M. Dewachter, Pour les yeux d'Isis, cat. of exhibition in Carcassonne, 1998,40-41,112, No. 71); also plaques of gold foil incised with images of several amulets (e.g. Andrews, Amulets, pi. 16b). 39 Evidence: (l)dd spsy is sometimes used as a designation of Shu or the king when supporting the sky, see J. van Dijk, in: OMRO 66, 1986, 13. (2) dd spsy is an epithet of Ptah that refers to his role of sky uplifter, see J. Berlandini, in: RdE 46, 1995, 9-41. (3) That tomb ceilings symbolize the sky can be inferred from their decoration (stars, birds with outstretched wings, Nut images or Nut texts, etc.) and from their shape (vaulted). The fact that the pillars in the tombs are often decorated with a djed (e.g. in the tomb of Nefertari QV 66) indirectly indicates that the djed symbolically represents a sky support. Cf. D.M. Mostafa, in: GM 109, 1989, 45, 47 (with lit.). (4) According to an old theory, the djed is a combination of the four pillars of the heaven seen one behind the other, see e.g. W.M.F. Petrie, Medum, 1892, 31; E.A.W. Budge, The Papyrus of Ani, 1895, cxxxviii, n. 1 (with lit.); A. Moret, Du caractere religieux de la royaute pharaonique, AMG bibliotheque d'etudes 15, 1902, 43. This theory has some adherents even now, see e.g. H. te Velde, in: Visible Religion 4-5, 1985-86, 66. 40 It is not included in Kurth's discussion of the sky supports: Kurth, Den Himmel stiitzen, 77-104.</page><page sequence="12">72 B.R. Hellinckx SAK 29 a female-headed tit-knot that supports the sky-hieroglyph occurs on at least one coffin of the Twenty-first or early Twenty-second Dynasty, i.e. contemporary with the weres amulet41. The material from which the object is made points in the same direction: iron ore was associated by the Egyptians with the sky (cf. 4.1). Thus the decoration, as well as the material, might express that the curved top (or the whole headrest) symbolized the sky. The consequence is that the deceased's head resting on it lay in heaven and was identified with A Fig. 9: The raising of the sun by a djed-pi\\ar (19th Dyn. pyramidion from Gurob: London, UC 14648). the sun or another heavenly body. However, this does not exhaust the possible explanations of Hornakht's headrest amulet. All the decorative elements (the djed, the tit-knot and their upraised arms) can be accounted for if one interprets the representations on both sides of the central pillar as refering to the sunrise. The somewhat obscure connection between the tit knot and the sunrise will be discussed in the following section. The djed's rather well-known contribution to the sunrise will be addressed at once. From the Eighteenth Dynasty on there are many representations that show the sun on top of the upraised arms of the djed (fig. 942)43. Sometimes the sun rests on the arms of an ankh-sign surmounting the djed*4. There can be no doubt that in 41 Paris, Louvre E 3864: C.

First, the djed-pillai is a well-known symbol of Osiris46. Second, the djed surmounted by an ankh-sign has often arms holding a crook and a flail, both emblems associated with Osiris. Third, the djed is often flanked by a representation of Isis and Nephthys, the devoted wife and sister of Osiris. Finally, some texts explicitly mention this act of Osiris. In the so-called Cult-Theological Treatise, for example, the sunrise is described as follows: ?his father Osiris lifts him (the sun) up"47. Thus, the meaning of the djed-imagt on the headrest might be that Osiris (as a djed-pillar) raises the head of the mummy like he raises in the morning the sun out of the under world. Again it seems the decoration has been designed to assimilate the head with the rising sun. 2.1.4 A tit-knot The tit-knot image on the headrest amulet of prince Hornakht (fig. 8b) may also have been chosen because of its solar background. Similar representations of a tit-knot with upraised arms occur on some contemporary coffins and show how the sun is raised by the arms of the rif-knot48. Although it has so far not been recognized that such images depict sunrise49, this can Fig. 10: The raising of the sun by a tit-knot, after Niwiriski, in: BIFAO 86, 260, fig. 1 (TIP coffin Krakow UJ 10628). 45 First explained in this way by Assmann: J.

The trees undoubtedly represent the ?twin sycamores of turquoise from between which Re ascends" (BD 109 and 149), and &amp;&lt;z-birds are well-known as worshippers attending the sunrise51. As these worshipping 6a-birds some times also occur in combination with an armless tit-knot surmounted by the sun disc (fig. 11)52, it seems that such representations can also depict the sunrise. This is indeed very likely since representations of a djed-pillar surmounted by a sun disc, a winged scarab or a solar bark are also a variant of depictions of the sun raised by the arms of the djed (or the ankh)53. In view of the age-old connection between the djed and the tit-knot54, the representations of the solar tit-knot - with and without upraised arms - were probably created on analogy with the two types of djed-images. The red colour of the tit-knot, resulting from the tit-knoVs relation to the blood of Isis (BD 156), was perhaps reinterpreted as the red glow visible at sunrise and sunset.

Of course the tit-knot is a well known symbol of Isis, but other goddesses like Nephthys, Nut, and Hathor are sometimes also represented as a tit-knot55. Moreover, it seems that the tit-knot is related to Horus and Nefertem in one way or another56. However, since at least in one sunrise representation the fir-knot has a woman's head57, it may be assumed that these depictions express the idea that the sun is raised by a goddess. For Isis and Nephthys, there is plenty of textual58 and pictorial59 evidence that they were responsible for the raising of the sun to the sky, but as in most sources these goddesses perform this act together60, it is perhaps not very likely that the tit-knot represents one of them. Nut and Hathor are also closely related to the sun. However, as goddesses of heaven, they mostly receive the sun in the sky after it has been raised out of the underworld; as goddesses of the dead, connected with the west and the underworld, they usually receive the setting sun. Thus, for the moment the question which goddess the tit-knot personifies must remain unanswered. Turning back to the headrest amulet, one may 55 J.

Hellinckx SAK 29 conclude that the meaning of this part of the headrest's decoration is that a goddess lifts up the head of the deceased like she raises each morning the sun to the sky. In retrospect, the symbolism of the headrest amulet of prince Hornakht (fig. 8) may be summarized as follows. The object assimilated the deceased's head with the sun and connected the raising of his head with the sunrise: like the sun, the head was symbolically lifted by the djed-pillai and the tit-knot. However, as the two latter symbols may also function as sky supports, and as the amulet's material has a celestial significance, the head may also be compared to the sun that is in the sky. In all likelihood the amulet deliberately combines sunrise and celestial symbolism61. 2.1.5 A pair of scepters A representation in the tomb of the sculptor Ipuy in Thebes (TT 217; temp. Ramesses II) shows a headrest with both ends of the curved top supported by a was-sceptre (fig. 1262)63. K. Martin explained the presence of the sceptres by referring to the amuletic character of the was-sign (it means ?dominion")64. However, the vras-sceptres of this headrest may also have another meaning. From the Early Dynastic Period down to the Roman Period this kind of sceptre was considered by the Egyptians as a support of the sky65. It is for example well-known that a/?ef-hieroglyph supported tef Fig. 12: Representation of a headrest with a pair of HYw-sceptres. 61 Besides connecting the deceased with Re, the miniature headrest placed the deceased also in the position of Osiris. As a composite amulet, it not only provided him with his backbone, his vertebrae (djed-amulet BD 155), and with the protection of Isis (f*7-amulet BD 156), but it also raised him from his horizontal position and preserved him from the loss of his head (weres-amulet BD 166). By means of an ingenious combination of Osirian and solar elements, the deceased's fate was thus connected with both that of Osiris and Re, and this doubled his chances to attain the immortality. Hence, the object is a nice illustration of the ?Solar-Osirian unity", a major concept in Egyptian theology, and especially in that of the Twenty-first and early Twenty-second Dynasty. For the latter, see A. Niwinski, in: JEOL 30 1987-88,89-106; idem, in: GM 109,1989,60; idem, Studies on the Illustrated Theban Funerary Papyri of the 11th and 10th Centuries B.C., OBO 86, 1989, 38, 231. 62 Figure after N. de G.

Westendorf, in: SAK 6, 1978, 212, n. 25 (with older lit.), this symbolic function of the was-sceptre goes back to the long-necked animals which in prehistoric times were thought to support the heavens.</page><page sequence="17">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 77 by two was-sceptres is frequently used as a frame around representations66. Therefore, the decoration of the headrest probably expresses that the curved upper section symbolizes the sky. When the deceased's head rested on the curved top, it was in heaven amongst the sun and the stars, and it perhaps fused with them. Another possibility is that the scepters are in fact djam-staffs connected with the so called ?side-lock wearers" (hnzktyw)61. Since these divine beings are positioned at the eastern side of the sky68, i.e. at the place of sunrise, the staffs might indicate that the head rest represents the eastern horizon. In that case the head of the deceased is again assimilated with the rising sun. Attention will now be paid to the shape of the headrest. 2.2 Shape 2.2.1 The standard horizon-sign: the sun disc between two mountain peaks Many scholars have drawn attention to the strong formal likeness of a headrest occupied by a head and the akhet- or horizon-sign (Gardiner N 27): just as the sun is bordered by two mountain peaks, the head is flanked by the two ends of the headrest's curved top69. As to the question whether the Egyptians were aware of this formal analogy, the answer is definitely affirmative. This is not only indicated by the symbolic decoration of the head rests discussed above, but also by the evidence that will be considered further on (the materials and colours of a number of headrests as well as a passage in a headrest-spell of the Book of the Dead). Besides the formal similarity between a human head on a headrest and the sun in the horizon, there is also a ?behavioral analogy" of which it is difficult to believe that the Egyptians did not notice it. In the evening man puts his head on the top curve of a headrest and at the end of the day the sun sets between the mountains of the western horizon. In the morning man raises his head from the curved top of the headrest, whilst almost at the same time the sun rises from the eastern horizon. Thus, approximatively at the same moment of the day the human head and the sun ascend and descend70. //A _w Fig. 13: A New King dom block-headrest, after Bruyere, Deir el M?dineh (1934-1935) III, pi. xxiv. 66 Wilkinson, Symbol and Magic, 138-39.

According to Bruyere, Deir el M6dineh (1934-1935) III, 228, the Egyptians noticed the likeness as follows: when looking at the head-end of a bed occupied by a person, the headrest in combination with the top of the person's head reminded them of the horizon-sign. For the possibility that the Egyptians were aware that the sun is spherical and not just a disc, see L. Kakosy, in: Fs Westendorf II, 1984, 1057-1064, pis. 1-3; C. Vandersleyen, in: CdE 59, 1984, 5-13. Cf. D. Rampelberg, in: Acta Orientalia Belgica 8, 1993, 204, with n. 22. 70 Wilkinson, Reading Egyptian Art, 159.</page><page sequence="18">78 B.R. Hellinckx SAK 29 Perraud stressed that headrests antedating the late Old Kingdom could not symbolically represent the horizon because the ?classic" akhet-bieroglyph (Gardiner N 27) did not exist at that early date71. Before the end of the Old Kingdom the word ?akhet" was written with a flat oval sign representing a sandy tract (Gardiner N 18). Perraud's statement appears to be based on the sign-list of Gardiner's Grammar where it is indirectly mentioned that the standard afc/ief-hieroglyph does not occur in the Pyramid Texts12. Although this is correct, the fact that at least one Fifth Dynasty instance of the new sign is known should not be overlooked73. So theoretically the horizon symbolism of the headrest may have been as old as the Fifth Dynasty. With most headrests (e.g. fig. 1) the similitude to the dw-mountain is restricted to the curved shape of the top. This suggests that the two ends of the curved top symbolically represent the two peaks of the horizon mountain. On the other hand, the more ?massive" headrest types almost completely reproduce the mountain of the horizon. This applies especially to the examples shaped as a solid block with a curved top, the so-called ?block-headrests" (fig. 13), attested from the Second Dynasty to the Ptolemaic Period74. Of the headrests having the space on either side of the pillar filled with a wall of ?negative space"75, only those that have perpendicular sides look like the dw mountain (fig. 14). As the headrests that most clearly resemble the horizon-mountain belong to the more simple headrest types, it is rather unlikely that their resemblance to the akhet was primarily intentional. On the other hand, one should not underestimate the impact of formal resemblance on matters of Egyptian religion. Just like the Egyptians often searched for a meaningful connection between phonetically related words (and establishing ) (I Fig. 14: A New King dom negative space" headrest, after Bruyere, Deir el M6dineh( 1934 1935) III, pi. xxiv. 71 Perraud, Appuis-tete 1.1, 37. She even criticized Sourdive for his suggestion that some Old Kingdom headrests might symbolize the horizon: Ibidem, 1.1, 268, n. 349. 72 Gardiner, EG, 487, 489. 73 Tomb of Ty: P. Lacau, Sur le systeme hi?roglyphique, BdE 25,1954,34. Lacau considered the absence of the new akhet-sign in the Pyramid Texts as an indication that these texts were composed at a much earlier date. 74 For the lifetime of these headrests, see Perraud, in: Histoire et anthropologic No. 3, 25, pi. I (7th type from top). For some examples, see F. Petrie, Objects of Daily Use, BSAE 42, 1927, 35 (Nos. 17, 25, 27), as well as the instances listed by Fischer, in: LA III, col. 689, ns. 36-41. The similarity becomes especially apparent when one compares such a headrest with a three-dimensional version of the dw hieroglyph, i.e. the mountain-shaped base of a wooden model of the Abydos-fetish in New York (MMA 11.150.46), see H.E. Winlock, Bas-reliefs from the Temple of Rameses I at Abydos, MMA Papers 1.1, 1921,21, fig. 4 = B.H.

He mentions several examples of the New Kingdom and one of the late Old Kingdom. According to Perraud, in: Histoire et anthropologic No. 3,25, pi. I (8th type from top), such headrests are restricted to the New Kingdom (18th-20th Dyn.).</page><page sequence="19">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 79 secondary etymologies), similarity in shape was considered more than just a coincidence.76 Seen in that light, there can be no doubt that once the standard horizon sign existed, and the similarity of this sign with a headrest that happened to have this form was noticed, some significance was attached to this resemblance. Therefore, if the block-headrests and the ?negative space" examples were not actually made to express that a head resting on them symbolized the sun in the horizon, they most probably did contribute to the idea. Be this as it may, it seems likely that from the Fifth Dynasty at the earliest, the following symbolic equations were made: 1 human head_= sun_ 2 headrest's curved top or the = c/w-mountain between which the sun rises _whole headrest_and sets_ 3 1 headrest occupied by a head | = | akhet or ?horizon" These findings do not contradict the conclusions previously reached on the basis of the analysis of the headrest decoration. It was concluded the curved top of the headrest symbolized the arms or hands of the divine power that raises the sun. That the latter were closely connected with the dw-mountain is clearly shown by some Late Period Shu amulets: the upraised arms by which the god lifts the sun disc are shaped as the dw mountain (when combined with the sun, they form the aM^r-hieroglyph)77. The notion that the complete headrest can stand for the dw-mountain is also perfectly in accordance with the earlier conclusion that the headrest personifies the divine ?sun-raiser" because the latter is usually positioned at or in the horizon (Shu78) and is sometimes even assimilated with it (Osiris79). In a jrise d'objets on a Middle Kingdom coffin and in a vignette of the Book of the Dead papyrus of Ani (spell 166) a red pillow is shown on top of the headrest80. According to Perraud, this pillow stands for the sun and it stresses that the headrest occupied by a head symbolizes the akhet*1. Muller-Winkler has pointed out that the close relationship between 76 Cf. H. Satzinger, in: J. Aksamit et al. (eds.), Essays in Honour of Prof. Dr. J.

Hellinckx SAK 29 the akhet and the headrest had an impact on the fl?/*ef-amulets: the afw-mountain of some examples is shaped as a weres%1. Although both interpretations might be correct, perhaps not too much weight should be attached to them. 2.2.2 The variant horizon representation: the sun disc between two lions The observation that lions lived on the margins of the Eastern and Western Desert led to the idea that the eastern and western mountain peaks between which the sun rose and set (Manu and Bakhu) were guarded by a pair of lions83. The connection between the lions and the horizon hills was so strong that the former sometimes replaced the latter. This appears clearly in the vignettes of two Mythological Papyri*4: the two lions flanking the sun disc, either seated or couchant, reproduce the shape of the horizon hills, and they are even labeled as ?Manu" and ?Bakhu". According to Wilkinson, Tutankhamun's Shu-headrest (fig. 1) imitates such a special horizon-representation: the lions on the base of the object reflect the lions that replace the horizon hills, while the curved top of the headrest with the head which it supported mirrors the form of the sun itself85. As the shape of the headrest's upper section is very reminiscent of that of the mountain-hieroglyph, Perraud's inter pretation86 is more acceptable. She believes that the headrest, when occupied by a head, parallels the more common vignette of Book of the Dead spell 17: the curved neck-piece with the head nestling in it corresponds to the akhet, the decoration on the headrest's base reflects the lions that flank the horizon-sign87. Thus, the lions of Tutankhamun's headrest probably only enhance the horizon symbolism expressed by the curved top of the headrest, rather than actually composing the tf?/^-hieroglyph. The lion pair represented on two small pyramid-shaped ivory panels on the base of a wooden headrest of the Twenty-fifth or Twenty-sixth Dynasty in the British Museum probably has a similar function88.

A similar view is taken by Shaw/ Nicholson, British Museum Dictionary, 162, 270. 86 Perraud, Appuis-tSte LI, 252,1.2, pi. G6n. 5. 87 In the vignette, the lions are usually designated as ? Yesterday" (sj) and ?Tomorrow" (dwlw). These symbolic names stress that the akhet is a transitory place between sunset and sunrise. Appropriately, the headrest, which symbolizes the horizon-hieroglyph, is to the sleeper the border of sleep and waking, and to the dead that between death and life. 88 For this object (London, BM EA 26256), see E. A.W. Budge, British Museum: a Guide to the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Egyptian Rooms, and the Coptic Room, 1922, 26-27; idem, The Mummy, 19252, 248 49; E.R. Russmann, in: JARCE 34, 1997, 32-33, pis. 7-9. It has been dated on the basis of the Nubian styled headdress and earrings of the figures on the pillar.</page><page sequence="21">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 81 the two lions on this headrest occur in the same pose (recumbent) and in the same position (on both sides of the pillar) as the lions on Tutankh amun' s example, they differ from them in one remarkable respect: they are positioned perpendicular on the base. This difference, coupled with the absence of other decorative elements that unmistakably point to a solar symbolism89, makes it uncertain whether they really symbolized the lions of the horizon, although this seems, for the moment, the most likely explanation90. Even more difficult to interpret is a wooden headrest from El Mahasna (fig. 15)91. Its precise date, its present location, as well as its original appearance are uncertain. The only information is a drawing in Garstang's excavation memoir. It is not mentioned in the text of the excavation report, and records about the tomb in which it was discovered, or about objects found together with it, are completely lacking. According to the header of the plate on which it occurs, all the objects figured on it date from the ?VIth-XIth" Dynasty. The drawing shows a frag mentary object with the head and the forepaws of a lion and in the caption it is described as a ?head-rest in form of a lion". However, according to Fischer the object ?seems to take the form of a double lion"92. In view of its fragmentary condition, it is indeed possible that the other end of the headrest did reproduce the forepart of another lion and that the whole was shaped as two lions reclining back to back and fused into one being. Numerous double lion amulets found on the mummies of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom show the form of the double lion was in vogue during the period from which the headrest seems to date93. If the headrest had such a shape, it in all likelihood represented the god Aker. Probably the idea that the sun rose and set between two complete lions Fig. 15a-b: A fragmentary headrest from El Mahasna, after Garstang, Mahasna, pi. 33. 89 Unless the floral design on the rectangular plaque in the centre of the curved top symbolically represents the primordial waters. Mainly adorned with lotus flowers, which grow in watery surroundings, the design is not dissimilar to the interior decoration of a particular group of shallow New Kingdom faience bowls usually explained as representing a pool full of lotus flowers and symbolizing the primeval waters of Nun, see in the first place E.-C. Strauss, Die Nunschale, MAS 30, 1974, and since accepted by most Egyptologists, see e.g. Desroches Noblecourt, The Great Pharaoh Ramses II, No. 41; B.A. Porter, in: S. D'Auria/ P. Lacovara/ C.H. Roehrig (eds.), Mummies and Magic, cat. of exhibition in Boston, 19922, 138, with n. 8. In view of the widespread conception that the sun god travelled through the Nun during the night and rose from it in the morning, it is possible the decoration of the headrest was designed to put the user in the mythological position of the setting and rising sun. If this interpretation is correct, the two lions probably symbolize the lions of the horizon. However, they might also represent the Aker-lions. This clearly appears in a Book of the Earth representation (Hornung, Unterweltsbiicher, 444, fig. 92): between the divided double Aker-lion the sun is raised by a pair of human arms representing the waters of Nun. 90 It was also the interpretation suggested by Russmann, in: JARCE 34, 32, n. 101. 91 J. Garstang, Mahasna and Bet Khallaf, ERA 7, 1903, pi. xxxiii. 92 Fischer, in: LA III, cols. 692-93, n. 67. 93 Andrews, Amulets, 90.</page><page sequence="22">82 B.R. Hellinckx SAK 29 already existed in the Middle Kingdom94, but there is no conclusive evidence that a double Aker-lion played the role of the ?horizon lions" at that early date95. Thus, depending from the reconstruction and the date of the object, there is only a slight chance it was intended to associate the head's rising from the headrest with the sunrise. 2.2.3 The sky At first sight, the preliminary finding that the upper section of a headrest symbolizes the sky does not seem to be supported by the headrest's shape because there appears to be a great formal difference with the pet-sign: the top of the headrest has to be concave whereas the upper side of the sky sign was believed to be flat or convex96. However, if one reconsiders their shapes from the viewpoint of the head and the sun, some formal analogy can be observed: when the head is put to rest on a headrest, it approaches the curved, i.e. concave, top, and when the sun rises towards the sky it arrives at the concave underside of the sky vault. Moreover, a headrest, despite its modest height, is a kind of raised platform. This too might have led to the belief that the head that was put on it reached a higher level, i.e. the sky. 2.2.4. Some other suggestions According to Bruyfere, the Egyptians compared the curved section of the headrest with the crescent moon97. In his opinion, a headrest with a head resting on it symbolically represented the moon symbol, with the effect that the head was assimilated with the moon. Since he did not cite any evidence to support his interpretation, and since there does not seem to be a clue whatsoever, the existence of this conception can not be confirmed. Bruyfere also suggested - again without any proof - that the Egyptians noticed the ana logy between a head nestled on the top curve of a headrest and the horned sun disc of the cow-goddess Hathor. As will be shown elsewhere, there may be some indirect evidence that the headrest's curved top symbolized either the horns of the primeval cow that raise the sun out of the underworld, or the horns of the heavenly cow between which the sun is put98. In Wilkinson's opinion, the vignette of Book of the Dead spell 110 in the papyrus of Anhai (20th Dynasty), includes an image of a bark shaped as a headrest99. Although 94 This at least indirectly appears from two Middle Kingdom mirrors, the disc of which is flanked by two seated lions, see Schafer, in: ZAS 68,1. Since there is other evidence indicating that the disc of a mirror was considered as an image of the sun (Ibidem, 1-7), one may see in the composition of these objects a precursor of the well-known BD-vignette. 95 For the sunrise between the Aker-lions, see n. 17. 96 For the form of the sky, see H.

She, however, had to admit that there is not the slightest proof of this. Nevertheless, there might be some circumstantial evidence for this theory too, but this will be dealt with elsewhere101. Finally, mention should be made of an interesting, but problematic observation by de Buck. The exterior Middle Kingdom box-coffin of a certain Nakhti from Assiut (now in the Louvre) is decorated with a headrest, both ends of the curved top of which are supported by a lotus bud102. De Buck noted the analogy with the vignette of Book of the Dead spell 81 which shows a large lotus flower flanked by two smaller buds and sur mounted by a human head103. Because the two buds of the headrest-depiction correspond to the buds of the Book of the Dead vignette, whereas the head resting on the upper curve of the headrest concurs with the head on top of the lotus flower, de Buck concluded that the headrest symbolically coincided with the central lotus flower104. There is not a single weak spot in the reasoning itself, but there is one major problem: the vignette is not attested before the New Kingdom, whereas the headrest-representation is definitely of the Middle Kingdom Though not considered by de Buck, the notion that a headrest may stand for a lotus flower has serious implications for the head that lay down on it. It is possible that the vignette of ?the spell for being transformed into a lotus" (BD 81), besides visualizing that the deceased has taken the shape of a lotus, also alludes to the deceased's identification with the sun reborn from the primeval lotus105. Therefore, one could think that the special headrest-image was intended to assimilate the deceased's head with the rising sun. How ever, as this version of the creation myth is not attested before the post-Amarna Period106, this is rather unlikely. Therefore, it does not seem that the Nakhti-representation can be used as evidence for the assimilation of the head and the sun. 2.3 Material and colour The present section will be devoted to a discussion of some headrests of which the material and/or colour was possibly intended to associate the head with the rising sun.

Hellinckx SAK 29 outset, it should be clear that the findings have to be regarded as circumstantial evidence. The discussion will primarily focus on the interpretations put forward by others. These will be critically examined, and if necessary, refined or supplemented. 2.3.1 Iron or haematite Besides a few weres-amulets of iron from royal burials of the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period (Tutankhamun, Shoshenq II and Hornakht), a very substantial number of haematite headrest-amulets is known from private burials of the Late Period107. Aufttre believes the frequent use of iron and haematite (both called bji in Ancient Egyptian)108 is due to the celestial symbolism of these materials109. According to him, it was thought that a headrest made from the same material as the sky and the stars had the magical potency to raise the deceased's head to the sky110. In Perraud's opinion, the Zyi-material is perfectly in accordance with the horizon significance of the headrest as it assimilates the head on the headrest with the sun that rises towards heaven111. However, it should be stressed that bji is not a material connected with the horizon, but with the sky. Therefore, it is perhaps more likely that the ty'i-material has simply been chosen to express that the headrest symbolized the sky, and that, as a result, a head resting on it was in heaven like the sun and the stars. 2.3.2 Per sea wood Wilkinson stated that a headrest was made from persea wood on account of the solar significance of this material112, and his interpration has been accepted by Perraud113. Neither of them mentions a museum number or a bibliographic reference, but the object to which they allude is in all probability the New Kingdom example analysed by Ribstein and mentioned by Lucas114. Unfortunately, Wilkinson's statement appears to be based on the old view that the persea of the classical writers (Mimusops species) corresponds to the isd 107 For these amulets, see Muller-Winkler, Objekt-Amulette, 325-334; Perraud, Appuis-t?te LI, 300-315, 1.2, 1-18. 108 J.R.

A similar explanation is given by Muller-Winkler, Objekt-Amulette, 328, and Franco, Rites et croyances, 167. 110 For the connection of bji with the sky and the stars, see H.

It is often stated that the Egyptians were aware of the meteoric origin of the iron and haematite they used, see e.g. Wilkinson, Symbol and Magic, 84-85. Aufrere, how ever, rightly stresses that this is possible, but by no means certain. 111 Perraud, Appuis-tate 1.1, 308. 112 Wilkinson, Symbol and Magic, 90. 113 Perraud, Appuis-t?te 1.1, 323. 114 A.

Presently, botanic experts identify the per sea with the swjb-tree and equate the isd-tree with the Balanites Aegyptiaca115. Whereas there is ample evidence of the ?sunrise symbolism" of the isd, there are only minor indications that the swib was connected with the sunrise116. That the wood of this headrest was deliberately selected in order to compare the head's rising from the headrest with the sunrise is thus possible, but much less likely than it would appear from the statements of Wilkinson and Perraud. 2.3.3 Painted red A number of headrests of Old Kingdom or early First Intermediate Period date have been painted red117. Perraud suggested several explanations for this colour (e.g. that it imitates the colour of wood), but in the end she believed that it reproduces the red glow of the sun at its rising and setting (she refers to PT ? 854a [456] which, according to the communis opinio, contains an allusion of the reddened sun at dawn)118. As red is indeed a colour symbolically connected with sunrise and sunset in the horizon119 and as the examples date from a time when the classic akhet-sign had already been introduced, it seems indeed possible that these headrests were painted in this way to enhance their horizon symbolism. 2.3.4 Painted yellow or gilded Some headrests of the Old Kingdom and the First Intermediate Period are painted yellow or gilded (the painted ones are undoubtedly a cheap substitute of the gilded)120. Likewise, three headrests from the tomb of Tutankhamun are made of gilded wood121. As the 115 R. Germer, in: LA IV, 1982, col. 942; R.

Hellinckx SAK 29 Tutankhamun headrests were probably connected with the three ritual couches from the tomb's antechamber (of which it is difficult to deny that they have some symbolic significance)122, it is not unlikely the objects associated with them also have a profound meaning. Regarding the symbolism of these objects, Perraud restricted herself to a rather general statement: ?Cette couleur peut faire reference a la lumtere solaire, a la chair divine des dieux, done a l'immortalite, mais aussi a Hathor, la Doree"123. In the context of the headrests, it is perhaps most likely that the yellow colour and gilding have a solar symbolism. Gold is often used in New Kingdom texts as a metaphor of the light, the rays and the brilliance of the sun124. It is therefore connected with the place where the sun is during the day, i.e. the sky, as well as with the place where the sun rises each morning, i.e. the horizon. This appears clearly from the sun hymns: it is frequently said that ?the sky is gold"125 and that ?the sun rises in gold".126 So, in all likelihood, the material either ex presses that the deceased whose head rests on the headrest is in the sky like the sun or it compares the rising of the head from the headrest with the sunrise out of the horizon. 2.3.5 Painted blue or made from a blue material According to Gilbert a headrest from the tomb of Tutankhamun was made from light blue glass in order to reproduce the bright sky of a newly started day127. Aufttre's interpretation takes the same direction. In his opinion, the material of the headrest imitates turquoise, and the object symbolizes the place where the sun rose128. As the material of the headrest indeed closely resembles turquoise and as the Egyptians believed that turquoise was connected with the sunrise and the horizon (see e.g. the ?two sycamores of turquoise")129, this may be 122 Reeves, The Complete Tutankhamun, 183. 123 Perraud, Appuis-tete 1.1, 60, cf. 130. 124 J.

Besides its brilliance, its eastern place of origin, i.e. the mines in the eastern desert, may also have been a reason for its ?sunrise symbolism". 127 Gilbert, in: Le regne du soleil, 134.

The eastern place of origin of this material, i.e. the Sinai, may have been a constitutive factor of this symbolism.</page><page sequence="27">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 87 correct. The turquoise-coloured faience example of princess Ahmose Tumerisi of the early Eighteenth Dynasty130 perhaps expresses the same symbolism. Tutankhamun's tomb also yielded a headrest of deep blue faience and one of dark blue glass131. In Gilbert's view, these objects are made of a lapis lazuli coloured material in order to reproduce the noc turnal sky132. As there is evidence that lapis lazuli was believed to symbolize the sky133 and as the gold speckles on the glass example resemble the stars of the sky somewhat, it is indeed very likely the material expresses that the head on the headrest is in heaven134. How ever, lapis lazuli can also stand for the primeval waters (Nun)135. As a sun hymn compares the sleeping of man with entering the waters of Nun136, it is not unreasonable to assume man's awakening was likened to the going forth from the primeval waters. It is well known that the sun god travelled through the Nun during the night and rose from it in the morning. As a matter of fact, some sun hymns describe sunrise as follows: ?the primeval ocean is lapis lazuli while you (the sun) rise in it"137. It is thus also possible these headrests suggest the head rises from the primeval waters like the sun god at the end of his nocturnal journey. From the survey above, it appears that the material from which the headrests are made and the colour in which they are painted sometimes had a symbolic meaning.

Hellinckx SAK 29 headrest, not just the pillar or the curved top, could have a celestial (iron, haematite, yellow paint, gilding, and lapis lazuli coloured material) or a ?sunrise" significance (red paint, yellow paint, gilding, turquoise coloured, and lapis lazuli coloured material). Symbolically significant materials and colours are most often encountered with amulets and royal headrests. Besides a few examples of the New Kingdom and the Third Intermediate Period, most amulets are of a Late Period date, while the full-sized royal headrests are all from the New Kingdom. However, a few Old Kingdom and First Intermediate Period examples of private persons (painted red, yellow, gilded, or of blue colour) might indicate that the horizon and sky symbolism already existed at an earlier date. As isolated evidence these speculative findings would of course be insufficient, but combined with the other in dications they are useful and complement the overall picture. 2.4 Texts relating to the headrest In the Coffin Texts spells associated with the headrest (CT 232, 823, and 934) little seems to point to a connection between the head's rising from the headrest and sunrise, or to an equation of the headrest and the sky. On the other hand, the headrest spell of the Book of the Dead (BD 166) contains a passage which seems to assimilate the headrest occupied by a head with the horizon138. The relevant part of the spell runs as follows: ?may the pigeons139 awaken you when you are asleep, may they awaken your head at the horizon" (srs tw mnw.wt sdr.ti srs.sn tp.k r ih.t). Although the assimilation is not very explicit, the fact that it is precisely near the horizon that the head - resting on the headrest - was awoken from the sleep of death by the pigeons strongly suggests that a headrest occupied by a head symbolized the place of sunrise and sunset140. As a matter of fact, it seems that one of the characteristics of the horizon has been transposed upon the headrest. The horizon 138 For this spell, see the references listed by S.A. Gulden/ I. Munro, Bibliographic zum Altagyptischen Totenbuch, SAT 1,1998,167-68. Add: J. Yoyotte, in: C. Falgayrettes, Supports de reves, 1989,30-31, 122; M.

They are guided in this by the ?sunrise symbolism" of the swallow. From a love poem it clearly appears swallows were believed to announce the dawn, and in this capacity this kind of bird also sits on the prow of the solar bark, see H. te Velde, in: Fs Widengren (see n. 119) I, 26-31; D.C. Patch, in: JARCE 32, 1995, 110. Because it is a migratory bird - leaves Egypt and later returns - the swallow also stands for regeneration", see R. Wassermann, in: LA V, 1984, col. 754, with n. 7. This aspect also makes it very suitable for the funerary spell. However, one should not lose sight of the fact that all the versions mention mnw.wt or mnw.w, see Luscher, Totenbuch Spruch 151,294 (b). Therefore, it is perhaps better to follow the text as it stands and to look after an alternative explanation. Possibly the Egyptians had the experience of being frequently awakened by the noise of pigeons (they coo quite loudly in the morning), and this may have led to the belief that these birds could magically awake the dead from their ?sleep". 140 The passage is usually interpreted in this way: Bruydre, Deir el M6dineh (1934-1935) III, 232; Corteggiani, Centenaire de lTnstitut frangais, 50; Parlebas, Ktema 7, 21; Luscher, Totenbuch Spruch 151, 294.</page><page sequence="29">2001 The symbolic assimilation of head and sun 89 is well-known as a place where the enemies of the sun are overcome141, and from the spell it appears that the headrest too is connected with the defeat of the adversaries: ?raise your self, (for) you triumph over what was done against you. Ptah has overthrown your enemies. It has been commanded to act against him who acted against you". 3 Evaluation From the preceding analysis it appears that headrests are symbolically connected with the akhet, with the sky, or with both of them. Most of the headrests seem to be associated with just one of the two. A turquoise-coloured headrest, for example, seems to hint at the sunrise out of the horizon, whereas a headrest amulet of haematite probably alludes to the sky. Only in a few cases, e.g. Hornakht's amulet, the horizon and sky symbolism can be recognized at the same time. Of several headrests, e.g. Tutankhamun's Shu-headrest and gilded examples, it cannot be ascertained with which of the two symbolic spheres they are connected. This might be due to the lack of decisive information, but as the ambiguity is of such a nature that it certainly would have pleased the Egyptians, this might also be inten tional. The double symbolism of the headrest has been summarized in table 1. The more hypo thetical suggestions stand between brackets and some of them have been adapted to the structure of the table. _Object (Sehbild)_Symbol (Sinnbild)_ _Akhet (horizon)_Sk%_ &lt;fty-mountain_sky__ Complete headrest (double horizon lion)_0_ _divine ?sun-raiser"_0_ divine power that raises the sun sky support: pair of was-sceptres; Pillar out of the underworld: Shu- Shu-figure; djed; m-knot figure; pair of arms; djed', tit _knot_ Jw-mountain_(sky vault)_ arms or hands of the divine 0 power which raises the sun out Curved top of the underworld_ (horns of the primeval cow that (horns of the heavenly cow raise the sun out of the between which the sun is put) underworld)_ (solar bark that is raised out of (solar bark that travels along the _the underworld)_sky)_ Decoration of base_two horizon lions_0_ Table 1.

Hellinckx SAK 29 A comparison of the information contained in table 1 with what is known about the symbolism of a closely related piece of furniture, i.e. the bed, may be informative. In fact, it seems that the symbolism of the headrest runs to a large extent parallel to that of the bed. That the funerary bier can symbolize the sky is clearly expressed in some texts. In Pyramid Text spell 417 it is said: ?The Great One (i.e. Osiris, the deceased king) sleeps upon his mother Nut"142. The important text on the lid of the outer sarcophagus of Merenptah is even more explicit: ?You put yourself down on the bier (nnm.t) which I (i.e. Neith as sky goddess) am"143. Sometimes the bier even has the shape of the heavenly cow (e.g. the well known example from Tutankhamun's tomb)144. That the bier can also stand for the place of sunrise is suggested by the lion-beds: beds of which the two side-sections are shaped as a simple or a double lion145. Moreover, there is also evidence that the bier was considered as a vessel on which the mummy was transported, perhaps on analogy with the journey of the sun in his bark146. Finally, the placing of a mummy on a cow-shaped bed seems to have symbolized the ascension of the dead on the back of the heavenly cow as is described of the sun god in The Destruction of Mankind147. As the ascension on the back of the heavenly cow is comparable to the positioning of the sun between the cow horns148, it is not unlikely that the placing of the head on the headrest's curved top symbolically coincided with that mythological act. To determine in which period the symbolic associations of the headrest originated, table 2 surveys the chronological distribution of the most important indicators. The indicators that possibly suggest a horizon symbolism are indicated with an ?x", those that seem to express a sky symbolism with an ?jc", and those that appear to evoke a double symbolism with ,,*".

Neverthe less, there are some indications of an earlier date as well. Of these, the Middle Kingdom chiromorphic headrests of which the decoration includes an image of the sun are certainly the most important. The fact that the classic akhet-hieroglyph was introduced around the Fifth Dynasty is also a major factor. Although it does not prove the existence of the head rest's horizon symbolism at that early date, it makes it at least possible. In this context it should be noted that a part of the bed symbolism certainly goes back as far as the Old Kingdom, viz the conception that the bier symbolizes the sky (cf. the PT-spell cited above). Other important information is provided by the ?Gliedervergottungstexte". Whereas the assimilation of the head and Re is absent from the Pyramid Texts150, the head and the face are assimilated with Re (or the sun disc) in the Coffin Texts and in the Book of the Dead151. The absence of this conception in the Pyramid Texts does not necessarily mean that the symbolic assimilation of the head and the sun was not yet known in the late Fifth and Sixth Dynasty. It is well-known that parts of the Pyramid Texts were composed somewhat earlier 149 Seen. 117. 150 PT ? 135 [213], 148 [215], 1298 [537], 1303-04 [539], 2098 [690]. See F.A.-M.

Hellinckx SAK 29 than the moment at which they were inscribed. Moreover, one should reckon with the possibility that at least some of the Coffin Texts antedate the end of the First Intermediate Period (this may apply to the Gardiner Papyri which contain one of the ?Gliederver gottungstexte" under discussion152). All this - admittedly indirect - evidence makes it possible that the horizon and sky symbolism of the headrest originated before the New Kingdom: almost certainly at the end of the First Intermediate Period, and perhaps already in the late Old Kingdom or early First Intermediate Period. Having ascertained that some headrests symbolize the sky and/ or the horizon, a very important question remains to be answered: What purpose did this symbolism have? The celestial symbolism of the headrest is undoubtedly connected with the well-known wish to be received after death by the sky-goddess, to be put among the circumpolar stars, and to become identified with the sun. This wish could be symbolically realized by means of a ?three-dimensional pun", namely by causing the tomb, the sarcophagus, the coffin, or the funerary bier to symbolize the sky-goddess153. The headrest's sky symbolism is based on a similar procedure, the only difference being that the head has to be seen as a pars pro toto, i.e. stands for the deceased in general. The headrests with a clear celestial symbolism are all purely funerary: the representation with the was-sceptres is included in a tomb scene (Ipuy's) showing the production of funerary objects (e.g. a shrine), and the iron and haematite headrests are miniature examples placed with the mummy. The horizon symbolism of the headrest seems to be related to the Egyptian conception of sleep154. From the dreams one had, it was deduced that the sleeper found himself in another, somewhat strange world155. Sleep was considered threatening because it was realized that a sleeping person was extremely vulnerable to chthonic creatures like snakes, and sleep was also seen as a state very near to death because the sleeper was in a condition of inertness. The close relationship of sleep with death had a positive aspect because 152 For the different opinions concerning the date of these documents, see Willems, Chests of Life, 246, n. 24. 153 See A.

This appears clearly from some Letters to the Dead in which a deceased is asked to appear in a dream156. However, this death-like condition also brought with it a major danger, i.e. the possibility that the sleeper did not wake again and himself became a dead person. The Egyptians noted the far reaching parallelism between a sleeper and the night sun: in the evening the sun sank into the land of the dead, was threatened by a snake (a giant one, i.e. Apophis), and had to seek a way to leave the depths of the netherworld. Having observed that the sun succeeded each day in overcoming this life-threatening danger, they searched a way to transpose upon the human situation the factors that contributed to this success. The two foremost objects connected with the sleep of men were the bed and the headrest. Because of the formal similarity that existed between the head and the sun on the one side, and the headrest and the horizon mountains on the other side, the headrest was the natural candidate to carry the solar symbolism. The headrest's likeness to the horizon could be enhanced by choosing a specific colour or material connected with the horizon, or by adding a representation of the lionine animals which were thought to guard the horizon mountains. The sleeper whose head was on such a headrest would in the morning magically awaken because his head would rise on analogy with the sun. Besides deliberately stressing the headrest's resemblance to the sunrise region, the headrest could be assimilated (through shape or decoration) with the divine power that caused the sun to rise out of the underworld. In that case, the headrest would lift up the sleeper's head, and this would lead to his awakening from the ?depths of the sleep". The conception that the headrest was connected with the raising of the head also appears from the occurrence of the headrest-determinative with the verb ts ?to raise"157 and from the fact that the three headrest-related spells of the Coffin Texts include passages dealing with the raising of the head158. That the headrest was the means par excellence to prevent the sleeper staying forever in the precarious death-like state is also indicated by the Egyptian designation of the headrest: wrs means something like ?that which keeps awake"159. Moreover, the opening lines of the headrest-spell of the Book of the Dead (BD 166) are also devoted to awakening160. 156 See e.g. E.F. Wente, in: OLP 6/7, 1975/1976, 595-600. 157 CTV,27a[366]. 158 CT III, 300b [232], VII, 24e [823], VII, 136c [934]. 159 Parlebas, in: Ktema 7, 20; Perraud, Appuis-tete 1.1, 35. That the noun is derived from the root rs ?wake" was already noticed by tequier, Les frises d'objets, 237-38. He, however, assumed that the ori ginal meaning of this verb was ?soulever, eiever" and hence his interpretation that the weres is ?un objet destine a soulever la t?te". Boreux, in: AIP 3, 98, linked the word with the same root, but gave still another explanation. According to him, the headrest was ?that what is watchful, vigilant" over the sleep. 160 Cf. E. Naville, in: ZAS 48, 1911, 108: ?le chevet bien loin d'endormir le d?funt doit au contraire lui procurer un r?veil".</page><page sequence="34">94 B.R. Hellinckx SAK 29 The possibility of being bitten by snakes during the night was nullified by decorating the headrest with a protective formula and/or some representations of apotropaic figures161. However, contrary to what is sometimes stated162, it does not seem that the analogy with the sun has been deliberately striven for on this level. Depicted on the headrests are not the sun's principal defenders (viz the uraeus, the Mehen-serpent, the god Seth and the jackals that pull the solar bark), but the more traditional household-gods like Bes. As the latter's role as protector of the sun is not attested before the Third Intermediate Period163, whereas the headrests with this kind of apotropaic decoration are mainly of the New Kingdom, there is so far no proof that the decorators had the analogy with the sun in mind. Sleep did not only have negative connotations; the beneficial effect of sleep was also noticed. Here too there was an analogy with Re: the sun, which in the evening was weakened, was in the morning powerful again when it rose out of the life-giving waters of the Nun. That the Egyptians were aware of this parallel is demonstrated by the above mentioned sun hymn passage in which sleep is compared to a submersion into the Nun164. It is therefore possible that the positive aspect of sleep was promoted by selecting for the headrest a material with the colour of the Nun (i.e. dark blue). According to the Egyptians there existed a very close relationship between sleep and death165. It was not only said about the living that, when asleep, it was as if they were dead166, the dead too were compared with sleepers167. Therefore, headrests in which the horizon-symbolism had been stressed in some way (e.g Tutankhamun's Shu-headrest) could after their use in this world also awaken the deceased from the ?death-sleep". This explains why the horizon symbolism, in all likelihood originally connected with the con ception of sleep, was also directly adopted for funerary headrests (see e.g. the chiro- or brachiomorphic headrests, some of which carry a funerary inscription). As a matter of fact, 161 See e.g. E. Feucht (ed.), Vom Nil zum Neckar, 1986, 75; Reeves, The Complete Tutankhamun, 183; Perraud, in: RdE 49, 161-66, pis. xxii-xxv. Similar figures frequently occur on the footboard of beds, see e.g. Reeves, The Complete Tutankhamun, 180. 162 E.g. by Perraud, in: RdE 49, 1998, 165. 163 M. Malaise, in: S. Israelit-Groll (ed.), Studies in Egyptology presented to Miriam Lichtheim II, 1990, 699-701. Another view is taken by Altenmuller, Die Apotropaia I, 152-154. He connects the Bes-like figures on the magic wands of the Middle Kingdom with solar mythology. 164 See n. 136. 165 In Greek mythology Hypnos (sleep) is a brother of Thanatos (death). 166 E.g. in the ?Shorter Hymn to the Aten": ?When you [the sun] set in the western horizon of heaven, they repose in the fashion of those who are dead, heads covered, noses obstructed..."; translation reproduced from W.J.

In that case, the headrest made the head rise from the ?depths" of the netherworld and caused the deceased to reach heaven. The object that most clearly displays such a double symbolism, i.e. the example of Hornakht, is certainly of a purely funerary nature since it is an amulet which was originally deposited with the mummy.</page></plain_text>
