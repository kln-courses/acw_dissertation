Stud. 7,pp. 125-140 DONALD EVANS Professor of Philosophy, University of Toronto IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD For Ian Ramsey, talk about God raises many philosophical problems: 'If we are not to use anthropomorphic concepts like love, power, wisdom, we cannot talk about God; but if we do use them, how do we manage to talk of God and not man?' (MJGCI52)' 'Believers wish on the one hand to claim that he (God) is indescribable and ineffable, and yet on the other hand to talk a great deal about him. Nay more, when they speak of God they say that he is transcendent and immanent, im passible yet loving, and so on. But if we speak like this, are we talking significantly at all? Here is the Falsification Problem: What kind of talk can this talk about God be, if it permits us to use such conflicting descriptions of God and to continue to use these descriptions in the face of any and all empirical phenomena?' (RL 13-I4). Ramsey holds that we can manage to talk of God while using anthro pomorphic concepts, and that talk about God can be significant in spite of apparent contradictions. His philosophy is essentially an account of how such talk is significant. He presents his analysis of religious language as an answer to the narrow empiricism of Antony Flew (MM59-6o) and Richard Braithwaite (RB84) and also as an alternative to the accounts given by 1 The following is a list of works by Ramsey which are cited in this essay, together with abbrevia tions used in the notes: AC: 'The Authority of the Church Today', Authority and the Church, ed.

It is an important alternative, one of the most important in modern philosophy of religion, but it is difficult to grasp as a whole. Ramsey's philosophy is scattered among many brief occasional pieces, in each of which some old Ramsey ideas are sketched and some new Ramsey ideas are introduced. He provides no comprehensive overall account. Instead, his philosophy emerges like a jig-saw picture-puzzle where each piece overlaps with some of the others and also fills a gap left by all the others. Moreover, even when all the existing pieces are put in place, there are gaps left open; we have only some hints as to how they might eventually be filled. This essay is an attempt to provide a comprehensive overall picture, an outline sketch of Ramsey's philosophy as I understand it. Since it is only an essay, and since it is not only a summary but also an interpretation of Ramsey's thought, it may be misleading in some respects. Certainly it will not convey the stimulating brilliance and lively wit of Ramsey's writing. But it seems to me important to try for an overall picture. I have found that it forced me to set aside many criticisms of Ramsey which arise from piece meal studies of his works, since Ramsey often remedies obscurities and defects in one book or article by dealing with them in another. When we can see an overall picture the real weaknesses of his philosophy, as well as the strengths, emerge much more clearly. I hope that this essay will enable readers to see some of these weaknesses and strengths, but there will not be space for me to make an appraisal myself. The essay is divided into five sections. In the first section we will consider what Ramsey regarded as his first task: to challenge a narrow form of empiricism in which reality consists solely of what is publicly observable (ICBCiog). If such an empiricism were accepted, any belief in God would obviously be untenable. Ramsey proposes a wider form of empiricism. He holds that whatever is real has some relation to experience, but that what men experience can not be reduced to public observables, since what men often discern is observables and 'more'. Unless there is 'more' there is no God, though to show that there is 'more' is not in itself to show that there is God. I. DISCERNMENT OF 'MORE Ramsey gives a great many different examples of situations where we discern observables and 'more'. Indeed, he provides such a vast variety of examples, useful perhaps in a shot-gun barrage against narrow empiricism, that the reader is bewildered. Ramsey does not sort out his examples clearly, distinguishing them into types each of which has a different kind of 'more'. And his examples are not equally relevant, or in the same way relevant, to</page><page sequence="3">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD I27 the 'more' which is God. My own classification, which covers most of his examples, would be as follows: (i) Awareness of I: (a) I, as a conscious subject using language, am more than my describable, observable behaviour. For the subject-object dis tinction presupposes that there is at least one subject, and all language presupposes a subject using language. (BPi8o, MM27, TL4, RS39-4I) (b) I, as conscious agent, acting in a free or personal or authentic way, in contrast with an involuntary (or conditioned reflex) way, an impersonal (or official) way, or an unauthentic way, am more than my describable, observable behaviour. (Fl, chs. I, 2, MTi6q, RL22-3) (2) Personal encounter: The I of another human being whom we discern in personal encounter is more than his describable, observable behaviour. (PG63-8, RLIg-20, 26, RSI4; cf. BP2o3, AC7I) (3) Moral claim: A moral claim to which one responds in a situation is more than the situation as described in terms of observables. (Fl, ch. 2, RLi6-i8, 29-31, MTI72, MJGCI66-7, RS42-3, BPI85-6) (4) Aesthetic wonder: An impressive work of art such as a picture, poem or symphony, which evokes wonder, is more than the describable features of the work of art. (RL72-3; cf. RS13-I4, RL76) (5) Whole: A whole is more than the sum of its parts. For example, a gestalt pattern is more than the sum of its parts. (RL23-4, MMIo, CD5, FI93-4; cf. CE4I-3% 47) (6) Scientific models: What a scientific model is about is more than the observables to which it is applied. For example, electricity as a current is more than what's observed; light as waves or particles is more than what's seen; the opposition of an induced current to a magnet is more than what's observed. (MMI3-I4, 19-21; RS20-22) (7) Infinite mathematical series: A circle is more than any polygon in an infinite series where each polygon has one more side than the previous polygon. The number 2 is more than any sum in an infinite series 'I plus I/2 plus I/4 plus i/8 plus i/i6.... (RL69-7o, TG9i, PR2o6, 208, FIR354) (8) Concrete particular: A particular thing in its concrete particularity is more than any list of features on the basis of which we recognise it or identify it. (PAI78, I83, MELP6-7; cf. BPi98) All these kinds of 'more' will be discussed at various points in the essay. All are important, in different ways, for the overall picture. The central case of the 'more', however, is (i) (b). For Ramsey, the awareness of I is</page><page sequence="4">128 DONALD EVANS the key to all the other discernments of 'more'. He links it closely to the experience of freedom in human activity. Unfortunately, his account of freedom is rather crude and confused. For example, he equates actions which are impersonal or official with behaviour which is merely a reaction to stimuli (FI29, 33). And although he sometimes restricts freedom to cases of response to moral claim (FI30, 38), sometimes he does not; instead, he finds freedom wherever an action has the agent's 'personal backing' (FI2 I 24). But it is better to ignore such defects in his analysis, and to consider the main thrust of his argument, which is to focus our attention on cases of self-awareness which are paradigms, cases where the experience of I is most intense, powerful and indubitable. 'The paradigm for understanding all disclosures is the disclosure that each of us has of himself in decisive, free, moral action' (FIR355, cf. FIR35o-5I). In paradigm cases Ramsey holds that we can have no doubt about 'I' referring to something experienced, yet what the word refers to is something which transcends all descriptions in terms of behaviour. We should note that although the 'more' to which 'I' refers is best discerned in paradigm cases, these cases differ for Ramsey only in degree from others where the self-awareness is minimal. Indeed, Ramsey holds concerning class (i) (a) that I is presupposed in any experience, since-it has a subject-object structure, and in any conscious use of language, since any use implies a user; I is presupposed even though the subject of experience or the language-user is only minimally aware of L The examples under (i) (b), however, are needed to elucidate any minimal self-awareness in (i) (a). Concerning (i) (b), Ramsey's main points are these: (i) That to which 'I' refers transcends description. (ii) Nevertheless the word 'I' is presupposed by all discourse concerning me (though 'I exist' does not entail any statements in this discourse). 'I' thus can be said to 'preside' in a unifying way over the discourse. (iii) The word 'I' refers to a 'more' which is discernible, that is, in some way experienceable. (iv) This 'more' is a form of activity rather than a mere happening or movement. Ramsey links (i)(b) closely with the next three kinds of 'more': with personal encounter (PG63-4), moral claim (FI30, 38, RS42-3, MTi67), and aesthetic wonder (RL72-3). The paradigm cases of (i)(b) are all responses. Maximal self-awareness occurs in responses to another person, a moral claim, or an aesthetic wonder. From this two things follow. First, the paradigm discernments of I are correlated with discernments of some thing other than L. The other is something 'more' than observables, according to Ramsey. Self-awareness is correlated with awareness of an external other which, like the self, transcends observables. Second, the discernment of self</page><page sequence="5">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD 129 and other is associated with a response which is a self-involvement, a com mitment, rather than a flat, neutral, disinterested assent. I shall consider Ramsey on commitment more fully later on. I shall also return to examples in classes (5), (6), (7) and (8). The next step, however, is to outline Ramsey's position concerning the objectivity of the 'more'. He says that the 'more' is not an observable public object, but he insists that it is nevertheless 'objective'. In one sense of 'objective', all experience is 'objective' according to Ramsey. That is, it is an experience of something, of an object; it has a subject-object structure (RL24, 28, MMR268). In this sense, Ramsey claims objectivity for dream images (CD88) and for hallucinations of pink rats (ICBCIog). But when Ramsey speaks of the objectivity ofthe 'more',he is using the word 'objectivity' in a different sense, where he would contrast it with the subjectivity of dreams, hallucinations and phenomenal sense-experience generally. In this second sense, the 'more' is objective in that it is a reality which is an active originator of experience. (In this sense the real and active I is also 'objective'; but Ramsey sensibly restricts the term to the 'more' which is external, other than I.) Ramsey links this objectivity with the disclosure of the 'more', concerning which he says a great deal (MM58, CD88, PG66-87, TG7-8, PAi96, FI99). Any discernment of the 'more' is a disclosure of the 'more', A disclosure occurs when we are actively confronted by another agency or quasi-agency which declares or reveals the 'more' to us; we are aware of an initiative which is like our own but not our own; we are relatively passive in relation to the initiating activity of that to which we respond. (Ramsey on disclosure reminds me of both Berkeley and Buber.) The notion of disclosure is obviously most immediately applicable to situations of personal encounter (class (2)), when we respond to the self disclosure of another human being. But Ramsey also finds a quasi-personal disclosure when he discerns a moral claim (class (3)), where there is some thing 'which may be usefully compared with the claims another person makes on us in social behaviour' (MJGCI69; cf. MTI72). The experience of moral obligation or duty is an experience which is similar to being confronted, challenged, or commanded, even though no other human being need be confronting, challenging or commanding us. And when we respond to a work of art with aesthetic wonder (class (4)), Ramsey says that 'some thing is exhibited which is characteristically personal', namely, the genius or inspiration of the creative artist (RL72). Ramsey even claims that the notion of disclosure extends to any recog nition of concrete particulars (class (8)). Particular things disclose their reality to us (PAi83, I96). Here Ramsey seems to be similar to Martin Buber, who talked about an 'I-Thou' encounter with a tree.' Like Buber, Ramsey is not ascribing consciousness or a soul to a tree, but he is empha 'I and Thou. B</page><page sequence="6">I30 DONALD EVANS sising our sense of being confronted, of an initiative and reality which is not our own. Ramsey finds activity in the particular thing, something remotely analogous to human activity. Similarly in his account of scientific models and invariants (class (6)), which abstract from particulars, he also finds something remotely analogous to personal activity (RS72-4, 82, TG93, MMR266). One reason for this is that according to Ramsey many of the most general concepts which we apply to nature (energy, opposition, attraction) have primary application to our own activity as persons (CD84; cf. TG93). Another reason is that, according to Ramsey, reference to reality is assured to models and invariants, and even to fundamental conceptual schemes (AC69, 72) by virtue of the disclosure character of the insights from which they arise. A scientific model is authenticated because the universe discloses itself (MMI3, I9). What science is about is always 'dis closure given' (MMR268; cf. MM20-2 I). Ramsey seems to be stressing the element of passivity in our experience of discernment or insight, the sense of an initiative not our own which is at work, remotely resembling in its reality that of another human being who actively reveals himself to us. Thus he finds disclosures even in the mathe matical cases (class (7)) when we see that the infinite sum points to the number 2 (RL69-7o) and in the moment of Gestalt insight (class (5)), when we move from parts to whole (RL23-4). As he often says, 'The penny drops'; we do not make it drop. Since even the 'more' of mathematics or Gestalt is disclosed to us, all eight classes of 'more' are disclosures. And we see that for Ramsey the notions of 'more', 'objectivity' (i.e. reality), 'dis closure' and 'activity' are all closely inter-related, and are all extended in meaning from a paradigm application, namely the experience of freely responsive self-awareness (class (i) (b). Ramsey's first step is thus a challenge to any narrow form of empiricism which reduces reality to public observables. His second step is to relate the various kinds of 'more' to disclosures which are 'cosmic'. II. THE 'MORE' AND COSMIC DISCLOSURES The first clue concerning the relation between the 'more' and cosmic disclosures is to be found in what Ramsey says about self-involvement or commitment. We saw that in so far as any discernment of the 'more' includes a response to a disclosure it includes some personal commitment. Ramsey gives most emphasis to the commitment in our responses to moral claims, but he also points out our commitment of trust or loyalty to a friend in personal encounter. Indeed, Ramsey extends the notion of commitment or self-involvement so that it is included in the response to a concrete particular (PAi94), the acceptance of a scientific or common sense conceptual frame work (AC69-70, 72), and the acceptance of a set of geometrical axioms</page><page sequence="7">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD 131 (RL32-4). When Ramsey discusses religious commitment first in Religious Language, he says that it differs from non-religious commitment in a two fold way. It is a 'total commitment to the whole universe' (RL37). He notes that a commitment to some geometrical axioms has the whole universe as its scope (RL32-5); but the commitment is not itself religious, for it is not total, it does not involve the whole man. In contrast with this, a captain's commitment to his ship or a man's commitment to his beloved may be total; but, according to Ramsey in Religious Language, the scope of such commitments is far less than the whole universe and hence they are not in themselves religious. A religious commitment must be both all-inclusive in its scope or reference and total in its personal, existential involvement. It must be cosmic in range and it must subordinate all a man's other commit ments, concerns and inclinations to itself. The cosmic and existential elements come together for Ramsey in our commitment when we respond to an overriding, unconditional moral claim in a particular situation (RL3o-3i, FI40-42, MMR265). If I acknowledge that I ought, unconditionally, to do X in this particular situation, my commitment has a negative all-inclusiveness: whatever else may be the case in the whole universe, X is my Duty in this situation; I am refraining from responding to anything other than the particular, overriding moral claim. This negative all-inclusiveness is obviously different from the positive all inclusiveness of some commitments which we shall consider later, for example, 'I trust the universe'. Ramsey nevertheless holds that the negatively all-inclusive commitment to a Duty in a particular situation can be called 'cosmic' (PG69). Since the existential element is evident in the unconditional, total self-involvement of the response to Duty, the response is for Ramsey a religious commitment, fulfilling both the cosmic and the existential conditions for religion. Although for Ramsey an unconditional moral commitment is religious, and is a response to a cosmic disclosure, it is not by itself a response to God. Ramsey says that if the only cosmic disclosure were that of Duty or Absolute Value, there would be no need for the term 'God' (FI46-7; cf. MTI73). 'Duty' or 'Absolute Value' would suffice. The term 'God', for Ramsey, integrates a variety of cosmic disclosures, as we shall see. Here we should note a typical and crucial step which Ramsey has already taken in his argument: he has assumed that the 'more' in all cases of overriding moral claim is some one reality. We have already noted his basis for ascribing reality to each moral claim: we have a sense of being actively confronted by another. But here a further step is taken: one reality, which deserves a metaphysical label such as 'Duty' (or 'God') is confronting us in each and every instance. Commitments in response to overriding moral claims are not the only ones which are negatively all-inclusive. Although in Religious Language</page><page sequence="8">132 DDONALD EVANS Ramsey denies that the loyal devotion of captain or lover is cosmic in scope, in later writings he cites 'You are the whole world to me' alongside a statement concerning Duty, as an expression of cosmic commitment and disclosure (MMR265; cf. TG87, FI63). This later view is more consistent with his position concerning moral commitments, for the speaker is saying, in effect, 'Nothing else matters except my devotion to you' (cf. 'Nothing else matters except doing X, my duty in this situation'.) But probably Ramsey is ambivalent concerning how to classify a total personal commit ment which is focused on only a part of the universe. On the one hand the commitment, like a Tillichian ultimate concern focused on one's spouse or one's nation, is religious existentially. On the other hand, in spite of its negative all-inclusiveness, it is not positively cosmic; indeed it is idolatrous. Ramsey does not say much about idolatry (RB84-6, TL7-8), but his position seems to be similar to that of Tillich: a total commitment or ultimate concern should not be focussed on any finite observable, or even on the particular 'more' disclosed in a finite observable and considered by itself, but only on God. Concerning idolatry and Duty, Ramsey is not clear. On the one hand he does not seem to allow that an unconditional response to Duty could ever be idolatrous, even though Duty is only negatively all inclusive. But he does insist that although a particular disclosure of one's Duty in a particular situation may be certain, there should be an openness to new and different disclosures, and a flexibility in any formulation of moral policy (BSR36, 46-7). We have been considering the negative all-inclusiveness of duty or devotion. What would a disclosure-commitment with positive all-inclusive ness be? The best examples in Ramsey, I think, are those where a 'more' of the whole universe is disclosed in a context of personal encounter or of aesthetic wonder. Let us consider personal encounter (TG79-8I, PG63-5, RL26-7, MMi 6, 59). First, according to Ramsey, I have personal en counters with other human beings in which their trustworthiness and concern are disclosed and I respond with trust and gratitude, feeling secure and at home. Then there is a disclosure of a somewhat similar trust worthiness and concern in some aspect of nature. Ramsey points to the reliable regularity of the seasons, with their seed-time and harvest (TG8o). He also reminds us of particular occasions when a landscape 'comes alive'. Our surroundings feel familiar and 'this familiarity develops into a feeling of friendship which finally evokes a sense of cosmic kinship' (RL27). In one passage Ramsey waxes Wordsworthian: 'It may be that we are walking in remote, mountainous country, and as night comes on we are filled with all kinds of uncertainties and anxieties. But then we refresh ourselves at a mountain stream, look up to the stars as symbols of stability, and find our path illuminated by the moon. A sense of kinship with nature strikes us; the Universe is reliable after all.' (TG8o)</page><page sequence="9">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD I33 Note the move from a particular situation to the whole Universe. The situation is taken as representative of the whole (CD7). The quasi-personal 'more' to which Ramsey's traveller feels a kinship and to which he commits himself in trust is disclosed through the stream, the stars and the moon; but it is also related to everything that has brought them and him together in the particular situation. The disclosure is that the Universe is reliable. Peter Berger expresses a similar disclosure when he says, 'Everything is in order, everything is all right'.' This is not an empirical generalisation com parable to 'All swans are white'. Unless it is interpreted in the context of a disclosure experience, it is obviously false. The conviction of Ramsey's traveller that the Universe is reliable does not preclude his perishing under an avalanche a few minutes later. Yet Ramsey does claim a measure of rational support for the cosmic disclosure in the fact that many patterns in nature resemble the reliable regularity of a friend (TG8o; cf. MMi6, PG65). This rational support from patterns in nature Ramsey calls 'empirical fit' (MMI 7, 2I, 58-9). (An aside: It seems to me that the disclosure is even more closely linked with the patterns in the psyche of the viewer. Patterns in nature are relevant, indeed necessary, but whether or not the universe seems friendly rather than hostile or neutral or conflictual depends a great deal on the individual's conscious and unconscious view of himself and of other human beings. Indeed, whether or not he sees a universe at all-as Ramsey does-rather than an unintegrated multiverse or even a chaos, depends a great deal on the extent to which his own personality is well integrated. World-views and depth psychology are intimately related.) Let us continue Ramsey's account of cosmic disclosures, shifting from personal encounters to responses of aesthetic wonder (RL72-3). When we are impressed by a work of art, our response of wonder and awe is a response to the creative 'more' in a particular, finite observable. Ramsey claims that we can move from this to a response of wonder which 'has the whole universe as its focus' (RL73). How? If Ramsey treated this case in a way similar to his treatment of personal encounters, the next step after viewing a work of art would be to respond with wonder to something in nature which is similar to a work of art. Then we would take the particular wonder in nature as representative of the whole, a disclosure of the 'more' of the universe. Ramsey's actual treatment of this case, however, is different, though such a route to a cosmic disclosure would be quite compatible with his philosophy. Ramsey does arrive at a cosmic, all-inclusive disclosure, but by a different route. Using a 'qualified-model' approach (which we will examine later) he applies the formula 'creator ex nihilo'. For Ramsey, 'creator' is the descriptive term, the model, and 'ex nihilo' is the prescriptive qualifier, the directive concerning what to do with the model. We are to construct a series of real or imagined works of art (creations) in each of 1 A Rumour of Angels (New York: Doubleday, I969), p. 69.</page><page sequence="10">I34 DONALD EVANS which there is less and less dependence on pre-existing material and more and more dependence on the creativity of the artist. Since eventually in the series there is no pre-existing material, the creation then includes everything. Hence the disclosure which occurs is cosmic, all-inclusive. Ramsey maintains that we are responding to the same 'more', namely God, when we respond to an unconditional moral claim, to a trustworthy cosmic providence or to a wondrous cosmic creativity. To apply the term 'God' to a cosmic disclosure is to consider it in relation to other cosmic disclosures, claiming that the same single reality is revealed in all of them. Thus when Ramsey considers 'God' and unconditional moral claims, he says that to move from 'Doing X is my Duty' to 'Doing X is God's will' is to provide an alternative account of the same disclosure, but in a more comprehensive context, one which includes non-moral cosmic disclosures (FI46-55; cf. MJGCi67-8, FIR354-5). The expressions 'God' and 'God's will' include not only the 'Duty' disclosed in situations of moral claim but also the reassuring cosmic trustworthiness disclosed in seed-time and harvest, and the wondrous cosmic activity disclosed in the sheer existence of created beings. Though Ramsey does not give the latter disclosures labels, let us do so: 'Providence' and 'Creativity'. Ramsey is then saying that to move from talk about 'Duty' to talk about God is to talk about the disclosure of Duty in a more comprehensive context, which includes disclosures of Providence and Creativity. Similarly 'Providence' would be replaceable by 'God' when related to Duty and Creativity; and 'Creativity' would be replaceable by 'God' when related to Duty and Providence. God is the one 'more' in all three kinds of disclosure. Why so? Why not three 'mores'? One reason is that for Ramsey all three disclosures (including Duty, which seems to me to be merely negatively all-inclusive) have to do with the same range of observables, namely, the whole universe. And if we ask 'Why might not the whole universe have several different "mores" ?', Ramsey has a number of replies, but all are related to his main assumption: There is only one 'more', one I for all my varied behaviour, and the relation between God and the universe is analogous to the relation between I and my behaviour. 'God is other than the Universe . . . as he who discloses himself in and through it, something like, though not exactly like, the way we disclose ourselves through our bodily behaviour'. (MMR269). This analogy between God as the 'more' of the universe and I as the 'more' of my behaviour is a central pivot in Ramsey's philosophy. Before we explore it more fully, we should notice one possible source of confusion concerning it. Ramsey sometimes uses 'I' to refer, not only to the 'more' of my behaviour, but to all my behaviour and its 'more'. The word 'I' does not refer to an entity which is separable logically, epistemologically or ontologically from some expressions in bodily behaviour. The word 'God', in so far as it resembles 'I', is similarly linked to the universe. So Ramsey</page><page sequence="11">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD I35 sometimes uses 'God' to refer, not only to the 'more' of the universe, but to the whole universe and its 'more'. The word 'God', like 'I', may refer to observables and 'more' (RL38, TLi I). Each word may refer to a whole (CE4i) which includes both an aggregate of observables and the 'more' which unifies them. Usually, however, it is most appropriate to interpret Ramsey as using 'I' and 'God' to refer to the 'more', considered as distinct from observables. Thus God is the 'more' of the universe. In some passages Ramsey is apt to mislead readers because he equates 'God' and 'universe' or 'whole universe'. He says that the word 'God' refers to the whole universe (CD82) and he uses 'the universe' where one would expect him to use 'God': the universe 'declares itself' (PG66, MM58), 'discloses itself' (MMi 3, I9) or 'confronts us' (TG87). Ramsey's language here is puzzling, but it can be interpreted so as to cohere with his main ideas. In these passages he is using 'universe' and 'whole universe' to mean 'all the observables and their "more" ' (one of the meanings for 'God'), whereas usually 'universe' means 'all the observables' (or 'cosmos' or 'world'). In these passages the universe is viewed as a whole which includes not only all observables but also the 'more' which unites them all together. In my exposition of Ramsey I have been using 'universe' as a synonym for 'world' or 'cosmos', and I shall continue to do so. Thus 'God' refers either to the universe and its 'more' or to the 'more' of the universe. The latter is usually the most appropriate version: God is the 'more' of the universe, its 'single individuation' (TG87) whose relation to the universe is analogous to the relation between 'I' and my behaviour. This analogy is so central in Ramsey's philosophy that it deserves special consideration. Why does it seem to him to be so apt and so illuminating? III. 'GOD' AND 'I' One reason is that, as we have seen, he thinks the scope of observables for all cosmic disclosures is the same, namely, the universe. Similarly the scope of observables for disclosure of I is the same, namely my bodily behaviour. And as my body is that by means of which men refer to me, the observable basis for identifying me as a distinct individual, so the universe is that by means of which men refer to God, the observable basis for identifying Him as a 'single individuation'. Since the universe is spatially all-inclusive, references to God have two peculiarities. First, it makes no sense to talk about trying to 'locate' God, as one might locate a man, for God is the 'more' of the universe, and it makes no sense to talk about locating the universe (PG68; cf. CD74-5). Second, there is no possibility that the word 'God' might have no reference, as the expression 'planet of the Evening Star' may have no reference, or as the expression 'son of Pierre Trudeau' has no reference. The reference is for Ramsey 'inalienable' (CD89; cf.</page><page sequence="12">I36 DONALD EVANS CD82), since there can be no problem in referring to the universe, and since 'God' refers to the 'more' of the universe-whatever that more may turn out to be. We have been thinking of the identification, location and reference for I and God in spatial terms. A second reason why the analogy between 'I' and 'God' seems apt and important to Ramsey has to do with time. According to Ramsey both 'I' and 'God' include that which is in temporal succession while also transcending it. The transcendence of time by I is for Ramsey closely linked with the free activity of I, especially in response to Duty (FI66, 73; cf. F123). His argument is that what I responds to is spatio temporal and 'more' and that there is an awareness of I as being similarly transcendent. Personal activity takes place in a particular place at a parti cular time, but it does not consist solely of that which can be described in spatial and temporal terms. I transcends the finite sequence of observable behaviour, not only in a particular action, but over a whole life-time, unifying it into a whole. God similarly transcends a sequence of observables in which He is active, unifying it into a whole (CE4i), but the sequence is a doubly infinite temporal series, infinite both retrospectively and pros pectively. This all-inclusive temporal series, called 'sempiternity', may be the context or setting for a cosmic disclosure to men, a disclosure of God as eternal (CE48; cf. CE44, 47, F176, 79). If we start in a particular situation with a disclosure of love or vitality and consider it in the setting of sem piternity, the cosmic disclosure is of God as eternal love or eternal life. A third reason why Ramsey's analogy between 'God' and 'I' seems illuminating to him has to do with activity. All cosmic disclosures are of a 'more' which is a confronting activity that is somewhat like, though not exactly like, the confronting activity of another human being. The cosmic disclosures all have an objectivity, a reality, which is somewhat like that of another I (PG68). Indeed Ramsey criticises some theologians in so far as their accounts lack a sense of the objective activity and otherness of God (CD59, 76). We should note that for Ramsey even Duty is to some extent like L He does speak of Duty as 'non-personal' or 'impersonal' (PG69; cf. CD83), but he also says (in the same place) that in a disclosure of categorical obligation 'we are aware of an activity confronting, engaging our own'. He warns us that we cannot safely talk about Duty as God's 'command' or 'will' unless we realise how vastly different this talk is from talk about a man's 'command' or 'will' (MJGCI69-70; cf. F51I). But he also notes that we experience Duty as a claim which is comparable to the claim of another human being to whom we respond in social behaviour (MJGC I 68-9). A fourth reason for Ramsey to stress his analogy between 'God' and 'I' has to do with a contrast which he applies to both, a contrast between certain, incorrigible awareness and uncertain, corrigible description (MTI 76,</page><page sequence="13">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD I37 AC74; cf. FIR355, PR2I2, BSRi, 23, CD25, TL5-6, BPi83-4, I87). 'We are as certain of God as we are of ourselves ... But no description is guaran teed' (MTI 76). Ramsey considers the statement 'I have a headache' (MTI 76) and analyses it into two parts: 'I exist (incorrigible) . . . with a headache (corrigible)'. Similarly any statements concerning God involve for Ramsey an incorrigible element ('God exists') and a corrigible, descriptive element. 'God exists' is incorrigible both because one cannot fail to refer to God (qua the 'more', whatever it is, of the universe), and because one cannot doubt that one is being actively confronted by a real, objective other (PG68). Whenever my I is disclosed to me, I am incorrigibly certain con cerning my own existence, but any statement in which I express what is disclosed is corrigible. Similarly when God is disclosed to me I am certain concerning His existence, but any statement in which I express what is disclosed is corrigible. Both I and God transcend description. Both, however, are disclosed in and through describable observables, and what is disclosed is related to these observables (BPi 83-4, I87). Both 'I' and 'God' are 'united with verifiably descriptive words, without themselves being verifiably descriptive' (PR209; cf. PR2 Is). Fifth, we should notice one way in which Ramsey manages to maintain his key analogy when it is threatened by the possibility of a plurality of cosmic 'mores' or of a self-contradictory cosmic 'more'. The threat comes from traditional religious statements which seem to be grounded in cosmic disclosures that conflict. Ramsey meets the threat by interpreting the statements so that they are all grounded in qualitatively similar situations. For example (PR2o8), he claims to reconcile talk about God as 'infinitely loving' and 'impassible' by relating both expressions to the 'same kind of situation'-presumably one which has to do with an unchanging stability or reliability, a providential concern for man. He also brings together God as 'Duty' and as 'all-powerful' by interpreting the latter in terms of the power of a never-failing love, which has a moral claim upon us (FI56-9). He interprets 'eternal punishment' (BSRI8-Ig) in relation to a disclosure of a reconciling love which overcomes separation, and 'eternal death' (BSR2o) in relation to a disclosure of 'infinite love' to men who feel 'utterly isolated, forsaken, alone'. Yet 'impassibility', 'omnipotence', 'eternal punishment' and 'eternal death' can be linked, respectively, with disclosures of cosmic aloofness, ruthlessness, vindictiveness and emptiness. Ramsey can plausibly and coherently relate all cosmic disclosures to one divine 'more', but this is because he selects his disclosures and interprets them on an already assumed basis which provides criteria of selection and principles of inter pretation. Some of this basis is provided by his conviction that a cosmic disclosure occurs when we respond to the 'more' disclosed in the life, death and resurrection ofJesus Christ, which is a 'more' of loving personal activity (CD25, 59, RB87, TL39, RL66, I73). For Ramsey the love disclosed in</page><page sequence="14">138 DONALD EVANS Jesus Christ is at work everywhere-in the midst of human suffering, moral inadequacy and death, and even within the pain and travail of nature. It is true that Ramsey associates talk about God as 'Father' and as 'Holy Spirit' with cosmic disclosures which are somewhat different from those associated with talk about God as 'Son', disclosed in Jesus Christ (TL39). But the christological disclosures seem to be the most important. They provide an implicit criterion of selection, for in practice Ramsey does not allow anything contrary to them to count as a cosmic disclosure. And Ramsey tends to interpret all traditional religious statements in relation to dis closures of loving personal activity. Thus Ramsey's analogy between 'God' and 'I' is supported by his stress on the self-disclosure of God in loving personal activity, especially that ofJesus Christ. A sixth support for the analogy is closely related to this. For Ramsey, the human behaviour which can be an occasion for cosmic disclosure of divine love is not restricted to that of Jesus Christ. The behaviour of Christians-individually and as a Church-should also provide such an occasion for cosmic disclosure. That is, the appropriate response to a cosmic disclosure of divine love is not only a response of worship towards God (RL89, i85, TL39, F158), a worship which is a loving, total commitment (RL46); it is also a response of witness (TL39, AC7I-80, CD24-5, 59-60). Witness is behaviour which so expresses love towards other men that it can be for other men an occasion for cosmic disclosure. If Ramsey mentioned only worship, he would be saying that the response of men to God is some what like the response of men to another I who actively confronts them. But in his talk about witness he is also saying that God actively discloses Himself through some of the activity of men; so for this additional reason God is like the I of men. The bodily behaviour of Jesus, and sometimes that of Christians, discloses not only the activity of men but also (or therein) the activity of God. (How the divine and human activities are related is not adequately clarified by Ramsey, as we shall see.) The seventh support for Ramsey's analogy between 'God' and 'I' is not theological, but metaphysical (MTI 73-4, RS73-4, 79, F148, RL59-6o, MELPpassim). As a metaphysician Ramsey looks for one ultimate concept by which to find unity in the universe. A metaphysical key-word must, he thinks, be able to unify diverse kinds of language while not being restricted to any one of them. If it belongs only to one, there will be category mix-ups when it is applied in another. Ramsey finds that the word 'I' unifies the diverse kinds of language (gross-behavioural, physiological, chemical, physical, etc.) which are used to describe me, while not belonging exclusively to any one of these. All particular descriptions of me presuppose 'I' or 'I exist' or 'I am active', though 'I exist' or 'I am active' entail no particular descriptions of me. Ramsey finds that the word 'God' works in a similar way. It can integrate the vast variety of kinds of language which are used</page><page sequence="15">IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD I39 to describe part or all of the universe. Each and every descriptive assertion presupposes 'God exists' or 'God is active', but these entail no descriptive assertions. A metaphysical key-word must fulfil a second requirement for Ramsey. It must unify, not by being more abstract than all other terms, more remote from the reality of concrete particulars, but by referring to this reality (MELP7). Within Ramsey's philosophy we can see how 'I' does this for language concerning me. But how can 'God' do this for all of language? Ramsey holds that any word, suitably qualified, can lead to the characteristic ally religious situation of disclosure (RL8o) and that there is no situation which cannot in principle give rise to a cosmic disclosure (TG87). This is because for Ramsey every disclosure whatsoever, if understood in a wide enough context, can eventually bear the name 'God' (FIR354-5; cf. MTI72, n.2). This is true of a disclosure of the 'more' of a concrete particular. It is also true of the disclosure of the 'more' of a gestalt, a scientific model or a mathematical series. In each case the 'more' is an active reality which does the disclosing. For Ramsey, assuming his analogy between 'I' and 'God', the reality in each case is God. Let us consider the analogy again. Suppose that I see Jones moving his little finger. I see the finger moving and 'more'-the 'more' being the I of Jones. The same I is also sometimes disclosed in a movement of arms or legs. The same I is also disclosed some times when Jones acts in an intensely personal way; but in such cases the disclosure of I is much more profound. Similarly, for Ramsey, any dis closure of 'more', if set in the comprehensive context of other disclosures of 'more' in the universe, is a disclosure of God. Indeed, the analogy has still further implications. Disclosures of the I of Jones vary in the extent to which the reality of I is revealed, but all are disclosures of I. Similarly all disclosures of reality vary in the extent to which the reality of God is therein revealed, but all are disclosures of God. Here Ramsey closely resembles William Temple,' for whom all events are revelations of God, though not equally revelatory, and for whom the transcendence of God in relation to the world is like the transcendence of I in relation to my bodily behaviour. Like Temple, Ramsey is open to two critical questions: First, what is the relation between the activity, reality or 'more' of God and that of the particular person, situation or thing through which God discloses Himself? If the relation between God and observables in the universe is like that between I and observable bodily behaviour, what then is the relation between God and non-observables such as the 'more' of a man or of a tree? What is the relation between God and I, between God's activity and mine? 1 Nature, Man and God (London: Macmillan, 1934), Lect. XI.</page><page sequence="16">140 IAN RAMSEY ON TALK ABOUT GOD Second, how does God transcend not only the world, but I? How does the transcendence of God transcend the transcendence of I?
