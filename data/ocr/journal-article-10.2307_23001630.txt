<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Tribals of Bihar P C Roy Chaudhury ' I ^he tribals of Bihar form about 15 per cent of its population—the -*■ third largest tribal population in any Indian State. Among the main tribes are the Santals, Mundas, Oraons, Hos and Kharias con centrated in and around the Chotanagpur area. Some tribes like the Santals, Mundas and Oraons are large, numbering several thousands. Others like the Birhors and the Paharias number a hundred or two, and are fast dying out. The Paharias, for instance, live only on hill tops avoiding all human habitation if they possibly can. The Birhors live along the fringe of Bihar's forests, moving away from their habitation when the fauna and flora of the area have been exhausted. Their diet includes rats, squirrels and even snakes. The Birhors live in leaf-made huts with a small entrance of between two and three square feet. All attempts to settle them in villages have so far not been very successful. As can be expected, the tribals of Bihar are at different and varied stages of civilization. The Birhors, for instance, do not know about ploughing. They continue to follow the practice of jhumming—burning down forests and weeds and sowing directly into the ashes without the aid of a plough. On the other hand, some members of the Santal, Munda and Oraon tribes have travelled far afield; away from their traditional practices. Some have become successful parliamentarians. Some have been to the United States or have studied at Oxford and Cambridge where they have distinguished themselves both academically and at sport. The Kharias and Hos are catching up fast. There is more literacy, more sporting activity, more liveliness in their areas than in the neighbouring non-tribal areas. As a rule, the houses of the Santals, Mundas and Oraons are cleaner, and have more basic amenities than those of other tribes. Cultu rally too they are both different and distinctive. The women enjoy greater freedom and have a more pragmatic approach to life than more advanced, literate Hindu women. They have had a traditional right to property long before their Hindu counterparts were given the same right. Rules for divorce or separation are also more liberal. Christian missionaries have been largely responsible for spreading literacy, education and sanitation among the tribes. They were not, as is often assumed, only keen evangelists. These missionaries penetrated the most inaccessible parts of the Santal Parganas or of the Palmau 33</page><page sequence="2">34 P C Roy Chaudhury districts where, in spite of starvation, insanitation and even epidemics, they opened schools, built roads and distributed medicines. They also introduced a written script—the Roman script. Until then, the folk literature and songs of the Adivasis or tribals were handed down from generation to generation by the oral tradition. The tribal earns his living by the sweat of his brow, but the drud gery of his economic life is relieved by a regular cycle of festivals. Each important festival has certain essential and common features. All homes are repaired, cleaned and painted for the occasion; offerings are made in the sacred grove; considerable quantities of rice beer are consumed and there is, of course, communal dancing. The main festival is the Maghe-parab, which takes place in January February, after the harvest. In each village the festival continues for seven days and revelry reaches its peak on the fourth day, the day of Marang-Maghe. During this festival a great deal of sexual feedom is permitted and the amorous exploits of the young are not restricted either by parents or guardians. It is traditional for foul words to be uttered, in chorus and in the presence of elders and women, which are suggestive of the sexual act. Next in importance is the festival of flowers—Ba parab —which takes place when the sal tree blooms. Sal flowers are gathered for offerings to be made to the tutelary deities of the village at the sacred grove along with rice beer and fowl's meat. The puja is followed by com munal dancing which, compared with the more riotous dances of the Maghe-parab festival, are more sedate. Group dancing is undoubtedly the favourite amusement of the tribals and each village has its own dancing ground or Susun akra. Unfortunately, over the years, modem forms of amusement have become popular and communal or group dancing is becoming limited, more and more, to specific occasions such as festivals and marriages. For each of these occasions, the dance has its own typical rhythm and movement. In the Maghe or marriage dance, boys and girls dance together. They form a circle, alternating boy and girl, and dance repeatedly in a clockwise and then an anti-clockwise direction. In the centre of the circle of dancers stand young men with drums, violins (banam) and flutes (ratu). Sometimes the dances are accompanied by songs but more often the dance only takes its lead from a song. The Maghe dance has particularly fast and amorous movements. In the Ba dance, however, only the women form the circle of dancers while the men participate as musicians. There is no special form of dress for dancing. Another popular pastime is cock-fighting. At every weekly market or hat, a number of tribals collect in a corner of the market place to indulge in this sport which frequently permits betting. Hunting, which was probably, in the past, a regular means of livelihood, is today another favourite pastime at least in those areas where patches of jungle still survive near tribal settlements. The grand season for hunting is between the months of January and June.</page><page sequence="3">The Tribals of Bihar 35 In their social organization the tribes have units like the family, the tonda or settlement, and the clan, which play important roles. The family unit is a simple one with the father as its head. The tonda or settlement has a headman or naya, who is also the priest of the different units. He is assisted by a kotwar or diguar. Members of the tonda hunt together and the most important form of communal hunting is the monkey hunt (geri sendra). The tribe is often divided into a number of exogamous patrilineal clans called gotras, named after an animal, plant, fruit, flower or some material object. Clan names like andi (wild cat), bonga sauri (a kind of wild grass), geroa (a small gidhi or vulture) and hembrom (betal palm) are not uncommon, and distinctive totemic taboos are associated with these clan names. For instance, a Birhor must abstain from destroying, maiming, hunting, eating or using anything made out of or obtained from that animal, plant or object that forms his clan totem. Men of the Muru clan customarily cover their eyes when they happen to come across a muru stag. Though the bonds of kinship are basic to their social organization, the tribal community also has a strongly developed social consciousness centred upon a tribal village. The village or hatu has its own sacred grove, tutelary deities, headman or munda, as well as its own priest or deuri. The village also has its council or panchayat and all major festivals are organized communlly. Furthermore the inhabitants of a village are often genealogically related. Taken together these factors make the village inhabitants strongly conscious of their village affilia tions. However, the Adivasis are very conscious of the rights of the individual and of the family with regard to ownership of property. By and large, common ownership by a group larger than the family is not known, except for village public places like the sacred grove, the dancing area and so on. Yet there is considerable co-operation, and a manifesta tion of the collective spirit in economic matters. Exchange of agricultu ral labour for instance is very common, as is communal hunting and fishing with equitable distribution of the spoils. When a new house has to be thatched, it is customary for all adult males of the hamlet or tola to co-operate in return for a sumptuous helping of rice beer. Of the agricultural operations, transplanting and weeding are done principally by the women, whereas ploughing and sowing are done by the men. Harvesting and threshing, however, are done by both men and women. Boiled rice is decidedly the staple food of the Adivasis. Even the wild Kharias and other such nomadic tribes who do not cultivate the land depend on rice which they procure in exchange for jungle produce collected by them or, for artifacts, made by them. Other forms of rice preparation are also popular, such as chapped rice (chira) made by the Bagtis or the Bhuiyas, puffed rice (muri) and rice flour cakes (lahu). The next important item of the Adivasi's diet is home brewed rice beer, known generally as handia, illi or diang. Rice beer is considered</page><page sequence="4">36 P C Roy Chaudhury to be a much cherished life giving fluid. The mahua tree (Bassia latifolia) also provides the tribals with a variety of essentials: its blossoms are distilled to make liquor, its fruit ground to make cakes and its seeds pressed for oil. Since progressive deforestation has led to the gradual extinction of wild fauna, meat no longer forms a regular part of the tribal's diet. Birds and domestic animals are reared but these are used either for sacrificial offerings in times of crisis, or, are sold for cash. To some extent fish has replaced meat in the tribal's diet. Low agricultural lands that hold water during the rains are the main fishing grounds. Moreover, most homes have an attached kitchen garden where common vegetables like spinach, pumpkin, gourd, brinjal and cucumber are grown. More recently, vegetables like cauliflower, cabbage and tomatoes have also been introduced. In addition, the forests are still a rich source of edible roots and fruit. Pulses, such as rahar and khesari, grown on higher ground, aie part of the regular diet. Oil is used sparingly and food spiced simply with turmeric and chilli. The Manki-Munda or upper class section of the tribal population have adopted, to a very large extent, the dietary habits of their more affluent Hindu neighbours. Tribal dress has changed considerably over the past 50 years. Traditionally, the men wore a single piece of cloth (4J'xlO') known as botoi. The women wore a skirt (lahanga) which covered their bodies from the waist down to the knee; the rest of the body was kept bare. Today, except among the so-called wild Kharias of Dhalbhum and the Birhors, men have taken to wearing dhotis (which cover the lower half of the body) and a loose shirt. Even among factory labourers the wearing of shirts is fairly common. For women, the wearing of a garment to cover the upper half of the body is now considered essential, particularly in the presence of dikkus or foreigners. The traditional handloom lahanga or ski i t is now seldom worn—mill-made saris having become more popular. The sari is worn in much the same way as most Indian women wear it with the difference that among tribal women one end of the sari is used to cover the top half of the body. Flowers are used to adorn the hair and ornaments such as bead necklaces or silver trinkets are very popular. Marriage is considered indispensable for every tribal; adult marri age is the general rule. Among tribals like the Santals and the Birhors there are ten different forms of marriage all of which are valid. These are: Nam-napam Bapala (love marriage), Udra Udri Bapala (elopement marriage), Balo Bapala (intrusion marriage), Sipundur Bapala (forcible annointment of the bride's forehead with sindur at a public place), Singha Bapala (widow re-marriage), Hirum Bapala (married man marrying for the second time while his first wife is still alive), Kiring Jawae Bapala (bought son-in-law marriage), Golhat Bapala (marriage by exchange of partners between two families), Bing Kaihi Bapala (a marriage without payment of bride-price) and Sadar Bapala (a regular marriage by negotia tion between the guardians of the two groups).</page><page sequence="5">The Tribals of Bihar 37 Socially, pre-marital chastity is not a condition for marriage though, on the whole, post-marital chastity is strictly demanded. Divorce is easily obtained in cases of impotence, incompatibility or for other serious causes of domestic unhappiness. An offence against a woman is consi dered an offence against the community and the aggrieved party may even kill the offender. The Santals practice a particularly harsh form of punishment called Bitlaha. The offender's homestead land, crops and home are desecrated or destroyed, and the offender himself, maimed. The Bitlaha is carried out only after notifying the offender and after making public announcements in different market places over a period of weeks. It is not unusual for an offender faced with this threat to run away leaving his home and village for good. If the woman is not a willing party to the offence, she is taken back into the village community without any hesitation. Idolatry has no place in traditional tribal religion. There is evidence, however, of anthropomorphism in their concept of deities. On the whole, tribal religion tends to be entirely practical, concerning itself mainly with happiness in this world. A tribal's whole life—economic, domestic, social and political—is pervaded by a belief in the supernatural which is divorced from any ethical content. His personal magico-religious beliefs and practices are almost identical with those of his tribe. Typical Mundari deities like Sing bonga (Sun God or Supreme Being), Haprom (ancestral spirits), Buru bonga (ancestral family spirits), rank highest in tribal religion. Contact with their Hindu neighbours has made little impact on the essential structure of tribal belief in the supernatural, although some Hindu deities like Devimai, Kalimai and Mahadev have, over the years, been adopted and brought into the tribal pantheon. Witch-craft is widely practised among the Adivasis and has naturally affected the various castes that live in a tribal village. Non Adivasis have also adopted the custom of consulting the sokhas or witch doctor in the event of illness or misfortune. It is perhaps because of the discipline imposed by their social organization and religious beliefs that the tribals have a reputation for being both law abiding and honest. The tribals of Bihar have always been a politically sensitive group, and during the last century there were a number of tribal uprisings. Today they are even more politically conscious and aware of the raw deal they have been given in the past. The Jharkhand movement, led by Jaipal Singh, a Christian Munda who was also a Cambridge Hockey Blue and a seasoned parliamentarian, demanded the creation of a single state for all the Adivasis, from Asansol in Bengal to Bhilai in Madhya Pradesh. This territory is the richest in India for both mineral and forest resources. The movement which had lost much of its force during the later years of Jaipal Singh's life is once again being revived. However, a fresh discordant note has been introduced into tribal politics. The non Christian tribals no longer see eye to eye with their Christian brothers</page><page sequence="6">38 P C Roy Chaudhury who, they think, got the best of both worlds in the past. Nevertheless the Adivasis of Bihar share their political aspirations with the Adivasis of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra. As such they form a strong front and will need careful handling. □</page></plain_text>
