<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS CUEVA LA CONGA: FIRST KARST CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY IN NICARAGUA Suzanne M. Baker and Ruth Ann Armitage Cueva la Conga, recorded in June 2006, is the first limestone cave in Nicaragua reported to contain prehistoric rock paint ings, culturally modified natural formations called speleothems, and artifacts. Located in northcentral Nicaragua in the Department of Jinotega, Cueva la Conga is the farthest south on the Mesoamerican periphery that a cave of this type has been reported, and it extends our knowledge of ritual cave use, including cave painting and speleothem modification, to include Nicaragua. Radiocarbon analysis of charcoal in five samples of the paint, the first such dating ofNicaraguan rock art, yielded calibrated dates from cal A.D. 680-905 to cal A.D. 1403-1640. The baseline data provided by Cueva la Conga are of great importance for regional rock art analysis and for our growing understanding of regional and Nicaraguan pre history. More archaeological survey and excavations in the area will be key in establishing a firm cultural context for the rock art and ritual cave use found at Cueva la Conga. Cueva La Conga, registrada en junio de 2006, es la primera cueva de piedra caliza encontrada en Nicaragua con pintura rupestre de tiempos prehistóricos, formaciones naturales culturalmente modificadas, llamadas espeleotemas, y artefactos. La Conga, ubicada en el departamento de Jinotega, en la parte centro-norte de Nicaragua, es la cueva de este tipo que se ha encontrado más al sur, ya en la periferia mesoamericana, y el sitio amplía nuestros conocimientos sobre una tradición de ri tuales en cuevas al incorporar Nicaragua, incluyendo las pinturas rupestres y espeoletemas. El análisis de radiocarbono en el carbón hallado en cinco muestras de la pintura, la primera dotación de arte rupestre en Nicaragua realizada con este método, arrojó feehas que abarcan desde 680- 905 cal d.C. hasta 1403-1640 cal d.C. Los datos de línea base obtenidos de la cueva La Conga son de mucha importancia para el análisis del arte rupestre y para nuestra creciente comprensión de la pre historia en la región y en Nicaragua. Es fundamental que continúen las investigaciones y excavaciones arqueológicas en el área de La Conga para establecer un sólido contexto cultural del arte rupestre y el uso ritual de cuevas.

Previous studies have shown that the ABA standard pretreatment can leave small amounts of carbonate in charcoal samples from rock paintings (Armitage 1998); this may explain the significantly older date for the AB A/combusted portion of Sample 3. Conversely, this sample was extremely contaminated with the earthy-smelling contaminant. Even after 10 washes with the phosphate buffer, the sample had an easily detected odor, suggesting that the anomalously much younger age of this sample may be due to residual contamination. The NaOH-washed portion yielded a date between the two extremes and should be considered the best estimate of the radiocarbon age of Sample 3. Further dis cussion of sample pretreatment is found in Li et al. (2012:80-81, 86-87).

They have been defined as "any secondary mineral deposit formed by water" (Gary et al. 1972:679). 2. Much of the significant previous archaeological work conducted in Nicaragua has focused on Pacific Nicaragua, especially the Rivas peninsula, a part of the Greater Nicoya Archaeological Subarea (Healy 1980; Lange et al. 1992; McCafferty 2011; Steinbrenner 2010). Because of this and because there were relatively late-arrived, Mesoamerican derived populations inhabiting that area at the time of Spanish conquest, the question of Mesoamericanization and Mesoamerican influence has been an important focus of study (Lange 1984; McCafferty 2011; Steinbrenner 2010). Although parts of precolombian Nicaragua appear to have absorbed influences from both south and north, archaeologi cal evidence also indicates that there have been highly varied local cultural developments (Lange 1984; 1986). Recent research is also calling into question assumptions about the intensity and impact of Mesoamericanization and revealing considerable cultural continuity from earlier periods (McCafferty 2011; Steinbrenner 2010).
