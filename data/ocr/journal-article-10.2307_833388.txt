KILLAM BACKGROUND FOR PAPER AT THE CLOSE OF THE 1991 SESSION of the Society for Music Theory's Committee on the Status of Women, John Rahn asked if I would be interested in submitting a feminist analytical paper to Perspectives of New Music, with the understanding that no assurance of publication accompa- nied the inquiry. I replied that I had nothing ready, but had in 1989 heard a haunting set of songs by Libby Larsen. Diane Fukunaga, who has analyzed a wide range of Larsen's choral compositions (Fukunaga 1991), contacted her and arranged that I receive the score to Larsen's Songs from Letters (Larsen 1989). Before undertaking an analysis, I obtained Lars- en's consent, an element I consider central to a feminist analysis of works of living composers. This statement can be better understood through</page><page sequence="2">Women Working my definition of feminist analysis, which constitutes the next section of this article. A DEFINITION OF FEMINIST ANALYSIS I do not propose a single definition for feminist analyses. Feminist schol- arship supports the concept of a multiplicity of feminisms, such as the 1987 description by Doane and Hodges: because there are many feminisms, the movement does not depend on the fortunes of a single leader or group. We are accustomed to think in terms of the powers associated with accumulation and iden- tity rather than the powers associated with dispersion and rupture precisely because the conventions of discourse, based on binary oppositions that preserve identity, insist that we do. (Doane and Hodges 1987, 140-41) A centrality to feminist analyses is the concept of change, both for indi- viduals and for groups. Most feminists agree with current research which posits no previous "golden age" when women were not oppressed. Research to date reveals only times of relatively less oppression (see Rosaldo and Lamphere 1974, 17-23, and French 1985, 65-77). Most feminist theory proceeds on the optimistic hope that we may be able to change to less repressive personal and cultural relationships. My minimal definition of a feminist analytical approach includes three elements. I do not consider analyses which do not contain these elements to be wrong; I do consider such analyses to be incomplete. For the scope of this article, the three concepts central to my definition of feminist analysis are: 1. Analysis should relate to such context as can be determined from current research, and should include women's experiences. The effects of women's (and men's) experiences on analytical styles and stances should be acknowledged. 2. Analysis should be reflected in praxis; therefore an analyst who prof- fers a feminist analytical approach (and feminist analysts logically include both women and men) but who participates in the continu- ance of an oppressive environment, should be subjected to close scrutiny. Thus my analysis of Larsen's composition was not under- taken until I had contacted her, explained my analytical intent, and had received her permission. Appendix A contains copies of some of our correspondence. 231</page><page sequence="3">Perspectives of New Music 3. My analytical approach acknowledges my personal, perceived experi- ence; those whose analytical approaches negate such experience will be subject to my close scrutiny. In support of the three previous points, I have segmented my analysis into the following topics: 1. context for the analysis, with special attention to Eric Gans's con- cepts; 2. my analytical context for Larsen's song; 3. an alternative to Gans's originary scene for linguistic development; 4. concluding summary. CONTEXT FOR THE ANALYSIS By my definitions, the context of any analytical approach is important. To establish the most immediate context for analysis of Larsen's work, I turned first to the most recent issue of Perspectives of New Music available at that time. The lead article in Perspectives of New Music 29, no. 2 (1991) is by Eric Gans, entitled "The Beginning and End of Esthetic Form." Gans references only males throughout the article; in the sec- ond of four footnotes provided for the article, he notes: I have assumed that the members of the originary human community-in-crisis, the inventors/discoverers of the sign, were male, since the male sex, among primates as well as humans, has always had a near-monopoly on violence. In the works mentioned in footnote 1, this "originary event" is described as taking place on the occasion of a hunting party. (Gans 1991, 21) [Gans's footnote 1 ref- erenced the entirety of three of his books.] Since by the first part of my definition of feminist analysis I am com- mitted to providing a context for my work, I read Gans's books before continuing an analysis of Larsen's songs. As Gans points out, he has developed and modified his theories of the originary scene throughout the scope of his three referenced books. I quote extensively from his work, to try to represent the range of his thought. The earliest publica- tion, The Origin of Language (1981) contains the following information: 232</page><page sequence="4">Women Working Let us assume with Girard that the community contemplates the body of its victim as a "transcendental signifier" of the whole process of crisis and resolution. Now during the murder, as a collective act, a virtual community already existed among its perpetrators. This col- lectivity could only become conscious of its existence when, the deed accomplished, action ceases, and the remains of the victim, no longer an object of aggression, become to all a sign of their solidar- ity. (Gans 1981, 19) Language is essentially a means of creating, within the sphere of intersubjective presence, models of real situations that, because they occur and recur in time according to material and not representa- tional necessity, do not simply "evolve" out of existence. (75) If one asks the man on the street to name the source of religion, his most likely response will be the fear of death. (286) Gans refines his concepts in his 1985 The End of Culture: The actual consumption or appetitive use of the object, whether ali- mentary or, for example, sexual, is not a necessary element of the scene itself. (Gans 1985, 34) There can be little doubt that the various forms of secular art derive originally from ritual. Yet, as we have seen, the esthetic contempla- tion of the desire-object is a necessary element of representation that precedes the sacralization of this object in ritual. (52) The notion of "natural democracy" is utopian.... All social order involves some degree of differentiation, and this must have been true from the outset. (75) Aggression imagined is aggression deferred, if only long enough to carry it out more effectively in practice. (76) To the extent that we presuppose an originary event, this event must have occurred to real men faced with a real object .... (98) The attribution of human characteristics to a ritual victim is not proof that the victim was "originally" a man. On the contrary, it is a sign of awareness that the originally obvious and a priori difference between community and victim has now become problematic-that it must now be justified on the purely human grounds of transgres- sion and punishment. (144) The desiring individual does not merely want to enjoy whatever appetitive satisfaction may be gained from the object; his desire is 233</page><page sequence="5">Perspectives of New Music mediated by the public scene of representation. To desire is to desire to possess the difference conferred on the object by this scene-in a word, to be different. (150) The survival of Judaism to the end of what we may still call the Christian era is epiphenomenal in the eyes of those-not all of them Christians by any means-for whom the cultural contribution of the Jews is merely preliminary to Christianity or to Western culture in general. .. . Why indeed did Judaism remain a tribal religion that only in the radically transformed versions of Christianity and, later, Islam, could acquire universal influence? (208) Gans introduces a use of feminine pronouns on pages 218-21: Israel's sufferings can no longer be looked upon merely as punish- ments for her own iniquities. Her sorry place in the international scheme must be given an exemplary role. (218) In most prophetic discourse, as indeed in the historical books, Israel's sufferings are presented as atonement for her sins.... (221) By way of contrast, Gans confers male identity on his Greek spectators at a Greek tragedy: Each member of the audience is an individual who makes his own judgment concerning the value of the work being staged. The com- petitive nature of the Athenian dramatic festivals reflects this fact. (234) Gans references feminism and a few women in this volume: The main thrust of feminism in the cultural sphere has been to oppose the role of the woman placed on a pedestal by generations of lyric poets.... (274) The difference between the sexes is marked from the beginning of culture, but this does not suffice to make sexuality itself culturally significant. The primary function of culture is to avert conflict, not to express emotions, and whether such conflict involves a woman or a share in the feast is unimportant so long as both desire-objects retain the same passive role. Whatever the extent of female indepen- dence in primitive society, structural anthropology's definition of kinship systems as mechanisms for regulating the exchange of women among different social groups remains justified. (274-75) 234</page><page sequence="6">Women Working Sappho's contamination of sacred and profane is indicative of a fur- ther degeneration in the power of the ritual sphere. (277) Gans's elucidation of linguistic and social relationships continues in his book, Science and Faith: As we saw at the beginning of this work, the theory of biological evolution does not explain the emergence of man. The Bible is a better source of materials for the solution of this problem than the Olduvai Gorge. (Gans 1990, 117) Mindful of the Pauline doctrines in the New Testament on the silence of women, I will nonetheless try to summarize my understanding of some of Gans's arguments in the three books to which his article in Per- spectives of New Music referred us: Language requires an originary event. This event required the partici- pation of a violent male group in either a murder or a gang rape. The object of this violence may or may not have been a man. Current social theory correctly assumes that women should be passive. The suffering of Israel is gendered as female; the spectators at classic Greek drama are gendered as male. The origin of language necessitates participation in the originary event; cultural development depends on the event's replication, as well as rituals which sacralize it. I have reduced the 769 total pages of text and sources in the three books Gans referenced to a few pages of quotations and summary, and have probably distorted his arguments in the reduction. Nonetheless, I have read his books and assume that anyone, wishing to correct my mis- understandings, has done the same. (Gans's beliefs stand in developmen- tal context with those of Collins (1985): "This 'political economy of music' has as its grounding notion the view that the aesthetic phenome- non has its origins in ritual murder" (Collins 1985, 15).) Several logical problems arise from Gans's theories: if language is granted only to males, I (as a female) should not have been able to understand John Rahn's request for this analysis. Further, my inability to understand Gans's writings is foreordained, and my ability to communi- cate any misunderstandings is doomed by my gendered lack of language. By my criteria at the opening of this article, I consider Gans's work to be incomplete. I dedicate the remainder of this article to the (possibly futile) attempt to offer an expansion of Gans's statement on page 18 of his 1991 article, "We conclude that if man can speak, he must be musical," to include women as well. 235</page><page sequence="7">Perspectives of New Music ANALYTICAL CONTEXT FOR LARSEN'S SONG I begin with a contextualization of Larsen's lyrics for her 1989 Songs from Letters, drawn from letters written by Martha Jane Cannary Hickock (1852-1903) to her daughter. Larsen obtained her texts from excerpts published in Payne's Between Ourselves (Payne 1983). The letters have been published in their entirety in Calamity Jane's Letters to Her Daugh- ter (Hickock 1976). Calamity Jane's relationship with her daughter is summarized by La Bastille as, "Janey, whom she boarded with an old friend because of her own [Calamity Jane's] dubious reputation" (La Bastille 1980, 43). La Bastille quotes from an 1877 letter not used in the song: I am alone in my shack tonight and tired. I rode 60 miles yesterday to the post office and returned home tonight this is your birthday and you are four years old today. You are the dead spit of Meself at your age and as I gaze on your little photo tonight I stop as I kiss you and then remembering tears start and I ask God to let me make amend some how some day to your father and you.... You are destined never to have a mother to live with. I am looking after a little boy. His name is Jackie and he is five years older than you, his father &amp; mother were killed by the indians. I found him the day your Father was killed. .... Good night dear till next time. For us, Calamity Jane's context arises in our mythologized American West. That mythological West has become universalized through popular culture and high art's investment in its cultural content. Roach chronicles unadorned facts of frontier women's lives, such as: Cowboys don't talk much. But the women did talk later and left records of what they knew of life on the cattle drive.... Mrs. W. B. Slaughter remembered heading out with her husband from Fort Sumner, New Mexico, in 1896 with a herd of fifteen hundred. It was her job to hunt watering holes, rustle wood and help the horse wrangler on the trail to Liberal, Kansas. (Roach 1990, 5) In a nineteenth-century context, Calamity Jane's skills with guns and horses were unexceptional; she seems further removed from us than her death date early in this century. Her letters remind us that myth is not the opposite of truth: myth encompasses more of reality than does simple truth. 236</page><page sequence="8">Women Working I chose to concentrate on Larsen's fourth song, with a text from letters dated between 1882-1893. Entitled "A Working Woman," this song is the one which has most remained with me since I first heard the set. As a part of the third element of a feminist analysis, I acknowledge that I heard the song just prior to the twenty-fifth anniversary of my choice of single parenthood. The text of this fourth song is: You see, your mother works for a living: One day I have chicken, and the next day feathers. These days, I'm driving a stagecoach. For a while, I worked in Russell's saloon but when I worked there, the virtuous women planned to run me out of town. So these days, I'm driving a stagecoach. These are hectic days-like hell let out for noon. Your Mother works for a living. I mind my own business but remember that one thing the world hates is a woman who minds her own business. The virtuous women, have bastards and shot gun weddings. I have nursed them through childbirth and my only pay is a kick in the pants when my back is turned. These other women are pot bellied, hairy legged and look like something the cat dragged in. I wish I had the power to damn their souls to hell. You see, your mother works for a living. Larsen's choice of piano and female voice provides an irony which enriches our approach to her work. Hoffman's analysis of the relation- ships of musical instruments and women's bodies provides a context for the historical significance of both piano and voice for women's musical roles (Hoffman 1991). By the time of Calamity Jane's death, the ensem- ble of woman's solo voice accompanied by piano had become a cliche, as alluded to by Judith Tick: In 1904 James Hunaker, noted critic and music journalist, sounded the death of the nineteenth-century stereotype: "passed away is the girl who played the piano in the stiff Victorian drawing rooms of our mothers." (Bowers and Tick 1986, 325) Larsen's writing for female singer and piano reinterprets nineteenth cen- tury stereotypical roles for women as ornamental objects, confined to the 237</page><page sequence="9">Perspectives of New Music privacy of the home. Cultural support of women's development of musi- cal performance skills for private exhibition coincided with the lack of support for women's public musical performance, as well as cultural interdictions against women as independent persons participating in pub- lic culture. Larsen has thus set a compositional task'for herself of explicat- ing the context of Calamity Jane's letters without trivializing her words or reifying the concepts evoked, if even in irony. Larsen uses a sparse chantlike quality in her vocal writing; the plain- spoken mythic Western language of "yep" and "nope" resonates through Larsen's setting of Calamity Jane's words. When Calamity Jane's curses ring out in the last phrases, they still retain this gaunt power, giving way to no operatic melisma. Larsen writes an unaccompanied rising line for the first phrase, "Your mother works for a living" (see Example 1). Slowly, freely, recitative 4 t ; your moth - er works for a liv - ing EXAMPLE 1 The melody evokes a number of the Western ballads contemporaneous to Calamity Jane's life, such as the phrases shown in Example 2 from "I'm goin' to leave old Texas now," and "When the work's all done this fall," but, in fact, quotes none of them. i;*jI J -I_ J__ EXAMPLE 2 The transcriptions are from the oral tradition, as I learned them when a child, from my family.

EXAMPLE 5 - 'r I I I I I 239</page><page sequence="11">Perspectives of New Music Larsen explicates Calamity Jane's phrase, "other virtuous women," which claims virtue for herself, but distances and "others" her from her female peers. The piano counterpoints the melody of "the other virtuous women" to the vocal line: "These other women are pot bellied, hairy legged and they look like something the cat dragged in" and asks us to consider: who is normally described as pot bellied and hairy legged? Women? By sex, they are women, but by socially constructed roles they are men. Mary Daly uses the description "token torturers": Women are used as scapegoats and token torturers (for example, by the "setting up" of mothers-in-law as to blame for the widows' doom). This masks the male-centeredness of the ritualized atrocity and turns women against each other. (Daly 1978, 132) Although this quotation is taken from Daly's chapter on suttee, she uses the concept in her discussions of Chinese footbinding, genital mutilation, and in a reference to the Nazi concentration camps, as well. Larsen fulfills her compositional process by reworking the "run me out of town" motif into the music of "I wish I had the power to damn their souls to hell." Larsen makes Calamity Jane's wish into a timeless curse which validates her reality and authenticates her mythological context. (accel)-------------- J = 100 damn their souls to hell, damn their souls to hell! EXAMPLE 6 Through intervallic and metric augmentation, Larsen invokes the incipit of the "Dies Irae." The final curse rings with the added interpretation of the "day of wrath and day of mourning." We can hear Larsen's recasting of Calamity Jane's identity from that of a homeless outcast assisting "other virtuous women" who refused reciprocal support, into an identity of judging, wrathful deity, creating her own role and place in the western mythology and pantheon now accepted by contemporary society. When I first heard the song, I expected it to end here; sometimes I still want it to end without the last section. Instead, Larsen repeats the vocal line, metrically augmented, at a tritone below its original location, "Your 240</page><page sequence="12">Women Working mother works for a living." And I must acknowledge that I, too, work for a living. AN ALTERNATIVE TO GANS'S ORIGINARY SCENE FOR LINGUISTIC DEVELOPMENT Context and relatedness, as centralities to women's identities, arise from social roles theorized nearly two decades ago by Chodorow (1974) and others. Briefly, they developed the concept that since women are tradi- tionally the primary care providers to infants, young girls need only dif- ferentiate between self and other to establish an identity. Young boys must make a double differentiation: self-other, then a differently gen- dered social identity. Women may have opportunities to develop identi- ties without the additional anxieties of men, anxieties alluded to by theorists such as Bloom (1973), and powerfully interpreted into theories of musical composition by Korsyn (1991, 19). When I first discussed these concepts in music theory classes, students who were fathers quickly pointed out that this definition is not based on biological essentialism but is culturally constructed. Several commented that they were/are primary care providers, or are equal participants in parenting their children. They differentiate their parenting experiences from those of their own parents, and they anticipate that their children's construction of social identities may differ from theirs. In support of their comments, I note that in my experience student fathers seem slightly more likely to bring their young children to music theory classes than do student mothers. Alternately, this might reflect greater childcare net- working skills of student mothers, or an array of other variables. Building on Chodorow, Gilligan's research expanded Kohlberg's theo- ries of individual rights into a theory of responsibility (Gilligan 1982). Those new to Gilligan's theories can approach them by taking the United States' Declaration of Independence and replacing the phrase "right to" before "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" with the phrase "responsibility for." Although this vastly oversimplifies even the begin- nings of Gilligan's research, it provides a starting point. (Attorney Gen- eral Janet Reno's public assumption of responsibility for the 1993 ATF debacle in Waco can be construed as having a socially gendered compo- nent.) Extending Gilligan's concepts, Ruddick acknowledged her debt to Gil- ligan, writing: Routines of responsibility, exhausting work, and, for some, the nar- rowing perspectives of a particular profession or academic discipline 241</page><page sequence="13">Perspectives of New Music conspire to undermine most mothers'-and most adults'-active mental life. (Ruddick 1989, 89) To paraphrase Gandhi, if the preservation and growth of children is truth, then a criterion of its realization is that it be achieved nonvio- lently. (170) Some people . . . take a perverse or sadistic pleasure in the confirma- tion of horrors they have long suspected .... Maternal tales are nei- ther mysterious nor attractively horrible. (250) Code makes the following points in writing of a feminist epistemology: The claim that individual men are the creators of the authoritative ... landmarks of western intellectual life is particularly interesting for the fact that the contributions-both practical and substantive- of their lovers, wives, children, servants, neighbors, friends, and col- leagues rarely figure in analyses of their work. (Code 1991, 11) Implicit cultural presuppositions work with the personal idiosyncra- cies of intellectual authorities to keep certain issues from placing high on research agendas. Critics have to learn how to notice their absence. (25) There is no doubt that a false essentialism informs both male and female stereotypes. But hegemonic ideals of reason are constructed out of symbolisms, qualities, and modes of thought that map accu- rately onto, and are mirrored by, hegemonic ideals of masculinity. (119) It is as important to acknowledge the places where women's contri- butions and interventions have been effective as it is to demonstrate the oppressive powers of monolithic disciplines and bodies of knowl- edge. Otherwise there will be no doubt that women are natural vic- tims after all. (261) The larger context of the effects of a feminist epistemology on aca- demic research, in its relation to feminist ethics, is well summarized in a volume edited by Card, and in which Trebilcot writes: The ideology of dominant western (white, male, capitalist) culture is like a huge and complex machine.... Although the academics know that the machine benefits them, and to some extent how it does so, most do not say that it does, even to themselves, because to notice would be to admit that there are others whose interests it does not serve. (Trebilcot 1991, 46) 242</page><page sequence="14">Women Working Commenting on gendered differences in authorial voices, Zierolf observed in a paper presented at the 1988 Society for Music Theory Conference: It is important to avoid recognition of the male role-agent mode as the norm and the female mode as abnormal or somehow inferior. I have found an expansion of authorial voice in the writing of women music theorists, who are more likely than men to present their work through affiliative, relational linguistic constructions (Killam 1992). Relational aspects of process and product are central to investigations of women's gendered roles in creative endeavors. Lochhead's recent analysis (1991) utilizes this approach: In general terms, process-oriented analysis addresses the "arising" of formal meanings during the temporal succession of units and events that constitute a musical whole. (Lochhead 1991, 136) The styles of women composers and theorists may expand the range of the traditional phallocratically structured heroic male voice, a male in vio- lent struggle with his peers. Assimilation and synthesis of creative ele- ments by women writers of music and of words may expand the models most frequently used by men. I am not proposing that women and men create music differently or that they create different types of music. Rather, I suggest that women may expand our concepts of musical cre- ativity. Some concepts excerpted from linguist George Lakoff's Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal about the Mind may clarify my suggestion: When new constructions are added to language, they are not ran- dom. Rather they are motivated by existing structures, just as new senses of words are motivated by existing senses.... What speakers do is use a linguistic system that fits together well and is cognitively efficient for their purposes. (Lakoff 1987, 493-94) Gans's description of an originary scene in the development of lan- guage may be accurate. The importance of his ideas for musical composi- tion and analysis may be significant. He marshals a great deal of evidence. To me and to those women with whom I have discussed his theory, it seems curiously incomplete, in light of Haraway's review of recent prima- tology research. She writes that the greatest expansion in field primatol- ogy dates from the mid-1970s and involves a great deal of work done by a number of women, summarizing: 243</page><page sequence="15">Perspectives of New Music In myriad mundane ways, primatology is a practice for the negotia- tion of the possibility of community, of a public world, of rational action. It is the negotiation of the time of origins, the origin of the family, the boundary between self and other, hominid and homi- noid, human and animal. Primatology is about the principle of action, mutability, change, energy, about the possibility and con- straints of politics. (Haraway 1986, 115) Research into primate social structures presents complex levels of maternal/infant bonding, supported by vocal communication. Primate groups engage in comforting behaviors after encountering a frightening situation, often returning to matrifocal groupings for these comforting behaviors. Studies of matrilineal status relationships and extended matri- focal family groupings would seem to offer possible alternatives to Gans's originary scenes. The extensive levels of mother-child communication at the primate level, and the extent to which this is a learned social skill, support interpretations more inclusive of women than those of Gans. To extend this idea into our earliest records of artistic practices, in The Chalice and the Blade, Eisler offers additional interpretations of Pale- olithic art: These cave sanctuaries, figurines, burials and rites all seem to have been related to a belief that the same source from which human life springs is also the source of all vegetable and animal life-the great Mother Goddess or Giver of All we still find in later periods of West- ern civilization. Paleolithic wall paintings were interpreted as relating to hunting even when they showed women dancing .... The evi- dence of a female centered anthropomorphic form of worship-such as finds of broadhipped and pregnant female representations-had to either be ignored or classified as merely male sex objects: obese erotic "Venuses" or "barbaric images of beauty." (Eisler 1987, 3-4) In contrast to Gans's interpretation of Judeo-Christian tradition in our development, Eisler notes, "only in the Bible is the Goddess as a divine power entirely absent" (93). Further, she writes: Typically, this pathologically misogynistic view of women as a sex is presented as merely an irrationality of sexually frustrated men. But the Church's "moral" condemnation of women was far more than a psychological quirk. It was a justification for male dominance-an appropriate, and in that sense of the word also rational, response by the androcratic system. (141) 244</page><page sequence="16">Women Working Gans's attribution of the source of religion to man's fear of death is incomplete to me. Death does come to us all; communities suffer the loss of essential others. When those die who have comforted us, we remem- ber (for I think we cannot forget) the comfort we received from them. They remain in our thoughts, our dreams. I suggest that their vivid remembered presence in our lives motivates us to project alternatives where these remembered others still exist, and to support the rituals which invoke and impresent them for us. I can imagine a myriad of origi- nary scenes where the death of an essential other, whether due to the multiplicity of natural catastrophes which groups cannot escape or to simple old age, impelled matrifocal family groupings into comforting lin- guistic patterns on the part of remaining females. When the originary groups discovered that members were comforted with the repetition of simple maternal sound patterns, they might have learned to invoke the solace and bonding through those linguistic patterns, even at subsequent times of no catastrophic crisis. In support of this, I quote Auerbach's "From Singing to Lamenting: Women's Musical Role in a Greek Vil- lage": Men and women play contrasting musical roles chiefly because of their different relationships to death and mourning. Kalohori [the location of her field research for the article cited] is no exception to the world pattern in which the burden of mourning falls to women (see Rosenblatt et al. 1976:110). Women are responsible for every phase of the care, grieving, and commemorization of the dead. Just as they nurture bonds among the living, they are expected to extend the connection of ponos (caring, yearning, pain) to family beyond death through adherence to mourning practices (see Dan- forth 1982:141). (Auerbach 1989, 28) The existence of such social roles for women in Calamity Jane's west is implied in a study of women's diaries of the overland western crossings in the time of the Gold Rush. Schlissel calculates that women diarists were more likely than men to record deaths among the wagon trains and graves passed on the trail. She interprets this to indicate that women were more fearful of the journey and less likely to have initiated their family's participation (Schlissel 1982, 14-15). In light of my theories above, I suggest that an additional interpretation is: one of the gendered social roles of women is that of lamenting the dead, and that this was (and may remain) a ritual practice expected of women. Women's practice of writing letters to their unborn children has been interpreted as a fear of the trauma of childbirth; I suggest that this practice confirms women's cen- trality to linguistic development and continuity. 245</page><page sequence="17">Perspectives of New Music Women today, musicians and nonmusicians, still negotiate our com- plex individual socially contexted identities. We struggle, we work, we hope for change. Neither Calamity Jane nor I, nor Larsen most probably, can obtain an independent status where we initiate and determine our cultural context. We negotiate a fragile status and space in a nonsupport- ive society. We work for a living; we work for the living. Others can toy and play with the dying; others can, with Gans, create their linguistic ori- gins from ritual and political phallacies, as do those to whom Gallop alludes in "The Phallic Mother: Fraudian Analysis," where she concludes: The need, the desire, the wish for the Phallus is great. No matter how oppressive its reign, it is much more comforting than no one in command. (Gallop 1982, 130-31) Perhaps my hypothesis of a maternal wish to communicate is more radi- cally decentering than I estimate. Such a hypothesis requires no originary violence, but does allow for a defence against those who would silence me and other women. CONCLUDING SUMMARY Hekman summarizes feminist concerns with duality and hierarchy: The basic insight that animates the feminist critique of the subject/ object dualism is simple and relatively uncontroversial: throughout the history of western thought men have been defined as subjects, women as objects. (Hekman 1990, 73) Calamity Jane was both (and also more than) Madonna and whore. As summarized by Blashfield (1981, 24-25), "For most of her life, brothels remained 'resthomes' to be visited when she was broke or weary." Her letters give poignant testimony of her love for her daughter, her care of others, and her judgment of society's judgment of her. Larsen's music depicts and explains the complexities of Calamity Jane's life. The ranges of contemporary women musicians' thoughts on the relationships of sim- plicity and complexity are exemplified in the recent colloquy of McClary (1992) and Barkin (1992). Larsen chose to ironize her interpretive stance through her title of Song IV, a title obviously not provided by Calamity Jane. The word "work" evokes a multiplicity of images, including "MEN WORKING" signs, and specification of functionality by the phrase, "This works." Using these criteria, Calamity Jane was indeed a "working [functioning] 246</page><page sequence="18">Women Working 247 woman": she bore a daughter, arranged for her daughter's care, labored to support her. Calamity Jane negotiated multiple cultural roles; she assisted other women and wrote of her judgments when she considered that assistance to be nonreciprocated. Larsen, too, is a working woman; a composer's output is known as her "work." At the time when she composed these songs, she had just com- pleted the work of birthing her own daughter and was engaged in the ongoing work of mothering. At multiple levels, women work: we func- tion, we labor, we produce, we create, we communicate. Songs such as "A Working Woman" work to relate our contribution to our culture.

Killam Route 77, Box 71B Annapolis, MO 63620-9603 Dear Rosemary: Thanks for your letter of June 8th. To be honest with you, I am so fascinated by you find in my music that I would just as soon stay out of the proceedings, and see the results of your work as you near the final draft of the paper. However, if you would like to have me more involved, just drop me a note and tell me how I can help you. Really, the whole process of analysis is fascinating to me and especially a feminist analysis of the work. Susan McClary, who I'm sure you are familiar with, once remarked to me that I may not be aware of what I am doing in the feminist approach to composition as I work. At the time, I took umbrage with her, but as time has gone on, and I have learned to trust the fruits of my labor to stand on their own, I have become more and more aware of our social positions and how that effects our work, both consciously and unconsciously. All this is to say that I'm just intrigued by what you will find in my music. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Good luck on the work, it sounds as if your working environment is quiet and productive. I'm envious.

[ I I Message: Dear Rosemary: I apologize for delaying in responding to your FAX. You caught me at the end of a deadline and in a spate of travelling. I read the analysis and am humbled by how much of what you find in the music is so true. And I must admit that reading your analysis rendered me mute for awhile. One thinks that one can hide sometimes, in music, but I see that instead of a mask, the music is a mirror. In answer to your questions: in m 17, the chord should be read as Bb-Eb-Gnat. In m33, I did compose the top not as Gb, and to be honest with you, even though to be an exact transposition of m28, I liked the sound of Gb. Can you tell me why? The line of your analysis which struck home with me most is "she chooses to enrich and strengthen the words'meanings through her music' That is so true. I do not 'set' words, instead, I try to create an environment for them to become even more active. Does this make sense to you? Again, I apologize for the delay and any inconvenience it has caused you. I look forward to hearing from you.
