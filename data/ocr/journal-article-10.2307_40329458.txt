<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. By I. M. Sim site of a series of charcoal drawings in a rock shelter near Wilton, N.S.W. , was shown to the author in 1962 by Messrs. J. and P. Price of Sutherland. They had been directed to it by Mr. T. Brown of Wilton and Mr. Egan of Corrimal. The area was settled in the early i8oo's and the drawings have been known to local residents for at least 100 years. The assistance of Messrs. J. and P. Price and D. Milner and of the author's wife in recording the drawings is gratefully acknowledged, as is also a grant for expenses made by the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies. Locality and Site Wilton is a small rural community about 40 miles south of Sydney. It is located on a wide ridge of undulating land which is bounded on the south-west, north-west and north-east by the incised gorges of the Nepean and Cataract Rivers. A number of tributary streams drain the ridge and have cut deep narrow gullies into the underlying Hawkesbury Sandstone formation. In contrast to the undulating farmlands of the higher levels, these gullies are rough and precipitous, littered with masses of fallen rock and covered with a thick growth of scrub and trees. Their rocky walls, vertical in many places, contain numerous eroded hollows and overhanging ledges. The shelter containing the drawings is located in one of these gullies known as Clement's Creek. At the site the creek runs north-westerly and the gully is about 100 feet wide and 40 feet deep, with broken vertical walls. At the foot of a steep, broken scree a small watercourse trickles through fallen rocks and scrubby vegetation. The shelter has been formed by erosion of the rock face forming the western wall of the creek. It is divided into two sections, both of which contain a series of charcoal drawings. Southern Section This section is about 100 feet long and contains the main frieze of drawings. Weathering has produced an almost vertical rock face up to 20 feet high, broken by irregular projections of horizontal sills of harder rock. The highest of these sills forms an overhang to the shelter, extending to a width of about 15 feet at its northern end. Large rocks have fallen from the overhang on to the scree slope, and these, together with growing trees, have acted as a retaining wall to a " floor " along the foot of the rock face. This " floor " has a maximum width of about 10 feet, a variable crossfall, and slopes down uniformly from south to north. Its southern end is about 30 feet above the creek bed.</page><page sequence="2">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. PLATE I (Photographs by D. Milner)</page><page sequence="3">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. 59 The southernmost 40 feet of the rock face is irregular and bears no drawings. The main series is drawn over 30 feet of an almost vertical face about four feet wide. The drawings are described from south to north, the series being arbitrarily divided into sections to facilitate description. (1) Small infilled figures of two men with bulbous heads or headdresses. Two small infilled figures or parts of figures. These have been drawn over a series of unes and are overdrawn with other lines. A number of lines and the outline figures of the upper parts of two kangaroos ; the ears and neck of one partly infilled. (2) Life-size figures of a male and female kangaroo facing each other. The male has a thick body, powerful chest and limbs, and uplifted head. The smaller and slimmer female has a joey in her pouch and is looking over her shoulder with cocked ears in a characteristic attitude. The figures are infilled with lines. Between the kangaroos is an outline figure of a large kangaroo head and several lines. Above the male is a small outline figure resembling a four-petalled flower. (Plate I (A).) (3) The main figures in this group are of three men, each about 15 inches high and shown in profile. (Plate I (B).) (a) The first is rotund and hump-shouldered, with slender legs and no arms. Most of his head is obscured by a long horizontal headdress, the extremities of which taper and terminate in rounded knobs. The figure is drawn with a fine outline lightly infilled. (b) Immediately below the first man is another, a slender figure with rounded buttocks, a long penis and scrotum reaching to his feet, and thin arms and legs. His body is arched, the legs spread and slightly flexed. He holds an elongated object in each hand. The figure is infilled above the waist. (c) The third figure is that of a stockily built man holding an axe and cutting or trimming a vertical pole. His body is drawn with attention to morphological detail. The axe has an oval-shaped blade, hafted at the base. The figure is infilled. Other figures in this section are : An outline figure of a large kangaroo head ; four small infilled figures, one like an emu track ; another a semi-oval with a long line " tail " ; the other two indeterminate : an outline figure five inches high of an armless human (?) with a bumpy body and a curved and sharply pointed head. The group has been drawn over older lines and other unes are drawn across the first man. Adjoining the third man are outline figures of an echidna and a small animal (?) together with several lines. (4) An infilled figure four feet high of a woman holding an elongated object in one hand. She has a disproportionately large head and thin neck. Her head and upper body have been drawn over indeterminate infilled figures. Beneath one arm is a small figure of a man (?). (5) The most spectacular figure of the series is that of a male anthropomorph about seven and a half feet long. He is drawn in a horizontal position with arms stretched above his head. His trunk is relatively long and slender, the legs short and thick. The hands are outspread, each with eight sharply pointed fingers. What</page><page sequence="4">6o ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. appears to be a mass of hair hangs in vertical stripes from the head on to the lower arm. On each side of the upper part of the head there is a projection resembling an elongated ear lobe. The figure is infilled, with a heavy outline around parts of the legs and trunk. (Plate I (C).) The lower trunk of the anthropomorph has been drawn over a partly infilled figure of a kangaroo, six feet long. Its legs and tail have been drawn around on to the roof of a deep hollow weathered out at the base of the rock face. The outline figure of a largfe emu has been drawn over the arms and head of the anthropomorph. Below the anthropomorph are a number of indeterminate line figures and patches of infilling. Distinguishable are small infilled figures of two men, one holding a boomerang. At the head of the anthropomorph is an infilled figure of an indeter- minate bird or animal. It resembles a grotesquely shaped emu-like bird with a squat and misshapen body, a long thin curved neck thickened at its extremity for a head, a small penis (?), and long legs terminating in large club-like feet, each with three toes. (6) On the lower part of the wall are outline figures of two flying foxes and a small infilled figure of a man. Above these are a number of lines which appear to be the remains of an outline figure of an anthropomorph about seven feet long lying horizontally. Only parts of the legs, a line across the waist, one hand and the head and shoulders remain. The neck and shoulders are well defined. Across the neck is a narrow band of seven parallel lines. On each side of the head is a double projection resembling a long bifurcated ear lobe. The head and shoulders are enframed by a semi-oval made up of a series of lines. The upper part of the head is obscured by indeterminate line figures but appears to merge into a long thick pendulous object, which terminates in a rounded knob. Across the legs are several lines and a small infilled figure of a man holding an oval-shaped object. Across the feet is a partly infilled figure of the upper half of a kangaroo, together with several lines. (7) Outline figures of the head of an animal (wombat ?), an indeterminate object and an armless human. (8) Three feet below the last, in a small alcove in the rock face, a Une of six small figures : heads and shoulders of two kangaroos, one infilled ; indeterminate object, partly infilled ; dingo (?), infilled ; kangaroo (?), infilled ; man holding a long narrow object, shown in profile, infilled. (9) Six feet north of the last, on a projecting part of the rock face, are the figures of two men fighting with clubs (?) and shields. They are about 10 inches high, shown in profile, with slender waists, powerful chests and buttocks, arched bodies and spread and flexed legs. Each is protecting himself with an upraised narrow shield in one hand, and holds in the other a club (?) lifted ready to strike. The figures are drawn with a fine outline lightly infilled. (Plate I (D).) A small outline figure of a boomerang (?) ; parts of two indeterminate infilled gures.</page><page sequence="5">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. 61 Dra</page><page sequence="6">Drawings from the Southern Section.</page><page sequence="7">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="8">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="9">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="10">62</page><page sequence="11">63 ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. Drawings from the Northern Section.</page><page sequence="12">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. 63 State of Preservation and Age The series is generally well preserved, although some of the drawings, especially the older ones and those on the lower part of the rock face, are fragmentary and are indistinct in dull light. In a number of places water seepage has obliterated the drawings with brown and white stains. On the evidence of appearance, the drawings are of various ages, the colour of the charcoal markings varying from black to light grey. In section (5) two later series have been superimposed on the oldest distinguishable figures. Northern Section North of the last drawings, the rock face is very irregular and the roof of the shelter dips sharply. A small creek running over the lip of the overhang trickles down through broken rocks into the main creek. The space along the rock face is constricted by fallen rocks to a passage a few feet wide, which then opens out into the northern section of the shelter. This is about 60 feet long, with a high-stepped overhang about 15 feet wide. Part of the floor, about six feet above the creek bed, is level and sandy ; the rest is irregular and rocky, strewn with masses of fallen stone. The rear wall has eroded out, forming a second shelter about four feet high and 15 feet deep at floor level. The drawings are in three groups. (1) On the rear wall of the main shelter towards its southern end. An infilled figure of a kangaroo (?) and parts of six or seven other figures, some partly infilled. (2) Fifteen feet north. Small infilled figures of three kangaroos, two indeter- minate objects and a human ; parts of infilled figures extending around on to the roof of the smaller shelter. On the roof of this shelter are infilled figures of two fish, one two feet long, the other six feet long ; two small infilled figures of a kangaroo and an indeterminate object ; several lines. (3) Ten feet north, on the wall of the main shelter. Partly infilled figures of a fish six feet long and an indeterminate object. In the diagram the distances between the three groups has been foreshortened. State of Preservation The series is very poorly preserved. The rock faces are damp and almost all the drawings have been badly damaged by the rock flaking away. Many of them are obscured by a glazed deposit covering the rock surface. Vandalism at the Wilton Site The site is on private property, but has been badly vandalized. Few of the drawings have been obliterated or defaced, although most of the rock surfaces are covered with names and dates scribbled in charcoal. According to local residents this vandalism commenced about 1930, the date of the establishment of a boarding school in the area. A photograph taken prior to 1930 of part of the main frieze shows no evidence of vandalism.</page><page sequence="13">64 ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. Evidence of Occupation Apart from the drawings, no evidence of occupation of the site was observed. The floor was not examined. It appears to be shallow and rocky in most places. Because of the lack of shelter in the southern section, the dampness of the northern section and the uneven and rocky nature of most of the floor, the site is rather unsuitable as a camping place. There are a few axe-grinding grooves in the creek bed some quarter mile down- stream from the site. Messrs. J. and P. Price examined a number of shelters along the creek but found no drawings or signs of occupation. According to local residents, an extensive Aboriginal camp site on the high ground west of the shelter was uncovered by ploughing in the early igoo's. Cultivation over many years and the final use of the land for pasture has obliterated all surface signs of this site. The area is well watered and, prior to European settlement, game would have been plentiful. Discussion On the evidence available, it appears that the shelter, at least the southern section, was used as a drawing gallery by the Aborigines over a considerable period. The site is secluded and rather difficult of access. Its unsuitability as a camping place, the presence of a large camping ground nearby, and the size and unusual nature of some of the figures, especially the large anthropomorphs, suggests a strong possibility of its being a site of some ritual importance. Monochrome drawings in charcoal are common in the Sydney-Hawkesbury district and appear to be more typical of the cave art of this area than of any other in Australia. Drawings of this type have not been recorded on the eastern coastal region further south than Milton, about 120 miles south of Sydney. The styles and subjects of the drawings in the Wilton shelter are generally typical of those found throughout the Sydney-Hawkesbury district, but several features are unusual. Large anthropomorphic figures, although common among the rock engravings, are a rare subject in the cave drawings of the Sydney-Hawkesbury district. In the few sites where they have been recorded, these figures are more elaborately drawn in red and white, and in one case, in red, white, yellow and black. In most of the sites where the drawings have an obvious ritual significance, bichromes in black and red or black and white are more common than simple black monochromes. Large charcoal drawings are uncommon in the area, particularly north of the Hawkesbury River. The largest drawing of this type recorded on the eastern coasj occurs in a shelter at Cordeaux, about seven miles south of Wilton - a marine creature 11 feet long. The series is a large one by the standards of the region, but only one art phase, viz. the " black period " designated by McCarthy, is represented. This is unusual in the region ; in a majority of cases several art phases are represented in the one site. There are six figures of men shown in profile in the southern shelter. This method of depiction is rare in Aboriginal art. A similar figure, of a man spearing a</page><page sequence="14">ABORIGINAL DRAWINGS NEAR WILTON, N.S.W. 65 kangaroo, occurs at Avon Dam, about 10 miles south-west of Wilton. The tableau of the two men fighting with clubs and shields is a particularly fine composition, and most of the figures, in their realistic portrayal and controlled linework, reveal artistic ability uncommon in the cave art of the Sydney district.
