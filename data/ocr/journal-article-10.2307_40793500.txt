<plain_text><page sequence="1">WEST AFRICAN MASKS AND SOCIAL CONTROL M. C. Jedrej, University of Edinburgh One approach to an understanding of artefacts which has proved valuable, especially as regards less obviously utilitarian objects, is the investigation of how they function in their social and cultural context. A particularly well developed example of the effectiveness of this method is the body of knowledge which has accumulated around the subject of West African masks and masquerades. The puzzling details of a particular mask are accounted for when it is restored to the social context from which it had been abstracted. The point of this paper is to suggest that this approach may not be without problems. Specifically it seems to me that the social context is not such an unproblematical and self-evident reality that it can furnish a sound basis from which to proceed to an understanding of the apparently more complicated problem of the mask. Indeed masks may not be as mysterious as we tend, perhaps, to think and a good case can be made for appealing to the manifest properties and evident significances of the mask in order to provide an account of the nature and structure of the rather obscure social context in which the mask is embedded. Sir James Frazer argued that masks are attempts by those involved to produce a convincing likeness of the spirits or gods in order, according to the principle of magic that like produces like, to manifest the spirit and thereby make the ritual in which it participates efficacious in terms of enhancing life and promoting fertility. The psycho-sociological corollary that the masks may also overawe, even terrify, onlookers, and have indeed been frequently observed to be deployed to this end against potential deviants, has been developed into a quite sophisticated functional theory of masks which can be called the social control theory. Masks and masquerades as institutions have even been placed as a stage in the evolution of governmental institutions usually somewhere between kinship- based societies and societies with explicit institutions of government, law and adjudication. This approach has a long history in the study of West African 1</page><page sequence="2">institutions and there is no doubt that at first the social control argument has an immediate appeal but it is also the case that in actual accounts the theory is neither comprehensive nor do the concrete details quite fit together. Yet on the other hand the social control theory cannot be completely discounted since it is equally evident that at least some of the masked figures are operating as agents of, or in association with agents of, social control. A solution is, however, possible once it is appreciated that unless the analysis of the social structure, to the maintenance of which it is the function of the masking institutions to contribute, is well founded then the contextualisation of the masks and masquerades will be unsatisfactory. The rest of this paper attempts to substantiate these general observations and to this end it will be useful to take as a starting point Horton's justly celebrated contribution to Ajayi and Crowder's History of West Africa (Horton 1985:87-128). Horton's chapter, which has remained intact through three editions of the volume while other contributors have sometimes quite drastically revised their contributions or have even been dropped by the editors, contains one of the best examples of the social control theory being used to situate masks in their social context. In dealing with the question of stateless societies in the history of West Africa, Horton describes several types of social structure and it is during the course of the account of his third type of stateless society that he presents a theory of the social and governmental role of masks. This third type is characterised, according to Horton, by nucleated settlements which create local 1. Moore, whose Travels into the Inland Parts of Africa was published in 1738 is among the earliest observers to note how masks, in this case the famous "Mumbo Jumbo" of the Mandinko, was used to bring deviants into line. Weil (1971), over two hundred years later, describes substantially the same institution. Webster (1908) argues generally for secret societies and associated elements such as masks as a stage in the evolution of governmental institutions in human society. Fifty years later Caillois was writing of masked figures as the "forerunners of government" and "the crude beginnings of political power" (1961:95). As regards the Upper Guinea Coast in particular the classic work is Harle/s study of the masks of the Dan and neighbouring peoples in Liberia (1950). However, it is worth noting that Harley only attributed social control functions to some of the masks, the rest he accounted for in simple Frazerian terms. 2</page><page sequence="3">loyalties and a settlement based corporate solidarity not found among populations with dispersed settlement patterns. At the same time there is a weakening of kinship institutions as a basis for social organisation and though lineages remain important as internal subdivisions within the settlement there is no over-arching segmentary lineage structure capable of bringing together a large number of settlements and their component lineages. These lineages tend, therefore, to become competing factions within the settlement. However, the associations, most notably the secret societies, cut across not only the divisions between lineages within a village but also set up linkages between villages. According to Horton, the secret societies and associations: ... are an adaptation to the problem posed by the continuing presence in the community of strong and rivalrous lineages ... they are more efficient tools for organising a harmonious village life than lineages; and this is undoubtedly why they are so extensively developed in large compact settlements (1985:108, 111). The secret societies and associations achieve this in three ways. First of all, elaborate initiation rituals which draw on symbols of death and rebirth represent the demise of the social importance of ties to family, lineage and village and the coming into being of new relationships within the association which embrace several villages in a much wider territorial range. Secondly, the institutions of secrecy allow senior members of the associations to consider issues on their merits and without regard to positions inspired by sectional interests as would be the case were they to be debated before the community at large and so decisions arrived at can be presented as unanimous, thereby muting sectional lineage interests. Finally: ... the masking of the secret society's executives makes immediate sense when considered as a device to ensure acceptance of the harsher sanctions applied by the society to offenders against the community laws ... where the executives 3</page><page sequence="4">are masked, it is possible for the public to accept their actions, however harsh, as impersonal manifestations of the collective will. If they are unmasked and identifiable, their actions might cause dangerous resentment through suspicion of sectional interest (1985:112). Moreover this is not just Horton's theory but also, it seems, the position of the people who have institutionalised masks and masking. According to Horton this is evident in the remarks made by some Dan elders to the ethnographer, H. Himmelherber: Users of secret society masks often have a shrewd idea of the purely political value of such devices in village life. As elders of the Dan villages of the western Ivory Coast say "our chiefs have never had any soldiers or policemen to enforce obedience. So the elders decided that the masks should be given final respect above men. Otherwise how could law and order be maintained in our country" (1985:112). The first question which has to be asked is, how does this theory which is presented in very general and abstract terms engage with the concrete details of particular cases, for example the Dan, already cited by Horton, and the Mende, among whom I have carried out some research into this problem, both representative cultures of the Upper Guinea Coast. Even a cursory examination of the masks and related institutions of these societies reveals two significant differences. First of all the Dan, though an example of Horton's type three stateless society, do not have secret societies though they do have a renowned tradition of masks and masquerades. The Mende, on the other hand, are equally renowned but as the locus classicus of the Poro and other secret societies. Secondly, Dan and Mende masks are very different, a difference which may be summarised by saying that while Mende have relatively few different kinds of masks most of which are not anthropomorphic, the Dan have numerous masks which are all versions of the human face, though some may have prominent grotesque features. It is, however attractive the general theory may be, unsatisfactory that such gross differences of concrete detail should remain 4</page><page sequence="5">unaccounted for and in response to this Siegmann (1980) attempted to ref√Æne Horton's social control approach in order to provide just such an account. According to Siegmann the presence and absence of masks will depend on the specific social control needs of particular social organisations and when they occur the differences in their nature and function will depend on differing political contexts. Siegmann argues that in the western part of the Upper Guinea Coast masks are not central to the functioning of the secret societies since they are not always found in all areas where secret societies are present. Where they do occur, as among the Mende, their function is the supplementary one of "highlighting the symbolism and drama of the initiation rituals" and "impressing with the awesomeness of the men's societies" (1980:94). In the eastern parts of the region, among the Dan in particular, Siegmann suggest that instead of an institution such as the secret society cross-cutting lineages and transcending local loyalties, masked figures have been devised to play various roles in the enforcement of law and order: some hear disputes, make judgements and arbitrate; others act as a kind of police force, others as messengers. There is even a fire-prevention brigade of masked figures. The argument is the familiar one that by disguising individuals as forest spirits, the exercise of social control will not be seen as biased in favour of any particular local lineage and so unity and effective control over a wide area is achieved. It seems that the functions of the secret societies such as the Poro are carried out in the case of the Dan by the masks themselves. In both situations the effectiveness of the institutions is achieved by distancing the sources of control from any one lineage or faction in a territorial alliance of groups. In some cases the judgements come from the secret society which transcends and draws upon the power and authority of the realm of the spirits which may or may not be manifest by means of masked figures. Among the Dan the spirits in the form of masked figures participate directly in securing conformity to custom as they define it. However, despite Siegman's effort to develop and refine the social control analysis there still remains a definite lack of fit between the theorising and 5</page><page sequence="6">what are rather familiar facts, the most obvious of which is that the majority of masks, certainly among the Dan and the Mende, have nothing to do with social control, certainly not in the sense intended by Horton and Siegmann. In the case of the Dan the most common type of mask is called deangle (lit., smiling mask- spirit) or sometimes bonagle (circumcision mask-spirit). The masks have poetical names such as "Come-and-look-at-me (for I am beautiful)" and they come out of the circumcision camp into the village to collect food from the women for the boys and men in the camp. The masks and the women joke with each other in a mild and unaggressive manner. Another kind of mask, like deangle in appearance but rather more elaborate is called tankagle. These are not only seen at initiations but are also invited to appear at public events where they entertain with dancing, mime and song. They have names such as "The-one-who- makes-me-happy" (Fischer 1978). The social control theory can hardly be made to apply to these masks, which are, after all, the great majority. But does it even apply to those masks which are indubitably associated with social control functions? Only one of the 11 or so kinds of masks identified by Fischer among the Dan is unambiguously concerned with social control, the glewa (big mask-spirit). Such masks control ceremonial activities and deal with disputes not covered by modern laws and regulations (1978:23), but they do so not by concealing or disguising those exercising authority but on the contrary by identifying precisely those who have legitimate power. In the four cases detailed by Harley (1950), it is obvious that ownership of the old and rare glewa reinforced and validated the authority of particular chiefs. In three of the four cases the masks were not even worn by the chiefs but were laid beside them (1950:13-17). The power of the chiefs rested in part on their possession of the masks while their subordinates were subordinate because they had no such masks. Ultimately these masks represent the legitimate power of the chiefs and therefore there can be no question of "concealment" or "disguise". Though this point may have escaped the notice of some anthropologists, the art historians had noted its significance. 6</page><page sequence="7">Frank Willett had observed of powerful Dan and Ngere masks that "the power of the mask ... depends on the social prestige of the owner" (1971:180). This evidence, while it entirely disposes of the Horton social control theory, is quite compatible with the remarks of the Dan elders themselves which Horton has quoted in support of his view. As I have pointed out elsewhere (Jedrej 1988), these remarks do not necessarily imply, as Horton seems to suggest, that the elders subscribe to some version of a Western liberal theory of objective impartial government by consent and are trying to achieve this end meanwhile by the use of masks. They are simply saying that they, the elders, use masked figures to maintain law and order. They are not saying that those enforcing social order are masked so that those upon whom the order is being imposed will thereby consent because everyone can more easily collude in the belief that the enforcement is being executed impartially in the general public interest than would be the case if the enforcing was executed by identifiable individuals. The same dichotomy of masks into a majority of popular entertainers and a relatively few great masks manifestly associated with chiefs and dominant groups is even more evidence among the Mende than among the Dan since among the latter there are numerous masks ranked to form an intermediate hierarchy. The most powerful and awesome masks are the gbini and goboi types and they are closely associated with the promulgation of new regulations and orders by chiefs. Alldridge's description of such an event is that of an eyewitness (1910:195-7). The relationship between such masks and rulers is at least as close as their links with the Poro secret society: as well as initiation ceremonies, they appear at the mortuary rites of chiefs who are the descendants of the first settlers of a locality but not at those of commoners who are generally regarded as subsequent immigrants. Of these two great masks, which are almost identical in appearance, the most powerful type, gbini is distinguished by the leopard skin as opposed to the antelope of goboi in its costume and, according to Mende, any leopard killed in the chiefdom must be given to the chief who is also 7</page><page sequence="8">himself sometimes referred to as "the leopard" (Abraham 1976:23). Only one gbini is allowed in a chiefdom and Mende will say in conversation that the ¬øbini is the paramount chiefs, it is referred to as "his gbini". More numerous than gbini and goboi are masked figures such a&amp;yavi andjobai. They are operated by small groups of young men and women and even by villages, sometimes under the patronage of a chief, but always as semi-commercial enterprises. They appear on request and for a fee at public festivals, initiation rites, wedding feasts, and the mortuary rites of ordinary people. Their costumes are finely made and the helmet masks are intricate and brilliantly colourful. They are judged to be beautiful and attractive by the people and are certainly not terrifying. They do not make judgements nor do they announce new laws (see also Siegmann and Perani 1976). These difficulties for the social control theory as presented by Horton and modified by Siegmann stem from an inadequate characterisation of the social context, a characterisation which is then supposed to account for the nature and function of mask institutions. The basic flaw in their analyses, at least to the extent that it is supposed to relate to societies of the Upper Guinea Coast, is that it fails to recognise the significance of social stratification as a characteristic feature of the social structure. This is a feature which Little (1951), D'Azevedo (1962), McCormack (1977) and Bledsoe (1980), among others, have identified in different parts of the Upper Guinea Coast. According to this analysis the basic structure of Upper Guinea Coast society, a pattern which persists to the present day and is still detectable throughout the region, consists of a series of lineages ranked according to distance from the founding ancestor. An individual's position in this series determines access to positions of authority, chiefships, titles, and land. The highest ranking lineages, those who control access to positions of authority, are in the main concerned with restricting their membership and excluding potential claimants. Instead such people, consanguineous kin and affines, by virtue of the power and authority of the lineage members become subordinated as clients and 8</page><page sequence="9">retainers. As Bledsoe has pointed out kinship and clientship are not mutually exclusive modes of social relationship in this cultural setting (1980:58). High ranking lineages insist, at least publicly, on strict patrilineal descent, patrilocal marriage and extravagantly high bridewealth for their sisters and daughters. At the same time members of high ranking lineages and especially chiefs are given brides by subordinates but the status of the children they bear is ambiguous because the bridewealth paid is a fraction of what a chief allegedly pays for the daughter of a member of another high ranking lineage. By contrast members of low ranking lineages are unable to subordinate others as clients and may be able to recruit personnel only by conceding full membership of the descent group, regardless of actual genealogical links, if any. In this situation, it is quite common for a man to accept an inferior position in another localised kin group as the husband of one of its women working off his debt to her kin by brideservice rather than the payment of bridewealth. In this account of the social organisation, the functional problem, to the solution of which the institutional complex of the mask contributes, is not conflict and factionalism among the lineages constituting the nucleated settlements. There is considerable rivalry among the powerful chiefly lineages but this was traditionally mediated by feasting and elaborate ceremonial gift exchange among the Dan and through the Poro society among the Mende, while among the low ranking lineages there is relatively less animosity simply because they have, in fact, materially little to quarrel about among themselves. The problem of social control is, from the point of view of the ruling lineages, how to maintain themselves as ruling lineages and that means maintaining the subordinate status of the low ranking lineages, clients and other commoners. Instead of a model of a society characterised by vertical cleavages which have to be countered by horizontal cross-cutting institutions (secret societies and masks), it is more accurate to picture a basic horizontal stratification which has to be sustained by the dominant ruling groups and mitigated by the subordinate groups. This is a view of the social context which not only makes more sense of the system of masks but is also one for which the masks, divided as they are into a few great 9</page><page sequence="10">masks intimately associated with the power and authority of chiefs and the numerous brilliant entertainers associated with the common people, provide concrete evidence. Moreover this version of the social control theory can be extended to include not only the former but also the latter. If the problem for the ruling groups is to reproduce and maintain themselves as ruling groups and to which end they deploy masks not only to control troublesome deviants but to represent their power and authority, then conversely the problem for the subordinated groups is one of mitigating their subordination, of resisting and of exercising control in a rather different sense. It seems plausible to suppose that they too will deploy masks but to serve their own interests. In this light, and with an insightful paper by Elizabeth Tonkin (1988) in mind, it is worthwhile briefly reviewing the nature and function of the demotic masking traditions. These masks and masquerades are marked by two outstanding features; deliberate breaches of social order, which sometimes probe the outer limits of tolerable conduct, combined with aesthetically pleasing and beautiful features not only as regards appearance but also movement and music. The former may be realised in several ways but the most usual is mime and satire where the targets will include other masks and frequently representatives of the powerful lineages and households. The satire can extend to dramatic sketches of historical and contemporary events and is, among the Dan, the characteristic performance of a kind of mask called bagle. Fischer and Himmelheber (1984:51-56) have described a case from the Dan where the performer who owned and worked the mask was a man of some considerable notoriety whose performances always drew large crowds from a wide area. Of course such masks will always be in a minority because the nature of the role makes demands which only a few personality types can meet. Among the popular masks of the Mende are found the same two features though in this case there seems to be a more pronounced tendency to associate a mask with one or other type of performance. So kongoli, a black 10</page><page sequence="11">anthropomorphic wooden mask, is described as extremely ugly and is a great lampooner of chiefs and other men of position and influence such as merchants and Muslim leaders. Masks such as jobai and yavi, on the other hand, are admired for their beauty of appearance and movement and their otherworldy lack of engagement in human affairs but they also thrill because they may, so it is said, suddenly metamorphose, as is the way of spirits, into something ugly and threatening which is, however, under the control of ordinary people, not the control of the chiefs. The position of the well known Sande or sowei mask of the women's society which institution is established among several cultures on the Upper Guinea Coast is rather more complicated. The Sande mask is perhaps the most ambivalent of all the Guinea Coast maskers. This is evident not only in the ritual symbolism of the masked figure but also in its material powers and functions.2 According to the major reports the masked figure punishes delinquent initiates and in that respect she functions in a manner comparable to the great masks associated with chiefs. However the mask also defends the rights of the women's society against the claims of men and she sits in judgement on men who are accused of violations of Sande prerogatives and regulations and she carries in her hand a whip. In this later mode the mask functions in a manner comparable to the masks of the popular Guinea Coast tradition in the complicated actualities of the relationship between dominant and subordinate groups. At the same time the women who control the Sande institution and its mask, by virtue of their position act as mediators or brokers in the arrangement of marriages between the daughters of men of less powerful lineages and chiefs and men of high ranking lineages.3 2. See Lamp (1985) for a detailed study of the mask and its symbolism among the Temne. For the Mende see Jedrej (1976). 3 For Temne, Mende, Kpelle, and Gola see, respectively, Lamp (1985), MacCormack (1975), Bledsoe (1980), and D'Azevedo (1980). 11</page><page sequence="12">The powerfully ambivalent combination of features of this particular popular cultural tradition of Upper Guinea Coast masks recalls that of the Zuni of North America where the numerous popular masked figures fall largely into two categories; the beautiful hacinas and the uncouth and obscene koyemci who entertain with satire and ridicule (Bunzel 1930:521, 952). A similar theme is evident in the bards and poets of pre-Islamic Arabia and of the pre-Christian Celts. In both traditions the bards were satirists and enchanters who composed beautiful songs of praise and awful songs of obloquy. The latter were held at one time to be so effective as to cause the death of the victim of the satire. The Celtic kings and Arabian chiefs and warriors patronised the bards not only to enhance their own prestige in poetic composition but also to direct their destructive powers against their enemies. According to myth and legend the blistering satire was no mere metaphor but had the power to physically blemish the victims. However, from time to time overbearing kings found that they were the victims of the satires of their own bards as well as being the target of the bards of rival kings. The essential ambivalence is explicit in the Celtic legends of ugly monsters with hidden poetic gifts who metamorphose into handsome heroes (Elliott 1960). The general conclusion is the rather obvious one that the success of the method of contextualisation as an approach to the comprehension of the development of an artefact depends on the availability of a valid account of the relevant social and cultural context. However, it is not so obviously the case that the available accounts are well founded and accorded general acceptance. To substantiate this view a particular example, Horton's account of the structure of a certain type of society in which masks and related institutions have been elaborated to meet the specific functional needs of such a society, was examined in some detail. It became clear that because Horton's analysis of the social structure was somewhat at odds with reality, at least with what is known of Upper Guinea Coast society, it followed that his contextualisation and account of the masks and related institutions, though fitting smoothly into the social structure as represented, was for that very reason also at odds with the ethnographic evidence. 12</page><page sequence="13">In other words a quite definite distortion of the nature and function of the masks as artefacts is introduced into the account, which is, of course, quite the opposite of what was intended. Finally, an alternative account of the social structure was sketched which made sense of the masks of the Upper Guinea Coast as they have been observed and reported not only by social anthropologists but also by art historians and students of material culture and in a way which illuminates how they share in dramatic features of very general occurrence.
