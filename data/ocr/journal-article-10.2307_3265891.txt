Yet the strength and contribution of the volume lies not in these, but in its reach for understanding. Christian theologians may be aided especially by the Jewish cast of the reflections. An English translation (with a better title) would be welcome. MARTIN J. Buss EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA, GA 30322 Die Reue Gottes: Aspekte alttestamentlicher Gottesvorstellung, by Jorg Jeremias. BSt 65. Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1975. Pp. 127. DM 14 (paper). Jeremias has produced a study of nhm when the root is used to express Yahweh's change of mind concerning his action toward men. The author challenges the widespread assumption that the biblical notion of God's changing his mind began in the naive anthropomorphic view of primitive folk culture. On the contrary, Jeremias argues, the concept originated in the self- conscious reflective processes of theological narrators. In the two earliest appearances of the concept (Gen 6; 1 Sam 15) God's nhm does not appear in the earlier stages of oral transmission but rather at the later period of theological refinement. In both passages God repents concerning a Heilsplan which had already been accomplished. His change of will is not a recurring divine attribute. On the contrary, in each instance Yahweh repents only once. Although men continue sinning after the flood, God never again changes his will as he did in the time of Noah. Nor does he repent that he had chosen David and his descendants as he did with Saul, though the former were certainly as sinful as the ill-fated Saul. These once-for-all-time examples of nhm, Jeremias argues, are the narrators' theological rationalization for singular events of punishment. Besides, in the case of 1 Sam 15, the biases of a theologian sympathetic to the Davidic dynasty lie behind the use of nhm. In contrast with these two earliest usages of the concept, the vast majority of the instances of Yahweh's nhm have to do with his possible change of will concerning afuture plan ofjudgment. This understanding of nhm developed and changed over the centuries, Jeremias contends. In Amos and Hosea nhm is a decision in which Yahweh alone determines whether he should alter his intended act of judgment. No appeal is made to Israel's merit or to Yahweh's obligations; nhm is rooted purely in Yahweh's inner desire to change his course of action. By the time Exod 32 emerges, however, Yahweh's change of mind is motivated by outside concerns such as his oath to the patriarchs. In the Deuteronomistic portions of Jeremiah matters external to Yahweh's mind take on still greater importance; Israel's repentance becomes a virtual guarantee that God will alter his intentions to punish. Indeed, from the exile on, the expectation of Yahweh's change of mind serves as a warning to motivate repentance. In the post-exilic books of Joel and Jonah the Deuteronomistic-Jeremianic connection between God's nhm and Israel's repentance is maintained, but with one major difference; Yahweh's change of willdoes not happen almost automatically when the people repent, but rather the hearers are told that perhaps Yahweh will alter his catastrophic plan. A review is necessarily selective, but the reader should be able to detect that Jeremias has given us a provocative treatment of a theologically significant biblical motif. No one interested in biblical theology will want to miss reading this book. ROY F. MELUGIN AUSTIN COLLEGE, SHERMAN, TX 75090</page></plain_text>
