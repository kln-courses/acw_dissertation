<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHAT CONSTITUTES A THING. W HILE reason must always believe in absolutism, yet it al- ways feels the impossibility of realizing absolutism, and thus finds a greater fruitfulness in the study of the purely finite thing. What is a thing? If this question equals, what sort of a thing is a thing, we are, of course, in confusion, since thing inter- preted by thing is unmeaning. In popular use a thing is what has a certain measure of continuance, as an insect is a thing, but not a flash of lightning. Yet it is plain that a being whose life is a minute fraction of a second would see that the lightning flash is as definite a thing as a hill or stone. Further, a being whose life was on the astronomical time scale would appreciate a man not as a thing, but as an evanescent earth phenomenon, like the lightning flash. If we were constituted on a radically different time and space scale, a new world of things would appear, and we should find as many worlds of things as time and space scales, that is, a practically indefinite number. To the eye of science a column of electrified air is as real a thing as an insect. All the actual in time and space is equally a thing, no matter how little or great the time or space it occupies. The popular definition of thing is then superficial, and must be re- pudiated by both physics and metaphysics. To physics the thing appears as individual-reactivity, and the more sensibly persistent the reactionsthe moreit isathing. If there were only a single mode and center of activity, there could be no things, but the external all would equal the thing. However, the actual, physical thing is an aspect of dynamic manifoldness in time and space, an individ- ual appearance in a universal determining and determined. There is then no ' it,' there is no thing, but thing is an appear- ance caused by our own s/a/us. A thing which is by its inertness, which is what acts, is for dynamistic science an anthropomorphic fiction. Activity is popularly supposed to be a mode of thing- ness, an act or acting, a something moving; but science shows that the appearance, say of that chair as thing, is really due to</page><page sequence="2">4I2 T HE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. my dynamic relatedness to an intense group of activities, so-called molecular and atomic. All things disappear except molecules and atoms, which are only hypothetical things, and which also in reality for physics disappear in their thingness and become mere activities. That is, the molecule designates only an apparition of atomic activity, and the atom is but the apparition of so much gravitative activity, etc. We have, then, to carry physics to its legitimate conclusion to see that everywhere and at all times activity is not a mode of thing, the thing acting, but that thing is an appearance of activity, an aspect of energy, a dynamic mani- festation.. Upon close inspection, then, we find a group of activities which by reason of their congruence and relation to our own activities we call things. Common knowledge erects gross things, but is sup- planted by science which resolves the gross things into minute subsensible things, which by their co-activity give the appearance of gross things. But as science does not ascribe any value to these minute things except in terms of force, of activity, the atom of iron being really only so much gravitative activity, heat activity, etc., it is plain that thing here plays no function, but only repre- sents a center of locality, size, form, and number. Thus the chair, which to my senses appears as a thing, is known as such only as an appearance in a certain place of multifarious and minute but in- tense activities. Now knowledge, which has so long dealt with things as the simple reality, is nonplussed when these vanish into pure activi- ties. Hence science in explaining a thing to common sense by co-activities has felt the need of making a thing the actor, as atom, a subsensible thing. But thereby it is merely blindly fol- lowing the instinct of vulgar knowledge, which it practically re- pudiates in reducing the things of common sense to appearance of activities. And thus thing, as atom-thing, for instance, re- mains a mere name, and is actual nonentity, for science uses only terms of activity as conveying the essence of the thing. That thing is an appearance of activity may then, at this day, be considered a true datum and suggestion from physics to meta- physics. It is further plain that a pure determinism means</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] WHAT CONSTITUTES A THING. 4I3 nihilism. The evidence of thing is reaction or response, but a complete determinism leaves no room for this. Thing entirely determinate is nothing. Reactive persistency and scope measure the thing. The usual grand division of things is into minds and bodies, which seem to interact, and yet from another point of view are quite disparate. This dualism is solved by the dynamic evo- lutionary point of view. We have already noted that objects of nature, as clods and stones, are the appearances of forces or ac- tivities viewed as external. But a great many natural objects are organic productions, and their thingness or objectivity is even more easily understood than in the case of the inorganic. In the latter case the rationale of thing is obscure, but in the former, thanks to evolutionism, we may perceive not merely its nature, but its rationale. What, for instance, is the finger but the mani- festation, the incorporate outcome of ages of psychic activity in the struggle for existence of intensest sensing, touching acts ? This thingness of the finger, its bodily reality, is appearance of the activity stored by many centuries of tentacular effort; it stands for the mode of inheritance. That I feel a burn by my finger, that I have the finger to feel by, is the appearance of psy- chic activity differentiated and integrated and inherited for thou- sands of generations. And so the human body in every part, and as a whole, is but experience storage made apparent. That is, the essence of organic things is always their function, this cre- ates and makes them, and not vice versa as is popularly sup- posed. I do not feel because I have a finger, but I have a finger because I and innumerable ancestors actively felt, and so instead of mere activity we have self-activity as producing thing. We see then the nature of the so-called action of body on mind. The mind is affected by the body only so far as the body is its body. The action is but an example of conservation of force and integration of activities, psychic activity correlated with external activities-natural forces-playing an old tune. That the mind is affected by the burnt finger really means that a long-established correspondence of the psychic group of activities is played over again. The mind does, indeed, depend upon the</page><page sequence="4">414 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. IX. finger just because it has made the finger, because the finger is its own factor; it is an aspect of itself. But let us consider another illustration of the meaning of body and mind, and that within the sphere of present growth. An athlete by severest effort doubles the size of a certain muscle. Now the affections which he gets from this muscle increment are plainly what he has put into it. This muscle is his own integrate activity, that is his individuality is his athletics, and he is not an athlete because he has muscle, but he has muscles because he is an athlete. To say that his muscle affects his mind is to say that he affects himself. The relation of body to mind merely means mind returning on itself. From the point of view of scientific evolution the dualism of mind and body is thus resolved. Mind is progressive activity in the struggle of existence storing itself, and the appearance of this storage is organism, the body, which is result and instrument of evolutionary activity. The great significance then of the current Darwinian theory of organic evolution is that activity, and that psychic, the struggle for existence, as volition-feeling, is made the essence of organism and life, and the body is but its expression and instrument. Also, through the science of physics we know that the actuality of inorganic things is activity, but the nature of this activity is not yet determined. But from both points of view it is clear that thing is not active, but activity is thing. We may add that from the psychological point of view the world of material things is but an interpretation from our self-made materiality. Thus materialism is but an abstraction from animism. If thing, organic and inorganic, is expression of individual systems of activity, so also is change. For in saying, ' a thing is changing' we mean that the thing, as system of activities, is being heterogeneously related to some other system; for example, as slower or faster, as when on board a train moving faster than another train on a parallel track we note change, but if moving in the same direction at the same pace no change is noted. A com- plete homogeneity of two systems of activities destroys change as appearance. Change is then fundamentally appearance of hetero- geneous relation of activities. An iron bar is a thing, as system of</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.1 WHA T CONSTITUTES A THING. 415 constant, inner, molecular, resistant activity to other systems of en- vironing activity, but when the melting-point of iron is reached we say that the bar is changed, that is, a new, intense system of activi- ties, as related to our own order of activities, is formed, which gives changed appearance. Change is then the reverse of thing, is thing in disappearance, but is dynamically interpretable in terms of relations of activities. It is our relativity as system of finite activities, related to other systems, that gives both change and thing as phenomena; and with every new time and space scale a new order of things and changes would appear. Thingness and changeability are then correlates from the mutual relations of systems of finite activities, and change and thing imply each other. We then conclude that physics points to the thing as temporal, spatial appearance of correlated activities, and evolutionary psy- chology points to the thingness of the body as the appearance of correlated psychical activities, and that to say that a thing changes, means a minor breaking up of the associated activities which con- stitute the thing, the larger sensual features of activity being the same, particularly unity of place. Change in general must be ac- counted the appearance of activity in general. The suggestion of science to philosophy is that the totality of things in time and space are appearances of a dynamism physical and psychical, an activity which in part is mere energy, whose determining quality is yet un- analyzed, but in part is the will effort of the struggle of existence in organisms.'
