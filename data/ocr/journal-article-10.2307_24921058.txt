During the Late Post-classic period, the resin was transported to Tenochtitlan where it was transformed into different objects such as  bars, spheres, conglomerates, bases of sacrificial knives, anthropomorphic figurines and diverse amorphous fragments. The macroscopic  and microscopic study of more than 300 copal objects from the offerings of the Great Temple archaeological zone (Templo Mayor)  permitted the establishment of a methodology in the manufacturing processes of several formal groups, which were then corroborated  by Computerized Axial Tomography, more commonly known by its abbreviated names, CT scan or CAT scan. This radiological tech- nique, created for the study of living human organisms, is very effective in archaeological applications, since it is not invasive but still  allows observation of the surface of an object as well as its interior by means of virtual slices. Additionally, it allows the detection of  different densities of the components of the object, making it possible to know the composition of different materials. Keywords: Resin, copal, archaeological objects, mexica, Great Temple of Tenochtitlan, Late Post-classical period, computerized  axial tomography (CAT). Resumen Desde la época prehispánica el copal (resina de Bursera bipinnata) ha sido utilizado para diferentes fines y contextos, desde uno  medicinal hasta uno ritual o religioso, lo que ha promovido su transportación desde el actual estado de Guerrero hacia Morelos, Puebla  y la misma ciudad de México, tal como ha sido verificado por los estudios etnográficos realizados en estos lugares.  Así, para el Posclásico tardío, como ha sido comprobado etnográficamente, la resina era llevada a Tenochtitlan donde la  transformaban en diferentes objetos como barras, esferas, conglomerados, bases de cuchillos de sacrificio, figurillas antropomorfas  y fragmentos diversos amorfos. Gracias al estudio macroscópico y microscópico de más de 300 objetos de copal provenientes de las  ofrendas de la zona arqueológica del Templo Mayor, se pudo establecer una constante en los procesos de manufactura de cada grupo  formal, siendo sometida dicha observación a una corroboración mediante análisis tales como la Tomografía Axial Computarizada  (TAC). Esta es una técnica de principio radiológico creada para el estudio del organismo humano vivo, más se ha descubierto que  este tipo de estudio es muy efectivo en la aplicación arqueológica, ya que es una técnica no invasiva que permite observar no sólo  la superficie del objeto, sino su interior mediante cortes virtuales, además de detectar las densidades de los elementos inmersos del  mismo, es decir, establecer diferentes materiales que le componen.
