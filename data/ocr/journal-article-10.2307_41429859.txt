<plain_text><page sequence="1">D'AUBIGNÉ'S LES TRAGIQUES : DIVINE TRAGEDY D'Aubigné scholars have perpetuated the notion that the many references to " tragédie " and " tragique " in Les Tragiques are unrelated to any generic concept of tragedy. Preoccupied with the biographical and historical aspects of the poem, nineteenth-century literary historians either neglected - like Lanson and Tilley - to face the questions raised by the presence of these references in an epic context, or offered - like Faguet - a vague suggestion that the work contains certain " vers de tragédie ". More recent critics have been concerned with the artistic unity of the epic poem, and appear, for the sake of that unity, to have ruled out the possibility of a fusion of the epic and tragic genres. The consensus, as expressed by Henry Sauerwein, is that within the context of the poem, " tragédie " and " tragique " are descriptive terms which refer to situations of misery, suffering, and bloody hardship in the civil and religious conflict x. Henri Weber denies any resemblance between the progression of the action of Les Tragiques and what he calls the " récit dramatique " of tragedy 2. For the modern critic then, as well as for his nineteenth- century predecessors, Les Tragiques bears little or no relationship to dramatic tragedy. Such interpretations, however, do not satisfactorily explain the prominence of so many terms related to tragedy as a dramatic genre. D'Aubigné's opening invocation is not to the epic muse but to Mel- pomene, the muse of tragedy (I, 79) 3. He indicates that the cothurnus - the high boot worn by the actors in Greek tragedy - is appropriate to his subject (I, 78). We learn that on the " triste eschaffaut " - the stage where the action takes place - the role of death will be played by death herself (I, 76) 4. The poet addresses his contemporaries in these terms : " Voyez la tragedie, abbaissez vos courages / Vous n'estes spectateurs, vous estes personnages " (I, 169-70). The very 1 H.

An analysis of " tragédie " and " tragique " within the thematic and structural framework of the poem, and against the background of 16th-century notions of tragedy, suggests the need for revising the traditional view. The literary tenor of the closing decades of the 16th century did not dictate a clearly defined concept of tragedy, nor did it uniformly require the separation of the tragic and epic genres. D'Aubigné was thus free to assume his personal poetic stance, drawing upon the differing views offered him by the heirs of the medieval tradition, the partisans of Greek and Latin literature, the students of Aristotle and the Protestant tragedians. Guided by the exigencies of his subject and his own inclination, he was eclectic in his choice. Although he turned for the most part from the literary notions of Ronsard and the Pléiade (whose import is evident in his " Printemps ") to the medieval tradition they disdained, his humanist's appreciation of the literature of antiquity continued unabated and the influence of Greek tragedy and of Aristotle as seen through the eyes of Jean de la Taille is manifest in Les Tragiques 1. D'Aubigné's vision of the contemporary world represented a spectacle which he evidently felt was most appropriate to presentation as tragedy. Yet the universal drama which he saw taking place between God and Satan, the Protestant and Catholic Churches, was inconsistent with the Pléiade' s concept of tragedy, which insisted on verisimilitude and the consequent rejection of allegory. Peletier's implication that tragedy is a dramatic form likewise appears to have precluded any fusion of tragedy with the epic, although the latter genre was compatible with the temporal and spatial dimension of the action of Les Tragiques and with the presence of the marvelous. Scaligeri views created the same impasse, for while allowing Gods to people the epic ( Poetices Libri Septem , III, 96), they limited tragedy to drama - a play in which characters act and gesture on a stage (I, 3). The medieval tradition, based on the Latin grammarians Dio- medes and Donatus and perpetuated in the Renaissance by such writers as Guillaume Bouchetel, Lazare de Baïf and Thomas Sébillet, did not, however, include a dramatic requirement in its definition of tragedy 2. Although Diomedes had differentiated between dramatic and narrative poetry, and although he had spoken of " tragica " and " comica " as dramatic genres of the Greeks, he had not included 1 For influence of Ronsard and Pléiade on d'Aubigné cf.

Lanson " L'Idée de la tragédie en France avant Jodelle " RHL , 11, 1904, pp. 541-585, for the influence of the medieval tradition in the Renaissance, including its effect on those who, like Peletier and Scaliger, rejected it outright.</page><page sequence="3">54 R. L. REGOSIN this dramatic element in his definition of the genres. In medieval dictionaries neither tragedy nor comedy is defined asa" dramaticum genus ", a fact that elucidates the strange confusion in the Middle Ages between epic poems and comedies г. D'Aubigné appears to have acknowledged this absence of generic distinction by basing Les Tragiques on the overlap between tragic and epic structure and content, thus achieving a form suited to the nature of his subject. The medieval heritage also justifies calling Les Tragiques a tragedy. Although the traditional fatal dénouement is missing, the inclusion of any of the other distinguishing characteristics - historical subject of bloody horror, illustrious characters, nobility of style - suf- ficed to make the work a tragedy 2. D'Aubigné's subject required a felicitous ending to the action, and here, for precedent, the poet might have turned to the current vogue of the tragi-comedy, to Scaligeri or la Taille's reading of Aristotle or to Protestant tragedies like those of Bèze or Rivaudeau 3. Certain parallels between Jean de la Taille's Art de la tragédie (1572) and Les Tragiques (and others which will be established at a later point in this paper) imply that la Taille's interpretation of Aristotle, more than any other single work, influenced the content, structure and purpose of the poem. The historical proximity of the two works - the Art de la tragédie was published five years before the inception of Les Tragiques - and the common religious, social, political and literary background which the two Protestant soldier-poets shared make this influence even more likely. Unlike most of their contemporaries, both poets propose the affective reaction of the audience as the purpose of their tragedies ; in both, as well, the disposition of the action fulfills this purpose and defines the structure of the work. As in Aristotle, change in fortune is a more significant affective element than the simple destruction of the hero. La Taille states his concept in these terms : Or c'est le principal point d'une Tragédie de la sçavoir bien dis- poser, bien bastir, et la déduire de sorte qu'elle change, transforme, manie et tourne l'esprit des escoutans de ça de là, et faire qu'ils voyent maintenant une joye tournée tout soudain en tristesse, et maintenant au rebours, à l'exemple des choses humaines 4. 1 E. Kern, The Influence of Heinsius and Vossius upon French Dramatic Theoru (1949), p. 21. 2 Lanson, op. cit., p. 554. 3 Henry Lancaster points out in The French Tragi-Comedy (1907) that the happy dénouement was the chief characteristic of the popular 16th-centuiy tragi-comedy. " During the sixteenth century, the name could be applied to any play of medieval origin which possessed a happy dénouement and a form that was at least partially classic." (p. xxiv). As the idea that the felicitous outcome was consistent with tragedy became established in France, the tragi-comedy began to decline, and practically ceased to exist after 1657. 4 Jean de La Taille, Art de la tragédie , ed. F. West (1939), p. 26-27.</page><page sequence="4">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 55 The dramatic action of Les Tragiques fulfills these requirements. In the course of the action France and the Protestant Church experience a change of fortune from misery to happiness while the Catholics undergo the opposite peripeteia. As the poet moves between the terrestrial and celestial perspectives, individuals or groups of individuals are brought low or raised to the heavenly heights. The spectator is faced with constant movement and change to which he responds with a variety of emotional reactions. In fact, all the possible subjects which la Taille suggests as proper for tragedy play a major role in the poem : the fall of great heroes, the vicissitudes of fortune, wars, plagues, and the cruelty of tyrants. Finally, the struc- ture of Les Tragiques is defined by action : the action which is the revolt of Satan and the iniquitous against Heaven ; the action of persecution ; that of the resistance of God and the Huguenots ; and most important, the action initiated by the poet himself as he becomes a participant. Although it is possible that d'Aubigné had direct access to one of the texts of Aristotle's Poetics published in France during the middle decades of the 16th century, such evidence makes it more likely that he knew the Greek master through la Taille' s Art de la tragédie 1. But d'Aubigné did not slavishly imitate la Taille. Rather he appears to have dismissed those elements which did not conform to the nature of his subject : the implication that tragedy is dramatic, the role of the chorus, the requirement of verisimilitude. At the same time, his understanding of the nature of Greek tragedy went beyond what he might have learned from la Taille. D'Aubigné's appreciation of the role of pride and the ambiguous position of the tragic hero who is at once guilty and innocent, responsible agent and victim, suggests that he had studied the Greek texts of Sophocles and Euripides carefully. His presentation of supernatural characters was consistent with ancient tragedy which, as drama, did bring in gods and the marvelous. D'Aubigné's success in integrating Biblical subject matter into classical form resulted in part from an awareness of the earlier attempts of certain Protestant tragedians to bring together the material of the Bible and the form of tragedy. From Théodore de Bèze's Abraham sacrifiant (1555) d'Aubigné would have learned the necessity of subordinating considerations of form to the requirements of the didactic and propagandist purpose of his work. Bèze's desire to portray the faith of God's Elect and to assure His children of the Lord's grace determined the choice of characters, the nature of the action, and the resulting felicitous dénouement. Perhaps a more 1 For the editions of the Poetics in France during the 16th century cf. Spingarn, Literary Criticism in the Renaissance (1899), pp. 183-85.</page><page sequence="5">56 R. L. REGOSIN striking lesson would have been André de Rivaudeau's Aman (1565). His attempt to preserve the integrity of both classical form and Biblical content led Rivaudeau to a clouding of both the preceptive purpose demanded by the religious aspect and the aesthetic function of the tragic elements. From a classical point of view Aman approxi- mates the tragic hero who in his pride challenges God and undergoes a reversal of fortune in which he loses his life. From the didactic perspective the long suffering, faithful Hebrews are the heroes and Aman remains the totally bad villain. D'Aubigné avoided the pitfalls of Aman by choosing a religious subject which according to la Taille's theory and practice was proper for presentation as tragedy. While adhering to the view of tragedy which allows a fortunate ending, he was able to approximate the nature and action of the Greek tragic hero in his own attempt to examine the relationship of man to God, fusing the vital non-dramatic aspects of ancient tragedy with his religious material and the didactic and affective purpose of his poem. I. Prologue to tragedy The opening verses of " Misères ", which describe the subject matter of the poem, introduce aspects of tragedy even before the expression " tragédie " appears : Ici le sang n'est feint, le meurtre n'y défaut, La mort joue elle-mesme en ce triste eschaffaut, Le Juge criminel tourne et emplit son urne. D'ici la botte en jambe, et non pas le cothurne, J'appelle Melpomene en sa vive fureur... (I, 75-79) Within the context of an epic, d'Aubigné intends a drama - action on a stage with roles and characters - to take place. The invocation to Melpomene and the mention of the cothurnus, to which I have alluded, indicate that the dramatic action will be a tragedy. This is reinforced by the poetic richness of " eschaffaut ", which in this framework juxtaposes the meanings of stage where the scene takes place and death scaffold: the play will present subject matter characterized by blood and murder, and death herself will be one of the principal characters. The events of Les Tragiques , unlike the love poetry the poet had been writing to this time, do not represent a world of fiction drawn from the imagination of the artist : the blood is real blood, the murdered really die, and death plays herself. The exterior world inhabits the realm of art. The muse, who is a poetic, metaphorical figure, here arises wildly out of the real wars raging about her, " eschevelée, affreuse, et bramant " (I, 82). The poet sees her as awakening out of " tombeaux " which he grimly describes</page><page sequence="6">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 57 as " rafraischis " - or dug up again to receive the swarming new victims, and, one readily gathers at the same time, stirred up again by the poet in order to conjure up the gruesome spectacle. " Misères " serves as a narrative exposé of the tragedy as it has progressed to the present. It sets the stage on which the drama is being played, presents the principal characters, and defines the nature of the tragic action. It covers those acts of the play which represent the complication of the tragic plot and carries the action to the point where the actual dramatic tragedy contained in Les Tragiques begins. The " tragedy " in the poem is then the dénoue- ment of the events whose progression has been recorded in the his- torical narrative of this first book. The epic form allows the poet to integrate this background matter into the body of the work itself. The poet evokes the muse of tragedy and her words introduce France as the first significant tragic character : О France desolee ! ô terre sanguinaire, Non pas terre mais cendre ! ô mere, si c'est mere Que trahir ses enfans aux douceurs de son sein Et quand on les meurtrit les serrer de sa main ! (I, 89-92) This portrait accuses France, the mother, of being responsible for the deaths of her two sons, the Catholic and Protestant parties. But the " terre sanguinaire " is also a " France desolee ", and versions of the same metaphor reproach the children for the murder of their mother. After the muse has expressed the one possibility : " ô mere ! si c'est mere / Que trahir ses enfans...", the poet probes further, and chooses to stress also the other possibility or truth : " Je veux peindre la France une mere afíligee " (I, 97). As the poet employs various images to describe the condition of France, he maintains this ambi- guity between her role as victim and that of responsible party. When she is depicted as the giant who turns against itself, she is guilty of her own demise, for she becomes a victim of her own great- ness (I, 133-62). Yet, as the helpless mother murdered by marauding soldiers, she is the innocent victim : " ce corps séché, retraict / De la France qui meurt " (I, 423-24). France is the sufferer again when as a ship she sinks because of the two warring parties on board (1, 179-90). Later, as an arrogant, haughty nation, her pride causes her destruc- tion (I, 683-88). This presentation of France as innocent victim and responsible party arises from the nature of the concept of " Motherland ". The nation is first the sum of its parts and France as a whole must bear the burden of guilt for the actions of each of the warring factions. When the poet decries haughty pride, although the context of his reproach indicates that he is addressing the Catholic nobles (I, 693-95),</page><page sequence="7">58 R. L. REGOSIN he reprimands France, the nation : " France, tu ťeslevois orgueil- leuse " (I, 683). At the same time France is an independent entity, distinct from her component parts. In this aspect she appears as helpless victim of those parts : as mother to the sons who murder her ; as ship destroyed by its occupants. This presentation of France as both victimizer and victim captures the ambiguous position which the tragic hero occupied in Greek tragedy, touching both innocence and guilt. The image of France as giant extends the notion of responsible victim by introducing the concept of hubris : Je pense encores voir un monstrueux géant, Qui va de braves mots les hauts cieux outrageant, Superbe, florissant, si brave qu'il ne treuve Nul qui de sa valeur entreprenne la preuve. (I, 135-38) The giant's invincible force, which no one dares challenge, has made it a " superbe ", haughty power. The very nature of its being causes its downfall, for when the giant does not encounter an opponent against whom to unleash its strength, this destructive force turns inward against itself : " Son corps est combattu, à soi-mesme contraire " (I, 141). The theme of subversive pride as the hamartia of France becomes explicit when the poet rebukes France as " orgueil- leuse " (I, 683) and states that her greatness is the cause of her destruction : Tu as plus que jamais de merveilleuses testes, Des cerveaux transcendans, de vrais et faux prophetes : Toi, prophete, en mourant du mal de ta grandeur Mieux que le medecin tu chantes ton mal-heur. (I, 637-40) Thus France as " la patrie " is responsible for her approaching demise, and yet each of the two warring factions must share the guilt individually (I, 101-102 ; 113, 116). The poet also implies that the civil wars, and consequently the destruction of France, are God's responsibility since He uses them to punish the stiff-necked nation. Here then, as in Greek tragedy, there exists the impenetrable realm of mysterious forces which punish man's sinful attempts to rise above the human condition. In the ancient context they were called the gods, Destiny or Fortune ; within this Christian framework that power is God. Greek tragedy is characterized by the complex relation- ship between a sense of determinism for which the gods must be held accountable and the freedom of the hero which makes him bear the major burden of responsibility for his fate. So in Les Tragiques , France, as proud subject and innocent victim, shares some of her</page><page sequence="8">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 59 responsibility with the Galvinist God of predestination, a relationship which reflects the mystery of grace and free will. This dual role of victimizer and victim lies at the heart of the tragic action as expressed in " Misères ". From the first image of France as mother, where the fatal blows are struck from within, self-destruction is the dominant theme. The giant, as the symbol of France, is called the " meurtrier de soi-mesme " (I, 136) and the struggle of the two warring factions is described in similar terms : En cela le vainqueur ne demeurant plus fort, Que de voir son haineux le premier à la mort, Qu'il seconde, autochire, aussi tost de la sienne, Vainqueur, comme Ton peut vaincre à la Gadmeenne. (I, 187-90) The victor, who himself has been mortally wounded in the combat, lives only long enough to see his hated victim expire ; his own death follows immediately. The men born from the teeth of the dragon slain by Cadmus killed each other off and thus, in effect, murdered their brothers. By entering the battle, each combattant is responsible for killing his brother - another himself - as well as for directly causing his own death. Jean de la Taille speaks of the weapons of civil war as " teinctes en nostre propre sang ", stained with the blood of one's own kin, or as the richness of poetic language allows, stained with one's own blood 1. The theme of " meurtrier de soi-mesme " then lies at the heart of civil conflict, and reinforced in this passage by the use of " autochire it now begins to emerge as the center of the tragic action. This interpretation is first implied by the words of the muse and is explicitly stated when the poet refers to the suicide of the giant as " la tragedie horrible " (I, 133). This association of civil war, suicide, and dramatic tragedy was also made by Jean de la Taille, and confirms the impression that d'Aubigné knew his work well. The opening paragraph of the Art de la tragédie, the dedication to Henriette de Cleves, characterizes the " piteux desastres " and " la mort... si pitoyable " caused by the civil wars as subject matter proper for tragedy. Later la Taille refers explicitly to the civil wars as " les piteuses et sanglantes tragedies... jouées sur l'eschaffaut de France ", describing the action in terms of suicide : " où les uns et les autres avons porté les armes teinctes en nostre propre sang 2." Finally, to complete the relationship, la Taille considers suicide a fitting subject for tragedy, for by its very nature it moves the listener and thus fulfills tragedy's goal of " esmou- voir ". All this, it would seem, is parallel and related to an inter- pretation of tragedy in Les Tragiques. 1 La Taille, " Dédication ** to Jacques de la Taille's Datre , in B. Weinberg, Critical Prefaces of the French Renaissance (1950), p. 234. 2 Ibid., p. 234.</page><page sequence="9">60 R. L. REGOSIN The presentation of the tragic action in terms of family con- flict - brother against brother, sons against their mother - recalls the type of situation Aristotle considered most capable of producing pity and fear, for it was based on the special horror with which the 4th-century Athenian considered the spilling of kindred blood and the moral stain he attached to it г. The occurrence of the tragic deed within the family intensifies the affective reaction of the spectator because the hero, blinded by pride, rage, or ignorance, destroys that which he loves, or that to which he is inherently bound. Or, if the deed is perpetrated consciously, in spite of family ties, then the willful perversion of the deepest natural human relationship, the denial of the most basic sentiment of the human condition, inspires the strongest feeling of fear and horror. This is not to imply that d'Aubigné knew the Poetics directly, for it was common to speak of the civil war in terms of intra-family strife. Both Ronsard in his Discours des Misères de ce temps and J. Béreau in his Complainte de France sur la guerre civile use this image, and Montaigne employs the same language to describe the wars in " De la physionomie ". The essayist characterizes the conflict in terms of self-destruction reminiscent of the image of the giant ; he also speaks of the civil strife as " haines parricides " and as the dismemberment of " sa mère " 2. He sees himself as a spectator to the dramatic representa- tion of suicide which, because it evokes his " desplaisir " as well as his " plaisir ", he likens to the experience of tragedy 3. Like la Taille, and like d'Aubigné, Montaigne has felt an inherent relationship among civil war, suicide, and dramatic tragedy. The tragedy of France has relentlessly followed its fatal course toward the destruction of the hero because of the unwillingness of certain elements to see and to act. The poet does not specifically characterize France as blind, but as the victim of pride which has concealed the true nature of her self and her action ; it is evident that blindness is one of her distinctive faults. Like the proud Oedipus, she is ironically working toward her own destruction. More specifi- cally, however, France is blind because so many of her leaders and citizens are blind. The poet reproaches the judges and bankers who in their pride oppress the weak and the poor, failing to recognize the tragedy in which they have been taking part. Blind to reality, they have stood as spectators as if removed from the context of the dra- matic action. The poet's cry is " See I wake up from your blindness, realize that you too are embarked on this ship which is sinking " : 1 G. Else, Aristotle's Poetics : The Argument (1957), pp. 421-52. * Montaigne, Les Essais , ed. Villey (1923), III, 12, p. 346. 8 Ibid., p. 353.</page><page sequence="10">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 61 Car encore vous pourriez contempler de bien loin Une nef sans pouvoir luy aider... Mais quand, dedans la mer, la mer pareillement Vous menace de mort, courez à la tempeste, Car avec le vaisseau vostre ruine est preste. (I, 171-79) D'Aubigné here comes close to the modem reading of Aristotle that in tragedy the spectator is to identify with the tragic character, for on this feeling for one " like himself " depends his experience of fear and pity l. This was not a notion discussed in the 16th-century theories of tragedy and it is interesting that d'Aubigné in his own way arrived at it himself. The poet's own response to the suffering of the tragic hero - his realization of the tragedy in which he too is involved - is the composition of Les Tragiques . II. The Poet and Tragedy Until the present time, the poet has been among those who ignored the civil strife threatening the very existence of France : Quand j'estois fol heureux, si cet heur est folie De rire ayant sur soi sa maison demolie, Si c'est heur d'appliquer son fol entendement Au doux laissant l'utile, estre sans sentiment, Lepreux de la cervelle, et rire des miseres Qui accablent le col du païs et des freres, Je fleurissois comm' eux de ces mesmes propos, Quand par l'oisiveté je perdois le repos. (II, 69-76) Now he reproaches himself for having written love poetry, characteriz- ing his mind as diseased - " lepreux de la cervelle " - for giving himself to the " doux ", to what he considered happiness. Unaware of his own situation, " sans sentiment ", and thus blind to the world about him, he turned his back on the suffering and misery of his " brothers " and laughed and played in its presence. The repetition of " fol " and " folie " emphasizes the false nature of his " heur ", expressing perhaps a sense of the etymological relationship of " fol " to " follis " (a puffed up bag or balloon, a swollen void). Like the bankers and judges, he has remained outside the action, an unmoved spectator to tragedy. Now the poet turns from his " oisiveté " and useless poetry. Inspired by God to see truth and no longer afraid of the consequences of what he might say, he recognizes the real nature of the world in which he lives and accepts the role he must play (II, 43-44). He acknowledges the light of truth which he refused 1 Else, op. cit., p. 436.</page><page sequence="11">62 R. L. REGOSIN to see before : " combien de fois feraiee / Ai-je à la vérité la lumière allumee " (II, 21-22). The opening verses of Les Tragiques promise forceful personal action as the poet sets out to " s'attacque(r) aux legions de Rome / Aux monstres d'Italie " (I, 1-2). He scoffs at the caution, fear and doubt which made Caesar hesitate at the Rubicon and compares himself to Hannibal, " qui... se fendit un passage aux Alpes embra- sez " (I, 4) : he too is going to " brise(r) les rochers " (I, 7) and " (faire) breche au lieu de porte " (I, 6). The poet's task will be the " délivrance " (I, 15) of the captive Church and he calls upon God to " fendre " (I, 36) the hardened hearts of those who refuse His word. Yet this promise of action is not fulfilled in " Misères " ; the verbs which characterize the poet's role in this first book are the more passive ones of depicting, portraying. He speaks of his subject matter as " le general discours de mon tableau public " (I, 367) ; as a " portraict... de la France " (I, 424) ; as the " tableau de l'Eglise " (I, 341). In itself this descriptive narrative of the tragic state of affairs in France represents the first significant act of the poet after becoming aware of the truth. No longer an oblivious onlooker, but an interested spectator, profoundly concerned with the future course of the tragedy, he has sought to recapitulate the past events of which he has been unaware, to understand their import, and to situate them in relation to himself and the reader before attempting vigorous and meaningful action. From the opening verses of " Princes the poet has assumed a new function. With the shafts of " la vive lumiere " as his weapon, he is going to " crever... l'enflé Pithon " (II, 2), " percer... les pestes et les roignes " (II, 5), " ouvrir les fonds hideux " (II, 6). The tyrannical giant of evil who is his enemy will be slain by the sling of truth, with the poem as its stone : L'ennemi mourra donc, puisque la peur est morte. Le temps a creü le mal ; je viens en cette sorte, Croissant avec le temps de style, de fureur, D'aage, de volonté, d'entreprise et de cœur ; Car d'autant que le monde est roide en sa malice, Je deviens roide aussi pour guerroyer le vice. (II, 49-54) The attack on the legions of Rome and the monsters of Italy in the battle to free the captive Church has evidently begun, for the poet has moved from spectator to participant in the action : La main peut s'endormir, non l'ame reposer, Et voir en mesme temps nostre mere hardie Sur ses costez jouër si dure tragedie, Proche à sa catastrophe, où tant d'actes passez, Me font frapper des mains et dire : c'est assez ! (II, 80-84)</page><page sequence="12">d'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 63 He now realizes that so many acts of the tragedy have already passed that the catastrophe, the fatal climax is near. The active hand might not take part in the struggle, but once the true nature of the times has been discovered, the sensitive, cognitive " âme " can no longer turn from reality. The poet here indicates that he is going to combine the two actions. By clapping his hands and shouting " enough " he arrests the movement of the tragic course of events and moves into the action as a lucid, physically active character whose efforts will strive to effect a reversal of fortune which results in the salvation of " nostre mere hardie ". The tragic prologue has ended and the actual dramatic tragedy of Les Tragiques has begun : the poet has become actor, the reader has become spectator, and the tragic action now begins to unfold before our very eyes. III. The tragedy of " Les Tragiques " The image of " nostre mere hardie " supports the designation of France, the mother, as the tragic hero of the narrative prologue of " Misères ". Yet the opening verses of the poem promised the deliverance of the Protestant Church. The portrait of " la mi-morte France " (I, 885) presented in the first thousand or so lines of " Misères " is, in fact, paralleled by the " tableau de l'Eglise " (I, 1341), with which the first book ends. Like the situation of France in the tragedy of the civil wars, the position of the Church is charac- terized by a reversal of natural order: the enemies of God, rather than His people, reign supreme on earth 1. The focus changes from a lament on the death of France to the destruction of the true Pro- testant Church ; the same events which are first viewed in social and political terms are now interpreted with regard to the religious conflict between Protestants and Catholics. The prayer with which " Misères " ends is a Protestant supplication to God for vengeance, and the " misères " of which it speaks are those of the persecuted Huguenots : " Soyent tes yeux adoucis à guérir nos miseres " (I, 1353). This shift from the social and political to the religious is carried through the image of " mère ". The analogous presentation of the two portraits would suggest this although the Church is not spe- cifically referred to as a mother. In this same prayer, it is pictured as a woman in chains : " les fers aux pieds, sur les geennes assise, / A sa gorge la corde et le fer inhumain " (I, 1342-43). She too is innocent, yet guilty of pride, and certainly under the altar of the idols where the poet sees her " visage meurtri " (I, 14), she appears " proche à sa catastrophe ". Thus the " mere hardie " whom the poet will 1 D'Aubigné characterizes the situation caused by the civil war as a " monde à l'envers ". Misères, I, 235. Cf. H.

The tragedy of France becomes an integral part of the greater struggle in which the Protestant Church is engaged. The theme of national disorder moves into the background, to appear from time to time throughout the work. It has served its primary purpose by providing the frame- work against which the situation of the Church has emerged as tragedy. The antagonists in the terrestrial realm of the drama are the Catholic princes and judges against whom the poet sustains his attack through " Princes " and " Chambre Dorée " ; they are directly and immediately responsible for the massacre of the Protestants and the destruction of the Church. In both cases they have reacted to the horror and carnage of the situation they have created by blinding themselves to this reality : Deschaussons le cothurne et rions, car il faut Jetter ce sang tout frais hors de nostre eschaffaut, En prodiguant dessus mille fleurs espanchees, Pour cacher nostre meurtre à l'ombre des jonchees. (II, 211-14) On the stage of France where the tragedy is being played out, the kings desire to remove the cothurni they wear to end the drama, not as the poet has done by recognizing and attempting actively to change things, but by avoiding truth. They are going to conceal the blood of their murdered victims by bedecking the stage-death scaffold with flowers, and by replacing the tragedy with comedy, escaping through farces and games : " Quand ce siecle n'est rien qu'une histoire tragique, / Ce sont farces et jeux toutes leurs actions " (II, 206-207). But real tragedy, where " la mort jouë elle mesme ", does not end when the antagonists take off the buskins. The events portrayed on the stage have taken place and the flowers must wither and die, revealing once again the tragic posture of the Church. The guilt of these active persecutors is shared through complicity by all Catholics who are a party to these deeds. Scenes of massacre described by autos-da-fe in Spain present the tragedy of the Church in Europe in microcosmic form : L'Europe se monstra : Dieu vid sa contenance Fumeuse par les feux esmeus sur l'innocence, Yid les publiques lieux, les palais les plus beaux, Pleins de peuples bruyans, qui pour les jeux nouveaux, Estaloyent à la mort les plus entieres vies En spectacles plaisans et feintes tragedies... ... Là de mesme maniere Qu'aux theatres on vid s'eschauffer les Romains, Ce peuple desbauché applaudissoit des mains. (III, 613-24)</page><page sequence="14">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 65 The very setting reveals the dramatic nature of the tragic scene, reinforcing an earlier reference to the platform containing the victims as " eschaffaut " (III, 545). These innocent victims are the pro- tagonists in this " spectacle ", with the executioners - Catholic priests and royalty - as the antagonists. In the presence of these deaths being played out before their very eyes, the zealous Catholics, animated by " faux zele d'erreur ", sit as spectators. They signify their approval by their heated applause and thus become accomplices to the crime. Like their spiritual and political leaders, they remain blind to the tragedy. What they see is a " spectacle plaisan ", a " jeu nouveau ", similar to a farce, a ballet, or a comedy which diverts and amuses. The " tragedies " are " feintes ", unreal or played, because not seen as tragedy. The spectators have hardened their hearts (III, 619) and cannot be affected with the emotional response proper to tragedy. They cheer the " heretics " destruction, remaining cold, distant, and unmoved by what they see. The truth is, the poet reveals, that these Catholics, have them- selves revolted against God (II, 457-58). The title originally given to " Chambre Dorée ", where scenes like the auto-da-fé abound, was " Ubris ", but d'Aubigné made the change, as he says, " aimant mieux que tout parlast françois " К The chariot of Themis - the goddess of justice - is depicted as rolling over the bodies of the iniquitous, " Des monstres avortez par l'infidelle Ubris " (III, 892). The Catholics are guilty of insolent pride, engendered by Até, divine malediction. Like the Pope in " Misères " (1235-44), they do not seek to fulfill God's will but desire to impose their own plan on the world's destiny. Blindly they exceed the limits imposed on them by the human condition and thus unwittingly pursue their own destruction. This description of the downfall of the Catholics, and the implication that their crimes result in part from a divine curse, suggest that they, as tragic antagonists, become the real tragic victims once the course of the action has been changed. This judg- ment must be reserved until the end of the drama, for here the poet manifests no sympathy for them as victims, vilifying them as canni- bals, serpents, and butchers. The allegorical vices which inhabit the Palais de Justice personify the evils which possess them, pre- venting any spectator from experiencing pity. The victims in this drama remain the Protestant martyrs, for the poet characterizes their deaths as tragedies (III, 582). The murder of each innocent Huguenot is a tragedy which reflects that of the " Eglise ", for the faithful are the Church. This equation of the part and the whole is manifested by the juxtaposition of the portrait in "Misères" of the "visage de la captive Eglise " (14) under the altars of the idols to the presentation 1 D'Aubigné, 44 Aux Lecteurs in Les Tragiques , Garnier et Plattard (1932), p. 11.</page><page sequence="15">66 R. L. REGOSIN in the Revelation of St. John which presents the individual souls of the martyrs. The death of each of the faithful foreshadows the death of the Church ; each death means that a little more of the " Eglise " has died. As the drama is played out on the stage of the terrestrial universe, the Elect in Heaven view the action from their spiritual vantage point. Virtue describes their perspective as she attempts to lead the young man in God's way : Je veux faire voller ton esprit sur la nuë, Que tu voye la terre en ce point que la vid Scipion quand l'amour de mon nom le ravit, Ou mieux d'où Goligni se rioit de la foulle Qui de son tronc roullé se joüoit à la boulle, Parmi si hauts plaisirs que, mesme en lieu si doux, De tout ce qu'il voyoit il n'entroit en courroux. Un jeu lui fut des Rois la sotte perfidie, Comique le succez de la grand' tragedie. (II, 1428-36) The reference to Scipio and its juxtaposition with Coligny serves to elucidate the Admiral's perspective, providing, at this early point in the poem, an essential view of the action of the tragedy. Scipio's dream, as recorded by Cicero in De Re Publica, tells of Scipio's ascent to Heaven in a dream *. From this vantage point he saw the world as it is - a small and inconsequential part of the total uni- verse - and he recognized the paltriness of human endeavor and achievement. In the light of this discovery Scipio turned from the empty values which man esteems to the substantial and eternal heavenly virtues. These insights characterize Coligny's position, for the Admiral too has ascended to Heaven (although his ascent takes place after his death). He too sees terrestrial activity in its proper perspective. What is happening in France, as what happened in Rome, is only a small part of what is happening in the world, and the world is only an infinitesimal point in the universe : " Là ne s'estime rien des régnés l'excellence, / Le monde n'est qu'un poix, un atome la France " (II, 1439-40). The duration of life on earth, its fame and fortune, mean so little in the presence of eternity. Scipio's dream also predicts his future success and by analogy serves to disclose the future course of the action of Les Tragiques : the eventual triumph of Coligny and his Protestant cause. This parallel is reinforced by the similarity of the lives of Scipio and Coligny - military hero, statesman of influence, man of virtue, honor and wisdom who sought national unity, and who met death at the hands of political enemies - and by the reasons given for Scipio's 1 Cicero, De Re Publica , trans, by G. W. Keyes, Loeb Classical Library (1943), pp. 261-83.</page><page sequence="16">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 67 salvation : patriotism and virtue. The elder Scipio Africanus praises his son's concern for the fatherland, advising him of the eternal afterlife of happiness which awaits the patriot. Goligny too has been a patriot, and the guarantee of salvation has already been fulfilled ; its realization awaits his spiritual and political heirs. Pro- minent among these is the poet himself, attempting to save France through his poem. The elder Africanus indicates that the second means to salvation lies in the practice of virtue, in the love of justice and duty. In " Princes " Virtue herself has been offering Goligny as a model to be emulated, for his ideals of justice, duty, and moral excellence have led him to Heaven. In d'Aubigné's view of the religious struggle, these values are intimately associated with the Protestant cause as a whole *. This again indicates ultimate success for the poet and his people, foreshadowing the felicitous dénouement - the " comique succez " - of the tragic action of Les Tragiques. The intellectual and spiritual distance of this heavenly perspective separates Coligny and the Elect from the action and makes them the first real spectators to the drama. From this vantage point, the Catholic bankers and judges, and the zealots present at the autos- da-fé are only spectators to a play within a play. They are the audience at a spectacle which is at the same time a microcosmic reflection of the larger universal drama and a small scene in it. These " spectators " participate in the action of the tragedy of the Church ; they are actors, passive characters who encourage and incite the active villains, and share their guilt. Ironically, although for obviously different reasons, Coligny experiences the same lack of concern for the apparently disastrous course of the tragic action. As he stands in Heaven, looking down on the world, he cannot appreciate the urgent position of the Church as the " fall of a great hero ". He is aware that in spite of current appearances, the Church and her people will be saved, and her enemies damned. Realizing the insignificance of all man's endeavors, and fully cognizant that human destiny is determined by God's will, Coligny must think of the " succez " - the progress or outcome - of the " grand' tragedie " as " comique ". From the celestial vantage point, the Admiral is a spectator to a dramatic comedy : the characters are of lower station than the Elect ; their actions are inconsequential in the framework of the universe ; the essential action progresses from misery on earth to eternal happiness in Heaven ; the emotional response is not pity or fear but elation. Why then is the poem not called Les Comiques ? The answer lies in the fact that the poet, and not Coligny, provides the focus from 1 Sauerwein, op. cit., pp. 93-96.</page><page sequence="17">68 R. L. REGOSIN which the events of the drama are interpreted. From the finite terrestrial perspective of the human mind and soul with which he sees and understands, the poet recognized the impending ruin of his country and his Church, and the self-annihilation of his compatriots and coreligionists. This horrible destruction of something greater than he, falling because of pride and divine anger, aroused his com- passion and fear, and he characterized it as tragedy. A divine light does make him aware of the true nature of the situation. His soul, " furieuse de sainct amour " (" Préface ", 132), has been mystically drawn to God and his " cœur " - as much will as heart - has been possessed by Truth (" Préface ", 145-46). Divine inspiration, growing in frequency and intensity as the poem progresses, allows him to share the celestial perspective. Although the focus of " Princes " and " Chambre Dorée " is an essentially terrestrial one, the poet's function through the rest of Les Tragiques is the gradual reinterpre- tation of the earthly " tragedy " from Coligny's point of view, until the felicitous dénouement of the original drama is finally accom- plished. He comes indeed to appreciate the significance of worldly events as Coligny does. But he rarely attains the Admiral's emotional peace. He himself is careful to emphasize that his state of divine inspiration exists only " quelquefois " (" Préface ", 355) ; the poem in general is written under God's guidance, but only at times does the human soul rise as high as the heavenly heights. Thus even when revealing the overwhelming positive value of martyrdom he still speaks with hatred and rage of the executioners. Despite the elevated vantage point he reaches, the poet essentially remains an actor in the drama and cannot distance himself emotionally from the events ; moreover as a man, he experiences human reactions. Speaking of the cruel deaths of innocent children, he cries out in anguish : " Mais quel crime avant vivre ont-ils peu encourir? " (V, 619). This question, raised to God, is asked by a man at that time unmindful of the celestial significance of terrestrial events. From this point of view, he characterizes the voices of the victims in " Fers " as " tragiques voix " (Y, 615), the civil conflit in that same book as " tragiques erreurs " (V, 366), and the battle of Moncontour as a " tragique bataille " (V, 420). This tension between the poet's two perspectives continues to the end of the poem when it is finally resolved in his assumption into Heaven. Then the poet takes his place for all eternity " au giron de son Dieu " alongside Coligny and the Elect. The presentation of the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre reflects the dual nature of this perspective. Present in Heaven as the Elect view the paintings and the prose gloss which reveal the true meaning of the massacre, the poet records what he sees and reads. He also copies the comments of Coligny, which disclose the perfidy of the Catholics as well as the pride of the Protestants, and which acknow-</page><page sequence="18">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 69 ledge the hardship which God's punishment of this pride has wrought. In the Admiral's eyes, God has remained faithful to his disloyal children by using this suffering to lead them to salvation. This is then the meaning which the poet communicates, but in spite of his exalted vantage point he retains his human emotional reaction. He characterizes what he sees as la tragedie qui efface le reste (V, 702), like the auto-da-fé, a microcosm of the great tragedy of the Church. Dawn, he says, ... tire en tremblant du monde le rideau, Et le soleil voyant le spectacle nouveau A regret esleva son pasle front des ondes. (V, 779-81) The murder of Jeanne ď Albret represented the first act of this play within a play : " le coup de poison qui de la tragedie / Joüa l'acte premier " (Y, 753-54). At the same time the descriptive terms of light and brightness which frame the presentation of these " tableaux " directly reflect the essential positive value which God gives to these events. What has been characterized as " tragedies " is presented in these terms : Le paradis plus beau de spectacles si beaux, Aima le parement de tels sacrés tableaux, Si que du vif esclat de couleurs immortelles Les voûtes du beau ciel reluisirent plus belles. (Y, 273-76) The Elect themselves are attracted to the painting of Jeanne's funeral by its brilliance : Jà les vives splendeurs des diversités peintes Tiroyent, à l'approcher, les yeux des ames saínetes... L'esclatante lueur prés de l'œil accroissoit. (Y, 745-48) While Goligny watches the suffering of the innocent in a detached manner, God shares the poet's bitterness as He rages against injustice and weeps for His children : Dieu voulut en voir plus, mais de regret et d'ire, Tout son sang escuma : il fuit, il se retire, Met ses mains au devant de ses yeux en courroux. Le Tout-Puissant ne peut resider entre nous. Sa barbe et ses cheveux de fureur herisserent, Les sourcis de son front en rides s'enfoncerent, Ses yeux changés en feu jetterent pleurs amers. (IV, 1389-95) Yet God knows of the salvation that awaits the righteous and of the damnation promised to the wicked, for He has determined it since the beginning of time ; as the omniscient, omnipotent Divinity, His</page><page sequence="19">70 R. L. REGOSIN will has directed the course of history. Two factors appear to deter- mine God's role. First, unlike the Elect who play no part in the drama, God is an active participant in the action. On the terrestrial level, His force sustains the martyrs, giving them the strength by which they endure the painful path to salvation : " Cette constance extreme... / Vient de Dieu... present au milieu de vos flammes " (IV, 1353-58). On the spiritual level of the action where Satan and the black angels join the Catholic iniquitous against the Heavenly hosts and the just Protestants on earth, God is the active commander of the forces of good : " ce grand Chef souverain, / Commande de la voix et combat de sa main " (IV, 1359-61). God is a spectator who watches the individual incidents and the course of events with great interest. But because He is the chief protagonist as well, He does not always maintain an emotional distance. The other attribute of God, on which the first really depends, is the anthropomorphic quality of the Divine Being. This is not the God incarnate of the New Testament. The poem, in fact, assigns a conspicuously small role to Christ. The God of Les Tragiques is the God of the Old Testament who actively punished His people in His anger and grief and shared their triumphs in His joy. The many references in the poem to Old Testament events and the continuing analogy between the Protestants and the Hebrews as the chosen people play a major part in creating the Old Testament atmosphere of the poem. Since He is spiritually and physically involved in the individual and collective destiny of His children, God shares their joy and sorrow, becomes angry in the face of evil and weeps when the innocent suffer. The Elect in Heaven devote themselves wholly to the contemplation of divine glory and no longer experience " pas- sion charnelle " (V, 289). The anthropomorphic God who participates in the action does. IV. The Poet as Actor After the prologue of " Misères ", the dramatic tragedy of Les Tragiques is divided into two parts. The next four books - " Princes ", " Chambre Dorée " Feux ", and " Fers " - represent the battle between the spiritual and terrestrial forces of good and evil. From his vantage point in Heaven the poet fulfills his role as active par- ticipant by relating the activities of the characters and revealing the true significance of events, thus allowing the felicitous dénouement. He describes the personal contest between God and Satan, the roles played by the celestial angels and the fallen followers of the Devil, and human conflicts of all magnitudes from great military encounters to individual martyrdom. By the last two books, " Vengeances " and " Jugement these conflicts have been resolved and only the</page><page sequence="20">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 71 punishment of the wicked and the reward of the just remain К It is in the resolution of the dramatic action that the poet assumes a more active role. In " Vengeances " he becomes the prophet of God, and is assimilated to Jonah by three analogous circumstances. First, they share an initial unwillingness to answer God's call : " Je m'en- fuyois de Dieu " (VI, 115). Second, both have subsequently been awakened by God (VI, 137-38) ; and third, both are prophets of doom, carrying messages of forthcoming destruction. As Jonah came to warm ancient Nineveh, the poet comes to destroy its modern counterpart, Paris. The words he is presenting are comparable to the words of Scripture : " Ainsi les visions qui seront ici peintes / Seront exemples vrais de nos histoires saínetes " (VI, 89-90). As God revealed His word in Scripture through the prophet, so it is revealed in Les Tragiques . With the coming of the time of final judgment in " Jugement ", the poet moves even closer to God as he and his poem become the actual instrument by which ultimate justice is carried out : " Pour me faire instrument à ces effects divers, / Donne force à ma voix, efficace à mes vers " (VII, 7-8). Through the verse itself, eternal happiness and damnation are acomplished. This must be taken literally, for the poet announces who is to be saved and who damned : " A celui qui t'avoue, ou bien qui te renonce, / Porte l'heur ou mal- heur, l'arrest que je prononce " (VII, 9-10). The poet possesses what he calls " ce pacquet à malheurs et de parfaicte joye " (VII, 22), which, when opened, separates the Elect from the multitude. God and the poet alone are the active protagonists as the rest of the universe waits passively to be chosen for Heaven or Hell. When his role has been fulfilled and the course of events of the original tragedy successfully resolved, the poet receives the reward promised by the dream of Scipio. The curtain falls as he is assumed into Heaven, to enjoy the eternal glory of the celestial afterlife. V. The Tragic Ones The question posed earlier as to who is meant by the title Les Tragiques can now be discussed. The Protestant protagonists lay strong claim to the title of " the tragic ones ". The situation of France which defines the tragic action has given way to the religious context where the Protestant Church becomes the " mere hardie " at the point of catastrophe. Because the Church and its followers are the chosen people, their downfall caused by an excess of pride and weakening faith exemplifies the fall of a great hero through an 1 sauerwein, op. cit. pp. 148-172.</page><page sequence="21">72 R. L. REGOSIN error in judgment. In their blindness they have been working toward their own demise. In time, however, and with divine sanction, their reversal of fortune leads to a felicitous dénouement. The author has succeeded in maintaining that dual perspective characteristic of Greek tragedy whereby both the human viewpoint which admires heroic nobility and innocence and the divine which recognizes sin and guilt are sustained through the work. As the poet moves between his terrestrial and celestial vantage points the picture of the Pro- testants as both guilty and innocent emerges. The audience, which would find the downfall of a totally virtuous hero repugnant and horrible, can thus feel pity for his suffering. In Aristotelian terms as d'Aubigné might have understood them, with allowances made for the epic context which permits the hero to be something other than a man, the Protestant Church and its people qualify as the " tra- giques ". This view is confirmed by the fact that every reference to " tragiques " and " tragédie " used in a religious context refers to the Protestants. The resemblance of Les Tragiques to André de Rivaudeau's Aman also supports this view. The analogy in the poem between the Galvinist Protestants and the Hebrews is well established and applies as well to the Hebrews of Aman . Rivaudeau's religious intention was to portray Aman's victims as the heroes of his drama ; his sympathy went out to the spiritual ancestors of his people and he sought to inform and encourage his coreligionists by their example. The comparison with Aman also reveals a similarity between the character and destiny of Aman and that of the Catholic antagonists of Les Tragiques . In Rivaudeau's tragedy the iniquitous chamberlain is the moving force of the action and the course of his career - pride, revolt against the gods, reversal of fortune, downfall, and death - represents the stages of the dramatic complication and dénouement. Until the entrance of the poet into the action, the Catholics occupy the same role as their wicked predecessor. This presentation ironically allows these villains to appear as satanic heroes. Although Aman is all bad, and thus cannot evoke pity, his counterparts in the poem seem not to be totally wicked. In " Jugement " the poet suggests that the iniquitous may repent and change their ways, thus achieving salvation : Doncques chacun de vous, pauvres pay ens... Suyvez, aimez Sara, si vous avez dessein D'estre fils d'Abraham, retirés en son sein. (VII, 631-46) If the souls of the wicked are always redeemable, then the propensity for good exists in them. Thus in essence, they are not totally bad, but are perhaps lost sheep, God's children who have gone astray.</page><page sequence="22">D'AUBIGNÉ'S « LES TRAGIQUES » 73 Their damnation which results from their denial of this latent good in themselves can therefore represent a tragedy, the loss of a poten- tially good soul. The resolution of the problem of who are Les Tragiques lies in the realization that neither the Protestants nor the Catholics alone are implied by this title. The action of the drama describes the simultaneous peripeteias of both parties whereby the initial victim becomes the triumphant hero while the original victor becomes the ultimate victim. The Galvinist context of the poem resolves the pro- blem of the hero in favor of the Protestants. From the poet's human point of view, his coreligionists and his Church are heroic victims of a dread tragedy; the apparent disproportion between their crime and their fate provokes his anger and pity. From his celestial view- point, the Huguenots appear as the heroes of a felicitous tragedy; here, their just destiny elicits his admiration and his joy. The Catholics in both instances represent the iniquitous forces of evil whose deserved punishment evokes his satisfaction. The suggestion that they are " lost souls " does, however, allow a reaction of tem- pered pity, and derives wholly from the celestial perspective. Thus the Protestants partake of the name " tragic ones " as heroes, and the Catholics as victims. Hanover, New Hampshire. Richard L. Regosin.</page></plain_text>
