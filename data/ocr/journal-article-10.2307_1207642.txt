<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN IN CONTEMPORARY CRITICISM Edward W. Said I Even this handful of anthologies of modern literary theory and criticism' enables one to surmise that a very large quantity and variety of work is being done today. Yet these anthologies do not help one to estimate how much better (or worse), in general, literary criticism has become. Not only is it difficult to know with what to compare "modern" or "contemporary" criticism-with "classical" criticism? with "traditional" criticism? with the criti- cism of "a generation ago"?-it is next to impossible to get readers, much less professional critics, to agree about the purposes or effectiveness of criticism. Still more problematic is the distinction often made, but rarely explained, between critical theory and practical criticism, or between the theory of something and criti- cism of or about it. Surprisingly enough, sophisticated critical polemicists are more likely than one would imagine to be satisfied with crude national labels ("French" or "European" versus "English" or "American") in dealing with these issues and distinc- tions, and in letting them settle very large areas of intellectual discrimination. Names are often enough. "Frye" and "Leavis" stir up undignified passions; "Derrida" and "Leavis" might provoke For bibliographical details on the anthologies cited in this essay, see Krieger's introduction.

"Good"-in the sense of approved- criticism can thus be associated with Anglo-Saxon moral concern, evaluative assertion, a certain kind of attention to stylistic per- formance, an emphasis on "concrete" reading as opposed to "abstract" (and foreign) pseudo-philosophy or generality. Stand on the other side of the net, and adjectives like "pro- vincial," "untheoretical," "unproblematic," "unself-conscious" will be opening shots at the opponent; after that, one can hurl at him "structure," "semiological," "hermeneutical" and the more or less ultimate cross-court word "deconstruction." Any slightly more than casual reader of literary journals knows either repertoire, and probably yawns at them both-as much as he is also bored by any eclecticist who tries to use all the factional vocabularies to make a transcendental synthesis. But, in the manner of an impressionistic historian, one can say there are things about what goes on in contemporary criticism today that are typical, even representative of the mode. What assumptions would a clever anthologist make about his readers' interest in contemporary criticism, assuming that by "contemporary" he understood "criticism which one could not afford to ignore," or "criticism that seems, by its novelty, modish- ness, or sheer intellectual power, to make people believe that it is the representative, hence the vanguard, contemporary type"? A question of this sort doesn't pretend to answer some of the basic problems faced by criticism. Neither, at the outset, does it get past the level of a useful exercise, by which one delineates the critical field in order to propose changes for it or reveal its shortcomings. If these anthologies serve any real function-aside from being convenient ways for the reader to get hold of fugitive essays-it is to let one think that they make up a consensus for today's critic, an immediate background he presumes to be accurate, from which he launches his own work, to which he responds, against which he defines himself, his allies, or his opponents. In accepting such a background the critic also presumes a background for the background, and without being too dodgy, he would say that these anthologies and what they represent aim to be different from previous anthologies and consensuses, which in turn were different from previous ones, etc. Critical change is much less sequential and abrupt than that, obviously enough. But let us grant a sense of change that these anthologies-dating roughly from the late sixties to the early seventies-incorporate and exploit. Whether such change is for the good of criticism or not is 328 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="3">the issue to be dealt with only implicitly at first; later, in the second part of this essay, I would like to assess the change in terms of what this contemporary criticism cannot do, and in terms also of what it might be doing. In a perfectly evident way, criticism today is more cosmo- politan than it has ever been since the first two decades of this century. (In order to make things easier, "criticism today"-and its cognates, "modem" or "contemporary criticism"-shall mean what it is that these anthologies stand for.) The Macksey-Donato col- lection (The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man) most authoritatively records a seemingly lasting French intervention into American critical discourse, just as the conference of which it was the published proceedings was (in late 1966) the first important gathering of almost wholly foreign critics in the United States. The French intervention additionally caused doors and windows to be opened onto the rest of Europe, first onto Romance cantons and countries (Geneva and Italy, notably), then onto other areas like Germany, the Soviet Union, even the United States itself. And, indeed, the new cosmopolitanism revived interest in either old or native approaches-those of C. S. Peirce, philologists like Auerbach, Curtius, and Spitzer, as well as the Russian Formalists-previously known mainly to specialists. A remarkable result for the practicing critic who wrote in English and who had an interest in theoretical issues was that English studies had its centrality eroded. Richard Poirier's well- known essay in Polletta's Issues,2 already in 1970, spelled out the English-speaking critic's uneasiness with the position taken from Arnold to Leavis, that "our" moral center was to be found stretched out in the English classics. The touchstones were being transformed into activity, such as what Barthes called l'activite structuraliste and ecriture,3 or into a rather more generously con- ceived entity called modem literature. The latter is Lionel Trilling's phrase which, when he employed it first in 1961, resonated against Arnold in particular; that Arnold's best critic, as well as the critic whose work in the United States had most assuredly placed English 2 Richard Poirier, "What Is English Studies, and If You Know What That Is, What Is English Literature?" in Polletta, pp. 557-71. 3See Roland Barthes, Critical Essays, trans.

ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 329</page><page sequence="4">studies centrally on the literary agenda, spoke of a modern litera- ture that included Diderot, Mann, Freud, Gide, and Kafka,4 was a significant announcement of how international and dialectical English-speaking criticism had become. Not only does it somehow seem pertinent to have had ses- sions of the English Institute addressed in French about French authors, but an intelligent young critic will now spend a lot of his time reading and citing from Barthes, Derrida, Todorov, Genette, and company. A new vocabulary-call it Anglo-French-disposes terms like decoupage, decodage, bricolage, with some assurance that everyone will understand them. A fortunate few will quote approvingly from Szondi, Benjamin, Adorno, Mayer, Enzensberger, Raimondi, Eco, Lotman, and, of course, the ubiquitous Jakobson. So it is not exceptionable that anthologies of the latest and best in literary theory will draw most heavily on international, as opposed to strictly local, work. From what had seemed to be the fierce parochialism of New Criticism, for example, to the (sometimes) abandoned cosmopolitanism of this New Criticism, it has mainly been the isolated integrity of English studies-as a body of texts, as a tradition, as an object, as a tone of voice, as a coherent, well-defined discipline-that suffered in the change. One could call the loss a loss of objectivity, in the sense of objecthood. Notions of boundary, object-ness, limits, and with them, the ideas of a national literature, a genre, a period, a confined text, an author, seem to have weakened. The positivism with which one could assert that romanticism is such and such, or that the tradition is those works arranged in that order, has been replaced with either a theory or a praxis of textual functions. Barthes's critical theory, with its emphases on ecriture, a defused author (in his Racine), an omnicompetent text (in S/Z), a text as sensation (in Le Plaisir du texte), fairly maps the shift from a kind of objectivized historicism, with English or French studies at its center, to a kind of international critical apparatus important for its activity, not by any means for the literary material it may (or may not) valorize. Curiously enough, a certain restraint has operated on these anthologists who, while excerpting Barthes and Todorov, have shied away from the most radical semioticians- Kristeva, Sollers, Faye, and others-in the Tel Quel group. But that 4Lionel Trilling, "On the Teaching of Modern Literature," in Polletta, pp. 539-56. 330 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="5">is an omission, along with the avoidance of Ingarden and a still challenging Lukacs, that I shall consider a little later. On the one hand, there appears an international critical vocab- ulary aimed not at texts or traditions but at a condition of existence we may rightly call textuality; on the other hand, various counterorthodoxies arise to replace the orthodox notions of author, period, work, or genre. As is always the case with criticism, certain past authors seem suddenly important. Think of Dante or Donne and the New Critics; think of Holderlin for Heidegger; think now of Artaud, Bataille, Saussure, Freud, Nietzsche for the latest new critics. Instead of these authors being touchstones they are employed rather as principles beyond which texts as texts cannot and need not go. To return to them, as Lacan returned to Freud, is to establish them in the role of a canon, whose legitimacy is maintained with loyal devotion. An unfortunate consequence for the assenting critic is that even if he does not use Arnold's image of venerable petrification as an equivalent for high value, he is no less susceptible to the dangers of received authority from canonical works and authors. A maddening new critical shorthand is to be observed. Instead of arguing a point, there tends often to be a lackluster reference to Nietzsche, or Freud, or Artaud, or Benja- min-as if the name alone carried just enough value to override any objection or to settle any quarrel. Most of the time the citation carries with it no discrimination that such a passage in such a work may be better or more useful than others, or less so in some unintentionally comic instances; the name and the reference are enough. A new canon means also a new past or a new history, and less happily, a new parochialism. Any reader of modern French criti- cism will be astounded to realize that Kenneth Burke, in whose huge output many of the issues and methods currently engaging the French were first discussed,S is unknown. Is this the result of ignorance, or convenience, or deliberate ideological omission? Another example, for which the Europeans are not principally to blame, of course, is the slavish attitude to them by American critics. Yet what seems especially wasteful is the way one critic elaborates on or criticizes the work of a canonical critic-somebody 5 Ignorance of Burke, and of Peirce, Dewey, Kroeber, Lowie, Sapir, Sullivan, and Mead is mentioned by Macksey in The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man, p. 320. ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN 331</page><page sequence="6">like Barthes, or Derrida, for there is a living, producing canon, too-and is never answered or even recognized by the canon. Similarly, there is a pronounced tendency to avoid historical re- search, or its results, as something less interesting intrinsically than theoretical speculation. Derrida's essays on Rousseau and Con- dillac,6 to cite two very influential examples, have spawned a whole array of imitations, all of them as historically and contextu- ally thin as Derrida's were brilliant. Inevitably we must ask, What then of the prevailing critical discourse itself; or to be more exact and delimited, What does critical discourse do? I shall speak here of a sort of majority a priori belief that seems to direct critics' attention to one very important aspect of the literary experience, namely function. In most of the anthologized material we will find the critic talking about what a text does, how it works, how it has been put together in order to do certain things, how the text is a wholly integrated and equilibrated system, and so forth. Much as it may seem to be an impoverishing view of literature, this particular kind of functionalism has had, on the whole, a salutary effect. It has done away with empty rhetorical testimonials proclaiming a work's greatness or humanistic worth. Moreover, it has made it possible for critics to talk seriously and technically and precisely about the text. Here, there is some novelty to be remarked. Academic, journalistic, or amateur criticism has usually been considered a branch of belles-lettres; until the advent of American and English New Criticism the job of a critic was an appreciation of the work, which he was writing about as much for the "general" reader as for other critics. Functionalist criticism makes the break between the community of critics and the general public extremely sharp. The assumption is that to write a literary work, or to write about one, is a specialized function with no simple equivalent or cause in everyday human experience. Therefore, critical vocabulary must, and so does, emphasize the antinatural, and even antihuman, char- acteristics of verbal behavior in written language. And, since genetic theses seem particularly suspect so far as literature is concerned-writing cannot be reduced simply to a natural past, or 6Jacques Derrida, De la Grammatologie (Paris: Minuit, 1967) and his long introduction L 'Archeologie du frivole to Condillac's Essai sur l'origine des connaissances humaines (Paris: Galilee, 1973). 332 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="7">to a natural urge, or to an empirically prior moment-the critic will go out of his way to find a technical language with no other possible use than to describe the text's functions. An antecedent for this decision to employ a rigorous technical vocabulary based mainly upon linguistic terminology is found in I. A. Richards' criticism. He, of course, did not use linguistic terminology; but what distinguished him, and Empson as well, from the American New Critics was his search for critical exactness without appeals either to the prestige of literature or of everyday experience. Precision in dealing with literature was gained for him in the use of words, and by what way can words be made precise except by a science of words, purified from inexactness, emotion, or sloppiness? Richards' subsequent attention to Basic English, as well as his continued borrowings from ordinary language or utilitarian philoso- phy, and empirical psychology, set him apart from his contempo- raries. What is additionally true of his work is also true of the critics we are discussing now-that the temptations of a rigorous technical critical vocabulary induce occasional lapses into a sort of scientism. Reading and writing become, at such moments, instances of regulated, systematized production, as if the human agencies involved were irrelevant. The closer the linguistic focus (i.e., in the criticism of Greimas or of Lotman, neither of whom has been anthologized), the more formal the approach; and the more scien- tistic the functionalism. And the more limited the defined func- tions. Definitions, more often than not, point the reader back towards the method, since one aim of functionalism is to perfect the instrument of analysis as much as one's understanding of a text's workings. Thus while a really intelligent critic like Barthes will have the good taste to know the qualitative difference between Ian Fleming and Balzac, what he actually says is that the latter works better (is more responsive to a full-scale semiological reading by Barthes) than the former. This is almost as much as saying that you could write a good story if you knew the rules of compo- sition, which obviously cannot guarantee any such result. For practical purposes, however, the constant peril of a functionalist bias is in giving the reader uniform, unvarying claustrophobia. Since the relationship between the work and the critic is a self- sealing and self-perpetuating one, since the specialized character of the relation is exclusive and rigidly systematic, a reader can expect ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 333</page><page sequence="8">only to receive knowledge of a sort already confirmed and en- closed by the initial definitions. One experiences the text making the critic work, and he in turn shows the text at work: the product of these interchanges is simply that they have taken place. Critical ingenuity is pretty much confined to transposing the work-any work-into an instance of the method. It is the potential monotony of this (or of any hermeticism for that matter), not its apparent solipsism, that I find objection- able. Most great critics are methodical; this perhaps means only that they are able to articulate and rationalize their intuitive awareness of literature. But it also means that they are not afraid of making their methods and their own writing independently interesting and intellectually consistent, over and above a work or an occasion. For the lesser critic such challenges are rare. He will use the work in order to make it work, which it always will. His method will demonstrate its effectiveness, which it will always possess. And on and on, without any sense of the drama under- lying method, or of its fundamental ground in intellectual life. The great virtue of Derrida's essay, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," is that method is shown turning upon itself at the very moment of its greatest victories, in order to achieve a still more novel, more differentiated lucidity. Derrida goes on to say that "the risk of sterility and of sterili- zation has always been the price of lucidity,"7 and hints with appropriate courage that he is willing to pay the price. But these are partial statements made with a full realization that contempo- rary methodology occurs at a particular moment in human self- consciousness, not randomly because a method was thought of and then employed at will. Such essays as Derrida's are occasionally to be found in the anthologies: their value is to make explicit a sense of what I called the drama of method and its underlying roots in intellectual vitality. Thereafter we are better enabled to recognize that contemporary critical discourse is fundamentally antidynastic in its attitudes-to the work, to the critic, to knowledge, to reality. Orphaned by the radical Freudian, Saussurian, and Nietzschean critique of origins, traditions, and knowledge itself, contemporary criticism achieved its methodological independence by forfeiting an active situation in the world. It has no faith in traditional con- 7Jacques Derrida, "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Discourse of the Human Sciences," in Macksey and Donato, p. 271. 334 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="9">tinuities (nation, biography, period); rather it improvises, in acts of an often inspired bricolage, order out of extreme discontinuity. Its culture is a negative one of absence, anti-representation, and (as Blackmur used to put it repeatedly) ignorance. Learned or gifted ignorance is no mean thing, however. All of the major critics now writing make themselves over into critical instruments, as if from scratch; for their presumptive ignorance makes possible the finding out of important truth about, and important methods for, the study of literature. Consider a con- stellation of critics that might include Auerbach, Spitzer, Black- mur, Barthes, Genette, and Benjamin; their careers span almost a century, but a good deal of overlap occurs between them. All are comprised within the scope of our anthologies. Each of them, to begin with, is a reader whose learning is for the text, and whose method is from the text. Having said that, one would immediately remark that the divergences between them are very wide because of the ways each uses to doctor his ignorance. Yet none cares much for tidy distinctions between bloodless theory and practice, or between literary criticism and philology, philosophy, linguistics, psychology, sociology. Such as it is, their common method is incorporative; it converts what seems to be alien material, or in some cases quixotic and trivial material, into pertinent dimensions of the text. Some of these dimensions appear perforce eccentric, even determinedly so. But this will-to-eccentricity, I think, is a major project of contemporary critical discourse, Northrop Frye's in- cluded. For the critic, texts are texts not as symbols of something else, but as displacements (Frye's vocabulary is useful here) of other things; texts are deviations from, exaggerations and nega- tions of, human presence. They are at times phenomena of excess and of rupture. Style does not represent an author, any more than he is his biography. Instead the facts of style exist together in an affiliative, rather than a filiative, relation to a text, which itself is part of an affiliative structure of eccentric elements. All of this is a much-noted consequence of subjectivity's weakened position with regard to a text. No longer is it commonly held that Taine's data (race, moment, milieu) both exhaust and define the writer as the producer of his text; even as staunch a defender of fertile authorial consciousness as Poulet, accepts before anything else the eccen- tricity, contingency, and instability of self, its mutability and powerlessness before the text. "Reading, then, is the act in which ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 335</page><page sequence="10">the subjective principle which I call I, is modified in such a way that I no longer have the right, strictly speaking, to consider it as my 1."8 What makes such statements methodologically valid, as opposed to being testimonials of an overly effusive sympathy between critic and text, is that the critic's proper identity, his working point of departure, is neither an empirical self (the same self that eats, goes shopping, breathes, dies) nor a sort of official persona. Instead, the critical identity, which one might as well also call the critic's authoritative, authorizing method of dealing with texts, is built upon a linguistic base, not a psychological, social, or historical one. In effect, this means that language is considered as a community of language-users, not merely as a means of communi- cation. Such a community is intersubjective of course, but it has rules or codes that give it order, coherence, intelligibility. The critical method-whether Auerbach's, Spitzer's, Blackmur's, Barthes's, Poulet's, or almost any one of the others-is effective because as far as it is concerned, every aspect of language is significant. And the production of significance is precisely the principal capability of language. What concerns the critic is how language signifies, what it signifies, and in what form. A vast range of possibilities immediately opens out: are these linguistic significations intentional? are they all equal? is one signi- fication more determined historically or sociologically than another? how do they influence each other?-the list of options for critical attention can be extended to include every critical act. For the critic is, of course, an intelligent reader first of all, but his role after that is nothing if not an active and dialectical one. For it is his work-his existence, his role-that makes, indeed determines, significance as a subject for study and analysis. Thus the history of literary criticism, as Hazard Adams' fine anthology amply demon- strates,9 is the history of critical mediations, which is another way of saying that it is a history of critics gaining identity by endowing certain linguistic objects with significance for the critic, and after that, for other critics and readers. The critical identity is the presentational device for certain, formally determined matters in 8Georges Poulet, "Phenomenology of Reading," in Polletta, p. 107. The essay was first contained in The Languages of Criticism and the Sciences of Man. 9Hazard Adams, ed., Critical Theory Since Plato (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1971). 336 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="11">language. To study the history of criticism is in reality to under- stand the history of literature critically; such a history is, no less than the history of biology described by Frangois Jacob, "de rechercher comment les objets sont devenus accessibles a l'analyse, permettant ainsi a de nouveaux domaines de se constituer en sciences."10 II The functionalist attitude in critical discourse (as I discussed it above) has some fairly unfortunate limitations, however. A functionalist attitude pays too much attention to the text's formal operations, but far too little to what I prefer to call its materiality. In other words, the range assumed for the text's operations tends to be either wholly internal or wholly rhetorical, with the critic himself serving as a sort of one-man Rezeptionsgeschichte. On the one hand, the text is imagined as working alone within itself, as containing a privileged, or, if not privileged, then unexamined and a priori, principle of internal coherence; on the other hand, the text is considered as in itself a sufficient cause for certain very precise effects it has on a (presumed) ideal reader. In both cases, therefore, the text does not remain but is metamorphosed into (pace Stanley Fish) a self-consuming artifact. A perhaps unforeseen consequence is that the text becomes idealized, essentialized, instead of remaining as the very special kind of cultural object which it really is, with a causation, persistence, durability, and social presence quite its own. Some notable omissions from the anthologies indicate this prevailing idealist and antimaterialistic bias. Michel Foucault is nowhere to be found, and neither is any of the current Tel Quel group. Auerbach and Spitzer-whose predominantly philological scholarship is mainly concerned not with "reading" but with describing the modes of persistence of texts-are misrepresented completely; an untutored reader will assume (if he does not read the two or three essays about Spitzer and Auerbach) that they were rather old-fashioned versions of Brooks or Warren. Lukacs stands out as a dull polemicist for "realism" since the company he keeps, anthologically speaking, actually extols artistic isolation and lOFranqois Jacob, La Logique du vivant: Une histoire de l'heredite (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), p. 19. ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 337</page><page sequence="12">the value of aesthetic rarefication. The extracts from his work are uniformly the same in critical anthologies generally, and uniformly uninteresting as a result, since they are chosen simply, and unin- terestingly, to prove his Marxism; the choice of such a Lukacs owes nearly everything to the cold war. " Even in their efforts to give some idea of how resourceful the functionalists are about style as a major instrument of the text's activity, the anthologies do not excerpt work by Michael Rif- faterre, M.A.K. Halliday, or other vigorous stylisticians. Moreover, such sophisticated historical criticism as the anthologies present cannot compare in its isolation from sociocultural history with straight history-of-ideas writing, which often fills the pages of the scholarly journals. This insensitivity to history spoils the very matter being anthologized; history is therefore irrelevant. Gras's anthology of modem "European Literary Theory" is grotesquely portrayed without Ingarden, the Sartre of What Is Literature? and The Critique of Dialectical Reason, or the Heidegger of Being and Time. These complaints are part of a peculiar disorder in modern criticism itself. Criticism has given very little notice to its history as a discipline-and any critic had better claim that criticism is a discipline if it is not to be an intellectual equivalent only of wine tasting. This essay is a perfect example of that disorder, since the hedges with which I surrounded my opening definitions of "modern criticism" make a great deal of what follows them appear impressionistic at best. One of the signs of modern criticism-and this is not impressionism-is a willingness to write criticism of other critics. But it is comparatively rare to find critics undertaking critical histories of criticism itself. True, there are encyclopedic efforts like those of Ren6 Wellek, but we must ask why the preference in critical history is always for the encyclopedia (hand- book, anthology, casebook, etc.) and rarely, if ever, for the critical critical history. Such a history would undoubtedly entail considera- tion of social and political impingements on criticism; it would also require attention to the question of when criticism is a discipline and when not. In short, critical attention to criticism viewed as an 11 The other Lukacs, by no means inconsistent with the assertively Marxist Lukacs, is to be found in Soul and Forms, The Theory of the Novel, Die Eigenart das Asthetischen, and variously in his Schriften zur Ideologie and Literatursoziologie. 338 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="13">intellectual phenomenon in a historical, social setting is resisted in ways exactly congruent with those I have listed for functionalist attitudes, which view the text as something immaterial. Criticism is considered as what critics do, irrespective of their archival or worldly circumstances. To produce criticism is to do what has always been done, with no change or past to speak of. For the anthologist, particularly if he is concerned with the modem, an anthologized choice (or exclusion) is often dictated by the sheer unintelligibility of a potential choice, since excerpts are even harder to understand than a whole book. Packageability is more relevant than historical, or even aesthetic, accuracy. But that is not always the case. What we will detect, then, is a conscious avoidance of criticism whose focus is the text as something other, as something historically and materially more, than a critical occasion. But what do I mean by "material" in this case? I mean the ways, for example, in which the text is a monument, a cultural object sought after, fought over, possessed, rejected, or achieved in time. Moreover, the text's materiality in- cludes the range of its authority. Why does a text enjoy currency at one time, recurrency at others, oblivion at others? 12 By the same token, an author's fama, his reputation, his status, is by no means a constant thing; is an account of this inconstancy, or at least, this inconsistency, not within the critic's job of work? It is, I believe, the more so now that the possibilities of archeological historical research have been so extended and refined by Foucault. Foucault's method is to study the text as part of an archive, which is composed of discourses, which are composed of state- ments. In short, he deals with texts as part of a system of cultural diffusion, rigidly controlled, tightly organized, difficult to pene- trate: he argues that everything stated in a field like literary discourse, for example, or medical discourse, is produced only with the most selective method, with very little regard for individual genius. 13 Each statement is therefore a material effort to incorpo- rate a particular piece of reality as selectively as possible. 12 For analyses of these problems see my "An Ethics of Language," Diacritics, 4, No. 2 (Summer 1974), 28-35; Beginnings: Intention and Method (New York: Basic Books, 1975), pp. 191-275; "The Text, the World, the Critic," Bulletin of the Midwest Modern Language Association, 8, No. 2 (Fall 1975), 1-23. 13 See Michel Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, trans. A. M. Sheri- dan Smith (New York: Pantheon, 1972), pp. 79-131. ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN 339</page><page sequence="14">But there are other ways of dealing with the materiality of texts, and these too are scanted by the anthologies. The oppo- site of incorporation as discussed by Foucault, no less material, is the theme of literary influence as recently theorized (and troped) by W. J. Bate and Harold Bloom. 14 Here, too, con- text is of the essence, since their assumption is that every writer, but especially the romantic post-Miltonic writer, is almost bodily aware of his predecessors as occupying the poetic space he now wishes to fill with his poetry. The intertextual struggle for the poet, according to Bloom, is no charming tea party, but a fierce battle whose all-pervading jostle spills over into, and becomes the topic of, the new, late-coming poet's verse. The text's materiality here is what the poetry is, and whether it can be a poetic text or not is something never taken for granted by the poet. Each line, in short, is an achievement, a space snatched out of the predecessor's clutches, filled by the poet with his words, which in time will have to be fought over by a successor. The family romance of poetry as Bloom and Bate portray it breeds a defensive poetry, a child of limitation and defensive anxiety. What Foucault, Bloom, and Bate have in common is that their work is about, and indeed is, the text's situation in the world; Foucault's, of course, is the world of culture, Bloom's and Bate's the world of art. One almost finds oneself saying that criticism always ought to be in the world, and that any world will do. But that is a sloppy notion, which I have tried elsewhere to hone a bit.'5 Yet compared not only with Foucault, Bate, and Bloom, but with the unreasonably ignored work of Raymond Schwab, 16 con- temporary critical discourse is worldless, in a frequently numbing way. Considering that much of the truly valuable work in literary theory and scholarship being done now in America is about roman- ticism (and note, by the way, that the anthologies before us are remarkably stingy on poetics or the various theories of poetic performance), there seems to be no good reason for keeping Schwab out. His thesis in La Renaissance orientale is a simple one: 14 See W. J. Bate, The Burden of the Past and the English Poet (Cam- bridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1970); and Harold Bloom, The Anxiety of Influ- ence: A Theory of Poetry (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1973), as well as his A Map of Misreading (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1975). 15 See my "The Text, the World, the Critic," pp. 18-22. 16 In particular Schwab's La Renaissance orientale (Paris: Payot, 1950), but also his Vie d'Anquetil-Duperron (Paris: Ernest Leroux, 1934). 340 i CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="15">that romanticism cannot be understood unless some account is taken of the great textual and linguistic discoveries made about the Orient during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. To be convincing, such a thesis needs to be buttressed with a tremendous amount of detail drawn from history, sociology, litera- ture, Orientalism itself, philosophy, and linguistics. Schwab has the detail, but what is more to the point for a critical theorist, he can organize it superbly, not according to a reductive linear scheme, but in terms of a subtle analysis of the process of gradual, then increasingly rapid, acculturation of the Orient by European society and culture. Schwab's point is that texts are frequently the result of an encounter between familiar and novel ideas; yet such an en- counter is eminently circumstantial and material, as when Anquetil-Duperron risks his life trying to get hold of the Zend- Avesta texts in Surat, texts which he then translates for the benefit of European culture at large. The innumerable and sometimes minute facts of such encounters are destined by Schwab to support his view of the change in European cultural institutions as a result of their reception of the Orient. Individual texts are seen from a perspective that is also able to pull in the salon, the museum, the laboratory, the learned academies, and even bureaucratic and governmental organizations. I cite Schwab, Foucault, Bate, and Bloom as exemplifying a possible trend for criticism to be taken seriously only if literature is going to be studied in a more situated, circumstantial-but no less theoretically self-conscious-way. Of course, there is no point in my further qualifying "situated" and "circumstantial" since it should be obvious that I mean "worldly" and "historical": for literature is produced in time and in society by human beings, who are themselves agents of, as well as somewhat independent actors within, their actual history. For some reason contemporary van- guard criticism has assumed that the relations between texts, and between texts and society, are taken care of by the superstructure or by something called "traditional" scholarship. That assumption is not warranted, if one means by the relation between texts and society anything like the complexity assigned to it by Benjamin (the student of Baudelaire), the Goldmann of Le Dieu caclie, or Lukacs. So-called traditional scholarship has rarely possessed the methodological rigor and vision of such critics. But the critics of influence have at least the great merit of believing that literature is ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 341</page><page sequence="16">produced because of other poets and texts, in their company, not despite them. Schwab and Foucault, the former in actual practice, the latter in extremely powerful theory, have gone very far in determining the social (and external) constraints upon production, as well as the discursive and cultural (that is, internal) systems that provoke and assimilate literary production. To approve and admire such historically generous critics is by no means to overlook problems in their theory and practice. From the viewpoint of learning, however, nothing they say has that airless and technically lucid finality characterizing a structural crite- fact, to coin a neologism for what is in fact only an analytical neologism; but in my opinion Schwab's and Foucault's work places too great a premium upon dramatic change. To a different degree, the same is no less true of Bate and Bloom. Literary history has been regarded by them all as a more or less steady drama, with one great age succeeded riotously by another. History in such a view becomes at bottom "linear succession" even though what- succeeds-what is described in very complex nonlinear detail. Only recently Foucault has tried rather programmatically to understand textual history in terms of those comparative stabilities (borrowing from Braudel) he called "the slow movements of material civili- zation." 17 Perhaps this refocusing on how texts maintain, instead of always changing, history is a return to Foucault's early interest in Raymond Rousell (e.g., "Les machineries de Roussel ne fabri- quent pas de l'etre; elles maintiennent les choses dans l'6tre").18 What is it that maintains texts inside reality? What keeps some of them current, while others disappear? How does an author imagine for himself the "archive" of his time, into which he proposes to put his text? What are the centers of diffusion by which texts circulate? For example, what equivalents in early nineteenth-century English culture are there for the French academies and the literary-scientific Parisian salons as agents of cultural dispersion and organization? Goldmann's theory of homologous structures, while it anticipates some of these questions, does not go far enough in beginning to answer them. Moreover, we need to understand with precision what role critical scholarship plays and has played in the production of "literary" works, a question raised seriously by both Wilde and Nietzsche. For 17 Foucault, The Archaeology of Knowledge, p. 3. 18 Michel Foucault, Raymond Roussel (Paris: Gallimard, 1963), p. 96. 342 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="17">example, how are the great philological discoveries contemporary with the European Romantic Movement influential in poetry, remembering that Coleridge, the Schlegels, Holderlin, Chateau- briand and others were writers with a deep interest in those discoveries? What method do we have for methodically assimilating such verbal institutions in a given social era as narrative, philology, history? In what way are etymology in philology, and plot succes- sion in the novel related? To call them all "textual phenomena" is hardly a satisfying answer, but so far this is all the answer we get. Of what moment to literary history are the rift in relations among language and philosophy and religion, which had been aligned together at the end of the eighteenth century, and the new rapprochement between language and natural science (comparative anatomy in particular) by the first third of the nineteenth century? Locke and Sterne; Balzac and Cuvier or Geoffrey de Sainte Hilaire. Here there is no question of derived ideas but of their inherent currency, or recurrency if you prefer. Any attention to these and similar questions must draw the critic very far into the rationale of his work. One of the unfortu- nate losses in contemporary critical discourse is that sense critics once had of their work as an intellectual adventure. An earlier tradition, which lasted until the middle of the eighteenth century, was the scholar's (or critic's) consideration of his life as having exemplary value; scholarly biography was a recognized genre. In both instances what the critic did, how he went from work to work, how he formulated the projects he undertook, were treated as meaningful parts of the methodological experience, not simply as anecdotal tidbits. I draw notice to these historical aspects of critical practice in order to approve their value for the future of critical discourse. Pedagogically, there is every good reason for regarding the choice of a subject and its formulation as being not only the beginning of a critical project, but also the critical project itself. If, therefore, we would have accounts by critics of what led them to a given project, why and how they fashioned the project, how they under- took its completion and in what context, we would have oppor- tunities for future study of a very important sort. Not only would it be possible to understand once and for all that criticism creates its subject matter-there are no problems lying about to be dealt with-but also young critics would understand criticism to be an activity whose main purposes are the enablement of learning and ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN 343</page><page sequence="18">the multiplication of critical discourse, from restriction to com- parative freedom. If critics today often feel that they are paralyzed by the sheer difficulty of finding a subject about which to write, it is because they have not realized the part of independent creation in criticism. For in a very deep way, critical discourse is still ensnared by a simplistic opposition between originality and repetition, in which all literary texts worth studying are given the former classification, the latter being logically confined mainly to criticism and to what isn't worth studying. I believe such schema to be hopelessly para- lyzing. They mistake the regularity of most literary production for originality, while insisting that the relation between "literature" and criticism is one of original to secondary; moreover, they overlook, in both traditional and modern literature, the profoundly important constitutive use of repetition-as motif, device, epis- temology, and ontology. 19 Perhaps it is not until the nineteenth century that such a view of repetition becomes explicit (in Kier- kegaard, Marx, Nietzsche, for instance), though Curtius and Auer- bach have taught us that that is not really the case. From its earliest beginnings narrative fiction, to take a further example, has been built around the tantalizing figure of the family, in which its recurring circumstantial perpetuity is tampered with (unsuccess- fully) by the upstart "original" hero. Why this modal constancy if not to preserve, maintain, repeat, the form of fiction within the "slow movements of material civilization"? As for the relationships in value between originality and ideas of novelty, of primacy, or of "the first"-this is a crucial matter. All critics take for granted that there is some connection between a great work and (on some level at least) its priority. Bloom's theory of influence is built around this notion, that a great work has power because it is, or was, first, that it came before and preempted others. Now such ideas also carry with them an ex- tremely crude understanding of what it means to be first, or to have come first. The necessity of such biological crudeness-it is biological, since "first" means "father" and "second" means "son"-for Bloom is unquestioned; he uses it, and it is by no means incidental to his poetics of misreading. 19 See my "On Originality," in Uses of Literature, ed. Monroe Engel, Harvard Studies in English, No. 4 (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1973), 49-65. 344 I CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page><page sequence="19">But for other critics priority is associated rather lackadaisi- cally with novelty, with coming or happening first, with simple precedence, as if history were like a series of children being born one after the other from past to present ad infinitum. An irre- ducibly serial, filiative conception of sociohistorical time such as this, totally obscures the very interesting problem of emergence, in which cultural phenomena are not simply ascribed priority or a miraculous "birth," but rather treated as a "family of ideas" emerging "permanently in discourse."20 Cultural events are not best understood as if they were human beings born on a certain day; the past is not a set of such births, and time does not move like a clock, in discrete succession. The history of science has learnt to deal with the emergence problem, why not literary theory? What are the limits to employing the human life cycle as a model of literary history? How really useful is a critical approach based on anthropomorphic units of originality like "work," "author," "generation," and so forth? What vocabulary can we employ that deals with human agency as well as the impersonal repeating discourse of literary structure? These are difficult questions to answer, but they are indispen- sable ones to the development of a critical discourse which will be intellectually serious and socially responsive in the largest humane sense. Only if the development occurs will it be possible dialecti- cally to assess the genuine force, in literary history and insti- tutions, of threats to coherence or order. There is no way to grasp these threats so long as cultural history is viewed as a lazy series of births and deaths. If culture is maintained materially then it cannot be dependent on events but on institutions constructed by men, these institutions also having an independent history of their own. The dialectical opposite of the repeating, maintaining material civilization to which I have been referring is an allied set of forces-Blackmur called them collectively the Moha21-whose presence in human life disturbs, wastes, troubles the numenal coercion of culture. One of the signal achievements of psycho- analytic criticism has been the attempt to deal with the Moha. Yet, 20 Ian Hacking, The Emergence of Probability: A Philosophical Study of Early Ideas About Probability, Induction and Statistical Inference (London: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1975), p. 17. 21 R. P.

ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN 1 345</page><page sequence="20">too often, symptology, or the mere willingness to consider this force as culturally deviant (whereafter it is confined to the neu- rotic weaknesses of the artist), has resulted. Recently the French attention both to Nietzsche and Freud has remedied the situation, but we need a more situated account of the Moha getting in to literature. This is a current of critical analysis begun effectively by Georges Bataille in 1933 with "La Notion de depense." 22 To date, the challenge has not been taken up except in Morse Peckham's Man's Rage for Chaos and in Richard Poirier's The Performing Self. 23 The interplay of order and disorder frames the essentially dispersed, diffused, disseminated sense of the literary text. Within that frame, however, there is an entire order of genetic questions, fearfully neglected since the 1944-45 Wimsatt-Beardsley attack on intention, an attack continued in Wimsatt's forceful "Genesis: A Fallacy Revisited," reprinted by Polletta. 24 Certainly one must feel that the irreducible dualities-subjective/objective, inside/outside, author/poem, and so on-held on to by Wimsatt and others extort too high a cost in understanding and discrimination. Furthermore, there is a large body of modern literature beseeching the reader to make intentional leaps into the author's psyche and into his own (see Trilling's essay, "On the Teaching of Modem Literature" or Blackmur's four essays, Anni Mirabiles).25 Strict boundaries between self and object, or ego and world, encourage a useful, yet preliminary, pedagogical discipline; nevertheless they are not about, and they do not describe anything more than, an analytic reality. Thus Goldmann writes: Every manifestation [of intellectual and artistic phenomena] is the work of its individual author and expresses his thought and his way of feeling, but these ways of thinking and feeling are not independent entities with respect to the actions and behaviour of other men. They exist and may be understood only 22"La Notion de depense," in La Part maudite (Paris: Minuit, 1967). 23 Peckham, Man's Rage for Chaos: Biology, Behavior and the Arts (Phila- delphia: Chilton Books, 1965); Poirier, The Performing Self (New York: Oxford Univ.

I see no particular use in constantly insisting that a poem is a solitary object, for it clearly is not. Each poem or poet is involun- tarily the expression of collectivities; what becomes an interesting theoretical problem for criticism is to determine how, or when, or where, the poet or his poem can be said to be a voluntary (i.e., personal and/or intentional) expression of difference and/or com- munity. Here genesis is not a simple empirical idea like birthdate, which has no special genetic power of explanation, but a con- ceptual test of critical interpretation. To admit that we now have only some genetic theses about literary production is quite another thing from saying categorically that there can never be a satis- factory genetic thesis. (See my comments above on the "emer- gence" problem.) A Luddite approach to what after all is in the critic's possession as a sentient rational historical being-the capacity to make genetic hypotheses-is a violent denial of some portion of his humanity. For genetic hypotheses, such as how or why such and such a work came to be written, are not one-way referrals of "a" work back to biography, or society, or whatever, just as iconic or textual studies need not always, and by definition, exclude the historical context surrounding the text. A genetic hypothesis admits the notion of human agency into the work-not a very daring idea in itself. But the obligation to rational interpre- tation along these lines goes further to include as part of the dialectic the critic's own shaping awareness of what he is doing. This awareness obviously increases and is refined in the very act of making a critical method. Perhaps one way of imagining the critical issue of aesthetic genesis is to view the text as a dynamic field, rather than as a static block, of words. This field has a certain range of reference, a system of tentacles, partly potential, partly actual-to the author, to the reader, to a historical situation, to other texts, to the past and present. In one sense no text is finished, since its potential range is always being examined, hence extended, by every addi- 26 Lucien Goldmann, The Human Sciences and Philosophy, trans. Hayden White and Robert Anchor (London: Jonathan Cape, 1969), p. 128. ROADS TAKEN AND NOT TAKEN I 347</page><page sequence="22">tional reader. Now the critic's task is obviously first to understand (in this case understanding is an imaginative act) how the text was and is made. No details, and their provenance, are too trivial, provided one's study is directed carefully towards the text as a vital aesthetic and cultural whole. The critic therefore mimes, or repeats, the text in its extension from beginning to whole, not unlike Pierre Menard. Or like Proust in his pastiches of Flaubert, Balzac, Renan, and the Goncourt brothers. In making over the authors he imitated, Proust set himself the aim of producing them from the opening to conclusion of a passage. Only by re-producing can we know what was produced and what the meaning of verbal production is for a human being: this is the quintessential Vichian maxim. And it is no less valid for the literary critic for whom the genesis of a human work is as relevantly interesting as its being, since both are infrangibly connected. I need add only one more thing to these last remarks. The prevailing ideology of even advanced literary criticism today is pronouncedly ethnocentric and seems indifferent to everything but the politico-social status quo. I shall not advocate any specific program to alter this, but will restrict myself to some observations and a final question or two. Every great age of literature and criticism has had organic ties with a dominant value system of some sort. All critics of the past have held fairly explicit views of man, his destiny, his goods, goals, nature. In other words, literary criticism has always contained some sense of its place in the process of human history. For reasons I cannot quite articulate, this is not true of contemporary critical discourse. In most instances it is disturbingly quietistic. Moreover, one gets no inkling from it that there are other literatures and languages than those of the Atlantic-European community, nor that vast segments of human society express other modes of aesthetic experience than the Occidental. That all this should be taking place as well in a world of exacerbated political and economic crisis increases one's wonderment at the ideological and evaluational silence of criticism today. What is the meaning of such silence? Need such silence be? Columbia University 348 | CONTEMPORARY LITERATURE</page></plain_text>
