Details of building procedures, shape, firing regime or decorative motifs, detectable for only a few fragments, are then tabulated for each variety. The result is a fully quantified record of ceramic variability which reveals both long-term trends and periods of relative stability or innovation. Five ceramic phases are distinguished (FCP1-5), the present volume covering FCP1-2 (traditional Early and Middle Neolithic) and a forthcoming volume FCP3-5 (Late and Final Neolithic). V.'s relative chronology allows different excavation areas within the cave and on the open Paralia below to be correlated, and within FCP2 she distinguishes five sub-phases. Diachronic variation within FCP1 is less consistent between trenches. The core of the volume is a thorough presentation of the excavation contexts and then of the ceramic var- ieties. Stratigraphic evidence for pits, the rarity of joining fragments and the virtual absence of recognisable activity areas suggest that the neolithic deposits are heavily disturbed. As V. observes, such disturbance poses potentially serious problems for bio-archaeological analyses which, because of Franchthi publication policy, have been conducted without the benefit of the ceramic relative chronology. V.'s ultimate focus is on potters' decisions and on the social and economic context within which they are made. In the final section 'From potsherds to people', she first considers the location and scale of pottery production. Most FCP1-2 wares (and vessels) were arguably produced locally, because of their abundance or diversity at Franchthi, because of their rarity else- where, or because they include vessels too large to be transported easily. For FCP1, detailed differences of technique suggest that each ware was made by different potters, and irregular shapes suggest limited expertise. FCP2 vessels are more adventurous yet more successful- ly executed, implying more experienced potters. FCP1-2 pots were hand-made, and firing clouds attest to baking in a fire in direct contact with fuel rather than in a kiln. The incidence of firing circles from the stacking of pots during firing, however, suggests that pots were made singly in FCP1 and in batches in FCP2. This argument is further supported by 'admittedly speculative calcula- tions' of the numbers of vessels discarded per year: perhaps c. 12-13, from at least five potters, in FCP1; c. 125-150, possibly from fewer potters, in FCP2. The assumption that most pots manufactured were disposed of on-site is unjustified, but the contrast between FCP1 and FCP2 in quantity of pottery is parallelled at Knossos. Turning to function, cooking pots are first identified in late FCP2, when two wares with good thermal shock resistance were used to make distinctive round-based bowls, often discoloured by use on a fire; with estimated volumes of c. 4-6 litres, these vessels are consistent with food preparation by family households. Cooking pots only account for perhaps 5-20% of the late FCP2 assemblage. Most of the FCP2 assemblage consists of fine 'Urf' ware (roughly equivalent to traditional neo- lithic Urfirnis). Through FCP2, Urf became progressive- ly harder and more fragile and was used for increasingly elaborate and ambitious shapes. Potters risked failure during manufacture, and early breakage thereafter, to make vessels more suited to display than everyday use. V. suggests a primarily ceremonial use for Urf, including feasting (for the common bowls), the burning of aro- matic or psycho-active substances (for many pedestalled basins and saucers with traces of scraping in the base of the bowl), and the consumption of fermented beverages (for a few deep bowls and jars with internal pitting). A ceremonial function can be inferred more tentatively for FCP1 pottery. The Franchthi material is not directly comparable with that from other EN-MN sites, because of the absence of fully quantified data from the latter, but some broader consideration of V.'s stimulating conclusions would have been welcome- if only because Franchthi may have been a seasonal herding camp or periodic meeting place rather than a permanent village like the more typical 'tell' sites. This omission does not, however, undermine the excellence of this imaginative, rigorous and admirab- ly lucid study. Publication of Franchthi has been slow, but this volume was well worth waiting for.

Pp. vii + 257 + illus. PNS. During the fourth millennium BC in Cyprus there arose a highly distinctive sculptural tradition for which the island is well known, comprising representations of females in pottery and stone. Like their precursors of Upper Palaeolithic Europe, they have traditionally been interpreted as 'mother goddesses' or 'fertility figures', the latter being a particularly attractive concept in Cyprus, the mythological birthplace and chief cult centre of Aphrodite in classical times. The temptation among scholars to 'read back' from the Graeco-Roman deity to the period of her supposed origins has been seductive and compelling, and many interpretations have chosen to treat the Chalcolithic and Bronze Age figurines precisely in this way, as prototypes of Aphrodite, normally referred to as the 'Great Goddess' or 'Mother'. The vague, generic image of a 'mother goddess' embodying all aspects of 'fertility', from sexuality and fecundity to procreation, motherhood, and life in general, may be contested on theoretical grounds as being subjective, undifferentiated, ahistorical and gender biased, much in the same way that recent critical studies of the Upper Palaeolithic 'Venuses' have done. Compounding these theoretical problems has been the lack of securely dated and provenanced material from Cyprus. Most female figurines of supposed Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age date are fragmentary and have unknown provenances or uncertain find contexts. Even when provenance can be determined, precise dating is hampered by lack of securely datable examples from settlement levels and, for the Bronze Age, the discovery of figurines in tombs spanning the course of several centuries. The author of the present book aims to chart a different course in the interpretation of this material. Shunning a priori interpretations and acknowledging the 226</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS lack of sufficient contextual evidence, a Campo estab- lished normative 'types' through multivariate analysis of selected formal characteristics of the figurines. Using the computer-based technique of multidimensional scaling (MDS), she is able to differentiate fundamental formal elements from less significant stylistic or decorative features. Two classes of coroplastic figurines have been chosen for the analysis: the Chalcolithic cruciforms well known from sites such as Kissonerga, Lemba, Erimi and Souskiou in the southwest of the island; and the so- called 'plank idols' of the Early Bronze Age, found primarily in the large cemetery sites of Lapithos and Vounous on the north coast. For the former, the norma- tive type yielded by MDS is a squatting female; other features, such as elongated necks, tilted heads, and outstretched arms, are secondary elements that account for variations on the standard type. For the plank figures, only the plank shape itself emerges as the standard element. Unlike the generic Chalcolithic types, plank figurines are highly individualized, as indicated by numerous variations in dress, headgear, facial markings, and personal ornamentation. C. adopts a two-pronged approach to the interpreta- tion of these artefacts. In the first chapter of the book, symbolic and functional aspects of representational art, in particular anthropomorphic figurines, are explored. Figurines, like other classes of artefact, have been designed and used for the purpose of fulfilling real social needs; as symbols of the cultural systems that created them, they both reflect and influence underlying social structures. In the second chapter, an overview of the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age cultures of the island is intended to serve as an historical and contextual backdrop to the interpretation of the symbolic patterns presented by the figurines. In the absence of direct contextual evidence, it is argued, the function and meaning of the figurines can best be interpreted by relating their fundamental formal elements to basic needs for survival. The latter, of course, are influenced by other aspects of culture such as social organization and method of subsistence. Thus for the Chalcolithic cruciforms, the basic formal element (a squatting female) is interpreted as a generalized symbol of female fertility reflecting the need of small scale societies for successful procreation. The more detailed, individualized plank types of the Early Bronze Age are linked to a very different symbolic system, one that has evolved from the generic concept of fertility to reflect the emergence of specific, elite social groups. It is further suggested (following Talalay's work on Neolithic figurines from Greece) that the plank figures may have been used in marriage contracts as part of patrilocal, exogamic practices. While C.'s fresh approach to the material is to be commended, her results fall short of the goals set forth in the introductory chapters. In the first place, the book (a delayed publication of her doctoral dissertation) is out of date with regard to recent archaeological material from Cyprus. Although major developments occurring in the field from the late 1980's are outlined in an adden- dum at the back of the book, these do not include discoveries made since 1990; nor are the results of any of these discoveries incorporated into her previous analysis. This is unfortunate, especially in the case of an important figurine deposit from the settlement site of Kissonerga near Paphos (discovered in 1987 with final publication by Goring in 1991) which for the first time has provided contextual evidence for a major group of Chalcolithic cruciform figurines. Secondly, the apparent objectivity of the analysis is marred by the fact that the figurines on which the study is based were not examined personally by the author. The formal criteria considered in the MDS analysis have been derived from published drawings, photographs, earlier typologies, and catalogue descriptions. In many cases only a single, frontal view is available in published accounts. Drawings and photo- graphs vary in extent and quality of detail, and rarely do they reveal evidence of wear marks or subtle morphol- ogical or decorative features. Finally, and most seriously, the author fails to fully integrate her results into the matrix of Cypriot prehis- tory. In the final pages of the synthesis (ch. 7), she hints at the social significance of the change during the Bronze Age from generic to specific figurine ('[it] might match a certain complexity in the social organization of early Cypriot society') but immediately abandons this line of thinking by insisting that it lies beyond the scope of the book to speculate about such matters. This contradicts the goals set out in earlier chapters, however, and prevents the book from making a truly significant contribution to our understanding of social complexity, gender roles, and other important issues of the prehis- toric past. As arguably the most important set of social symbols from the pre-state cultures of Cyprus, the cruciform and plank figurines of the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze periods furnish valuable evidence for the emergence of gender hierarchies and social elites during the second half of the third millennium. It is a pity that C., having developed a methodology that stands head- and-shoulders above previous approaches to the subject, has failed to realize the full potential of her analytical results.

The two volumes which make up Ancient Building in Cyprus represent, as with the previous two volumes on Palestine and Syria, an ambitious and far-reaching ideal. Wright has attempted the almost impossible task of pulling together a diverse range of data dealing with the built environment from the Aceramic Neolithic to the Roman Period. His aim is to provide '... a conveniently assembled resume of all the information relating to the subject presently scattered in disparate and often inac- cessible publication'. The aim is admirable, if not overly ambitious. Its very scope, however, is perhaps the greatest drawback and in the absence of specific data or detailed information throughout the text the reader is frequently left questioning the superficiality of the approach and the reliability of many of the premises and assumptions made. 227</page></plain_text>
