<plain_text><page sequence="1">Revels of a Gaudy Night VICTORIA CASS University of Minnesota I. Introduction One of the best-known works of Ming fiction was the Shui-hu chuan * #t (Tale of the Marshes), the story of the larger-than-life bandit-heroes who defied the corrupt imperial power of the Sung to establish a rebel-legitimacy. Certain episodes of the cycle were known in oral tradition as early as the Yiian, and by 1600 there were copies of an estimated seven versions in circulation. In the late Ming, however, mutations of the Tale of the Marshes appeared. Wu Sung, one of the central heroes of the story- cycle, appeared to take on a second fictional identity as a protagonist in the new novel Chin P'ing Mei  (The Plum in the Golden Vase).1 The erotic novel opens with one of the minor but nonetheless well-known episodes of the Shui-hu chuan.2 The episode details the adulterous affair between Hsi-men Ch'ing w'f and the gorgeous P'an Chin-lien A (Golden Lotus), the discovery of the affair by the cuckolded husband-the puny Wu Ta -k -and the lovers' murder of the husband by poison and suffocation. In the Shui-hu version, the episode is immediately brought to a close when Wu Sung a' , the brother of Wu Ta, murders the lovers and escapes to pursue more grand-scale battles and feats of adventure in succeeding episodes. The new erotic novel, however, allows the lovers to live on, for seventy-eight chapters and five years' worth of misadventure, before Wu Sung enters finally to exact his revenge. Thus the novel Chin P'ing Mei starts with a double setting; when a Ming reader first opened the erotic novel he had a double perspective on the events. Like a modern viewer sitting down to view Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, the Ming reader saw some well-known though trivial characters given a new literary existence. The Shui-hu setting of the parent novel is peopled with superheroes, mythical beasts, grand principles, huge mountains, and great marshes. The author of Chin P'ing Mei, however, quickly abandons the grandiose setting and carries out his tale in the teeming marketplace, among the low-life of Ch'ing Ho. Most of the novel is set among, and much is concerned with, the details of urban life: the business deals, the purchased love, the street trade, the holiday ritual, the food, clothing, furnishings, colors, smells, 1This paper is part of a larger work which is still in progress. The edition used is Chin P'ing Mei tz'u hua, the Taiwanese reprint of the Japanese Daian edition (Tokyo, 1963). For treatment of different editions see Patrick Hanan, "The Text of the Chin P'ing Mei," Asia Major (1962), 1-57. 2Cheng Chen-to has noted that the Hsi-men Ch'ing subplot from Tale of the Marshes was popular with theatre audiences as well, as the writer Shen Ching tI (1553-1610) used the subplot in one of his plays. Ch'a-t'u pen Chung-kuo wen-hsieh shih f1 9 [Illustrated History of Chinese Literature] (Peking, Tso-chia ch'u-pan she, 1957),IV: 921. 213</page><page sequence="2">214 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) brilliance, and gossip of a bustling, commercial world.3 The purpose of this discussion is to examine one lengthy description of the setting in the novel, and to ask how the masses of detail affect the novel's texture and tone. Some have praised the richness of detail, noting that these massive amounts of realistic data provide us with a sort of Ming encyclopaedia of daily life. Anna Seidel noted: "These descriptions [of funerals] are so rich in information on sixteenth-century popular religious practices that from 1974 to 1976 M. Soymid devoted a seminar to their study at the Ecole pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris."4 Wu Han in his work on the dating of the novel relied on the novel's details of economic and political practices. He notes: "An author, whether in some casual dia- logue, or in the narration of a certain topic under discussion, or in the description of some ordinary particular, will invariably convey the flavor of his contemporary period. In fact, though he takes the general stuff of his work from a period different from his own, yet he will reveal the bits and pieces of his own contemporary period."5 As useful as the masses of detail may be in helping us date the novel, or in studying Ming customs, the artistic import of such detail has yet to be fully analyzed. As I hope to show, detail in Chin P'ing Mei acts as a significant adjunct to theme. The novelist, in the descriptions of setting, no less than in his description of character and major event, is in full command of his craft. The details function metaphorically; the language of the prose descriptions is allusive and rich. In my analysis I am seeking to establish the significance of motifs that recur in descriptive passages. I will thus analyze not only the motifs as they occur in the novel, but also as they occur in literature other than the novel itself. In reconstructing the import of these motifs, I will primarily rely on Ming fiction, poetry and sui-pi 3S (miscellaneous notes), but I will also use Ch'ing sui-pi when the author includes Ming material. Since the novel is an historical work set in the Sung, I will also use Sung geographic descriptions that contain material on urban life. The passage I have chosen to analyze is a description of the Lantern Festival or yian hsiao EW (Primal Night), a holiday which occurs on the fifteenth of the first month of the lunar calendar. The Lantern Festival imagery is repeated several times in the novel, particularly in the slow-paced Chapters 41 through 46. The most elaborate treatment occurs in the first of the four occurrences in Chapter 15. My discussion will focus especially on the first occurrence, as it sets the connotations of the holiday as a major motif.6 3Goto Motomi '{ WE , "Kinpeibai no jidai haikei" ARW04@ , in Chugoku no hachidai, shosetsu 0i0DL Ak'J'R , ed.

He also discusses the origins of the holiday.</page><page sequence="3">CASS, Revels of a Gaudy Night 215 The essential function of the Lantern Festival motif is to portray humanity trapped in a world of grotesque dreams. We see people suspended and exposed, in a world of heightened sensations, and ecstatic moods. The Primal Night holiday is a nightmarish scene of eroticism and death fantasies in which human society loses its order and is seen as swarms of life and surges of energy. Creation is seen as chaotic and indiscrim- inate. The image is particularly suited to the first eighty chapters of the novel, for these chapters chronicle the rise and fall of Hsi-men Ch'ing. His erotic exploits parallel the mad celebrations of the holiday. Not surprisingly, then, the Lantern Festival descrip- tions recur four times in Chapters 1 through 79-and not at all in Chapters 80 through 100. Primal Night festivities serve as a summarizing metaphor for the events and subplots that characterize Hsi-men Ch'ing's life. The Primal Night imagery also serves as the central clue to understanding the novelist's implied attitude toward one of the chief concerns of the novel, eroticism. Erotic love in the novel plays a role that is neither simple nor obvious. It is not only seductive, destructive and short-lived-a sequence of transitory urges that delude-but also vital and creative, the essence of human energy. Eroticism thus presents a seem- ingly conflicting face; it betokens a world of impulse, but the impulse is also associated with a life-sustaining vitality. Several critics of Chin P'ing Mei, among them Paul Martinson,7 Sawada Mizuho,8 and Sakai Tadao,9 have all noted the novel's reliance on popular Ming ideas of morality and karmic retribution. The novelist's familiarity with the morality texts of the day, the shan pen A and pao chian W , is indeed apparent. One central function of the narrator in the novel seems to be to convey the expected popular moral judgments of the sort, "excess leads to disaster." The narrator, however, does not serve as chief representative or vehicle for the major themes of the novel. The narrator with his attendant comments and ethos in fact represents a minor theme. Chin P'ing Mei is in many ways an amoral book, for despite the sententious com- ments of the narrator, the novel is not an overgrown cautionary tale. The novel is concerned with integrity and truth in human action, but not with a strict code of social morality. The use of the Lantern Festival imagery serves to embody this paradox in Chin P'ing Mei. The image functions symbolically in a way that no single character or event does. Hence the submersion in the world of eros appears in the novel as a moment of awful necessity. It is a terror-filled jumping-off place that must precede the final phase of regeneration. The novel in its most condensed form is a journey that starts with a descent into the fantastic and disturbed, and then proceeds through confusion, out to a recombination of elements into a renewed life. The chaotic elements of Lantern Festival imagery suggest the standard images of initial and initiatory confusion in other literary works, such as the "selva oscura" in which Dante is lost, or the rabbit hole into which Alice drops so gracefully, or the strange dream world of the transmigration of souls, fictional heroes and story-book images in which Proust's narrator first loses 7Paul V.

The night-time world of eros is one of the central concerns of Chin P'ing Mei, and a grasp of its meaning and function is essential to a careful reading of the novel. Chapter 15 of Chin P'ing Mei contains the first reference to the Lantern Festival. After translating the description, I will discuss the motif of the Primal Night and its relationship with the rest of the novel. II. Translation from Chapter Fifteen1o The fine ones take smiling pleasure in enjoying the house of lanterns. The intimate guest buys love with his cronies at the House of the Gorgeous Spring. The sun drops to the western mountain; The moon comes up to the East; One hundred years of light and shadow seem a floating sail. Tip your head and you've just wanted the vermillion-cheeked maid. Blink your eye and you transform into a white-haired old gaffer. How easily do our lives age; yet we should not pass it carelessly. Even if you could sweep up the heavens with your riches and rank; yet it all equals the cloudy vacuum. Why not, then, get for yourself the red-skirted diversions. Trust to the kingfisher; cleave to the red, in the center of the Houses. Let the tale proceed through the rapid passage of time, till we come down to the fifteenth of the first month. Hsi-men Ch'ing had just sent off his servant Tai An on the day before the holiday to make a formal presentation of four bowls of pickled vegetables, two bowls of long-life peaches, one jug of wine, one bowl of long-life noodles, and one bolt of heavy pongee, woven with metallic thread. He enclosed a card on which he had written: "Mistress Wu 4 of the Hsi-men house conveys cordial greetings." He presented it all to Li P'ing-erh (Vessel Child) in acknowledgement of her birthday. Vessel Child had just arisen and was preparing her toilet. She called Tai An into her bedroom and spoke with him: "It's just a few days ago that I troubled the goodwife, and now I've had her waste herself again with these presents on my account." "My Goodwife has often received your generosity," Tai An replied, "and my master, Father Hsi-men, would but reciprocate generously with you, Second Goodwife. The negligible few gifts are to give to your own people." Vessel Child turned then and directed Ying-ch'un iS (Welcome Spring) to prepare a table in the reception room, and had her arrange four dishes of food and serve them to Tai An. As the boy was about to leave he was given two silver coins, and one handkerchief with the eight-treasure motif. "When you get home would you reciprocate for me to your several Goodwives of the house. I'll send off now for Lao Feng 2, (Old Woman Feng) so she can bring you all invitations. Come what may I expect you all to grace me with a visit here tomorrow." Tai An bowed deeply and left; and the two bearers each received one hundred pennies. 1oThe translation is my own.</page><page sequence="5">CASS, Revels of a Gaudy Night 217 So Vessel Child Li sent Old Feng with five invitation cards within an envelope to have her invite Wu Yiieh-niang AfJ4 (Goodwife Moon) to come along on the fif- teenth, with Li Ch'iao-erh R, (Beautiful Child Li), Meng Yii-lou fI? (Jade House Meng), Golden Lotus P'an, and Sun Hsiieh-o =l (Snow-Maiden Sun). Vessel, how- ever, set aside one card. Secretly she sent it to Hsi-men Ch'ing and asked him to come for dinner on the evening of the fifteenth day. The next day Goodwife Moon left Snow-Maiden Sun to watch the house; and with Beautiful Child, Jade House and Golden Lotus they left the house by palanquin. They all wore floral-patterned clothes of figured silk. The four servants Lai Hsing  , Lai An R , Tai An and Hua T'ung i followed after them through the city festooned with lanterns on their way to the house on Lion Street which Vessel Child had recently bought. On the street side of the house were four rooms; and altogether there were three compounds. One storied structure overlooked the street. Once through the main gate they passed the side apartments. There were three rooms on each side, and one parlor as well. Going farther in they threaded their way back to the third compound, where there were three bedrooms and a kitchen. In the rear, the wall of the house was right up against the garden of the Chiao family, who were relatives of the Imperial family. Vessel Child knew that Goodwife Moon and the others were coming to view the lanterns. In the storey overlooking the street she had erected standing screens, tables, and mats, and suspended many decorated lanterns. Vessel first greeted the women in the parlor and then, seeing the ritual salutations were complete, she brought them into the reception hall to serve them tea. In the back apartments they changed clothes and set out the tea; but it's not necessary to relate all this in detail. At noon Vessel set four tables with mats in the parlor, and called for the singers Tung Ch'iao-erh l (Beautiful Child Tung) and Han Ch'in-sun &amp; #II (Golden Bracelet Han) to accompany their feasting with music. All the wine and food-five rounds of wine and three courses of food-had been set up in the upstairs room on mats at the front of the house. Vessel then invited all her guests to ascend to the upstairs to amuse themselves in viewing the lanterns. From her own rooms she had hung both a Hsiang River mottled bamboo curtain and variegated lanterns. Goodwife Moon Wu wore a crimson floral long-sleeved jacket, a beautiful green silk skirt, and a sable jacket. Beautiful Child Li, Jade House Meng and Golden Lotus P'an all wore white damask jackets and indigo silk shirts. Beautiful Child was in a deep incense-colored floor-length cape woven with metallic thread. Their hair was piled up with kingfisher and pearl, with phoenix pins stuck aslant. Behind their temples they bore clusters of multi-colored lantern ornaments. They arranged themselves at the upstairs window to look down below. They saw the masses of people gathered together, amid the city festooned with lanterns. It was totally wild and boisterous. Directly down in the street were arranged several tens of lantern frames. All make and manufacture of goods were bought and sold all around on every side. The men and women who came to amuse themselves among the lanterns were flower-red and willow-green. The carriages and horses rumbled and thundered; and the fiery Ao mountain soared up to the Stars of the Milky Way. Have you ever seen such a finely festooned city of lanterns? But look:</page><page sequence="6">218 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) A threading through the mountain rock: a pair of dragons play mid-water; There's brilliance in the cloudy haze: the lonely crane looks to heaven.

Displays of the diviners: a cluster of clouds; Tents of the prognosticators: a net of stars; All expounding on what sort of fortune the new spring brings; And fixing on the measure of one's glory and decay.

Vendors with their high mounds of Primal Nights all stuffed with fruit. Hawkers with their rows of pasted plum blossoms. The trimmed spring beauty wears pins aslant behind her temples that are teased by the spring wind. The silk-bound cool pins atop the head let fly golden rays in the shining sun. Standing screens, painted like the damask curtains of the doomed Shih Ch'ung. Beaded curtains colored with the paired clarity of the plum and moon. Though we can never see the whole of the realm of the Ao mountain Yet let us meet with a year of delight and fruition. Goodwife Moon Wu looked on for a while; but she saw that the scene below was chaotic. So together with Beautiful Child Li she returned to the mats to have some wine. Only Golden Lotus P'an and Jade House Meng remained above with the two singers. As they leaned from the upstairs window, they looked down to the people below. Golden Lotus P'an straight away pulled back her white sleeves. She exposed ten fingers as slender as spring onions, with their six gold stirrup-shaped rings. As she stretched out over the window ledge, she cracked some melon seeds in her mouth and spit them out down onto the people below. Together with Jade House she laughed and chattered away. After a while Golden Lotus pointed out: "Big Sister, look there at the two jade hydrangea lanterns that hang below the eaves of that house-one coming and one going: bumping up and down. But it is so pretty!" In a bit she said again: "Second Sister! Come now and look at the big fish lantern carried on the frame at the gate there facing us. Beneath it are lots of little fish and crabs that trail along. It is really funny!" Then again she called out to Jade House Meng: "Third Sister, look up ahead! This Old Lady lantern, and that Old Man lantern." But just as they were looking, a gust of wind suddenly surged up and sliced a hole in the bottom half of the Old Lady lantern. When the women above saw it they gave out peals of laughter, which provoked the attention of the people below who had come to watch the lanterns. Down below it was shoulder to shoulder, back to back, faces upturned to stare above: a crowd of people with not a place to squeeze through; all were pressed and trampled in the herd. About then, a few vagrants who were clustered within the noisy mob pointed up to the window, and had a bit of a discussion together. "Certainly those are the ladies of the house from some noble family," said one. Another one then again took a guess. "Those are the lovely concubines of the nobility and of imperial descendants; for if not, they would never be so festooned." Then that one said, "Why, isn't it that some great family has hired the girls from one of the 'Houses' and summoned them here to watch the lanterns and sing." Then one came over closer and said: "Oh, I recognize them. None of you has guessed it. If you say they are singers, why would they place those four from the back out there? But now, let me tell you who, in fact, those two women are. They're not from the house of some nobody. Those are the wives of Yama, the God of Hell, the handmaidens of General Five Roads, God of Thieves. Those are the women of Master Hsi-men who lends money among officials and owns a medicine shop in front of our provincial gate. Why make trouble with him! I think he must have come along here to watch the lanterns with them. I don't know who this one is with the green floor-</page><page sequence="8">220 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) length gold-threaded cape; but that one wearing the red floor-length cape and the kingfisher feather flowers looks just as if she might be the wife of Master Wu Ta who sold roast cakes. Master Ta caught her in flagrante in the tea shop of Old Woman Wang, and the grand official Hsi-men kicked him to death and took Wu Ta's wife to be his own. "After that Wu Ta's younger brother Wu Sung returned from the Eastern Capital and brought an indictment. But Wu Sung then beat to death the black-garbed runner Li Wai-chuan; and the great officials drove him off into exile. For a few years now she hasn't been seen about; now I see how appealingly she's turned out." Just as he was speaking an altercation arose. Someone said "You rubbish! Why are you pointing? Get out!" From the upstairs Goodwife Moon saw how large the crowd of people was below the window. She called in Golden Lotus and Jade House to return to the mats to listen to a couple of Lantern Lyrics which were being played and then to drink some wine. After they had sat for a while, Goodwife Moon wished to arise and leave. III. The Passage Analyzed This first description of the hubbub of Lantern Festival occurs in Chapter 15, at a key moment in the novel. It is three chapters after Hsi-men Ch'ing encounters Vessel Child, and three chapters before he finally takes her as his own sixth wife. We see thus arrayed in this chapter the chief female personae of the first eighty chapters of the novel. The later recurrences of the festival in Chapters 24, 42 through 46, and Chapter 79 build on the symbolism and themes established in Chapter 15. The three chief aspects of the festival exploited as symbols by the novelist are 1) the appearance of the lanterns, 2) the mood associated with early spring, and 3) the connotations of crowds and masses of people. A. Lantern Imagery Celebrating the sign of the Primal Night festival, the crowd and the women view a multiplicity of figures and forms depicted by the lanterns. Predominant among the lanterns are representations of people: "Graduate-scholar lanterns, . . . Good Dame of the House lanterns, . . ." The array covers a range of human stereotypes, and the bobbing and bumping of the lamps now animated by the wind suggests the elaborate erotic pas de deux of all the characters of the novel. The lanterns in Chapter 15, however, are not simply anthropomorphic in general, but represent, more specifically, the central characters of the novel itself. The author, in fact, presents the displayed lanterns as interchangeable with the wives and concubines who are out to enjoy them. The first two lanterns mentioned in the extended lantern poem are the names of two of the female characters, the two women who are watching the lanterns at that moment: "Golden Lotus lantern, Jade House lantern, reveal a row of pearly orbs". The prose description provides further suggestions as to the lantern-persona met- aphor. As the women stand in the balcony the novelist notes the detail that they bore on their temples: lantern ornaments. They thus appear as part of the festooned building, their headdress an echo of the lanterns behind them. The women thus appear as another brilliant cluster among the objects displayed in the city. The reader's eye moves from the lanterns in the eaves of Vessel's house to the clothing of the women, to the lantern</page><page sequence="9">CASS, Revels of a Gaudy Night 221 hair-ornaments, and finally to the lanterns in the street; and all appear as items in a display. In exploiting the anthropomorphic aspect of the lantern, the author was relying on a well-known Ming association: lantern as a symbol of human nature. The Ming sui- pi by Lang Ying  (1487-c. 1566), the Chi hsiu lei kao ( -;e ), says about lanterns under the heading "metaphors for human nature": "Lamp oil is taken to be one's pneuma (ch'i 7) and the wick as one's character. The flicker of the lantern is thus one's soul; and to the extent it illuminates things around it, would be thus one's abilities. When it grows hot, that is eros (hsing 1h)."" In addition to serving as a secular symbol of human nature, the lantern also figures prominently as a religious symbol. The lanterns of the novel function in a similar fashion to the lanterns of the Taoist ceremony of fen teng  . Both symbolize one's essential nature. The lamp of one's fundamental destiny (pen ming teng 4i@ ) is lit in a Taoist rite of expiation.12 It is seen as the earthly symbol of the star of one's destiny. If the lamp goes out, death follows shortly. The author of Chin P'ing Mei was obviously well aware of the religious significance of the lantern, for he describes the ritual in detail. When Vessel Child lies dying, a Taoist monk performs the lantern rite on her behalf. He erects 27 candles, each intended to represent a year of her life. When they are extinguished he accurately predicts her death.13 The ritual apparently penetrated the world of fiction, for we see it as well in San-kuo yen-yi =-- . As Chu-ko Liang prays to his star of destiny, he also lights the pen ming teng. In a wonderfully ironic sense, typical of the epic novel, the lantern is extinguished at the very last moment. Just as the ritual is about to conclude successfully, an agitated, frightened officer rushes into the tent and knocks over the lamp by mistake; and Chu-ko Liang, like his fragile symbol the lamp, is also shortly thereafter extinguished.14 The author of Chin P'ing Mei thus relies on an established lantern mythology that is partially religious and partially secular. Lantern and candle imagery appears fre- quently in the text. Man (or woman) as a flicker of lantern light is one of the more persistent images in the narrator's homilies. The "viewers take heed" (K'an kuan S ) passages often contain some simplistic, moralistic advice of the standard "beware the evils of sex" variety. But the imagery used is significant. In Chapter 79 as Hsi-men Ch'ing lies dying the narrator notes, "Master Hsi-men did not know that, like a lantern whose oil is dried up and light gone out, his seed was spent and his life finished."'5 The lanterns arrayed for the Primal Night holiday not only represent mankind or human nature, but also, more specifically, certain aspects of humanity. They suggest humanity at its most chaotic, most vulnerable and most transitory. It is a view of life as a carnival: brilliant but short-lived. The brilliance of the lantern display is one of the most striking aspects of the prose and poetic description. The passage abounds in color and light words: "pearly orbs" (chu-chi 4 ) and "embroidered streamers" (hsiu-tai W ), with "figured silks" (chin- "Lang Ying I3 , Ch'i hsiu lei kao t.9iM (Peking, 1961), ch. 16, p. 241. 12For a discussion of the lantern in Taoist mythology see Hou Ching-lang, Les monnaies d'offrandes et la notion de la trdsorerie dans la religion chinoise (Paris, 1975), pp. 120-121; K.

Similarly, the women's clothes present a brilliant spec- trum: "crimson" ta hung Ar, "floriate pattern" chuang hua (E , "white damask" pai ling , "green and blue" lii lan E, "deep incense-colored cloth "shen hsiang se" i~5 and "pearl and kingfisher ornaments" chu ts'ui ; and throughout the description of women's clothes is the repeated word for "gold threaded" fabric chin Again the author is exploiting standard views of Lantern Festival decoration. The Ming author Hsieh Chao-che (1567-1624) says: "House by house the lantern fires glow and shine like broad daylight."'16 Another Ming author, Lang Ying, says: "The floriate lanterns entered one's vision: a cluster of starry heights."'17 The brilliance appears as a festival of lights to beat off the long night: "The lantern fire burned in the sky to fight the night's chill."'8 The spectacle of the nighttime profusion of lanterns is one of the most consistently mentioned of the holiday. The city seems to have been transformed on these nights. Liu T'ung SU1 (d. 1637), in his description of Ming Peking not only describes the array of lights of Peking but cites from a large selection of Ming poets who depict the brilliance of the display.'9 Indeed, the image of glistening, bobbing lanterns fills all poetic accounts of the holiday. The collection of Ming popular poetry, the Sheng shih hsin sheng ts~ , opens with the color and dazzle of the holiday.20 The material collected in the Ku-chin t'u shu chi-ch'eng &amp; # M also repeatedly describes the dazzling array of lanterns.2' The brilliance of the spectacle dates at least from the Sui. During the Sung, Wu Tzu-mu  notes in his Meng Liang lu RA that "the lantern balls suspended in the sky looked from afar like flying stars."22 In addition to the sense of brilliance, there is a sense of chaos. The array of lanterns appears as all creation massed together in disorder. Almost one-third of the long lantern poem is a list. The catalogue of types of lanterns begins with plant forms, jumps quickly to human, then to divine, demonic, and animal and fish. There is no sense of order, rank, logic, or hierarchy. Plant forms receive the same treatment as model wives. Old hags and monks, good scholars and crabs all appear on a par. The rhetorical device of enumeration creates a sense of chaotic multiplicity. From a view of creation as chaotic we move to a view of creation as demonic. When distinctions based on the hierarchy of reason disappear, the animal merges with the human. The Sung account of the Lantern Festival celebrations in the Tung-ching meng- hua-lu , also emphasizes demon imagery. The account describes the lanterns as the artifice of demons (kuei kung WT ),23 an expression which is echoed in poetic accounts. Similarly, as the old woman lantern of the Chin P'ing Mei pretends to summon evil spirits (hsieh shen WY1 ), or as the frog swallows treasures and the fish and dragons roll together, we are again in a world dominated by creatures.

The lanterns appear as dangling from houses or frames, twisting in the wind, and exposed. The prose description and the poem emphasize that the lanterns hang from structures and bump and toss about in the spring wind. The poem says: "Revolving lanterns, one coming, one going./ Suspended lanterns, some rising, some dropping" tE {Mi~ A . They are mJ~o . They are moving, but going nowhere, and openly exposed to the eyes of others. Thus the final pronouncement of the voice from the crowd on the identity of Golden Lotus is logically an act of exposure. It blandly relates her sordid affair with Hsi-men Ch'ing, Wu Ta's murder, and Wu Sung's exile. The synopsis of the plot is hardly a necessary summary, P'an Chin-lien's identity is not in doubt to the reader. The brief narration is an extension of the metaphor of the lantern suspended only temporarily. The anecdote serves to expose Golden Lotus and announce the parameters of her existence; she is guilty of Wu Ta's murder and thereby exists at the mercy of Wu Sung. The voice from the crowd reminds the reader of Golden Lotus' ultimate fate. Like the lanterns, Golden Lotus' secrets are on view. Just as the lanterns are exposed to the wind, so are the women exposed to their fates. They are all, in this moment of brilliance and chaos, vulnerable. Frequently the cloth imagery functions to suggest the frailty of the lanterns. In addition, the novel exploits, in later references to the Lantern Festival, standard associations of the holiday with darkness. The holiday was primarily considered to be a nighttime holiday. The term for the fifteenth of the first month is Primal (hsiao W or ye ). The lanterns described in Chapters 24 and 45 all hang suspended in the night. The nighttime pro- vides a sense of consuming blackness surrounding the limited glow of the lanterns. The novelist here relies on one of the most basic associations of Primal Night celebrations: the sense that the lunar-calendar holiday confronts the long night in early spring (solar calendar: about March 20-30). The Sung encyclopedia, T'ai-p'ing yi-lan iman , cites a now-lost section of the Shih chi We on the origins of the holiday, saying that "it was originally a ritual sacrifice to T'ai-i ic " originating in the Han during which the praying continued from dusk into dawn.24 Whatever the accuracy of the statement in terms of origins, it captures the general connotation of the holiday: a festival of lights to ward off the enveloping darkness. The sense of disaster approaching is an important aspect of the prose description in Chapter 15 of the novel. It is suggested not only by the voice from the crowd and Golden Lotus foolishly inciting their interest, but by the image of the broken lantern that so appeals to the woman who watches it. As the wind tears a hole in the lantern we see an omen of what will happen to P'an Chin-lien. Golden Lotus often seems, like old Grandmother Feng whose services she uses so well, to be a knowing and manipulative old witch. She is like the cynical old hags of the novel. Hence when Golden Lotus lets out a peal of laughter heedless of the ominous interest she draws from below, we have an eerie premonition of the concubine's future; the torn lantern foreshadows the moment when Golden Lotus is herself, in Chapter 83, eviscerated by Wu Sung. Aside from the physical vulnerability of glowing fabrics suspended in blackness, there are the temporal limitations of a holiday that lasts three to five days. Hsieh Chao- che in his Wu tsa tsu w 0 f describes the times when lanterns are set up and when 24Li Fang FJ , T'ai p'ing yi-lan k~'SR (Shanghai, 1960), ch. 30, p. 2a.</page><page sequence="12">224 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) removed. "In the Min regions the lanterns remain up for ten days; in the rest of the subcelestial realm they were only up for five."25 Most other accounts agree that the duration of the holiday is five days and the sign for the beginning of the festival is the suspending of lanterns: the sign of the end is their removal. Thus we return to the narrator's sententious comment made in Chapter 79 when Hsi-men Ch'ing dies. The comment is made near the end of the Lantern Festival-the fourth one described in the novel-as Hsi-men Ch'ing grows fatally ill. During the sickness, we are told that we are progressing through the days of the holiday though "the lanterns are not suspended." During the progression Hsi-men Ch'ing's penis remains erect, burning out, spewing semen and finally air. Finally on the twenty-first Hsi-men dies, and he is removed from the drama, just as the lanterns would be removed from display. B. Spring Imagery In describing the gloomy, transitory, doom-laden aspects of the lantern imagery we have ignored one of the most important aspects of the motif. The holiday of the full moon of the first month is a holiday celebrating the resurgent powers of spring. To return again to one of the terms for the holiday, yian hsiao W (Primal Night), we lay the emphasis now on the word yian, prime. The Jung-chai sui-pi Ma notes that the term yian refers to the Taoist term shang yian ?_t , the first prime.26 Shang yian denotes the creative power of the spring season and hence coincides with the early part of the new year. (The second of the threefold powers is chung yian f , which occurs on the fifteenth of the seventh month in summer, and the third is hsia yian Tid , whose celebration occurs in the fifteenth of the tenth month.)27 The central associations of the term shang yian are growth, sun and heat. It is clearly a paradoxical association to join images of the temporary, the fragile and the exposed, with the imagery of optimism, resurgence, spring and creativity; but it is an association culturally implicit in the term yian hsiao and metaphorically exploited by the novelist. The passage from Chapter 15 abounds in images of heightened perceptions, ex- panded feelings, celebrations, soaring and love. One such image occurs in the prose lines that immediately precede the long descriptive poem. "All make and manufacture of goods were bought and sold ... and the men and women who came to amuse themselves among the lanterns were flower-red and willow-green. The carriages and horses rumbled and thundered; and the fiery Ao mountain soared up to the Stars of the Milky Way." The images of male and female seen in the traditionally erotic colors of red and green and enjoying the lanterns in the busy market place suggest a springtime urban fertility rite with the coinage of exchange parallel to the seeds sown during an agrarian festival. This brief scene of urban prosperity and gaiety is the setting for the last item on the list, the Ao mountain that sends the spirits soaring. The Ao mountain is one of the sacred mountains born by the giant tortoise in the Eastern sea. During 25Hsieh, Wu tsa tsu, pp. 90-91. 26Hung Mai A, , Jung ch'ai sui-pi wu chi W W $ ?

This moment, which was the focal point of the festival, served chiefly as a symbol of the creativity and beneficent power of the renewed year. Eroticism in the novel has some of these same connotations; it is associated with fertility, excitement, expanded awareness and transcendence. The references to femi- nine display and to women as "red-skirted diversions" are the focal points of the description of the Lantern Festival. First we see the women in parade through the streets forming a cavalcade of colors, and then again on the balcony. The poem refers twice to geishas: "Mistresses of their trade go arm in arm; and from those heights expose their charms with bewitching softness." The poem culminates its list of cele- brants with the appearance of women, and when the prose passage recommences, the women appear to draw the curiosity of the spectators upward (p. 16). A central activity of the Lantern Festival is, in fact, the parade of feminine charms. In the festivals depicted in Chapters 42 and 46 the women set forth from the household to go through the city streets. The parade of women is occasioned by the "Walk of the One Hundred Illnesses," another regular part of the Lantern Festival celebrations.29 The walk, according to one Ming writer, is predominantly a feminine procession. Again the novelist is embroidering on Ming conventions. The Lantern Festival often appears as a time of a sexual initiation-an urban rite of spring. The Sung collection of material pertaining to seasonal holidays, Sui-shih kuang-chi agr (The Com- prehensive Record of the Seasons of the Year) by Ch'en Yiian-ching 7c~ , contains several tales exploiting the erotic significance of the Primal Night.30 The stories concern fateful encounters of a young man with a mysterious woman who introduces him to the delights of love, but who disappears with the dawn or with the voiced suspicions of a reasonable friend. The woman may appear briefly, brilliantly costumed, or com- municate mysteriously in elliptical verse. She is invariably exotic, her powers indis- putable, but her benefits are short-lived. One example of the type is the tale of "Chang Sheng Who Encounters a Woman on Primal Night.""'31 On that night a woman in a gorgeously-arrayed carriage com- municates her desire to meet Chang. The tryst is to occur one year later on the night of the same festival. Chang Sheng's encounters on the two Lantern Festivals receive even more elaborate treatment at the hands of one of the tellers of colloquial language tales. The twenty-third story from the Yii-shih ming-yen It#W' collection contains the story "Chang Shun-mei Gets a Beautiful Woman on Lantern Festival Night."32 In the colloquial version not only is the plot more fully told, the details of the setting of the festival are also more elaborate. Still another colloquial-language tale has employed the Lantern Festival setting. The festival provides a romantic backdrop for the tale "Yang Szu-wen Meets an Old Friend in Yen-shan."33 The setting in this tale very closely resembles the setting as it 28Hu Chi-tsung k , Shu-yen ku-shih ta ch'ian ~r (Tokyo, 1887), ch. 10, pp. 8b-9a. 29Hsieh, Wu tsa tsu, pp. 91-93. 30Ch'en Yiuan-ching, Sui-shih kuang-chi, pp. 124-29. 31Ibid., pp. 124-25. 32Feng Meng-lung  , YU shih ming yen %&amp;@8 (Taipei, 1978), ch. 23. 33Ibid., ch. 24.</page><page sequence="14">226 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) is used in Chin P'ing Mei. In the story of Yang Szu-wen, a man encounters not simply a lover, but a woman who is the ghost of his former wife. The encounter leads eventually to disaster as she finally, out of jealousy, drowns both her former husband and his new wife. The tale exploits the eroticism and sense of mystery of the Lantern Festival holiday. Jaroslav Prusek has pointed out that the original classical-language version of the tale provides no details of setting. He has commented that the setting in the colloquial story enhances the sense of nostalgia.34 It does a good deal more; it focuses the theme of dangerous romantic encounters, sharpens the mood of mystery, and heightens the sense of eroticism, for to a Ming reader the term Primal Night was rich in all these connotations." The romantic encounters of the Primal Night are characterized, moreover, with a sense of the semi-divine and preordained. These are not chance meetings with mere mortals. They are meetings with spirits. The descriptions in general have a sense of transcendence, for momentary concourse with the divine. The Sung collection of tales associated with holidays, the Sui shih kuang chi, contains several stories of divine journeys in Lantern Festivals. In the tales, emperors roam to divine precincts, to view the divine lanterns.36 The divine nighttime journey has, in fact, a distinguished tradition in vernacular fiction. The Tun-huang pien-wen tale, the Yeh Ching-neng shih a3f~ , tells the story of a Primal Night journey of the Emperor Hsiian Tsung.37 The Taoist magician Yeh Ching-neng escorts the emperor on two fantastic flights, one to the far reaches of the empire on Primal Night, and another to the moon on the lunar festival of the eighth month. Thus magical flight, moons and yiian-hsiao lanterns seem to be associated motifs as early as the ninth century. The poem in the translated passage from Chin P'ing Mei contains several references to the divine realms: "the Isle of Ying," "the Garden of Lang," "the Ao mountain." The Sung account of the city decorations in the Tung-ching meng-hua-lu also de- scribes the decorations of the Lantern Festival as having an aspect of the divine: "They set up two frames that were twenty or thirty feet tall, gauzy colored ties of paper draped from them with playthings and dolls suspended from the top. The wind blew them about turning around like flying transcendents,"38 and again the displays are described "depicting the tales of divinities and transcendents."39 Related to the imagery of transcendence is the imagery of fertility. The other three occurrences of the Lantern Festival in the novel contain much fertility symbolism. The fertility in these passages, however, like the eroticism and fertility of the Primal Night, is transitory, even endangered. Cracked melon seeds, often given by a woman as a gift to her lover, are strewn on spectators in Chapter 15, and thrown on the floor in Chapter 24. Coins and money are lost, stolen, misused and squandered in Chapters 42 through 46. Babies are endangered and associated with stolen money and misplaced 3'Jaroslav Prulek, Chinese History and Literature (Prague, 1970), p. 371. 35Ku Lu, Ch'ing chia lu, ch. 1, p. 116.

The chief fertility images of seeds, coinage and infants40 are thrown to waste during the Lantern Festival. Hence the lantern poem in Chapter 15 has several images of plundered, swallowed and stolen treasure. Finally in Chapter 79, the last Primal Night of the novel, Hsi-men Ch'ing wastes his own seed. He has a virtual orgy of erotic encounters. Thus he flagrantly ignores the well-known Taoist and Buddhist strictures against repeated male orgasm as de- structive of the male life-force. He is but carrying out the metaphor established in Chapter 15: the Primal Night as symbol of expansive, transcending and self-endan- gering eros. C. Crowd Imagery As Golden Lotus and Jade House look down below them onto the city streets the narrator devotes several lines to describing the appearance of the mob. The press of people is described as a mobile, surging mass. People with their shoulders and backs pressed together, they move like a herd of beasts. There is no room for any one person to progress through. The image of the city on Primal Night is one of a mass of sub- human energy. Other references to the city during the later Primal Nights of the novel are consistent in this use of the image. In Chapter 24 we read: "The roaming people were like swarms.""41 In Chapter 42 we read: "When Tai An set up the firecrackers in the middle of the street and then, after a bit, lit them up, the surrounding spectators from the two sides of the street pressed together shoulder to shoulder, and back to back: it was impossible to tell how many. They all said the grand official Hsi-men Ch'ing was setting off fireworks here, so everyone came to watch."42 The Sung accounts of the cities both refer to parades of people roaming en masse.43 The image of the city as a swarm is best captured in a Ming story from the Erh p'ai collection, "Young Man Thirteen Looks up to Heaven at the Age of Five." This story, which also plays on the imagery of fertility, excitement and danger of the Primal Night festivities, describes the sensations of being amid a large gathering to watch firecrackers: "At this point Wang Chi was swept up amid a thicket of people. Because he carried the little boy on his back and was thus considerably inconvenienced, all he could do was shift his feet, crane his neck, look upward and glance sideward. As he looked before him the crowd slowly pressed on him so his legs were crushed, his torso was bent, his shoulders were squeezed, his sweat seemed pressed out of him and his breath exhausted." Parallel to the imagery of the mob of Primal Night is the imagery of human voices as cacophony. The Ao mountain celebrations referred to in Chapter 15 are moments of cheers and shouts. Noisemaking appears in the novel as one of the central activities '0oAnna Seidel, in her review of Hou Ching-lang's monograph on funeral money (see note 12), discusses the belief that one's life was considered to be a stockpile of money which could be squandered or preserved (History of Religions, 17 [1978], 423-24).

A Ying, in his study of the Lantern Festival, emphasizes the relationship between the popularity of the festival during the Ming and the development of a commercial class (Hsiao-shuo hsien t'an, p. 218). He discusses the holiday as a chiefly urban phenomenon that provided an opportunity for the opening of the markets for trade.

In Chapter 2445 and again in Chapter 4446 the author provides lengthy descriptions of the sights and especially sounds of fireworks display. The description says the sound reverberated, exploded, shook the heavens. Deafening noise is as much a part of the holiday as brilliant lights. Hsi-men Ch'ing acquires on Primal Night a great gong. As part of the holiday he sets up and strikes the gong: "The sound went up to the skies and the reverberation awakened the birds of the air and the fish in the sea."47 Again the novelist is relying on standard Ming and Sung associations of Primal Night festivities. The Comprehensive Record of the Seasons of the Year says that: "Before the houses music played the tune of The Nine Completions. And below the building people shouted out the sound of Wan Sui."48 The Tung-ching meng-hua-lu lays great emphasis on the musical, noisy cacophony that characterizes the celebrations.49 Several sui-pi devote sections to noisemaking, usually under a special heading: "roistering the Primal Night" (Nao yian hsiao PW~; ).5o The noisy crowds serve an important function in Chin P'ing Mei; they serve as symbols of danger. Crowds are especially, in Primal Night holidays, the agents of exposure and theft. The mob exposes the culpability of Golden Lotus in Chapter 15. In Chapter 44 they press on Hsi-men Ch'ing's display and have to be beaten away.51 Two members of the holiday crowd enter Hsi-men Ch'ing's home and rapaciously consume all the food in sight, then stuff more under their cloaks and return to the mob.52 Other members enter the stage briefly and make a duplicitous deal with Hsi- men Ch'ing and effectively steal his money.53 Again the festival description cited from Chapter 15 reinforces the theme of danger with words suggesting violence: plunder, rob, steal, strike. Thus, in the novel, in Ming geographic descriptions, and in sui-pi, the Lantern Festival appears as a night of anti-structure (to use Victor Turner's term). Like other rituals of release and chaos, the lantern holiday has connotations of an exorcistic rite. Shen Pang ~tt (fl. 1550-96), the author of a description of Peking entitled the Wan shu tsa chi  d , describes the Walk of the One Hundred Illnesses as the "exorcism of one hundred illnesses" ch'ii pai bing M- 5,. The explosion of firecrackers also suggests an exorcistic rite. According to the encyclopedia Recording the Origins of Things, the firecracker display was essentially an exorcistic practice to drive off demons of sickness."55 Both modern studies of the rite, by Wen Tsai-tao and A Ying, describe the holiday as exorcistic in origin and nature.56 It is a night to drive out the ills of the old '5CPM, v. 2, ch. 24, pp. 79, 81, 82. 6Ibid., v. 3, ch. 42, pp. 42-43.

Shen Pang's description describes in some detail a children's game that suggests a scapegoat ritual: Beat the Demon On the 16th of the First Month, children gather together in a group in the middle of the city and play a game. At first, one person plays the Demon. The others tie a rope about his waist and together the group pulls on him. They go along for several yards and take turns jumping around before him, striking at him, and then running off-which is called "beating the Demon." You have to watch being caught off-guard to avoid being grabbed by the one who is tied up; for if he gets you then it's said you've been grabbed by the Demon. And they all laugh at you. If you are seized, and then substitute for the one who is tied round the waist, you are called "Demon's Substitute." One after another, they either are tied up or they strike, or they get caught and have to substitute.57 Shen concludes his description by noting the game probably originated in military exercises. However, from modern studies, and comparison with other typical actions, it seems likely that the game is exorcistic. The sense of the Lantern Festival as an elaborate exorcistic rite is a useful metaphor for the novel's central view of eroticism. As the novel attests to the dangerousness of eros, it also implies the necessity of an immersion in eros. In order to pass through the stage of the fearful Primal Night, the characters must first join in the demons and thereby exorcise them. Hence to return to the parallel examples from other literatures, the journey out into a coherent society and to an ordered mind has a necessary jumping- off place: a plunge down into the world of wasted wealth, of high eroticism, and disordered perceptions: the selva oscura, or the Primal Night. VI. Conclusions The Lantern Festival image serves as a chief symbol that informs much of the novel. The term yian hsiao, with its attendant associations of fertility and danger, conveys the themes 1) of eroticism as life-giving and semi-divine, and 2) of eroticism as de- structive. The term teng shih afl conveys the themes of brilliant, chaotic multiplicity suspended in the context of humanity as a faceless swarm. The first appearance of the holiday sets the stage for the lantern-like women who are beautiful yet doomed. The second appearance in Chapter 24 focuses the sense of excitement, ambition and vulnerability of Sung Hui-lien. Hui-lien, the maid and would- be lover of Hsi-men Ch'ing, dazzles the household first, attains greater and greater favors from Hsi-men Ch'ing, only to plummet quickly (in Chapter 26). Like the fragile lanterns she enjoyed earlier, she too hangs suspended from the rafters after committing suicide with the laces of her own shoes. In Chapters 42 through 46, the festival provides a background for the slow-paced and aimless activities of the women. And finally in Chapter 79 the fragile lantern of Hsi-men Ch'ing is removed. The repetition of the Primal Night festival also helps emphasize the all-important theme of entrapment in fantasy. For as each successive Lantern Festival recurs, with the initial detail of Chapter 15 repeated and embroidered, we have a sense that the events of the first eighty chapters are really only one extended Primal Night holiday; that the characters who appear and bob and toss in the wind are really only lanterns, 57Shen Pang, p. 167.</page><page sequence="18">230 Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews 4 (1982) and that the entire progression of the first three-fourths of the book is not a progression at all, but an elaborate hallucination stirred into brilliance by the transitory festivities of Primal Night. The holiday functions much as the magic-lantern imagery functions in Proust's Combray: it reminds the reader of the basic quest of the novel to discover a release from a state of suspension. Hence it is not by accident that the setting of the Primal Night coincides in function and location with the setting in the novel of the Shui hu chuan chapters which begin Chin P'ing Mei. Both the Primal Night imagery and the temporary flight of Wu Sung for seventy-eight chapters (Chapters 9-87) provide a sense of lives suspended in the context of doom, though they move and chatter with a persuasive reality. The Wu Sung story from the Tale of the Marshes provides a shadow image behind the multiplying yet small-scale world of Ch'ing Ho. The reader is always aware of a double perspective on events. He knows that Wu Sung will at some point reenter the novel Chin P'ing Mei from the parent novel and eradicate the personae who have naively sustained themselves with temporary distractions. The modal jump in the two types of charac- ters-romantic super-heroes and ironic adulterers-further stresses the sense of a larger, more definitive reality standing ready to engulf the smaller. The device of a secondary, larger backdrop is also common to so-called "Taoist" tales of ambition and decline. T'ang classical tales often employ the device of the double setting. A story may chronicle the grand successes and fortunes of a protagonist's life span as he lies sleeping. When he awakens, however, with a sensation of his life lived out to the fullest, he finds that only a short period of time has passed. Such stories deliberately foster a sense of two realities, each equally compelling, but with the larger reality transforming the smaller reality into a life of false gesture, fantasy and transitory urges. We return then to the original question: what is the function of setting in Chin P'ing Mei? In the case of the Lantern Festival we found that the novelist draws on firmly established, highly familiar motifs. Whether we read of the holiday in a description of a children's game, or in song lyrics, or in fantastic tales, we see a holiday that conveys a powerful and exciting moment of anti-structure. And further, in comparing the Ming connotations of the holiday with the novel's application of the holiday, we find that the tone and themes within and without the novel echo one another. The practices and setting of the Primal Night serve in fact as metaphors that epitomize the actions of Hsi-men Ch'ing and the several members of his household. After Hsi-men Ch'ing's death, what then becomes of the Lantern Festival? Like Hsi-men Ch'ing, it also disappears from the novel. The moment in the year for the holiday is never referred to.58 The images of a frantic nighttime fantasy of the holiday have apparently dispersed. The ritual the novelist does choose to exploit, however, is not the Primal Night with its associations with urban, erotic madness, but the festival of Lucid Brightness (Ch'ing Ming). With great literary symmetry the details of the third- month holiday presented in Chapter 89 balance out the imagery of Primal Night. Where the Primal Night is dominated by the imagery of fires, obscurity, swarms, eager ac- quisition, and danger, the Lucid Brightness imagery is dominated by quenched fires and happy crowds.59 58CPM, v. 5, ch. 88, pp. 158-59. 59Ibid., v. 5, ch. 89, pp. 185-87.</page><page sequence="19">CASS, Revels of a Gaudy Night 231 The more muted tone and sense of nostalgia conveyed by the Ch'ing Ming holiday suits the actions of the final twenty chapters of the novel. The ritual return to the tombs and recollection of one's ancestors prefigures the final scene in which Wu Yiieh-niang returns to the Hsi-men estate to head the less powerful, greatly reduced, but finally cleansed household of Hsi-men Tai.60 The analysis of setting, and in particular the analysis of the use of the Primal Night motif, thus provides insight into the overall meaning of the novel. Hsi-men Ch'ing's self-absorbed and colorful exploits characterize Chapters 1 through 79; and the Primal Night serves as an appropriate backdrop for his deluded revels. Thus the motif of the Lantern Festival partially unifies the disparate, undigested and often contradictory ele- ments of Chin P'ing Mei. 6lIbid., v. 5, ch. 100, pp. 490-93.</page></plain_text>
