Scribner's Sons, 597 Fifth Avenue, New York 17. xviii + 365 pp, $6.00. It is never a pleasure to be critical of a good book-and this is a good one-but the topic of cycles, being what it is in our present state of knowledge, is inevitably a fruitful ground for disagreement. If the title were modified to something like this:-The Way to Game Abundance Through Con- trolled Environment-it seems to the reviewer that it would have been more ap- propriate; he remains unconvinced that Grange has found an explanation of game cycles. Before debating this issue, however, let me say that the author's account of plant successions (which occupies the first third of the volume) is lucid and convincing, while his case for the direct dependence of animals on en- vironment and habitat has probably never been better stated. His style, more- over, is easy and pleasant. The Way to Game Abundance is divided into four sections under the headings:-I. The Pattern of Life. II. Plant and Animal Suc- cessions. III. Population Cycles. IV. The Technology of Game Increase. Part I is introductory and thought-provoking. II, in which the author elaborates his thesis of plant and animal successions and environmental control appeals to me as the best section of the book. In Part IV, the author is very *much at home. Although this section is more reminiscent of the standard textbook, its style is anything but that of a text. Occasional comments are particularlv arresting, as for instance, "The nature of man's own habitat dilemma requires another vol- ume: suffice it to say that he is indeed confronted with such a dilemma almost parallel to that of the Snowshoe Rabbit population in a jackpine thicket which has passed the optimum productive stage." (p. 350..) How appropriate an analogy! Before considering Section III, a few general comments seem in order. Lack of documentation is, to my mind, a detracting feature of the entire book. One frequently gets the impression that the author is listing plants or animals on an arbitrary !basis, or wonders whether this statement or that rests *on established fact or is instead the author's personal opinion. The statement on p. 121, to take a concrete example, that low years of the ten year cycle have, for ten decades, ended in the numeral 7- 1857, 67, 77, 87, 97, 1907, 17, 27, 37, 47-is, for instance, entirely valueless without corroborative evidence. The years 1867 and 1887 actually saw the greatest Canadian lynx peaks in recorded history (Elton and Nicholson, Jr. An. Ecology, Nov. 1942), together with rabbits and, no doubt, all species of grouse as well, unless the general pattern of the cycle has changed within recent decades. Likewise the statement-or inference, for one cannot decide which it may be from the way it is expressed-that lynx and bobcat prey on deer (p. 183), surely demands support. The average lynx, notoriously depend- ent on rabbits, weighs only about 25 pounds and a bobcat less, while a deer may run to over 300 pounds. Occasional judgments are open to question, as for in- stance, the inclusion of blue, snow and white-fronted geese among species need- ing special protection (p. 334). The first two species, on their spring resting grounds in Manitoba have been estimated in millions, while the writer has seen 30,000 white-fronts pass over his tent in a single day during the fall migration in Alberta. A few errors also occur, such as the statement (on the same page) that "there is no native breeding stock of musk oxen on the (American) con- tinent itself." Not only does the Thelon sanctuary on the Canadian barrens have a substantial population but between it and Coppermine, herds of anything up to 50 animals are often enough reported by airmen. Part III-Population Cycles-demands critical examination in view of the sub- title of the volume, An Explanation of Game Cycles. Part III attempts to provide the explanation. In view of the excellence of much of the book, it is regrettable that this section should lay itself open to rather drastic criticism, but such is the case. If I understand Grange correctly, he explains cycles on the basis of plant and animal successions. When an area has been burned, or logging has denuded a forest (the climax vegetation phase), a fresh start is made in the matter of plant growth. Beginning with grasses and small plants, a recognizable sequence varying with soil, latitude, climate, etc. is passed through, finally to terminate once again in forest, the climax phase which may require 150 years to attain. During that time, any given area has proved itself particularly suitable in suc- cessive years for successive species of birds and mammals: the plant cycle, in fact, induces an animal cycle. But there are cycles and cycles. There is no suoh</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXII 1951 Recent Literature [ 139 thing as a cycle of small game, but distinctions are not clearly drawn by the author. In the list of cyclic species, for instance (p. 118) in the paragraph be- ginning:-"The game cycle affects . . ." (italics mine), are included wolves, rab- bits, grouse, arctic foxes and snowy owls, in addition to numerous other species. If wolves actually show a cycle, it is certainly a long term one, possibly of 35 years: rabbits and grouse, like lynx and many other fur-bearers, fall into the familiar ten-year pattern, while snowy owls and arctic foxes exhibit a four-year frequency, presumably dependent on the short-term cycle of about four years characteristic of mice, voles and lemmings. "The game cycle" of the author thus incorporates three entirely distinct concepts, each of which seems to require its own explanation. If all three depended upon a common denominator-plant suc- cessions-there would surely be but a single cycle and its duration would more appropriately appear to be around 150 years. Although the author correlates the incidence of forest fires with sunspots in parts of the United States, the sunspot cycle coincides with none of the animal cycles yet recognized. And logging operations are certainly not cyclic. Taking the entire continent for our field, as we must in the case of at least the ten-year cycle, the author's argument seems inevitably to land him in the same jackpot as it did Stoddard in the matter of quail. Grange cites Stoddard on p. 188 as follows:-"It is also evident that the abundant summer rains that mean a big quail hatch in hill country flood flat low areas and cause a short quail crop. So, even a single large property of both hill lands and flat lands may have both spot abundance and spot scarcity! No wonder quail cycles are masked in the South!" Quite, no wonder! The question seems to me to be-do quail in the South cycle at all? And the question posed by Grange's hypothesis is precisely the same-would any kind of cycle be possible across the American continent if there were spot abundance and spot scarcity alternating over the entire territory, and coincident neither in time nor space? The answer is much more likely to be in the negative than in the affirmative. Such circumstances, which cancel each other out, might eliminate, but could surely not create, a cycle. The point I am trying to make is this: from what we now know of the ten-year cycle, it has three outstanding features-(a) remarkable regularity of interval (on the average, something short of ten years) ; (b) circumpolar synchronization; (c) the simultaneous involvement of various species. Taken district by district, the maxima and minima do not necessarily fall into precisely the same years: There may be a lag of a year or two here, and an advance of a year or two there, quite possibly reflecting local conditions such as fires, logging operations and plant successions, but the fact remains that in the over-all perspective of the whole of Canada, and into Scandinavia and Finland, the cyclic interval has re- mained at close to ten years for as far back as the records go. The northern United States are no exception. Grange's graph on p. 91 of the rabbit-grouse cycle in Wisconsin fits precisely into the ten-year pattern and involves four species. Yet the legend reads-"Basic habitat changes and cyclic weather conditions com- bine to cause the small game cycle." The "cyclic weather conditions" are not defined: a random reference to sunspots is truly included, but sunspots have long since *been discarded as irrelevant to the ten-year cycle. The "Basic habitat changes" are local and show no synchronization: how can they logically be held to account for the synchronous nature of a circumpolar cycle? The cycle, moreover, appears to be more than circumpolar. Wodzicki's newly published book, Mammals Introduced Into New Zealand, indicates a ten-year cycle of the European rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) almost as precipitate as our Snow- shoe's and equally regular over the past 30 years. Since I am not reviewing my own opinions, and this new information lends remarkable corroboration to a view- point expressed elsewhere (See Rowan, W., (a) The Ten Year Cycle, Department of Extension, University of Alberta, 1948: (b) New Biology (Penguin Books), Oct. 1950, "Canada's Premier Problem of Animal Conservation".), suffice it to state that the length and -breadth of the ten-year cycle, its striking periodicity, and its simultaneous effect on many species, suggest a controlling factor of far greater magnitude and potency than local and fortuitous vegetative sequences. What the factor (or factors) may eventually prove to be, remains a matter of con- jecture, but that the author's contention (p. 160) that "Fire (and wind locally)</page><page sequence="3">140] Recent Literature Bird-BarLding July is the important denuding factor in the Snowshoe Rabbit cycle" (and with it grouse) remains, as far as I can see, without any reasonable justification. Across the breadth of Canada and into Finland and Scandinavia, a wave of death affect- ing numerous species of birds and mammals, and millions of individuals, sweeps the northern hemisphere at ten year intervals. Apparently, it happens also in New Zealand. It seems to *the reviewer that this periodicity alone is so striking as to eliminate the last chance that local and random plant successions can pos- sibly account for the phenomenon, Grange has brought to.gether many interesting facts. That plant and animal successions are correlated I imagine nobody will question, but that these can account for the ten-year cycle or any other large-scale cycle, I, personally, find it impossible to believe. That game abundance can be enhanced by manipulating the local plant environment seems equally beyond doubt, and if such control could be applied simultaneously on a continental scale, I would certainly entertain a hope that the ten-year cycle m.ight some day be harnessed by management. In the meantime, I am afraid I shall remain a. skeptical-and possibly an obnoxious -reviewer of Grange's Explanation of Game Cycles.-Wm. Rowan. 36. Evolution Emerging. William King Gregory. 1951.

This extensive treatise combines an interesting presentation of selected evidences for the current concepts of the stages and pathways of the evolution of animals with numerous philosophic suggestions and theories concerning the dynamics of evolution. As one would expect from the author's numerous important researches, the core of the treatise is paleontologic; however, the author *has by no means dwelt alone on prosaic descriptions and comparisons of fossils but has extensively interwoven innumerable inferences concerning the biology of fossil groups as well as evi- dences and ideas from comparative anatomy, comparative embryology, ecology, and, to a considerably lesser extent, comparative physiology, comparative psy- chology, and genetics. The basic philosophy of the treatise is best expressed in the words of the author. "In the present work we -shall not be concerned pri- marily with the classic problems whether the course of -organic evolution has been guided by natural selection or by some other natural system. Even the hereditary and statistical mechanisms through which evolution works will be taken for granted here because they are being dealt with (as in the growing volumes on evolution) by many who are more competent to do so. Still less we are inter- ested in proving evolution. . . . Our postulates . . . are as follows: (1) Evolution, the natural history of the universe and its parts, deals with the processes and results of the transformation of energy and matter, viewed against the background of time and space. (2) Our sense organs and measuring instruments give only partial information of the complexities of the subject matter; our mental pictures, written records, symbols and measurements of evolution, having been made by fallible human beings, are often anthropomorphic or at best approximate. Never- theless, since scientists are always subjecting their colleagues' results to the test of experience, there is in the long run a rapidly growing residue of increasing approximation to the facts of evolution." (p. 7.) Volume I contains the text (with references to pertinent figures in Volume II), a classified bibliography of 143 pages and several thousand references, an index of authors, and a general index. Volume II contains only illustrations with a minimum of explanatory material, The total number of individual illustrations must exceed five thousand. Although the majority are concerned with the mor- phology of fossils, many depict restorations, morphology and anatomy of living species, and phylogenetic relationships. This valuable collection of illustrations will prove invaluable to zoologists in general, regardless of the field 'of specific interest. The text has an unusual, but effective, organization and order of presen- tation. Part One consists of an introduction and chapters concerning respectively (I) "the first living things" (bacteria, Protophyta, and Protozoa through Amelida), (II) the Mollusca, and (III) the Arthropoda. Part Two, "Emergence of 'the Vertebrates . . .," consists of chapters on (IV) "coelomate foodsifters of diverse types" (Brachiopoda, Polyzoa, and Echinodermata), (V) the prochordates 'and the origin of vertebrates, (VI) the jaw-less vertebrates, (VII) placoderms, (VIII)</page></plain_text>
