<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS Gezer, 1992 The unusually heavy rains of the 1991-1992 winter in Israel exposed architectural remains in the fields of Kibbutz Gezer. Kibbutz members discovered a 'wall' in the bottom of a small wadi running south-north (1-2 m. in depth and about as wide) in the rich alluvial fields approximately 1 km. due north of ancient Tel Gezer. It was pointed out to W.G. Dever in March 1992. Visible at that time was what appeared to be a section of wall consisting of well-laid fieldstones five courses in width (approximately 2.25 m.). It appeared to be oriented basically east-west, but little more of its nature could be discerned at that time since only 0.50-0.75 m. of its length was exposed. Excavation of the 'wall' took place in June 1992 under the field direction of J.W. Hardin, with W.G. Dever as principle investigator. About 15 members of an overseas summer programme from Dawson College of Quebec, Canada, served as volunteers. Special thanks are extended to R.J. Scheuer for his generous support and to the members of Kibbutz Gezer for their support, interest and enthusiasm. Excavations began on 16 June 1992, when the west bank of the wadi was cut back into a vertical section for control, and 1.5 3 m. units were placed in the wadi and against the north and south faces of the 'wall'. It was quickly determined that we also had part of a flagstone floor ringed by a circular wall one course (approximately 0.35-0.45 m.) in thickness, preserved in some places to a height of two courses (about 0.50 m.). Investigation was continued to the east and out of the wadi. The wall and its accompanying flagstone floor continued in this direction for only another metre before ending. Preservation was poor due to the structure's proximity to modern ground surface. Some of the higher stones had been dislodged from their original positions by modern plows, as evidenced by plow marks on their surfaces. In addition, many large cobbles (0.25-0.60 m.) were found strewn about in the wadi north and south of the structure, attesting further to its disturbance. Once the remains had been completed exposed, it was easily determined that they belonged to a round building (Fig. 1). Since only a small 'wedge-shaped' section of the building was preserved, its diameter could only be roughly estimated at 7-11 m. h 50 0 20_40 ooo i 1-3) km.</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND NEWS 65 Fig. I. Gezer, 1992: round tower, c. eighth century B.C.E in foreground; Tel Gezer in background. Dating the structure proved to be somewhat problematic. While a chisel dressed ashlar block in secondary use provided a tenth/ninth century B.C.E. terminus post quern, the paucity of the architectural remains and their location in a modern wadi made dating on a ceramic basis difficult. The pottery excavated from around the building ranged in date from the Middle Bronze Age to the Roman period, and was thoroughly mixed from top to bottom of the excavated areas. Due to the mixture of this material and the nature of the soil from which it came (mostly water-laid silty/small pebble-strewn earth), little, if any, reliability can be placed on a date derived from its analysis. The only diagnostic pottery from a reasonably safe context consisted of a ninth century B.C.E. cooking pot rim and an eighth-century B.C.E. 'Imlk -type storage-jar handle. These sherds were found against the south side of the structure in an area to the east and outside the modern wadi bank. No sherds later than Iron Age II were found in this context. It is tentatively suggested what we have is a circular tower associated with domestic functions (i.e. agriculture), dating from the ninth/eighth centuries B.C.E. Defense as a primary function has been ruled out because of the structure's thin wall and its placement in an area serving little or no strategic value. Similar structures in ancient Samaria have been described by S. Dar (1986) and ancient Ammon by R. Kletter (1991). These range in size from 5-12 m. in diameter, and their construction has been dated to anywhere from the early Iron Age II to the Hellenistic period. Communicated by James W.

P. Jacobs (Cobb Institute) and 0. Borowski (Emory University) were co-directors. Exca vation concentrated on two areas: Field IV on the western edge of the mound (directors: P. Jacobs and 0. Borowski) and Site 101 on the lower terrace of the site (director: J.D. Seger, Cobb Institute). Field IV: Iron Age The season provided a broad exposure of late eighth-century buildings which had been destroyed by fire, causing roofs and walls to collapse onto ground floors. The destruction layer was rich in small finds, each floor covered with pottery, tools, jewellery, food remnants, etc., but also preserved nearly intact the architectural * Cf. IEJ 38 (1988), pp. 278-281. foundations of the stratum. The results of the first season at Field IV have furthered the goals of the Project's Phase III: to determine the use of rooms within buildings; specific function areas within rooms or open areas; town planning; and site function within the network of Judaean towns in the eighth-seventh centuries B.C.E. By the end of the season, Iron Age Stratum VIB levels had been exposed in nine areas (F8-L8 and F7-G7; Figs. 1, 2), revealing a series of pillared buildings erected along the fortification (Fig. 3). The exposure of ground floors has given ample evidence (currently being analysed) of activities carried out in the rooms. In Areas K8 and L8 (Fig. 1), rooms apparently served largely for food storage and preparation. The floors, large smooth stone cobbles, were found covered with broken storage-jars. Similar scenes of storage and cooking vessels appeared on the surfaces in Areas F7 and G7 (Fig. 2). In the rooms in Area 18, on the other hand, the main activity was weaving, indicated by the mud loom weights found in a bin. In Areas G8-F8 (Fig. 2), the materials on the cobbled floors of two rooms differed Area L8 Area K8 ) -) B K L I l Fig. 1.

On floor G8005 the remains of a house shrine were found, along with ordinary household vessels. The painted head of a 'pillar figurine' was found on the floor, beside a pair of rectangular, carved limestone blocks with a ceramic fenestrated incense stand between them (Fig. 4). The Field IV Iron Age remains provide a rich data base for questions about site function and town planning. All artifacts on living surfaces were carefully plotted, and the floors tested for microartifact remains by Arlene Rosen (Ben-Gurion University of the Negev). These test plots, along with the architectural plans to be determined, will help to form an hypothesis of site function for Halif. Remote Sensing at ffalif The decision to work in Field IV was based in part on ground penetrating radar experiments conducted in 1987 by F. Miller and J. Doolittle.

Field IV: Persian Period More than 200 fragments of ceramic figurines dating from the Persian era were found in this field. The figurines include anthropomorphic statuettes, as well as several of the 'horse-and-rider' type (Fig. 5). Although the majority were found in disturbed surface soils, they constitute a rich and important collection. Parallels are known from other sites in the region, including Tel ?ippor, Lachish and Tel Dor. Fig. 5. Tell tfalif, Field IV: a Persian period figurine. Site 101: Chalcolithic Period Previous seasons had documented a sequence of four Early Bronze I occupation phases (Phases 6-9) at Site 101 on the lower eastern terrace. Continued excavations this season recovered important data related to several phases of earlier Chalcolithic period culture. The work this season confirmed an hypothesis raised in 1989 that open bedrock exposures at Site 101 had been developed as cave shelters during the Chalcolithic period. Excavation included the removal of numerous large limestone slabs from the collapsed cave roof. Well-preserved Chalco lithic remains were found on surfaces below and adjacent to these slabs. Surface assemblages included pottery, finished flint blades and stone-grinding tools, as well as stone beads and bone tools. Of special interest was a potter's tournette, which, along with several unfired pottery vessels and a number of levigated 'green clay' deposits, suggests the presence of a ceramics industry within the complex. Of greatest interest, however, was the presence of human skeletal remains; at least two individuals were identified. One of the skeletons was well preserved and was found in an extended prone position on Surface 101045 (Fig. 6). Preliminary analysis by biological anthropologist S. Homes Hogue of Mississippi State University suggests that the bones belong to a male between 35 and 40 years of age. The skeleton was associated with a hearth and with an artifact assemblage which included a ceramic cup and bowl and a stone dibble weight. Remains of the second individual, found on Surface 100079, were crushed and badly disturbed. A scattering of miscellaneous human bone throughout the complex suggests the activity of animal scavengers following the burials. The remains from Chalcolithic and EB I phases at Halif provide evidence for the continuity of late fourth and early third millennium B.C.E. occupation in the area. Three sub-phases of Chalcolithic period occupation (Phases lOa-c) have been</page><page sequence="7">70 NOTES AND NEWS Fig. 6.

It is represented by a metre wide circular cutting into the bedrock floor. This opening was sealed by Phase 10b Wall 100068 and Surface 101045. This early phase has so far been tested only by probes; further excavation is necessary to clarify and define its nature. Communicated by Paul F. Jacobs and Oded Borowski</page></plain_text>
