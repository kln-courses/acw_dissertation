<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LA TOLITA-TUMACO CULTURE: MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM David A. Scott The archaeological setting of the La Tolita-Tumaco culture is briefly discussed as a framework for the examination of the metallurgy of the area, in particular the gold-platinum alloys used to make platinum-coated gold objects, platinum-gold sintered alloys, and platinum-gold foil-plated objects. The sophisticated approach to the manipulation of metallic materi als resulted in several notable advances being made by the La Tolita-Tumaco culture: the production of extremely fine rec tangular wire, bimetallic tumbaga alloys, small lead spheres inlaid with platinum, soldering, granulation, and a degree of sophistication to metalworking that is very impressive and, in some cases, unique in the world. Some selected examples are discussed, and the micro structure of a representative selection of the La Tolita material, bimetallic tumbaga construction, the initial sintered gold-platinum product, platinum-plated gold, and heavily worked gold-platinum composite artifacts are presented. Se discute brevemente el panorama arqueológico de la cultura La Tolita-Tumaco como una introducción para el examen de la metalurgia del área, en particular, las aleaciones de oro-platino usadas para hacer revestimientos de platino en objetos de oro, las mezclas para aleaciones de oro-platino, y objetos de oro-platino laminados. La sofisticada manipulación de materi ales metálicos resultó en varios avances notables hechos por la cultura La Tolita-Tumaco: la producción de alambre rectan gular muy fino, las aleaciones bimétalicas de tumbaga, las pequeñas esferas de plomo incrustadas con platino; el soldado; la granulación y el grado de sofisticación del trabajo en metal es muy impresionante y algunas veces representan casos únicos en el mundo. Se discuten algunos ejemplos seleccionados, y se presenta aquí una muestra representativa de la microestruc tura del material de La Tolita, la estructura bimetálica de tumbaga, las mezclas iniciales producidas en oro-platino, el platino enchapado en oro, y artefactos sumamente elaborados compuestos en oro-platino. The purpose of this review article is to describe the nature of the metallurgy of the region, together with an account of the archaeological context in which these metallurgi cal developments occurred. The cultural area of La Tolita-Tumaco, also known as the Esmeraldas Tumaco or Tumaco area, existed along the Pacific littoral crossing the Colombian-Ecuador border and consisted of communities of fishermen, farmers, hunters, and craftsmen who, remarkably, produced some of the most sophisticated and skillfully made goldwork and platinum-gold alloys in the entire South American continent. Even more remarkable is that this achievement was not made by an advanced state-controlled civilization, such as the Moche, the Inca, or the Aztecs, but by a group of local chiefdoms living along this Ecuadorian-Colombian border region, an area that is seismically rather unstable and subject to tidal waves and earthquakes (Bruhns 1994). The general area of this part of the coast is shown in Figure 1 (after Bouchard and Usselmann 2003:Figure 1). The map includes the area of Atacames to the south as far as Buenaventura in the north. Bouchard and Usselmann (2003:Figure 7) also illustrate some of the geographical areas of Formative period phases in Ecuador. The generalized time frame for the For mative in this area is from 3500 to 600 B.C. The Regional Development period is defined as the span from about 600 B.C. to A.D. 500, and the Integra tion period, from A.D. 500 to 1532. Comparatively little is known of the metallurgy of the later Inte David A.

During the Regional Development period, between about 600 B.C. and A.D. 350, the inhab itants lived by the shore among the mangrove swamps and small estuaries, inhabiting the lit toral between the area of Esmeraldas in Ecuador and as far north as Buenaventura in the Colom bian region of Valle del Cauca, which is a con siderable reach along the Colombian coast. The chiefs, who controlled the economic, religious, or shamanistic aspects of life, were buried in earth mounds, called tolas', wore gold and gold-plat mum alloy necklaces, diadems, nose rings, lip plugs, and other miniature ornaments; and were buried with ceramics, gold, and other grave goods. Some of the tolas at La Tolita may contain super imposed, column-shaped pots called timburas. Ceremonial centers occurred at La Tolita Island, at El Morro, and in the Santiago-Cayapas region in Ecuador (Museo del Oro 2009). These centers appear to have been simultaneously trading ports, centers of cultural diffusion, and political and reli gious headquarters.</page><page sequence="4">68 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 La Tolita La Tolita is the most important site for any discus sion of the metallurgy of the region. Valdez (1992:230) maintains that there are four phases of development in the growth of La Tolita as a cere monial site. Occupation appears to have begun around 600 B.C., referred to as the early Tolita period, with settlements along the Rio Santiago, many on raised banks of earth. Abundant fresh water and marine ecosystems were available, with numerous villages along rivers and marshes. Many species of edible mollusks and crustaceans were caught, along with cultivated maize, beans, squash, and yucca. Utensils and figurines have affinities with the Formative or early Regional Development periods of the Machalilla phase (1800-1500 B.C.) and the Chorrera phase (1500-300 B .C.) along the central Ecuadorian coast. The La Tolita-Tumaco culture is also closely allied to the Jama-Coaque culture, which flourished along the Pacific coastal lowlands around the Ecuadorian border regions adjacent to that of La Tolita itself. Excavations at the site of Las Balsas, immedi ately to the south of La Tolita, has produced evi dence of worked gold alloy artifacts dating to the Formative period, including perforated sheets joined with metallic hooks or vegetable threads (Valdez et al. 2005:1-3). Calibrated radiocarbon dates for these artifacts from a well-stratified con text gave 918-780 B.C. (GIF 11900: 2670 ± 35 B.P.; Beta 181458:2660 + 60 B.P.).This is the ear liest evidence for the use of worked gold alloys from the La Tolita area. The two analyses given by Valdez et al. (2005:7) show that these objects are made in gold-copper alloy, one with 75.1 per cent gold, 8.93 percent silver, and 15.7 percent copper and the other with 79.8 percent gold, 9.74 percent silver, and 9.48 percent copper (percent ages given are by weight). These analytical results are significant, as they show that prepared gold-copper alloys were already in use in the region around 900 B.C. Comparison with trace elemental analyses for native gold from the Ri'o Santiago and from La Tolita (Valdez et al. 2005:7) shows comparable amounts of bismuth, lead, rhe nium, antimony, tin, palladium, ruthenium, arsenic, and platinum to the tumbaga objects from the site, proving the use of locally available gold in their fabrication. Around 400 B.C., known as the Transitional period in La Tolita, the population increased as a result of reclaimed marshland, with land clearance and filling to raise some areas nearly 1 m in height, while settlements expanded into the hinterland. Artifacts in shell, bone, wood,obsidian, and stone were common, and metallurgical developments in gold, copper, and plati num occurred. By 200 B .C., the importance of La Tolita was well established (Valdez 1992:230). In La Tolita itself, the Classic phase of occupation lasted until about A.D. 400. The center of the cultural region grew in size to occupy about 1 km2, with a resident population estimated to be about 2,000. The center was laid out according to a well-conceived plan, already noted by Max Uhle (1924). The site had a rec tangular plaza about 190 m wide surrounded on three sides by important tolas. The great quantity of funerary remains suggests that the site func tioned as a regional burial ground. Ceramic mod els of houses show that a variety of huts, houses, and specialized buildings existed. Artistic pro duction in ceramics, metallurgy, wood, weaving, leather, and basketry produced superb examples of craftsmanship. Trade in shells, emeralds, quartz, sodalite, and obsidian took place, and provenance studies of the obsidian from La Tolita show that it originated from the area of Mullu mica (Asaro et al. 1994). La Tolita became the preeminent ceremonial center on this part of the Ecuadorian-Colombian coast, with maritime contacts that extended as far afield as Central America and western Mexico (Anawalt 1992). Agricultural activity included ridge-and-swale raised fields, which greatly expanded crop production. During the late Tolita Classic period, from A.D. 90 to 400, the site grew to 2 km2, with a socially stratified population of about 5,000 composed of theocratic rulers, artists, farmers, fisherman, and workers. Borderland marshes were filled in, and new tolas were created. The site of La Tohta has been looted almost continuously from A.D. 1600 to the present (Alcina Franch 1979:15; Ferdon 1940),and most of the arti facts come from alluvial deposits that seem to be the result of redeposition of objects from eroded and washed-out archaeological zones (Saville 1908). The fragility of this part of the coast is con firmed by early reports of the Spanish friar Fray Juan de Santa Gertrudis in 1756:</page><page sequence="5">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 69 They call this village La Tola, because it is full of "tolas" or earth mounds, and it really is like that because I have seen it. . . . These are the burial mounds of ancient Indians, and as they were buried with everything they possessed, a lot of valuable articles have been found in some of them. The sea leaves its marks there, and when the tide goes out, a piece of beach is left opposite the village, and the Indians go there to see if they can find anything from the edge, and you can see that the sea is gradually eat ing them away every time the tide comes in [1756:123], Because of this coastal destruction and pro longed looting, it is not certain that all of the metal lic artifacts found at the site are contemporary with the tolas of LaTolita. Excavations at LaTolita have produced three radiocarbon dates: A.D. 90 (CSIC 2145: 1860 ± 60 B.P.), A.D. 150(CSIC-2414: 1800 ± 60 B .P.) for materials still not described, and A .D. 270 (M-735: 1680 ± 200 B .P.) for a "chimney bur ial" of superimposed urns with a clay figurine of the La Plata type (Alcina Franch 1979:109; Estrada 1962:Table 5; Stirling 1972:163). Pottery and fig urines similar to those reported from LaTolita occur only in the first two periods at the site of Inguapf (Bouchard 1977-1978), while in western Esme raldas, the connections are mainly with the later Tiaone phase, which has five radiocarbon dates from site E-13 at La Propicia at the junction of the Rio Tiaone and the Rio Esmeraldas. These dates (Alcina Franch 1979:109, 114) span the period from A.D. 50 ± 60 (CSIC-240: 1900 ± 60 B.P.) to A.D. 260 (CSIC 241: 1690 ± 60 B.P). The other connection is with the early Atacames phase (Scott and Bray 1994), which is radiocarbon dated to between A.D. 310 and A.D. 970 (CSIC 291: 1640 ± 50 B.P.; CSIC 280: 980 ± 50 B.P). By the third or fourth century A.D., copper objects were in use at La Propicia, in Esmeraldas (Alcina Franch 1979), and at about the same time, sophisticated metal work in gold, copper, silver, and other alloys became widespread throughout Pacific Ecuador (Meggers 1966; Saville 1907-1910). Guinea (1995) descnbes the Tiaone phase as dat ing from A.D. 1 to 500, characterized by dispersed houses of extended families, which is followed by the Transitional phase, A.D. 500-700, leading to a depopulation of the coastal regions for reasons that are still poorly understood. Possible causes are still under discussion: Valdez (1986) believes that diminishing food productivity may have led to social deterioration, while Bouchard (1995) sug gests other hypotheses such as natural events (e.g., earthquakes, coastal erosion) or social-political fac tors, leading to a loss of centralized power. During its Classic period, the La Tolita culture excelled in a number of crafts, such as metals and ceramics, the latter usually finely modeled by hand or mold-made. Gertrudis writes: "Various small figurines made of clay to a high degree of perfec tion are normally found there. . . . There are also others made of gold, with eyes of emeralds, and small filigree gold beads, as small as the head of a pin" (1756:127). The miniature size of much of the goldwork is confirmed by the numerous examples of very delicate metallic artifacts from the region, something of a La Tolita specialty. Some 200 years earlier, Francisco Lopez de Gömara, writing of the Esmeraldas area in 1552, records: "The people wear many gold studs in their faces. They pierce the flesh in many places, and in each hole they put a grain or stud of gold, and many of them put turquoises and fine emeralds" (1852 [ 1553]:224). Bray (1979) reports the existence of a portrait of the leaders, the Mulatos of Esmeraldas painted by Adrian Sanchez Galque in 1552, the same year that Francisco Lopez de Gömara made his obser vations. This portrait shows typical La Tolita jew elry, which therefore must have continued to be in use up to the sixteenth century (Lane 2002:23), despite the loss of La Tolita as a center in its own right. This raises doubts as to the origin of the mulatto jewelry, for which there is no good post-La Tolita archaeology to help answer the questions regarding its origin. At La Tohta, the first conquistadors met with Indians who said that they were not indigenous inhabitants of the island but that they were there to guard a place that must therefore still have had some special significance. Bouchard (1984) notes that after about A.D. 50 a cultural diversification appeared, which may have continued for several centuries until the beginning of the Integration period. This seems not to have lasted until the Span ish conquest because the first Europeans who dis covered this region reported the existence of several Indian groups with individual cultural identities (Bouchard 1984), a possible return to the organi zation of local power, probably similar to the caci</page><page sequence="6">70 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 cazgos or chiefdoms that were to be found in many Andean areas at the time of the conquest. Masucci (2008) draws attention to the impor tance of Spondylus in long-distance trade; and in La Tolita, the prominence of gold (and platinum) may have been an important factor in the territor ial expansion of the culture (Masucci 2008:494). Bouchard (1995:79) also believes that the search for raw materials in the littoral and western foothills is a likely explanation for extended colonization. Inguapi and Cancha: Tumaco At Inguapi, near Tumaco, Department of Narino, small pieces of cut and hammered gold wire of astonishingly small diameters were recovered from a stratum with ceramic figurines of the Tolita type (Bouchard 1979). The location of some of the rel evant sites is shown in Figures 2 and 3.The Inguapi deposit gave a radiocarbon date of 325 B.C. (Ny 642: 2275 ± 85 BP.). Bouchard (1984) also exca vated the site of Cancha, located near the small modern village of Pampa de Oro, constructed on the remains of an archaeological site that may have lain parallel and contiguous to the bank of the Rfo Santiago. Cancha itself may have been part of this larger site. The second archaeological phase from Cancha was dated to about A.D. 90 (GIF 6818: 1860 ± 60 B.P.) from wood charcoal, and among this refuse were small fragments of gold sheet and wire that are typical metalworking products of the La Tolita-Tumaco culture (Scott and Bouchard 1988). In the Tumaco area as a whole, a variety of set tlements have been found. The first occupations of many sites from this area originated during the late Formative period, as the radiocarbon dates and the salient characteristics of the ceramic vessels clearly demonstrate. Radiocarbon measurements from the site of Mataje on the pacific littoral of Colombia (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965, 1978) gave an age of about 400 B.C. (M 1480: 2350 ± 180 B.P.) for the end of the Mataje I period, which is comparable with the date obtained by Bouchard (1982) for the first period of occupation of the site of Inguapf, while farther north a tola at Imbilf has been dated to A.D. 1000 (H1481: 950 ± 150 B.P. [Reichel Dolmatoff 1965:111-114]). Other finds include coastal trade artifacts from sites in the Narino high lands (Uribe 1976). Some sites are of considerable size, such as Isla del Morro near the port of Tumaco, which runs for a kilometer along the beach and was inhabited until the Spanish invasion (Bray 1979). Houses were often rectangular with gabled roofs and built on arti ficial platforms to protect them from coastal flood ing. Other sites such as Monte Alto consist of small middens, low tolas, and simple pit graves (Cubil los 1955). The La Tolita-Tumaco culture extended along the Colombian coast, into the Valle del Cauca. Relationships, particularly in cosmological sym bol s, may have existed between La Tolita-Tumaco and those of the llama phase of the Calima area and of the San Agustfn region in Colombia. Cardale de Schrimpff (2000) traces the image of the crocodile in ceramics, gold, and other materials in Tumaco to those of Calima, outside of the natural habitat of the crocodile. The more closely the iconographies of Tumaco and the llama phase of the Calima area are compared, the more similarities there are to be seen (Cardale de Schrimpff2000:85), such as mod els of rectangular houses or the depiction of snakes on ceramic canasteros. Goldwork and Imagery The sacred character of much La Tolita art is shown by its depictions of powerful predators in earth, water, and sky such as caimans, serpents, felines, eagles, and bats and in the goldwork, small insects and flies. Imagery is divided by Valdez (1992:234) into nine principal categories: deities or anthropo morphized animals; persons in formal poses, usu ally without specific attributes; priests or shamans engaged in ritual acts with artifacts; men and women engaged in daily activity; trophy heads and masks; sacred animals; common animals of the region; houses or temples; and figures combining animal and human forms with headdresses, pec torals, or masks. This categorization seems to underestimate the extent to which depictions of aging, disease, sexual expression, and phallic imagery were employed in Tumaco art. Fertility was important, the phallus being represented in the form of a handle on ceremonial jars, rollers, fish descalers, and censers. Pottery jars depict a variety of sexual acts, and some show the mother in the act of birth or with her baby just following birth, breast-feeding, or carrying the baby in her arms or on her shoulders (Museo del Oro 2009). Many</page><page sequence="7">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 71 ceramic objects appear to have been decorated with tiny nose ornaments and earrings made of gold, which adds another spectrum of gold usage to the art of the area, not just for human use as ornamen tation but for the decoration of ceramics (Lathrap etal. 1975). Old age and the changes in appearance with ill ness were portrayed in detail so precisely on the ceramics that the afflictions of leishmaniasis, tuber culosis, syphilis, dwarfism, facial paralysis, Morquio's disease (Pachajoa et al. 2009), and Down's syndrome can readily be identified (Bernal and Briceno 2006; Calvopina et al. 2004). Cranial deformation was practiced in the Tumaco area to elongate the skull, and several of the ceramic jars show figures with this kind of elongated head. The origins of cranial deformation are already to be found in the Ecuadorian Formative period Machalilla phase (Munizaga 1976:690). Certain symbolic materials earned varying sig nificance at different times in La Tolita, and before A.D. 200, the conch shell (Strombus), the mollusk (Malea), and the bivalve shell (Spondylus) were especially important. A deposit in the subfloor of the principal plaza is composed of a great mass of seashells, and during the existence of the site, great accumulations of shells occurred in many areas, some being washed out in various deposits, such as those reported by Marshall H. Saville during early reconnaissance in 1908. The objects found during this expedition form part of the collections of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foun dation, New York, now known as the National Museum of the American Indian (NMAI), Wash ington, D.C. Much of this gold and gold-platinum assemblage consists of small dangles, granulated gold necklace beads, penannular nose ornaments, pins, needles, awls, appliques, masks, miniature pectorals, wires, studs, dangles, and zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figurines. Saville (1908) examined the whole coastline from Cojimies, in Manabf, northward as far as La Tolita. In Esmeraldas itself, Saville noted over 40 localities where archaeological material, mostly ceramics, was to be found. Objects in terra-cotta and gold were the most numerous, and at La Tolita, Saville (1908) mentions the find of a crouched bur ial with pottery and a gold egg containing a small fragment of an emerald. The crushed remains of a gold "egg" in the collections of the NMAI were examined and conserved by me and Jeffery Maish at the J. Paul Getty Museum, Malibu, in 1994 and proved to be composed of a few fragments of gold-platinum sintered alloy sheet and an ovoid shaped tumbaga applique probably for attachment to a textile, which may have been crushed around the emerald found by Saville, misleading him into thinking of it as an egg-shaped golden artifact. No enclosed, egg-shaped gold objects have been found at this site, to the best of my knowledge. During theTolita Classic phase, the marine sym bols that had been important earlier became less predominant and were replaced with the jaguar, serpent, felines, and eagle; together with mixed animal-human figures and birds, such iconography was common to most of the cultures of the region. Stone weights were used on nets, and gold fish hooks have been found in the rivers. Some of these hooks were made of copper plated with gold by the fusion gilding technique, which will be discussed here later. Excavated or salvaged gold and gold-platinum artifacts have made their way to the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen (Bergs0e 1937,1938), and to the NMAI, whose col lections have formed the basis of several studies already published regarding this material (Scott 1984, 1986, 1987, 1992, 2004; Scott and Bray 1980, 1994,1999; Scott and Doehne 1990), along with excavated finds from the sites of Cancha and Inguapf (Bouchard 1977-1978, 1979, 1984; Bouchard and Usselmann 2003; Scott and Bouchard 1988). Some material has been examined from the collections of the Museo Nacional del Banco Central del Ecuador, Quito (Estevez de Romero 1998; Meeks et al. 2002), while other experimental work on gold-platinum sintering has been reported by Handwerker et al. (1991) and Noguez et al. (2006). Gold and Platinum: The Geological Environment Gold In general, the gold ores of Colombia and Ecuador are to be found along the Central Cordillera, a minor source existing in the Eastern Cordillera. The min eralization occurs in relationship with rocks of an acid-intermediate nature that are of igneous origin. The events, metallogenetically, are pre-Tertiary and</page><page sequence="8">72 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Tertiary. The pre-Tertiary events are associated with igneous rocks of plutonic type such as granites, granodiorites, and monzonites that intrude princi pally in metamorphic rocks.The pre-Tertiary rocks of the batholith of Antioquia are the principal exam ple; similar intrusions are present in the Central and Western Cordilleras in the Departments of Tolima, Cauca, Narino, and Chocö. The Tertiary events occur in relation with rocks of the dacite and andesite type, formed in metamorphic processes. These are typical of the regions of volcanic activ ity of the Central Cordillera from Antioquia and Narino and the area of Chocö. There are many ways in which the nature of gold deposits can be classified (see, e.g., Emmons 1937:4; Scott 1982). There are extensive placer gold deposits in many parts of Ecuador and Colom bia that were worked by Indians; an attractive woodcut illustrated by Plazas and Falchetti (1978:23), taken from Oviedo (1959 LI 535-1548]), shows Indians panning gravels in a stream that they are taking from terrace deposits to one side of the riverbank. The gold deposits are impregnation zones and fissure veins in rocks of the basement complex, in Tertiary sediments and andesite. The gangue removed in the Indian mining operations would have been quartz, calcite, and dolomite. Grosse (1932) states that the fineness of the gold varied between 750 and 800 and that the andesite masses are of late Tertiary age. Most of the placer deposits of Colombia and Ecuador are formed by the weath ering of these veins, and X-ray diffraction studies (Juleff 1981) have found both quartz and calcite inclusions in ancient Colombian gold objects, both of which might be expected from the geological evidence. Some interesting information on alluvial work ings is recorded by several cronistas (Balboa 1951 [I513];Chaparro 1889 [1583]; Enciso 1895 [1519]; Oviedo 1959 [1535-1548]; Vadillo 1872 [1537]). The basic technique is still in use today—that of gravel washing and panning in the batea. In the area of Tumaco, the main deposits are to be found in alluvial deposits along the Pacific slopes, particularly in the beds of the rivers Mira, Petia, andTelembi, located in Figures 1 and 2. Gold mineralization in veins is associated with quartz and porphyry of the Upper Tertiary, in the area from San Pablo to La Cruz, Department of Narino. Most of the alluvial deposits, therefore, will be found in the La Tolita-Tumaco area and probably supplied the highland areas. The area of Esmeraldas, includ ing the Island of La Tolita, shares the same basic geological nature, the Rivers Santiago and Esme raldas and tributaries being rich in gold in alluvial terraces. There are many varieties of native gold; all invariably contain silver but sometimes apprecia ble palladium, rhodium, mercury, tellurium, and lead as well as a common range of impurity ele ments. Both the geological evidence and recent analyses point to a fairly simple gold mineraliza tion in Colombia and Ecuador (Scott 1982) in which low levels of impurities, apart from silver and copper, are found. Platinum The source rocks for the platinum minerals in Colombia and Ecuador are thought to be pre-late Tertiary mafic-ultramafic intrusives (Mertie 1969), although the host rocks have never actually been located. Most Tertiary period rocks outcrop along the Western Cordillera in areas that, to some extent, correlate with alluvial platiniferous deposits. The most abundant placers are those of the Department of Chocö, in the region of Pacific Colombia, where platinum is found disseminated in ultramafic rocks such as pyroxenes, serpentines, and dunites (Mon roy 1978). The Choco area today produces about 98 percent of the platinum of Colombia, the other 2 percent being obtained from the Departments of Antioquia and Narino. A detailed geological examination of worldwide platinum deposits has led to a better understanding of the occurrence of platinum based on two principal metallogenic regions: 1 .Alaskan-type concentrically zoned intrusions. 2. Alpine-type mafic-ultramafic intrusions. Cabri and Feather (1975) have listed occur rences of these types of deposits based on data from the literature. The Tertiary deposits of Colombia are of the Alaskan type (Mertie 1969); the two types are char acterized by values of R, where R = Pt weight percent x 100 / [Pt weight per cent + Ir weight percent + Os weight percent] In Alaskan-type intrusions R has a high value</page><page sequence="9">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 73 (&gt; 85), compared with the Alpine type in which R is low (&lt; 40). Cabri, Harris, and Weiser (1996) have suggested that the Au/Ir ratio may also be of significance, and this ratio as well as R give the Colombian and Ecuadorian deposits a particular character in which R has been estimated at about 95 (Mertie 1969:Table 27) and where the Au/Ir ratio is also high. The original mafic source rocks have suffered severe erosion resulting in alluvial deposits rich in platinum in the Chocö area of Colombia and in the Pacific littoral crossing the Colombian-Ecuado rian border; some salient geological features are shown by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993: Fig ure 2). Alluvial platinum, then, is encountered along the western flanks of the Western Cordillera, while in the Eastern Cordillera platinum is rare. The geo logical evidence helps to explain the relative paucity of platinoid inclusions in the goldwork of most of the Colombian area, such as the Tairona, Quimbaya, Muisca.Tolima, and Zenü regions, for the gold mineralization belts are found principally along the Central Cordillera and to a minor extent in the Eastern. Mixed gold and platinum placer deposits must have been the source of the platinum used in pre hispanic times. Modern methods of gravel dredg ing operate on a vast scale compared with Indian methods of mining and gravel washing by means of the batea, so it is hard to equate modern depo sitional studies with those used by prehispanic pop ulations. Primitive methods, however, would have possessed the virtue of close personal observation of the nature of the sands in which gold and plat inum may occur. Castillo (1909) found during investigations in the San Juan Valley that it was pos sible to tell from the color of the gravel whether it might be gold-bearing or platinum-bearing. The gold gravels were "whitish and reddish in colour, while the platinum, owing to the gabbro, has a bluish-black colour ... the separation of the gold from the platinum gravel being so sharp that the writer was able to trace the platinum to its source rock" (Castillo 1909:827). By panning operations alone, however, it is unlikely that Indians could have separated gold and platinum if they were found together, for the specific gravities of both range from about 14 to 19, with most of the gold containing some silver and copper, while native platinum may contain varying quantities of iron. copper, rhodium, palladium, and indium, the lat ter three being representatives of the platinum group metals (PGM). The area between the Cordillera de Toisan and the Pacific coast in Esmeraldas contains occur rences of the PGM, especially between the Rivers Cayapas, San Miguel, and Santiago. Ecuador is divided into three very distinct physiographic belts, the Costa, the Sierra, and the Oriente. The PGM from this region was studied by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993). The area of Esmeraldas to the Colombian bor der lies in the geological area called "The Costa." This Pinon Formation comprises basaltic lavas and breccias of submarine origin in which pillow struc tures are common and may represent oceanic crust. The age is pre-Senonian and is older than the Macuchi Formation to the west. These are overlain by Tertiary and Quaternary sediments, which reach a maximum thickness of several thousand meters in the Borbön Basin. The youngest deposits are compacted fluviatile and estuarine sediments of Quaternary age derived from erosion of the Sierra to the east. The placer deposits of platinum and gold occur in these sediments (Weiser and Schmidt-Thome 1993:62-63), and those of the platinum metals were found to be exclusively of platinum-iron alloy. The small grains are mostly well rounded by abrasion during transport. The platinum-iron alloys and especially the ruthenosmiridium inclusions are characterized by a very low content of ruthenium. On the other hand, the platinum-iron alloys always contain remarkable amounts of rhodium, and the most common inclusions are the rhodium sulfides bowiete and cuprorhodsite. All other PGM contain rhodium, which indicates a ruthenium-depleted and rhodium-enriched source for the platinum from the Santiago River. A similar trend was found by Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993) in unpublished data from placers in the Condoto River area, Department of Chocö. A sketch map showing the principal locations of present-day platinum deposits in Ecuador and Colombia is shown in Figure 3 (after Scott and Bray 1994:Figure 1). The basic to ultrabasic rocks that occur in the Macuchi Formation have been interpreted as part of an ophiolite complex and as possible source rocks for the platinum placers. The composition of the Ecuadorian placers compares closely with those</page><page sequence="10">74 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Rio Esmeraldas ECUADOR KEY o™=^okm ▲ □ Pt = Major Platinum Deposit TM = Tertiary Mafic Intrusives ■ TG = Grano-Dioritic Intrusives • Artifact of Pt/Pt-Alloy o Artifact of Platiniferous Gold ~~ \ __ / Turnaco-Esmeraldas Culture ® Modern Town Figure 3.

The Platinum Artifacts The first report ot ancient objects made of platinum from this area was that of Wolf (1879, 1892), who discovered them in alluvial gravel deposits while undertaking geological investigations in the Ecuadorian Department of Esmeraldas. In 1912, Verneau and Rivet (1912-1922:Plate 24, Figure 2, 323-324) described a gold figurine with one eye made of silver alloy and the other of platinum alloy. An examination by d'Harcourt (1948:325) gave an analysis for the platinum eye of 50 percent Pt, 25 percent Ag, and 20 percent Au. The silver was, in fact, alloyed with some copper, so the overall com position is still not clear, especially since gold must be greater than silver in Colombian and La Tolita material. Further examples of small gold and plat inum objects were found at La Tolita in 1912 and published by Farabee in 1921; in this collection, now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum, were objects of native platinum, sintered gold-plat inum alloys, and gold objects coated with platinum on one side. However, little metallurgical interest in this remarkable use of platinum was raised until a number of small objects were obtained from the area of Esmeraldas by Paul Bergs0e in Denmark. The collection comprised face studs, tweezers, nose ornaments, awls, small ornaments, and other mate rial from La Tolita and various sites in the area of Esmeraldas. In 1937 and 1938, Bergs0e published two monographs on the metallurgy of the Esmer aldas area, the first of these dealing with gold and platinum and the second concentrating on the gild ing method and the metallurgy of copper and lead. The 1937 report gives the first account of the use of sintered gold-platinum alloys in antiquity. The investigations carried out subsequently have confirmed the accuracy of Bergs0e's findings, and his monographs remain classics. A historic photo graph of part of this collection in the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, is shown in Bergs0e's 1937 monograph and illustrates some of the miniature penannular nose rings, crescentic nose ornaments, dangles, ingots, beads, wire, fish hooks, sintered lumps, platinum-plated gold, ear ornaments, face studs and other small beads, tubes, and other ornaments in the collection. Two later publications resulted from Bergs0e's work: a study by Reichlen (1941, 1942) of metalwork from Esmeraldas in the collections of the Musee de 1 'Homme and the Terver Collection and a note by d'Harcourt (1948) that gives analyses of two plat inum objects in the same museum. One of the few omissions in Bergs0e's work is the lack of any analyses for iron in the native plat inum. He did not seem to be aware that many of the gold and platinum sintered alloys could be picked up with a hand magnet, showing that they are ferromagnetic as a consequence of their plat inum-iron content. The analysis of platinoid inclu sions was considered by Bergs0e but rejected at that time, since the destruction of many objects would not necessarily have resulted in any worthwhile analytical conclusions. This statement holds today: we can correlate the detailed analyses with geo logical data, but since we know no more of the loca tion of the original deposits than was known in 1938, there is little point except for the purpose of characterization. Analytical studies show that the La Tolita artifacts are composed of five principal elements: gold, platinum, silver, iron, and some times copper. The copper content of gold alloys that have been clad with platinum appears noticeably higher than in the sintered gold-platinum alloys, which is highly significant, as we will see later. The size of the alluvial grains is similar to that of gold (McDonald 1959, 1960), and the separa tion of mixed deposits would have required hand sorting, although if the native platinum is ferro magnetic, which it often is, some clumping together of the platinum might be expected on washing in the batea. Larger nuggets of platinum are some times encountered; a specimen from the Chocö area now in the Royal Museum of Madrid weighed nearly 700 g (Heuland 1818). According to some geological writers, unaware of the use of platinum by Indians, the sources of the platinum in placers in Colombia had never been exploited (Noble 1976:228)! There are additional phases that may be present such as Au-Cu-Pt (Johan et al. 1990) that are rarely encountered. The nomenclature for the alloys of iridium, platinum, ruthenium, osmium, rhodium, and palladium (the PGM) used to follow that of Harris and Cabri (1973); however, in 1991, Harris and Cabri revised the nomenclature for this min</page><page sequence="12">76 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 eral group and adopted the recommendations of the Commission on New Minerals and Mineral Names, relating to solid-solution series, that the 50 percent rule be followed, where the mineral name is given to the dominant end member. Nickel (1992) revis ited this question again and has suggested a partial series of name changes to redefine the revision of Harris and Cabri (1991). Minerals in the Ru-Os-Pt-Ir group are either cubic (iridium and platinum) or hexagonal (osmium, ruthenium, and rutheniridosmine). The preferred terminology is now as follows: osmium is the mineral name for the hexagonal alloys; iridium, for all cubic alloys; rutheniridosmine, for all hexagonal alloys with irid ium as the major element; and ruthenium, for all hexagonal alloys with ruthenium as the major ele ment. Ideal limiting compositions of rutheniridos mine have been determined using the miscibility gap as shown by Harris and Cabri (1991). Cabri et al. (1996) collated the data for the ternary Os-Ir-Ru system, where hexagonal alloys follow the bound ary of the miscibility gap while alloys of cubic irid ium generally show no trend. I have described the composition of the PGM inclusions within the gold-platinum artifacts in detail (Scott 1982), and a synopsis of the data is shown in Figure 4, where worldwide occurrences are plotted in small dots, after Harris and Cabri (1991), and the Ecuadorian data are marked with a letter E. Data are plotted in atomic percentages, with the ternary miscibility gap shown in gray. The Ecuadorian inclusions in the Pt-Os-Ir field mostly cluster toward the high iridium, low platinum, and low osmium area, while in the Os-Ir-Ru system, they are all ruthenium deficient and are spread across the osmium-iridium field with less than 20 atomic percent of ruthenium. In the platinum-iron grains themselves, the material from Ecuador and Colombia may also contain copper, nickel, and antimony, usually pre sent only in very small amounts; the presence of small percentages of copper in the platinum (. 1 -2.0 percent by weight) is common (Scott 1982), but no nickel or antimony were detected. The platinum laths usually have a small percentage of rhodium, occasionally of iridium as well, broadly in keep ing with the results from the geological work of Weiser and Schmidt-Thome (1993:62-63). I have given one analysis of a cuproplatinum sample from the Choco area of Colombia (Scott 1982); no exam pies of this type of native platinum were found in the examination of the Esmeraldas material. This one small penannular nose ring made in a native cuproplatinum nugget is a unique object and is, so far, the only example published showing the use of cuproplatinum in antiquity. There are many exam ples of platinum-gold alloys being exported as trade items from the La Tolita area: and these have been found at Convento, at El Angel, in a Recuay crown, and in areas of the Colombian cordillera, especially in the Calima area. The Sintering of Gold and Platinum Antoine Lavoisier demonstrated the melting of platinum before King Louis XVI of France and Marie Antoinette in 1782,12 years before his exe cution by the state (McDonald and Hunt 1982:71). The metal had never been molten before in human history. This is because 1,772°C (Weast 1978) is impossible to reach with charcoal and a forced draft of air. There is a large gap between the melting points of the pure components: gold at 1,061,4°C, which can readily be molten, and platinum at 1,772°C, a difference of 708°C. Of course, the native gold will contain some silver, and the native platinum will contain some iron, both of which will lower the melting point slightly. The usual method for melting metals in Colombia and Ecuador was to use a charcoal fire and blowpipe, with hammer ing carried out using polished stone blocks, held in the hand. There is, for example, an Esmeraldas ceramic figurine, thought to be from the fourth to seventh centuries A.D., which shows a seated fig ure holding a rectangular block (Emmerich 1965:Figure 200). Resting on the block are a penan nular nose ring and a bead. Spanish cronista accounts are also given of metalsmiths hammering out gold using smoothed stone blocks and tum baga using shaped stone hammers on large stone anvils, some shaped like a Majorcan cheese (see Bray 1971:28). Using a charcoal fire and blowpipe, it is not nor mally possible to attain temperatures higher than 1,200°C, and usually less than that. In the gold-platinum equilibrium diagram there is a wide, two-phase field between 25 percent platinum and 97 percent platinum by weight.

The gold can be liquefied, since Indians could obtain temperatures higher than 1,100°C, but the platinum will remain undissolved, apart from small amounts entering into solid solution through the process of interdif fusion. But did the Indian metalsmiths actually reach a temperature of 1,100°C for this purpose? Such a temperature would have been unnecessary when the small objects were being worked and annealed to shape, as otherwise they would undergo incipient melting. Handwerkeret al. (1991) exam ined the microstructure of gold-platinum compos ite wire assemblages used as replicas in laboratory studies that were heated to 1,100°C for two min utes, held at that temperature for three minutes, and then water-quenched. Another experiment was car ried out at 1,200°C, with the same materials, hold ing the alloy at 1,200°C for seven minutes and then water quenching. In both cases, the degree of inter diffusion of gold and platinum was far greater than that seen in the artifacts under study, which were loaned to Handwerker et al. by the Museo Arqueo logico del Banco Central del Ecuador, Quito. Parts of these objects were dissolved for atomic absorp tion spectroscopy, one of which (MIT 3407-2) gave the following overall composition (by weight): 74.6 percent Au, 10.6 percent Ag, 12.7 percent Pt, and 3.4 percent Cu, totaling 101.3 percent. This result is useful but not complete, as no analyses for iron are given, which would bring the total to well over 102 percent. In the initial stages, then, we can assume that either the gold was only momentarily liquefied to stick the little pieces of platinum together or the sintered mass never really contained a liquid phase and all of the work was carried out by solid-state diffusion. However, if the platinum grains were mixed with some gold grains and placed on a char coal lump to be heated together with the blowpipe, we can assume that the gold must have been liq uid at some stage in order to create the homoge neous gold-rich matrix between the platinum grains to be seen in National Museum of Denmark No. NMD158, shown in Figure 5 and drawn in Figure 6, No. 3. The sintered mass that results from the initial stage of fusing the gold and platinum together is lumpy, porous, and difficult to work without breaking off small pieces of the unalloyed mass in the process. Successive annealing and careful working will eventually produce a sintered alloy Figure 5. Photomicrograph of a sintered gold-platinum alloy in the early stages of being fused together.

A small selection of the artifacts, mostly from the National Museum of Denmark, used in the present study is shown in Fig ure 6, and further details are briefly given in Table 1. Of the objects examined from the area, only a small awl and the ingot showed a very finely dis persed platinum content. This is of significance, because to ensure that the awl would have good working properties (such as wear resistance, hard ness, and ability to be used without cracking), the alloy would not be able to possess the porosity and large platinum remnants that are typical of many of the thin decorative sheets made of sintered gold-platinum alloy. Although platinum may have been used in the area primarily as a decorative metal, the microstructural evidence shows that some appreciation must have existed for its poten</page><page sequence="15">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 79 a 2 J J 4 Figure 6.

The most remarkable degree of interdiffusion between gold and platinum of any of the objects examined here is to be seen in the small penannu lar nose ring drawn in Figure 6, No. 1, and illus trated in the etched photomicrographs of Figure 7. These photomicrographs are at very high magnifi cations and reveal extensive dissolution of plat inum within the gold matrix. For this kind of microstructure to occur, the gold must have been heated to about 1,000- 1,100 C, j udging by the data obtained by Handwerker et al. (1991). What this penannular nose ornament shows, in fact, is that considerable variation existed in the degree to which the ancient metalsmiths sintered their native gold and native platinum together, with a wide range of microstructures being possible, all the way from platinum particles showing very little disso lution to extensive interdiffusion of the different components. Melting may not have been necessary in order to achieve the latter; indeed, after the ini tial components are mixed together, there would be no need. Salazar et al. (2006) examined several gold-platinum artifacts in the collections of the Museo del Oro (MO), Bogota, and give semi quantitative x-ray fluorescence analysis of them and a description of the microstructures. They (2006:Tables 1-3) were able to divide the alloys into three groups: those with a white appearance containing about equal amounts of gold and plat inum, such as the platiniferous component of the bimetallic nose ornament, MO 022765, that is illus trated on the Museo del Oro's Web site for the Tumaco area, with about 45 percent gold, 1 per cent silver, 45 percent platinum, 5 percent copper, and 3 percent iron (all compositions by weight per cent); a white-yellow group with more gold than platinum, a typical composition being 49 percent gold, 6 percent silver, 37 percent platinum, and 4 percent iron (MO 033447); and a white-red group with deliberate additions of copper to create a qua ternary alloy, a typical composition being 62 per cent gold, 6 percent silver, 6 percent platinum, 25 percent copper, and 1 percent iron (MO 033679).

Platinum and Lead Worked and hammered platinum grains or gold-platinum composites were used to decorate the surface of small lead spheres or ornaments by impressing the platinum into the surface of the lead. Lead has a microhardness of 25—40 Hv, so the plat inum grains can be depressed into the surface eas ily. The La Tolita culture is, again, the only one in the world to have made use of platinum-lead com posite artifacts. The subject of lead in the context of La Tolita is itself mysterious, since at present we have no idea where this lead comes from. Since lead is badly corroded in warm, moist soils with access to air and rainfall, it is quite possible that there has been substantial loss of small lead artifacts to cor rosion as they convert to cerussite or hydrocerus site in burial. Small pieces of native lead had been found in platinum sands in Colombia; Bergs0e (1938:21) also mentions that Root reports metallic lead, in the form of 60- to 80-g nuggets on the west coast of Guatemala, although in general terms the use of native lead is considered a very rare event as the metal is readily smelted from its ores. An analysis by Bergs0e of one lead nose ring showed the presence of .1-.2 percent copper, .05 percent bismuth, and .01 percent silver, with no detected tin, arsenic, or antimony.

One lead nose ornament, shown in Figure 6, No. 8, was examined. The surface was covered in lead cor rosion products, and the small sample taken had only a few remnant specks of lead metal left that gave the electron microprobe analyses (by weight) shown in Table 2. Neither Bergs0e nor Reichlen appears to have made any determination of sulfur in their exami nation. The analyses shown in Table 2 reveal a con siderable sulfur presence. Bergs0e noted that if a small piece of galena, lead sulfide, is heated with a charcoal fire and a blowpipe, a small bead of lead could very easily be produced. The presence of rather high levels of sulfur in this nose ring sug gests that he may well have been correct and that the lead was made from smelted galena rather than from native lead, especially given the environ mental conditions around La Tolita; but further research is needed to shed light on this interesting question, as the sulfur content could be influenced by subsequent corrosion of the lead. Platinum-Plated Gold The use of platinum to coat one or both sides or selected areas of one side of gold artifacts is another La Tolita achievement unparalleled anywhere. Some artifacts have a dual surface: with half coated with platinum and the other coated with gold, this duality was probably of significant symbolic, reli gious, or shamanistic importance. A well-known example consisting of an ear ornament half in plat inum-gold alloy and half in gold alloy with a sodalite bead incorporated into the assemblage is in the collections of the Museo del Oro, Banco de la Repüblica, Bogota. It is said to come from the Inguapi River area of Tumaco and is only datable to between 500 B.C. and A.D. 300. Sodalite or other beads joined to a gold or gold-platinum orna ment are a feature of La Tolita metalwork whose cultural significance remains to be unraveled. If fine platinum laths are placed over a strip of hammered gold and heated at 800-1,000°C, some dissolution takes place and the platinum will tend to sink through the gold, some of it becoming bro ken down to fine globules. This was carried out in a laboratory experiment using pure gold and filings of a 96 percent platinum/4 percent iron alloy (by weight). Similarly, if the unalloyed laths are forced onto the surface of the gold with a hammer, they tend to be driven into the surface and to become covered with the softer gold matrix. However, a platinum-coated surface was produced by the Indi ans, so the question arises as to how this was achieved. Bergs0e suggests the following method: It is extremely easy with a hammer and anvil to make a piece of platinum plated gold. A small piece of the hammered-out plate made of the artificially produced [sintered] alloy is placed above a little bead of gold alloy, heated until coherence takes place and then hammered out with a few intervals for annealing. When the two metals have attained the same degree of hardness they are hammered out together, and we now have a gold plate with a thin coat ing of platinum alloy [1937:27]. Metallurgical examination of some of the small objects coated with platinum shows that in some cases, extremely thin platinum-clad surfaces have been produced, consisting of gold with a single layer of small platinum laths, as in the microstruc ture of a small dangle from the National Museum of Denmark collections shown in Figure 8 and in Figure 6, No. 4. Very little sintering has occurred, and the plat inum could not have been applied as a sintered mixture subsequently fused to a gold alloy base. The method of manufacture can probably be recon structed as follows: first, a gold alloy was ham mered out approximately to shape, followed by the addition of fine platinum particles to one side. With careful heating, these platinum additions will just fuse with the gold at the surface. When this alloy is hammered out, the platinum surface cannot be driven into the gold to the same extent as unalloyed</page><page sequence="18">82 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Figure 8. Platinum clad gold dangle from the collections of the National Museum of Denmark. The finely hammered plat inum laths coat the gold surface. The dangle appears silvery in color as a result of this fine platinum coating. Etched in aqua regia, x450, see Figure 6 no. 4. inclusions can be, and they will tend to flatten out along the surface of the gold as both are deformed. Since the platinum will still be appreciably harder than the gold matrix, some embedding of the plat inum would be expected on heavy working. But if further platinum grains are added, and the process is repeated, then a substantial coating of platinum can be built up that will give a smooth silver-gray surface on burnishing. A laboratory experiment was performed on a gold sheet coated with filings of the 96 percent platinum/4 percent iron alloy. The initial color of the filings was silver, but after heating under char coal in a muffle furnace to about 900°C for 15 min utes, the sintered surface of the platinum assumed a dull gray-silver color. As the platinum enters into solution with gold, the color of the resulting alloy changes from gold to gray-yellow to gray-white as the platinum content increases. The change in color on the outer surfaces of the platinum here, how ever, is due to some oxidation of the iron compo nent. If the platinum-iron alloy filings are heated in a blowtorch with a blue, oxidizing flame, the fil ings are rapidly covered in a thin layer of iron oxides, which interfere with the sintering process. The Indians, with a charcoal fire and blowpipe, had the means of avoiding this excessive oxidation, since the atmosphere in a charcoal fire will not usu ally be an oxidizing environment. The laboratory alloy was lightly hammered and annealed at bright red heat, with further cycles producing a flat sheet with gold on one side and platinum on the other. A little of the platinum broke up and sank through the gold through gravity separation; the major part remained on the surface to produce a platinum coated gold sheet. Meeks et al. (2002) examined a miniature zoomorphic mask from the La Tolita culture, in the collections of the Museo Nacional del Banco Cen tral del Ecuador, Quito (Inv. 1-53-75), which had previously been described by Estevez de Romero (1995, 1998). It is made of a number of different components, and many were found to have a plat ing of platinum on one side of about 20-30 /y thick, with a high density of flattened platinum grains fused within a gold-silver alloy matrix. A typical analysis for this coating found 9 percent platinum, 34 percent silver, and 54 percent gold. There are several indications that the platinum-gold coating was applied as an already formed thin applique. First, the plating stops at the top of the pendant in an abrupt fashion. Second, the diffusion of the plat inum into the gold-silver alloy of the applique foil is much greater than the diffusion into the gold of the body of the pendant. Third, the gold-silver alloy used in the foil has a significantly higher silver composition than the gold of the pendant itself. This kind of thick, platinum-gold foil coating was probably also used for another small dangle in the National Museum of Denmark, Copenhagen, collection whose microstructure is shown in Fig ure 9 and drawn in Figure 6, No. 5. In this dangle, the composition of the gold substrate is 77.9 per cent gold, 9.6 percent copper, 8.7 percent silver, and 2 percent platinum (by weight); while the compo sition of the thick coating is 43.3 percent gold, 1.2 percent copper, 4.9 percent silver, 38.3 percent plat inum, .7 percent rhodium, and 3.8 percent iron (by</page><page sequence="19">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 83 Figure 9.

The surface appears slightly rough, as if the platinum has been fused to the gold without appreciable surface finishing, which may be a significant observation if this is due to the fusion of a separate platinum-gold alloy foil to the surface. One ot the most extraordinary examples of the great skill in platinum coating over gold is that of a small gold arm or leg bangle in thin hammered gold strip that has a platinum-coated central band with a border the color of the gold substrate on either side of the platinum-gold surface. This La Tolita specimen is in the collections of the National Museum of the American Indian and is discussed further in Scott 2004. For the past 100 years, this masterpiece has been languishing in storage, coiled up in a test tube, its superb and subtle craftsman ship having gone unnoticed or unappreciated. All the platinum-clad objects examined from La Tolita have some copper content, but only 55 per cent of the sintered gold-platinum alloys have any copper content. The evidence suggests that copper additions were made to the gold-platinum alloys but that these additions were controlled. The indis criminate use of scrap tumbaga alloy fragments, for example, would give rise to high levels of cop per that would be undesirable in gold-platinum alloys. One reason for this is that oxidation of cop per, on heating sintered gold alloy and platinum grains together, would interfere with the sintering process. To approach the same argument from the per spective of gold content, it is quite evident that where gold and gold-copper alloys have been pre pared, platinum has been excluded or efforts have been made to keep platinum to low levels. Several of Bergs0e's results support this argument. The gold used to make the sintered platinum alloys con tains some silver, whose presence appears vari able; however, examination of the Ag/Au ratios reveals that they fall in the range between .10 and .15, indicating some consistency in the Ag/Au ratios for the Esmeraldas material. From the National Museum of Denmark collections is a small rec tangular platinum alloy block with pale silver yellow colored surfaces (Bergs0e 1937:Plate 3, Figure 49; Scott and Bray 1980:Figure 7). The block is smoothly finished on all sides except one, where it has been cut, probably with a chisel, from a longer strip of metal. The rough and deformed face of the cut shows the same pale silver-yellow as the surfaces. The alloy is ferromagnetic. The sampled section was etched for 30 seconds in a cyanide/persulfate mix, which revealed a heavily worked and annealed microstructure. The grains can be seen to be recrystallized and well worked with very little porosity. There are only a few larger platinum grains; one of these, toward one edge of the section, shows the incipient dissolution of the platinum along grain boundaries, isolating globu lar areas of platinum as some enters into solution with the gold. The microstructure of this small rec tangular ingot is remarkable for the fine grain struc ture and the regular dispersion of small platinum-rich globules that it contains. The pho tomicrograph is shown in Figure 10 and in Figure 6, No. 2, while microhardness readings gave the results shown in Table 3.</page><page sequence="20">84 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Figure 10. A small ingot of gold-platinum alloy which has been well-worked to shape and has resulted in a quite even platinum distribution. The block has a high Vickers hard ness, as seen in Table 3. Etched in potassium cyanide/ ammonium persulphate, xJ25, see Figure 6 no 2. The three hardness values, all ostensibly obtained from the gold-rich matrix rather than the inclusions, in fact owe their high and variable nature to the finely dispersed second phase, which must have an appreciable effect on all the readings taken. The figures are, then, a rough average of the two constituents but show, nevertheless, that the alloy is considerably hard and as an ingot, highly suit able for the manufacture of small items such as nee dles, fishhooks, and other small implements. An electron microprobe analysis using line scanning was taken across the polished surface to examine Table 3. Some Typical Microhardness Values for the Small Awl. Microhardness: weight diagonal average Hv 1 50g 9 165 2 50g 6.75 291 3 50g 8 209 the variations in gold and platinum concentrations. The gold matrix shows periodic disturbances that correspond to the presence of areas of high plat inum concentration. Some interalloying with the gold has taken place, although the platinum seems to be present principally as a large number of finely dispersed globules. One inclusion, about 50 pi in length, is composed principally of iridium but also contains some platinum and osmium. A number of spot analyses were obtained, given in Table 4. These results show that a native gold has been mixed with the platinum grains. The silver content is quite high: the Ag/Au ratio for analysis 4 being . 125. Since the microhardness values of gold rarely achieve figures greater than 70 Hv. the production of gold-platinum chisels and awls would indeed be of great practical benefit in goldworking. Micro hardness values of 160-200 Hv compare with those of bronze. In summary, then, platinum has been used to create sintered gold-platinum composites, platinum-clad gold alloys, selectively plated plat inum artifacts with coverings of platinum only in certain parts of the object, and platinum-gold alloy foils that were then used to coat gold artifacts with a thick platinum-rich coating by diffusion bonding to the gold alloy substrate. Some objects make use of platinum-gold alloy components that are then joined to gold-rich parts to create multiple-colored artifacts, some of them of miniature size. It is a remarkable range of achievements by any measure. Platinum-Gold Alloys from Other Areas of Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia A number of other objects have been reported in the literature as containing platinum (or platinoid inclusions). Most of these objects have been described in Scott and Bray 1980, 1994. Some of these are of considerable interest and will be briefly mentioned later. Some earlier studies were carried out by d'Harcourt (1948:323), who mentions a small nose ring, of gray-white color, that came from the Rio Tapaila, some 2 km to the north of the Rio Mate, Department of Esmeraldas. This piece was not illustrated by d'Harcourt; it is in the collections of the Musee de 1' Homme, No. 48.45.1, and is cres centic in shape and weighs 2.37 g. The alloy had a composition of 49 percent Pt, 29 percent Au, 2 per cent Ag, and 9 percent Cu. A spectrochemical</page><page sequence="21">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 85 Table 4.

The second analysis reported by d'Harcourt was for a gold figurine. The right eye is made of plat inum alloy. The figure itself is made of a number of thin sheets of gold held together with fine sta ples of gold. Verneau and Rivet (1912-1922: 323-324) suggest that this figure originally had two platinum-gold alloy eyes, one of which was lost in the highlands and replaced with locally avail able silver. It was found at El Angel, Carchi, just south of the Colombian border. Most of the metal work from the El Angel area came from shaft tombs whose dates span the period A .D. 800-1500. These tombs also contained imported seashells and ceramic figurines of the Esmeraldas-Tumaco type (Francisco 1969; Uribe 1977-1978). Schuler-Schömig (1975) illustrates another masterpiece: it is a gold alloy mask coated on the outer surface with platinum. The mask has human features and animal fangs, the concave pupils being typical of masks from Esmeraldas The punched holes suggest that the mask was originally pinned to a shaped wooden idol. The mask is believed to come from the region of the Rio Esmeraldas and was obtained in the 1870s by Adolf Bastian (Museum für Volkerkunde, Berlin, Va-2152). Zevallos (1965-1966:Plate 2, Figure 5) reports a birdlike ornament made in gold with an eye of plat inum. It is from the Island of La Tolita and now in the collections of the Casa de la Cultura, Nucleo de Guayaquil. Bushneil (1951:275-285, No. 292b) shows another sheet mask with punched holes at the bottom of the chin and at the sides of the head dress. It is made in a gold alloy with eyes and teeth of platinum. Bushneil suggests that it is from the Manteno culture, Integration period. This mask was found at Convento, Manabi'. The exhibition catalog Tesori dell'Ecuador (1973:No. 332) illus trates a repousse anthropomorphic pectoral of sheet metal, showing the side view of a feline with a long tongue and human feet. It is described as "gold and platinum (Museo del Banco Central, Quito, No. 56.80.70), from the Island of La Tolita. I (1998) examined a Recuay fox and crown. The Recuay cultural area is known to extend from Calle jön de Huaylas to the headwaters of the Rio Santa. It is reminiscent of the Moche style in technical mastery and iconography. The crown itself consists of a band of gold alloy about 5.5 cm high and about .2 mm thick. The band is made in hammered sheet that has been ornamented with a cutout design show ing small human faces in a repeating pattern, with the eyes, nose, and mouth of the face shown by cutout areas. From microscopic examination it can be seen that this design was cut using a chisel. Part of the head is shown in Figure 11. The pattern is repeated so that the small faces appear upside down on the top of the band, in a design executed with great skill. Pairs of small holes at the top and bot tom of this crown probably indicate where attach ments of small dangles were affixed. The design on the crown is rather similar to textile patterns from the Paracas-Nazca cultural regions. The crown itself is made in a native gold alloy, with no platinum con tent that could be detected by x-ray fluorescence analysis. This band has an unusual matte appear ance with some staining. The head, which has a ser pentlike quality, is of a fox and has been attached to the band with four tabs passing through slots cut into the crown. Further details are given in Scott 1998: what is significant here is that the teeth are made in a heavily sintered gold-platinum alloy as seen in the photomicrograph of Figure 12. At the present time, this is the farthest south that we are able to trace the use of sintered gold-plat inum alloys, some 750 km from La Tolita, from which it must surely have been imported. Caution has to be exercised, however, since this is not an excavated example, and further archaeological data must await the discovery of artifacts with secure provenience. The pre-Incan northern highland cul ture of the Recuay lasted from about 200 B.C. to A.D. 700, corresponding well in terms of time</page><page sequence="22">86 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Figure 11. Presumed Recuay crown with animal head whose teeth are made in a platinum-gold alloy. period to the use of gold-platinum sintered alloys from La Tolita. From the Colombian side of the border in the Esmeraldas-Tumaco area there are two finds that are so far unpublished. One is a nose ornament, sim ilar to an example illustrated by Bray (1978:No. 510) and apparently bimetallic, with one half of the ring made in platinum and the other made in gold. The other find is that reported in a newspaper arti cle (El Espectador, 20 May 1981). This is a poten tially important find of gold, platinum, and bimetallic objects from Guenyele, on the Rio Guapi, although what has happened to this mater ial subsequently is unknown. The discovery of 17 artifacts from the region of Frias, in the north of Peru (Alva 1992:86; Plazas 2007:134), which were apparently of La Tolita-Tumaco type, and the existence of other arti facts of gold with platinum content from Calima and the Chocö region, far to the south in Colom bia, show that other regions of South America could have made use of alluvial platinum deposits. Recent finds of such artifacts from Manta in Ecuador (Plazas 2007:248) as well as from the Huari cul tural area of Peru pose questions concerning the possible local manufacture of such artifacts rather than being exports from the La Tolita-Tumaco area. Some of these artifacts, such as examples from the Chocö region (Scott 1982), contain platinum but do not represent the sophisticated utilization of the metal that is characteristic of La Tolita-Tumaco. The alluvial gold deposits might contain platinum in some localities, and this platiniferous gold was simply worked or cast to shape in the way that native gold or tumbaga alloys would have been, Figure 12. Photomicrograph of part of the teeth of the crown, showing a very well worked and dispersed plat inum-gold sintered alloy. Etched in potassium cyanide/ammonium persulphate, x 160. with no attempt to separate out the platinum itself. In some cases the platinum content is significant enough to alter the color of the gold artifact, which could have been of interest to the local craftsman, since surface color was such an important aspect of the metallurgy of Colombia. Fusion-Plated Gold over Copper or Tumbaga The surface enrichment or depletion gilding of debased gold alloys was extensively used in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru for producing golden surfaces on heavily debased gold-copper or gold-silver-copper alloys (Bray 1993; Lechtman 1973; Scott 2004). In Peru, the use of electro chemical replacement for producing micron-thin gold layers over copper artifacts in the Moche cul ture (Lechtman 1979) remains one of the most astonishing accomplishments of ancient Peruvian metalsmiths. Less familiar is the use of thick gold-copper alloys over copper interiors, which is yet another La Tolita specialty. Depletion gilding was also used on tumbaga alloys from La Tolita, but several examples of copper with gold-copper coatings have been found. These can subsequently be surface enriched themselves, creating depletion gilded and fusion-plated gold-copper alloys over a copper base. Bergs0e (1938) had already concluded that a process of coating copper with thick gold layers had been developed in the Esmeraldas-Tumaco area: another remarkable achievement of his work, as it was deduced entirely from wet chemical analyses. He suggested that the coatings had been made by</page><page sequence="23">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 87 a dipping process, in which the roughly finished object was immersed in a bath of molten cop per-gold eutectic alloy; the object was then removed and finished with some further hammer ing and annealing. The binary eutectic (80.1 weight percent Au, 19.9 weight percent Cu) has a melting point of 911°C, with any silver present further reducing the melting point, itself 173°C below that of pure copper at 1,084°C. After dissolving the copper base of five gilded objects in dilute nitric acid, Bergs0e found the remaining scales to have a composition of 64.8 percent gold, 26.8 percent copper, and 8.4 percent silver. The only evidence that Bergs0e put forward for the dipping process was the gradual decrease in gold concentration in successive layers removed from the surface. One object examined was coated only on one side, and the thickness of the coating on some copper sheets was not the same on both sides. Bergs0e's sugges tion would also involve heating some quantity of copper-gold alloy to within a narrow temperature range, completely immersing and retrieving the object, and preventing excessive surface oxidation. The evidence points to the probable use of other methods of achieving the same result that could be more readily controlled. One way in which this can be done is to apply a coat of copper-gold alloy fil ings, perhaps with an organic binder, followed by fusion with a blowpipe under charcoal and ham mering out to smooth the surface. This process would conserve fuel, energy, and metal, compared with the dipping process. It remains, however, only as a probable method: it is not possible to prove that it was the technique actually used by Indian metalsmiths. The use of this fusion gilding process has more links with the southern metallurgical tra ditions of Peru and South and Central Ecuador than with the central or northern cultures of Colombia. I (1994) found that a penannular copper nose ornament dated to about the tenth century A.D. from the Milagro-Quevedo phase urn burials at La Com pan fa, Los Rios Province (Meggers 1966), had been fusion-gilded, while La Niece and Meeks (2000:232) discovered that a cast Moche mace head in the form of a owl head in the collections of the British Museum had also been fusion-gilded. The discovery of the fusion gilding process as far south as the Moche culture is surprising, especially because of the prevalence of the electrochemical replacement gilding technique, used in Vicus, Loma Negra, and Moche copper artifacts exten sively, and suggests that much remains to be learned about the true extent of the use of fusion gilding from southern Colombia all the way down the con tinent to Peru. The problem here is that it is prac tically impossible to be certain of which gilding technique has been employed if objects cannot be sampled for metallographic examination, espe cially since many Ecuadorian copper artifacts are gilded with gold foil, adding yet again to the list of potential gilding techniques. A calculation was made of possible diffusion working temperatures by examination of electron microprobe line scans across the diffusion profile between the gold coating and the copper interior, from which the distance from the Metano interface can be calculated. The Metano interface represents the original position of the junction between the two contiguous metals, which will apparently move if the two metals have unequal coefficients of diffu sion (Matano 1933). The apparent movement of the junction between these two metals results in the Hartley-Kirkendall shift, indicating the extent of the movement of the boundary. Further technical details describing this calculation and the diffusion coefficients required are given in Vignes and Badia 1971. Working followed by annealing will produce interdiffusion at a faster rate than that allowed for by diffusion coefficient measurements, but the amount of working is not extensive. Time and tem perature are independent variables, which means that in order to obtain a theoretical profile, one or the other of them has to be fixed so that the calcu lated profile can be matched with that determined by actual measurements of the ancient fusion gilded surfaces. However, although the calculation cannot be accurate, it does exclude some combi nations of temperature and time, because these would result in a greater distance of diffusion from the Metano interface than that determined by the electron microprobe studies. For example, it we assume that the copper and gold-rich coating are heated together at 900°C for 10 hours, then we arrive at a figure of about 600 /v interdiffusion. This figure is patently wrong, because the microprobe studies show a region of interdiffusion over less than 50 pi. The diffusion profile obtained is also much more sensitive to tem perature than to time. For example, if the diffusion</page><page sequence="24">88 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1,2011 ol gold into copper from the Metano interface is 21 /&lt;, as it is in one of the plated objects, then heat ing at 900°C for five minutes still produces a greater depth of gold diffusion (about 50 p) than that shown by the Narino fragment. Similarly if a very low tem perature is selected (say, 300°C), then in order to achieve 50 // of interdiffusion, a very long time is required: the diffusion profile obtained sets some practical limits to the manipulation of temperature and time. It is possible to give a range of tempera ture and time combinations that accounts in a sim plified way for the observed diffusion. The method I (1982) used followed that of Darken and Gurry (1953:2) and was applied to a Narino example of the fusion gilding process. At 500°C for 60 seconds it is not possible to attain the diffusion of gold into copper by much more than 2-5 pi. The required dif fusion distance is 26^, that observed on the object. Increasing the time by 10 times to 600 seconds only produces a threefold increase in diffusion, which is still too low. The initial diffusion of the gold and the copper substrate probably took place between 700°C and 900°C. Lower temperatures give very long periods of time, which would not be of any practical benefit. Working and annealing at lower temperatures would also not greatly increase the extent of interdiffusion unless very long annealing times were employed. It is difficult to say it this calculation reintorces the concept that the fusion-gilded surfaces were prepared using a solid paste of gold-copper alloy. Since it appears that some objects were only coated :&gt;n one side and maintain an even thickness, dip ping in molten gold-copper alloy appears difficult to accept. Some objects have different thicknesses Df gold on either side, which could not have been made by a dipping process. In one anchor-shaped abject in the collections of the National Museum Df Denmark, the development of a shift in the inter face between gold coating and substrate, together with porosity at the junction, argues for extensive interdiffusion of the gold-copper alloy coating into the copper substrate: in this case perhaps a dipping process was used. 1 he object is shown in higure 6, No. 6, and elec :ron microprobe elemental maps are shown in Fig jre 13, so there may well have been more than one :echnique employed to achieve this kind of thick :oating. It is certainly possible, for example, to apply i small drop of gold-copper alloy to a copper sheet Figure 13. Electron microprobe elemental maps for gold, copper, silver and a back-scattered electron map of the alloy area used for the maps. Reveals a thick, well-diffused gold-copper alloy coating over copper, made by the fusion gilding process. Using this technique, thick gold-copper alloy coatings could be produced over copper. See Figure 6, no 6. and to heat the two components together until the gold alloy flows over the surface of the copper. This was replicated in a laboratory experiment where :he temperature was kept at 1,000°C for 10 minutes ;uid a gold-copper eutectic alloy flowed across the surface, rather like molten tin flowing across a bronze. The surface was uneven but could have been easily formed with further working. A small crescentic nose ornament from La lolita, shown in Figure 6, No. 7, is of bimetallic instruction, as the photomicrograph of Figure 14 in the etched and unetched condition clearly reveals. It is made of a gold-rich tumbaga joined :o a copper-rich tumbaga, creating two different colors on either side of the nose ornament. The gold-rich component, to the left-hand side of the photomicrographs, has a composition of 51.5 per cent gold, 32.6 percent copper, and 7.4 percent sil ver, while the copper-rich tumbaga is 73.6 percent :opper, 25.8 percent gold, and 1.3 percent silver.</page><page sequence="25">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM J 71 XI30 171 X130 Figure 14.

This bimetallic crescentic nose ornament in two different tumbaga alloys is yet another La Tolita innovation, which is so far unreported for any other cultural area in South America. Wire Making The usual techniques of making wire are by draw ing, swaging, strip-twisting, block-twisting, fold ing, casting, and hammering (Oddy 1977, 1981, 1983; Ogden 1982; Scott 1991). Fine braiding, strip-twisting, block-twisting, and folding were all used in La Tolita for wire production. Some very thin gold wires were found at Inguapf, mound 5, level 7, from the late Formative period, dated to about 325 B.C. (Bouchard 1984). These are extra ordinarily fine and about 60 mm in length. Three lengths of wire were found, of which one was examined in the scanning electron microscope and found to have a rectangular cross section with a width that varies from .035 mm to .032 mm and a thickness of .027 mm. Electron probe microanalysis was used to deter mine the major elemental composition: 85.9 per cent gold and 10.3 percent of silver were determined, with no copper or platinum detected. This is a fairly typical composition for the native gold from the area. It is extremely difficult to manipulate wire of this very fine thickness; never theless it has been worked to shape by hammering. Very fine wires wrapped into small coils or bun dles are also known from the material collected by Saville at LaTolita (NMAI No. 1/7449). The wires are described in greater detail in Scott 1991. There are a number of remarkable facts concerning these rectangular wires. First, no other culture in the world made rectangular wires 32 ji 27 ja in cross section. It is not obvious how they were made. They were not drawn to shape using a drawplate; this is clear from the surface and the microstruc ture. The only method that I can think of is that the gold was hammered out to a thin foil and then some kind of tool was used to cut the wire into very fine parallel strips, although it is not possible to see any evidence of such a technique either in the microstructure or in the scanning electron micro scope surface views of the wire. Second, the early date of the Inguapf wire, at 325 B.C., shows that sophisticated and exceptional gold artifacts were already being made at La Tolita by this early date. The wires fit into the corpus of miniature gold and platinum technology of the area and are yet another remarkable and unique product of the culture. Granulation, Soldering, Hole Punching, Mechanical Joining Making holes through sheet metal is always nec essary, but in La Tolita another specialty is that burrs on the underside or reverse were smoothed and hammered flat so that the hole had no rough edges on either side and was perfectly circular, obviously made with great care and precision. This contrasts with the typical piercing of gold sheet with an awl, in which the burrs on the underside are often not removed in a lot of goldwork from Colombia, for example. Small gold staples or tab-and-slot methods for joining sheet gold objects were com monly used, especially for the sheet gold figurines</page><page sequence="26">90 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 where different parts needed to be joined together, which would be hard to solder. The production of tiny gold and gold-platinum granules in La Tolita was essential for granulated gold beads and tiny ornaments (Orchard 1925, 1927,1929). There are many ways in which these beads could have been produced. A significant find in this connection is a ceramic plate with tiny depressions, some still bearing small gold beads, which shows that in the Calima area, the method used to fabricate the small spheres was to fill each depression with a little gold dust and then heat the matrix, producing numerous small beads of the same size at the same time. The granulation matrix is illustrated by Bray et al. (2000). Granulation can be carried out in a number of different ways. The gold grains can be soldered together by appli cation of an alloy with a lower melting point between the small spheres. This is hard to con trol, and there is a danger of the beads being over run with solder. A more subtle approach to this problem is to create the solder in situ by use of a copper salt and glue applied to the gold spheres in the area to be joined. When heated, the glue car bonizes, reducing the copper salt to metallic cop per, which then interdiffuses with the gold, forming a gold-copper alloy with a lower melt ing point than the gold and producing a metallur gical join, often of great delicacy. Yet another method is to stick or hold the gold spheres in place and to carefully heat the granules with a blowpipe until the surfaces of gold just begin to "sweat," with the small amount of liquid that forms join ing the grains together. If heating is prolonged, then the grains would simply coalesce, so very careful temperature control is required for the sweat-welding of gold. The use of the copper salt and glue approach to granulation lacks evidence in Colombia and Ecuador and appears to be more of an Old World technique. Soldering was used in some cases, and the difference in melting point between parts being soldered together and the sol der itself has been found, from a nose stud in the NMAI collections, to be as little as 50°C in terms of liquidus value of the ternary alloy (Scott and Doehne 1990), which would demand great skill. Gold granules were also joined by the sweat welding technique, and examples of this fabrica tion method have been found from both the Calima and Tumaco areas. Conclusions When the Spanish first found the dull gray platinum grains, they simply threw them away as worthless. The Europeans failed to appreciate its metallurgi cal potential or to give it any value. Once scientists had worked out what it was, unaware that the Indi ans had already made extensive use of it, the town of Quito was soon razed to the ground in the newly rapacious thirst for platinum. A few philosophers and natural historians, such as Julius Caesar Scaliger (1557), and the Jesuit priest Jose de Acosta (1604) provided the first intimations of the exis tence of platinum, which were later followed by the scientific inquiries of many natural scientists, such as Antonio de Ulloa (1748) and William Bowles (1775), leading later to the obsession to pro duce malleable platinum. The La Tolita-Tumaco culture is the only one in the ancient world to have used platinum to pro duce a sophisticated metallurgical tradition. In the process, this culture also created the first powder metallurgy in the world. Powder metallurgy is a method of fabrication that utilizes a molten or semi liquid phase to adhere together more refractory par ticles or metallic materials that cannot be easily molten themselves. This is an apt description of the ancient platinum metallurgy, since the platinum grains were diffused to a limited extent in the gold matrix, resulting in a heterogeneous mass, essen tially the same in concept as a modern "powder" metallurgical product. As we have seen, there are other occurrences of alluvial platinum, and this helps to frame the ques tion as to why the only ancient culture to make use of platinum was that of the precolumbian Indians of LaTolita-Tumaco. Why should this be so, if allu vial platinum is found in rivers and gravels in cul tural areas nominally considered more "advanced" than those of Ecuador? The geographical situation of the gold and platinum placers is part of the answer, as in some other areas of the world the two native metals do not occur in the same streams or gravels, though in many they do. Gold and platinum occur in several river ter races: for example, Krstic and Tarkian (1997) found native platinum grains with alluvial gold in the streams and terrace sediments of the Srebrenica River, Yugoslavia, with clear traces of working of the alluvial deposits stretching back to the Middle</page><page sequence="27">Scott] MASTER METALSMITHS IN GOLD AND PLATINUM 91 Ages. Yugoslavia was an early center of extractive metallurgy in the Bronze Age, so the area could hardly be considered to be metallurgically back ward. The fact that silver was not available, or not used, in the La Tolita area may be one factor for platinum's discovery and use. Platinum may have been a color substitute for silver, although that is something of an oversimplification's the range of colors in the sintered alloys encompasses yellow green, yellow-gray, steel gray, gray, and plum. The majority are of a silver-gray or steel gray colorrather than a silver-white, and my x-ray diffraction stud ies have shown that this is due to a thin film of hematite, or sometimes magnetite, on the surface of the artifacts. The gray tinge is provided by the iron content of the native platinum and its subse quent oxidation, which provides a different hue than that of silver and a color that is much more stable, as it represents a patina over the platinum. The work of Salazar et al. (2006) confirms my observations made from La Tolita material that deliberate use was also made of alloys of gold-silver-copper-plat inum, as these create a whole range of darker col ored alloys. The sintered alloys, used for awls and chisels, also have impressive hardness values, tes tifying to their utilitarian value as well as their var ious color values, which is often overlooked. As we can see from the depiction of numerous illnesses in the pottery record, the Indians were close observers of nature and produced both ceramic and metallurgical masterpieces with great skill. Their attention to observed detail and the met allurgical sophistication of the metalsmiths must be part of the answer as to why this region initiated so many metallurgical techniques not employed anywhere else, such as fusion gilding, very fine wire production, platinum and lead composite objects, gold- and platinum-plated tumbaga alloys, platinum-gold sintered alloys, prepared gold-plat inum sintered foils to be used over gold, and the use of molds to form the sintered alloy into prede termined shapes, the latter technology an interest ing possible link to the predilection for ceramic molds for ceramic production in the region. The position of La Tolita as a burial ground, reli gious center, and trading port must have meant that it was the prime location for specialized artisans to develop these extraordinary capabilities. The early date associated with the very fine gold wires reviewed in this article, of about 350 B .C„ leads to the inference that there must have been some antecedents to this extremely fine gold wire. The recent discovery of tumbaga plaques from the nearby site of Las Balsas, dated to about 900 B.C., shows that such an inference is correct. As the ana lytical evidence shows that native gold from the La Tolita region was used to make these objects, then it follows that the alloying with copper must have been carried out locally too. These facts suggest that a further inference can be made: that earlier work ing of gold probably existed in the La Tolita area. Generally we assume that metallurgy originated in the ancient Peruvian area and spread northward, reaching southern Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica at a later date, in the early centuries A.D. It is surprising that tumbaga alloys should already be present in the La Tolita area at such an early date. By the time that metallurgy was advancing in the early Bronze Age in Europe, around 2500 B.C., no notice was taken of alluvial platinum, which must have been found, because unlike other metal lic substances, it was impossible to melt it or to alloy it. Other societies failed to recognize the potential of platinum, as they did not make the imaginative leap of alloying the grains with gold or of heating the naturally mixed platinum and gold deposits to see what might happen to them. Archaeological work in Colombia suggests that socially stratified chiefdoms existed, and fine ceram ics and high-grade gold objects are found in tombs of the elite, with tumbaga or copper objects for other members of the culture. Some of the gold objects from La Tolita are both large and impressive, sug gesting that these were from elite burials; however, the sheer quantity of miniature gold items produced by the La Tolita-Tumaco culture suggests that the artifacts must have been worn or used by most mem bers of society. Whether this was so for the inhabi tants of La Tolita remains unknown. That specialized metalworkers must have existed in La Tolita appears undeniable, given the range and sophistication of the gold and platinum artifacts. Their story is an inspir ing one: a local chiefdom among the mangroves of the Pacific coast that was able to produce, with the simplest tools, developments in platinum metallurgy far in advance of those of Europeans, who later had to destroy an entire city to recover the dull gray material they had once thought of as worthless earth, unaware of the accomplishments of the prehispanic Indians of Ecuador and Colombia.</page><page sequence="28">92 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 22, No. 1, 2011 Acknowledgments.
