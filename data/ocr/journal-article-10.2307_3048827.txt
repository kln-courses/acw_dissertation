<plain_text><page sequence="1">143 Hic Homo Formatur: The Genesis Frontispieces of the Carolingian Bibles* Herbert L. Kessler Manuscripts of the complete Bible illuminated with a uni- fied and comprehensive set of illustrations are unknown before the ninth century. Only single books and small com- pendia such as the Pentateuch and Gospels, illustrated with pictures interspersed within the columns of text, gathered together at the tops or bottoms of text pages, or, occasion- ally, arranged on separate folios, survive from the Early Christian period; and surely no full Bible ever was illus- trated with the density typical of these early volumes.1 To provide the complete biblical text with a consistent set of illustrations, artists eventually developed a system of full- page miniatures placed within or at the front of the various books, thereby establishing a clear over-all structure while severely reducing the total number of pictures. In construct- ing these miniatures, illuminators did not reject the earlier tradition - quite the contrary. As K6hler has argued for the Bibles from Tours,2 as Gaehde has shown for the San Paolo Bible,3 and as Weitzmann has demonstrated for the Greek Leo Bible (Vatican, Cod. Reg. gr. I),4 artists drew heavily on the tradition of text illustration to create their full-page illustrations. In his analysis of the earliest extant frontispiece Bibles, produced at Tours during the second quarter of the ninth century, Wilhelm K6hler5 set forth impressive arguments that the system of illumination in the Grandval Bible (London, British Museum, Cod. Add. 10546) and the Vivian Bible (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, Cod. lat. i) reflects a manuscript created for Pope Leo the Great and that, in fact, the creation of a harmoniously illustrated complete Bible was accomplished already during the fifth century. Because K6hler's theory considers one of the most characteristic manuscript forms of the ninth century to be essentially a replica of a Roman prototype, it has important implica- tions, not only for our understanding of Early Christian illumination, but especially for our evaluation of Carolin- gian inventiveness and creativity. This theory depends, of course, on a complex analysis of the several Touronian frontispieces and on an erudite examination of the presumed theological program underlying their organization. Ulti- mately, therefore, any revaluation of K6hler's suggested "Leo Bible" must depend on a complete investigation of all the evidence he presented.6 It is the purpose of this paper only to begin such a reconsideration by focusing on the first of the Touronian frontispieces, the Genises pages, and by studying in detail their sources and principles of construction. This is undertaken for two main reasons. First, as K6hler himself rightly argued, the Genesis frontispieces belong to an ex- tremely rich iconographic tradition, the Cotton Genesis recension, of which our knowledge has been enhanced con- siderably since the appearance of Die Schule von Tours.7 Second, it is our belief that by restricting his iconographic consideration to the Grandval and Vivian Bibles (Figs. 2 and 3), two manuscripts related in origin and style, K6hler omitted two other monuments necessary for a full under- standing of the sources and methods of construction of these pages, the contemporary Touronian Bible in Bamberg * The substance of this paper was presented in a seminar on the history of illustrations in medieval manuscripts conducted by Professor Kurt Weitzmann at Princeton University during the spring of I962 and was incorporated into my Ph.D. dissertation on the Touronian Bibles. Drs. Hugo Buchthal, Otto Demus, Ernst Kitzinger, Michael Taylor and the late Jean Porcher and Paul Underwood read and commented on my dissertation and I have profited from their discussions and criticisms. The article itself was written during the spring of 1970 while I was the Herodotus Fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, N.J. I wish to thank Dr. Carl Nordenfalk and Dr. Robert Deshman for reading the typescript and for offering many useful suggestions. To Professor Kurt Weitzmann I am especially grateful for guiding my work in all its stages and for contributing fundamentally to the content and method of this study. 1 The Syriac manuscript in Paris (Bibliotheque Nationale, Cod.

The similarity of the four frontispieces strikes one immedi- ately: they are alike in their basic layout of narrative illustrations of the life of Adam and Eve arranged along horizontal strips that divide the full page into three or four registers. But careful analysis reveals that these Genesis pages are independent of one another and, hence, that each provides evidence for reconstructing the model or models available at ninth-century Tours. The Individual Scenes A scene of the Creation of Adam begins the Genesis pages in all four Bibles. In the Grandval Bible (Fig. 2), the youthful Creator bends over the rigidly outstretched body of Adam rii AL. ,: VAN~i- 6 Forming of Adam, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco and grasps his head and shoulder. Two orant angels look on at the right. The Grandval composition, which is quite un- like the corresponding scenes in the other Bibles, finds a very close parallel in the Millstatt Genesis (Fig. 5)10 where, despite minor adjustments (the Creator places both hands on Adam's head and stands erect and the angel kneels in prayer), the basic action is repeated. K6hler identified the specific moment as the physical formingll indicated in the titulus and described in Gen. I I: 7, "Then the Lord God formed a man from the dust of the ground ... ," whereas Weitzmann suggested that the scene illustrates the enliven- ing of Adam12 recorded in the subsequent phrase of the Genesis text, ". . . and [he] breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." Little in the Grandval scene indicates the precise action. Adam is fully formed but lifeless, and the Creator, bending over him, touches his head and shoulder. The composition is unlike the representation of the Forming of Adam (Fig. 6) in the fullest extant copy of the Cotton Genesis, the mosaics in the atrium of San Marco in Venice, 8 K6hler treated the Bamberg Bible separately in his discussion of the "silhouette" pictures (Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, 10o2ff.). For K6hler's reasons for not considering the Bamberg and San Paolo Bibles in his iconographic investigation, cf., ibid., I, pt. 2, IIO0. 9 Several studies by H. Schade have appeared: "Hinweise zur friih- mittelalterlichen Ikonographie," Das Miinster, xI, 1958, 375ff.; "Studien zu der karolingischen Bilderbibel aus St. Paul vor den Mauern in Rom," WallrafRichartz Jahrbuch, xxI, 1959, 9ff-; XXII, 1960, 13ff. Most important is the unpublished dissertation by J. Gaehde. Gaehde's analysis of the Genesis page of the San Paolo Bible, I39ff., supports the hypothesis of Carl Nordenfalk ("Beitrage zur Geschichte der Touronischen Buch- malerei," Acta Archaeologica, vII, 1936, 281ff.) that a Touronian Bible similar to, but not identical with, the Vivian Bible served as the model for the San Paolo Bible. This hypothesis, which is borne out also by our investigations, permits us to treat the later manuscript, together with the earlier ones from Tours, in reconstructing the prototype. In this paper we have assumed that, iconographically, the San Paolo Bible is an accur- ate replica of the Touronian model, an assumption supported by the study of the other San Paolo frontispieces. 10 In 1947 Weitzmann introduced the Millstatt Genesis (Klagenfurt, Mus. Cod. vI, 19), a 12th-century poetic paraphrase of the Bible, into the discussion of the Cotton Genesis recension, suggesting that it was part of this family, and he made the first comparisons with the Touronian Bibles (Roll and Codex, 140ff.; see also, "Cotton Genesis Fragments," I23ff.) A few years later, apparently unaware of Weitzmann's work, H. Menhardt published an extensive study in which he attempted to show that the illustrations of the Millstatt Genesis derive from a Middle Byzantine Octateuch ("Die Bilder der Millstitter Genesis und ihre Verwandten," Beitriige zur iiltern Europiiischen Kulturgeschichte. Festschrift fiir Rudolf Egger, Klagenfurt, 1954, 248ff.); but his arguments have since been refuted by H. Voss (Studien zur illustrierten Millstatter Genesis, Munich, 1962). In rejecting Menhardt's conclusions, Voss gives additional support to Weitzmann's theory that the Millstatt Genesis, while showing certain other influences, is fundamentally a part of the Cotton Genesis recension, in fact, one of its fullest members. In his two articles on the Millstatt Genesis ("Zu den Bildern der altdeutschen Genesis," Zeitschrift fi r Deutsche Philologie, LXXV, 1956, 23ff., and LXXXIII, 1964, 99ff.) E.P. Pickering did not deal with the question of pictorial origins. R. B. Green also confirmed Weitzmann's hypothesis in her study of the Hortus Deliciarium ("Adam and Eve Cycle"). 11 K6hler, Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, I 19ff. 12 Weitzmann, Roll and Codex, I76f.; and idem, "Illustration der Septua- ginta," I I5ff. (Studies in Manuscript Illumination, 69ff.). In the new edition of Roll and Codex, 257, Weitzmann again takes up the question in response to the re-interpretation of H. Schade ("Das Paradies und die Imago Dei," Probleme der Kunstwissenschaft, II, 1966, 79ff.). Weitzmann's conclusion that the Creator is not lifting Adam up by the head finds support in the details of the Millstatt scene. In the Hortus Deliciarum, the forming and animation are depicted as vertical compositions (cf., Green, "Adam and Eve Cycle").</page><page sequence="5">GENESIS FRONTISPIECES 147 "':X Al'.:::.: 7 Animation of Adam, Millstatt Genesis. Klagenfurt, Mus. Cod. vI, 19, fol. 6r now: 8 Animation of Adam, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco where, however, the scene is sandwiched between the Crea- tion of the Animals (Gen. I: 24-25) and the Sanctification of the Seventh Day (Gen. 2: 3) and, therefore, must refer to the Creation of Man described in Gen. I: 26 and not to the passage in Gen. 2: 7. Because of the striking similarity between the Millstatt and Grandval compositions and the Enlivening of Man in antique depictions of the Prometheus legend,13 we may conclude with Weitzmann that the scene represents not the forming, but the moment when the Creator is about to breathe life into the newly created man, although the gesture of touching Adam's shoulder may de- rive from the scene of the Forming and may represent an attempt on the part of the Carolingian artist to conflate two scenes from his model into one composition. The depiction in the Vivian Bible is essentially different (Fig. 3). Adam stands upright facing the Creator who extends his right arm. Only the half-figure of the orant angel looking on from the right recalls the corresponding Grandval scene. Yet this image, too, has its parallel in the Millstatt Genesis (Fig. 7) where, however, the Creator grasps Adam's wrist and the orant angel is shown full length. By analogy with the mosaics of San Marco (Fig. 8) where the composition occurs in reverse and the Creator literally gives Adam a soul in the form of a classical Psyche, we may identify the Vivian and Millstatt scenes as the Animation of Adam described in Gen. 2: 7, "Thus man became a living creature." The existence in the Millstatt Genesis of two Creation scenes, one representing the En- livening and the other the Animation, indicates that both moments were available in a single model and that the artists of the two Touronian Bibles merely made different selections from this source. We need not conclude, as K6hler did, that the Vivian artist consulted a second model.14 That both phases were represented in the prototype is confirmed by the San Paolo Bible (Fig. 4) where the Crea- tion of Adam is depicted twice. First, Adam lies diagonally upon a hillock, his arms tightly pressed to his sides. The Creator bends over him from the right and holds his arm and shoulder. Probably to save space, the Creator has been moved to the right, but in its basic elements, this scene con- forms to the Enlivening (again perhaps infused with ele- ments of the Forming) in the Grandval and Millstatt manu- scripts. The second phase, though reversed, closely parallels the Vivian and Millstatt Animation scenes and is virtually identical to the Animation in San Marco, except that the Psyche is lacking. We may conclude, therefore, that each of these Carolingian Bibles presents a different selection from the same model in which the Enlivening and Animation of Adam were both represented and, on the basis of compari- sons with San Marco and the Millstatt Genesis, that this model was a member of the Cotton Genesis recension. Yet another composition depicting the Creation of Adam appears in the Bamberg Bible (Fig. I). Adam sits upright upon the earth and reaches out toward the Creator standing at the right. It is difficult to identify this scene precisely. It does not occur in the purest members of the Cotton Genesis recension although similar compositions are found in the frescoes of San Paolo fuori le mura,15 in an eleventh-century ivory plaque from southern Italy in Berlin,16 and in the mosaics of the Capella Palatina in Palermo. By analogy with these, we should identify the Bamberg scene as the Enliven- ing of Adam. Judging from the Grandval and San Paolo Bibles, however, the Enlivening was shown differently in the model available at Tours and, consequently, we must regard the Bamberg scene either as a borrowing from another source or as an innovation of the Bamberg artist. The gener- al similarity with the other Carolingian Bibles, including the presence of the anthropomorphic Creator, supports the 13 Weitzmann, Roll and Codex, I76ff. 14 K6hler, Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, I I9ff. K6hler recognized that the duplication of angels in the Grandval Bible bespeaks the existence of two Creation scenes in the model but he dismissed this as being contra- dictory to the other evidence. 15 The relationship between the destroyed San Paolo frescoes and the Cotton Genesis recension is yet to be worked out in detail. For the copies of the frescoes see: S. Waetzoldt, Die Kopien des 17. Jahrhunderts nach Mosaiken und Wandmalereien in Rom, Vienna, 1964, 56ff. 16 Kessler, "Eleventh Century Ivory Plaque," 98f.</page><page sequence="6">148 THE ART BULLETIN 9 Drawing Adam's Rib and Shaping Eve, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco latter hypothesis. Most likely the Bamberg artist 'con- flated the two scenes of Enlivening and Animation and thereby created a new composition intermediate between the two. Following Gen. 2: 21 I, "And so the Lord God put the man into a trance, and while he slept, he took one of his ribs and closed the flesh over the place," the Creation of Eve is depicted similarly in all four manuscripts. The Creator bends over Adam who lies asleep upon the ground and draws a rib from his side. In the Grandval and Vivian Bibles the action moves from left to right while in the Bam- berg and San Paolo manuscripts, it goes from right to left - but this is an insignificant variation. That the Creator draws only a rib and not the fully formed Eve from Adam's side displays a literal adherence to the Bible text which is characteristic of the Cotton Genesis recension and which distinguishes these manuscripts from the majority of later medieval representations. San Marco (Fig. 9) and the Millstatt Genesis (Fig. o) parallel the Carolingian compositions so closely - the resemblance with the San Paolo Bible being particularly striking - that we cannot doubt that all derive from the same archetype. Even the direction of the original composition and the curious position of Adam's right arm in the Grandval Bible, bent and brought up to his face, may now be explained. As in the San Paolo Bible, San Marco, and the Millstatt Genesis, this model must have showed Adam lying in the antique sleeping position, his head, to the left, resting on his right arm.17 This is important, for it shows that in certain details, at least, the San Paolo Bible is a more precise reflection of the prototype than are the earlier manuscripts. For the Creation of Eve, as for the Creation of Adam, the San Paolo Bible (Fig. 4) has two illustrations. The second shows Eve lying diagonally on a small hill and the Creator bending over and holding her shoulder. A parallel to the representation above of the Creation of Adam, this scene illustrates the Shaping of Eve described in Gen. 2: 22, "The Lord God then built up the rib, which he had taken out of the man, into a woman." Although influenced by the Adam Io Drawing Adam's Rib, Millstatt Genesis. Klagenfurt, Mus. Cod. vi, 19, fol. gv scene, the artist of the San Paolo Bible certainly based h illustration on a model of the Cotton Genesis recensio where, as in San Marco (Fig. 9), the Shaping of Eve was separate scene showing the Creator confronting Eve an forming her shoulder. The introduction of Eve to Adam and her naming de: cribed in Gen. 2: 22-23, "He brought her to man, and th man said: 'Now this, at last - bone of my bones, flesh froi my flesh - this shall be called woman, for from man was th taken,' " is presented in virtually identical compositions i the four manuscripts. The Creator stands behind Eve, h right hand on her shoulder, and Adam approaches her froi the right, raising his arm in the gesture of naming. TI composition derives from the Cotton Genesis recension. N( only can a precise parallel to it be found in San Marc (Fig. I I), but the scene can still be distinguished among tl charred fragments of the Cotton Genesis (Fig. 12).18 In th case, the Vivian Bible (Fig. 3) is closest to the archetype. Interpretation of the scenes of Temptation and Fall complicated by the fact that three distinct versions appe, in the four manuscripts. In the Grandval Bible (Fig. 2), tt Picking of the Fruit is a separate phase showing Eve stane ing before a fig tree and reaching for the fruit held in tk mouth of a serpent. Immediately following this, Eve repeated. She is depicted eating the fruit while simultai eously offering a piece of it to Adam who is also show eating the forbidden food. Formally, the Grandval repr&lt; sentation is nearly identical to the Picking and Eating ( the Fruit in San Marco (Fig. 13) and, therefore, must t quite faithful to the model, although the serpent, entwine about the tree trunck in the Grandval illustration, appea: only in the San Marco Temptation scene (Fig. 14). Wheret the model available at Tours may already have conflate the first two moments, the Cotton Genesis archety: 17 Schade ("Hinweise," 375ff.) sought to explain Adam's open eyes in the San Paolo Bible as a reflection of an Augustinian interpretation. Judging from the three other Carolingian Bibles and from San Marco and the Millstatt Genesis, Adam's eyes were not open in the archetype. It seems to us that this is a stylistic rather than a theological element because even in the San Paolo Creation of Adam, Adam's eyes are ope: Gaehde's suggestion ("Carolingian Bible Manuscripts," 154f) that tl San Paolo master used a non-Touronian model is refuted by the Granw val Bible and the other evidence of the Cotton Genesis recension. 18 Weitzmann, "Cotton Genesis Fragments," I23ff-</page><page sequence="7">GENESIS FRONTISPIECES I49 xi Introduction of Eve, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco certainly depicted separately the three phases of Temptation Picking, and Eating of the Fruit reported in Gen. 3:1-6: The serpent was more crafty than any wild creature that the Lord God had made. He said to the woman, "Is it true that God has forbidden you to eat from any tree in the garden?" The woman answered the serpent, "We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden, except for the tree in the middle of the garden; God has forbidden us either to eat or to touch the fruit of that; if we do, we shall die." The serpent said, "Of course you will not die. God knows that as soon as you eat it, your eyes will be opened and you will be like gods knowing both good and evil." When the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good to eat, and that it was pleasing to the eye and tempting to contemplate, she took some and ate it. She also gave her husband some and he ate it. In the Bamberg and Vivian Bibles (Figs. I and 3), the distinct phases of Temptation, Picking, and the Fall have been conflated into a single scene. As in the Grandval Bible, Eve first is shown taking the fruit from the mouth of the serpent coiled around a fig tree. She is not repeated, how- ever, in the scene of the Fall. Instead, her left arm is awkwardly extended back toward Adam who, in the Vivian Bible, much as in the Grandval depiction, is already eating. We need not assume, as K6hler did, that the artists con- sulted another source for the Paris (and Bamberg) composi- tions.19 Such conflations are natural and frequent, and the close correspondence of trees, serpents, and figures in all three manuscripts assures their derivation from the same model. More difficult to analyze is the scene in the San Paolo Bible (Fig. 4). Adam stands to the left of the tree, eating the fruit which he holds in his right hand and covering his nudity with a large leaf held in his left. Eve stands to the right of the tree, around which the serpent is coiled; she extends a piece of fruit to Adam and, having already eaten of it herself, she is aware of her nudity and covers herself with a leaf. Poorly integrated into the scene, the Creator approaches behind Eve, calling to the sinful couple with an outstretched arm. Gaehde is certainly correct in stating that I2 Introduction of Eve, Cotton Genesis. London, British Museum, Cod. Cotton Otho B. vi the image stands for "the deceit of the serpent, the eating of the forbidden fruit, the hiding of nakedness, and the re- proach of the Lord,"20 events described in Gen. 3: 1-6 (see above) and Gen. 3: 7-8: "Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they discovered that they were naked; so they stitched fig-leaves together and made themselves loin- cloths. The man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze and hid from the Lord God among the trees of the garden. But the Lord God called to the man and said to him, 'Where are you ?' " Thus, the San Paolo scene is an example of extreme con- flation in which four scenes are combined into one. Is it necessary to assume, however, as Gaehde does, that the artist consulted a different model for this highly condensed composition? To be sure, when structuring his scene, the San Paolo master may well have been influenced by sym- metrical compositions of the Fall such as those found on Early Christian sarcophagi and in the catacombs, but the individual elements all appear within the Cotton Genesis recension, and similar conflations even occur in certain of 19 K6hler, Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, I22ff. 20 Gaehde, "Carolingian Bible Manuscript," I46f.</page><page sequence="8">150 THE ART BULLETIN its members.21 Eve may have been adapted from the Temptation figure as in San Marco (Fig. i4) while the complicated pose of Adam as well as that of the Creator finds an adequate parallel in the San Marco Calling (Fig. 15). Confirmation that the artist is working from the same basic model comes also from the Vivian Bible (Fig. 3) where the Striding Creator appears in the scene of the Calling. Thus, the complex scene in the San Paolo Bible may be regarded as a free adaptation of the scenes of Temptation and Calling in the Cotton Genesis recension model. Two types of Expulsion scene occur in the four manu- scripts. In the Bamberg and Grandval Bibles (Figs. I and 2), an angel - resting one hand on Adam's shoulder - escorts the couple from Eden, while Adam and Eve, clothed in short tunics, gaze longingly back toward the lost paradise. In the Vivian and San Paolo Bibles (Figs. 3 and 4) Adam and Eve look forward and Eve mournfully leans her cheek on her left hand. In the Vivian scene the couple wear mantles; in the San Paolo Bible they are nude but for their fig leaves, and in the latter, a vigorous, wingless, sword- brandishing man replaces the gentle angel. Should we con- clude that these two compositions derive from different models ? Both the Octateuchs22 and the Vienna Genesis23 depict the Expulsion twice, in accordance with Gen. 3: 24-25, before the gates and again outside Eden: "So the Lord God drove him out of the garden to till the ground from which he was taken. He cast him out and to the east of the garden of Eden he stationed the cherubim and a sword whirling and flashing to guard the way of the tree of life." Some evidence exists that the Cotton Genesis recension also had a double Expulsion. The Vivian-San Paolo scene has a close parallel in the Salerno Antependium (Fig. 16)24 and similarities exist with the Millstatt compositions of Calling and Expul- sion (Figs. 17 and 18). The Bamberg-Grandval scene, on the other hand, resembles the San Marco Expulsion (Fig. 19) in details of costume, the backward glance of Eve, and the out- stretched arms; although in the figure of the Expeller, which in San Marco is Christ himself, the Carolingian manu- scripts represent an essential variation. It is possible, there- fore, that as in other Genesis manuscripts, the Cotton Gene- sis archetype also had two Expulsion scenes of which the artists selected one or the other. Another possibility is that the Vivian and San Paolo illustrators adapted the Cotton Genesis recension scene of Calling to serve as the Expulsion (Figs. 15 and I7). This is indicated by the nudity of Adam and Eve which has a clear parallel in the Millstatt Genesis depiction. Thus, while we cannot be absolutely positive that both Carolingian Expulsion compositions derive from the same prototype, the general homogeneity of the depictions and similarities with the Cotton Genesis recension indicate that they derive from a single model. One variation can be explained more definitively. The wingless, sword-wielding Expeller in the San Paolo Bible (Fig. 4), so different from the angels in the other three manuscripts and identified in the titulus as "flammeus et gladius," actually represents a borrowing from a different scene in the model. He is the "sword whirling and flashing" shown separately in the Millstatt Genesis (Fig. 20). There he is less dramatic but, as in the San Paolo Bible, he is a nimble youthful figure who clutches his garment with one hand while swinging the sword with the other. This may also account for the substitution of the sword for a scepter in the Bamberg Bible. "As punishment for their sins, the Lord imposed labor on Adam and Eve, And to the woman he said 'I will increase your Labor and your groaning, and in labor you shall bear children. You shall be eager for your husband, and he shall be your master.' And to the man he said, '... With labor you shall win your food from the ground all the days of your life' " (Gen. 3: 16-17)- In all four manuscripts, Adam is shown bending over a mattock tilling the soil while Eve sits nursing a child.25 Although his clothing, like Eve's, varies according to that worn in the Expulsion, Adam is virtually the same in all four depictions. Slight, insignificant differ- ences appear in the figure of Eve. In the Grandval and San Paolo Bibles (Figs. 2 and 4) she nurses the child; in the Vivian Bible (Fig. 3) the child sits upright in her lap and Eve gestures toward Adam. And in the Bamberg Bible (Fig. i), Adam and Eve are placed at opposite corners of the page; Eve is enthroned and shown in profile with the child on her lap. The four scenes are clearly variations on the same model which must have included the garlanded booth or bower found in the Grandval and San Paolo Bibles, of which a vestige also occurs in the Vivian Bible. Adam tilling the soil with a mattock is a common medi- eval motif which occurs frequently in the Cotton Genesis recension. San Marco (Fig. 19) compares well with the Carolingian representations, as do the scenes on the Salerno Antependium and in the Hortus Deliciarum. On the other hand, Eve nursing her child is very rare and is not found in the major monuments of the Cotton Genesis recension which show Eve in a variety of occupations. Formally analogous to the Carolingian representations is the Eve in San Marco who sits enthroned with distaff and spindle, Mariological symbols that probably are a later alteration of the recension.26 Closest is the fresco formerly in San Paolo fuori le mura,27 which, however, must be used cautiously in 21 Cf., Green, "Adam and Eve Cycle," 334ff. and Kessler, "Eleventh Century Ivory Plaque," 89f. Very close parallels also occur in manu- scripts of the Christian Topography of Cosmas Indicopleustes, but these have been shown to be late additions to that recension, cf., D. Mouriki- Charalambous, "The Octateuch Miniatures of the Byzantine Manu- scripts of Cosmas Indicopleustes," unpublished Ph.D. diss., Princeton University, 1970, 19ff. 22 D. C.

Venice, San Marco 14 Temptation, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco any consideration of the Cotton Genesis family. In the Ash- burnham Pentateuch (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, Cod. Nouv. Acq. lat. 2334, fol. 6r), Eve is shown in a bower nursing her child in the sequence of scenes tracing the his- tory of Cain and Abel.28 Because there is evidence that the Ashburnham Pentateuch was already in Tours during the ninth century, it is tempting to see its direct influence in the Touronian Bibles. This, however, is unlikely. First, we would have to assume that, independently, four artists con- sulted the same new model for the single motif of Eve nurs- ing her child. Second, the Ashburnham and Touronian scenes are distinctly different. In the former, Eve sits on a bench within a shelter consisting of a flat roof supported on four poles, while in the latter, she is seated on the ground under a bower made of a garland draped in the trees or suspended from two poles. Thus the model constructed from the Carolingian copies does not conform to the Ashburnham Pentateuch. Third, as we shall note below, the motif of Eve in a bower has a specific textual basis which also explains other details in the Carolingian depictions. It is our conclu- sion, therefore, that this element was found already in the same model used for the other Genesis scenes in the Touron- ian Bibles, even though we cannot demonstrate with parallel examples that Eve appeared in the Cotton Genesis recension nursing her child in the scene of Labor after the Expulsion.29 Such an image would be proleptic, for the actual concep- tion and birth of Cain and Abel is recorded only in Gen. 4 and it would be understandable if later copyists replaced it with a depiction more consistent with the flow of narrative. All phases of the narrative are not depicted in all four of the Bibles. For instance, one episode, the reproval of Adam and Eve, is illustrated in the three Touronian manuscripts but is lacking in the San Paolo Bible. The Grandval scene shows the Creator standing beside the tree of wisdom censuring Adam and Eve who hide their nudity with fig leaves. Adam denies his guilt by pointing to Eve who, in turn, seeks to transfer blame to the serpent. Essentially the same, though more animated, is the Bamberg composition, and certainly both representations illustrate the Denial of Blame described in Gen. 3: 12-14: "The man said, 'The woman you gave me for a companion, she gave me fruit from the tree and I ate it.' Then the Lord God said to the woman, 'What is this that you have done?' The woman said, 'The serpent tricked me and I ate.' " Similarities with San Marco (Fig. 21) confirm the presence of this composition in the Cotton Genesis recension model. In the mosaic the Creator is enthroned (a characteristic alteration of the archetype), but the gestures of Adam and Eve closely parallel the Carolingian depictions. In the Vivian Bible, the scene of reproval is distinctly different (Fig. 3). Adam and Eve huddle together and hide their nudity with their hands. The Creator, his right arm raised in a gesture of calling, strides in from the right. The crouching couple has an exact parallel in the Bamberg Bible where even the hand of Eve raised to her face is repeated. Clearly, then, this scene appeared in the model, but, to judge from the Bamberg Bible, it refers not to the Denial of Blame but to the Hiding reported in Gen. 3: 8, "The man and his wife heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden at the time of the evening breeze and hid from the Lord God among the trees of the Garden." K6hler attempted to derive the Vivian composition from the Vienna Genesis recen- sion;30 some similarities do exist, but these are only of a superficial nature. The figure types, the degree of over- lapping, and even the gestures differ. The Making of Loin- cloths (Gen. 3: 7) is depicted in San Marco, but the Hiding survives in no major member of the Cotton Genesis recen- sion; its significance in the narrative makes it highly prob- able, however, that this scene, too, was found in the densely illustrated archetype.31 28 Cf., 0. von Gebhardt, The Miniatures of the Ashburnham Pentateuch, London, 1883, pl. 3.

Narkiss, "To- wards a Further Study of the Ashburnham Pentateuch (Pentateuque de Tours)," Cahiers Archeologiques, xix, 1969, 45ff. 29 A similar scene appears on the bronze door at Hildesheim which certainly depends on a lost Touronian Bible. Cf., H. von Einem, "Zur Hildesheimer Bronzettir," Jahrbuch der Preuszischen Kunstsammlungen, LIX, 1938, 3ff.; and R.

I am grateful to Professor Weitzmann for permitting me to consult his unpublished notes and reconstruction of the Cotton manuscript.</page><page sequence="10">152 THE ART BULLETIN The Creator in the Vivian Bible who, as we noted above, appears awkwardly conflated with the Temptation and Fall in the San Paolo manuscript, is a borrowing from the Cotton Genesis recension Calling (cf., Figs. 15 and 17) and is another witness to the illustration of Gen. 3: 9 in the Tours prototype. Thus, the reproval scenes in the Carolingian Bibles derive from three distinct representations in the model: the Hiding (Gen. 3: 8) as illustrated in the Bamberg and Vivian Bibles, the Calling (Gen. 3: 9) conflated with other scenes in the Vivian and San Paolo Bibles and perhaps the basis as well for the Expulsions in these two manuscripts, and the Denial of Blame (Gen. 3: 10-13), depicted in the Bamberg and Grandval Bibles. Four other scenes, two unique to the Bamberg Bible and two which appear only in the Grandval Bible, are found in the Carolingian manuscripts. The Naming of the Animals is represented only in the Bamberg Bible (Fig. i). Adam stands at the left, his arm extended towards a herd of ani- mals arranged in a pyramidal group. To the right stands the Creator pointing towards the animals, of which several, a deer, camel, elephant, lion, duck, pig, and serpent, are identifiable. The scene illustrates Gen. 2: 19-20, "He brought the animals to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that was its name. Thus the man gave names to all cattle, to the birds of heaven, and to every wild animal." The corres- ponding scene in San Marco (Fig. 22) shows the Creator enthroned (again an alteration of the archetype) and before him Adam with his hand on a lion's head. The Millstatt Genesis provides an even closer parallel (Fig. 23). Adam stands at the left before an abbreviated group of animals which he names while the Creator at the right raises his arm towards them. Even though the Bamberg Naming of Ani- mals is unique among the Carolingian Bibles, we can be certain that it derives from the Cotton Genesis recension and, therefore, that it was found in the same model as the other scenes. God's admonition to Adam and Eve concerning the tree of wisdom described in Gen. 2: 16, "He told the man, 'You may eat from every tree in the garden of Eden, but not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil; for on the day you eat from it, you will certainly die,' " appears only in the Grandval Bible (Fig. 2). With an extended arm, the Creator points out the tree to Adam and Eve who stand respectfully on the other side of it. Eve's presence at the Admonition is anachronistic since her creation is described only subse- quently in Gen. 2: 22-23. Perhaps because of this, the Admonition was omitted in the majority of Cotton Genesis monuments. It was retained in the Hortus Deliciarum (Fig. 24) where the composition corresponds in its basic elements to the Grandval scene.32 Adam and Eve stand side by side before the Creator (now grasping Adam's wrist) who warns them not to eat of the tree (now placed behind them). There is no reason to suppose, therefore, that the Grandval artist consulted a model other than the member of the Cot- ton Genesis recension used for the other scenes. Another depiction, the Burial of Abel in the Bamberg Bible, has no parallel in the extant members of the Cotton Genesis recension and, in fact, has no basis in the Bible text, which describes Abel's murder (Gen. 4: 8) but not his inter- ment. We cannot be certain that this episode, too, derives from the Cotton Genesis recension, but evidence to support such a conclusion exists, as we shall note below.33 The hands of God which issue from clouds in the lower narrative strip of the Bamberg page are difficult to explain. Similar hands appear throughout the Cotton Genesis recension following man's Expulsion from Eden; and it is possible that the Bamberg artist borrowed the motif from a scene such as the Sacrifice of Cain and Abel or the Reproval of Cain and used it to fill the corners of his composition. Beneath the right tip of the garland which forms Eve's bower in the Grandval Bible is a tiny scene hardly visible in ordinary photographs.34 Within a lightened square, two sketchy figures are delineated in brown and gold (Fig. 25). One stands at the left, his right arm extended toward the other who seems to be falling back upon his knee, throwing his left arm up for balance. These two figures, which are authentic elements of the ninth-century painting, may be no more than idle scribbles, but their composition suggests that they form a real scene. Although we cannot be certain, similarities do exist with the Slaughter of Abel in the Cotton Genesis recension (Fig. 26), perhaps permitting us to identify yet one more episode copied from this model in the Carolingian Bibles. The Model of the Genesis Frontispieces Our detailed analysis of the individual scenes in the Caro- lingian Genesis frontispieces reveals that behind these pages lies a consistent and extensively illustrated Genesis manu- script, of which sixteen or more episodes - beginning with the creation of Adam and terminating with Abel's death - may still be reconstructed: Enlivening of Adam (perhaps conflated with Forming, Gen. 2: 7); Animation of Adam (Gen, 2: 7); Admonition (Gen. 2: 16-17); Naming of Animals (Gen. 2: 19); Drawing Adam's Rib (Gen. 2: 21); Shaping Eve (Gen. 2: 22); Introduction of Eve to Adam (Gen. 2: 22-23); Temptation (?) (Gen. 3: 1-5) Picking the Fruit (Gen. 3: 6); Fall (Gen. 3: 6); Hiding (Gen. 3: 8); Calling (Gen. 3: 9); Denial of Blame (Gen. 3: 10-I3); Expulsion (Gen. 3: 23); Casting Out(?) (Gen. 3: 24); Whirling Sword (Gen. 3: 24); Labor (Gen. 3: 16-19); Slaughter of Abel(?) (Gen. 4: 4-8); Burial of Abel. Of the sixteen scenes that surely were in the model, fourteen have precise parallels in the Cotton Genesis recension, while the other two, the Hiding and the Burial of Abel, are lacking in 32 Green ("Adam and Eve Cycle," 344) convincingly associated the Adam and Eve cycle of the Hortus Deliciarum with the Cotton Genesis recension. 33 A similar scene appears in the 8th-century Genesis cycle in Santa Maria Antiqua (cf., W. de Griineisen, Sainte Marie Antique, Rome, 191 I, pl. xxi-A and J. Wilpert, Die rdmischen Mosaiken und Malereien, Freiburg im Breisgau, 1916, I, pt. 2, 7o3ff.). The iconography of this cycle, which certainly is connected with the Cotton Genesis recension, is yet to be studied in detail. 34 H.

Venice, San Marco the extant members of the Cotton Genesis family but may well have been in the archetype. Indeed, there can be no doubt that not only the Grandval Bible, as K6hler first showed, but each of the other ninth-century Bibles derives independently from a model of the Cotton Genesis recen- sion.35 It is difficult to imagine the sixteen or more scenes that may be reconstructed for this model arranged on horizontal strips on a single page as in the Carolingian manuscripts; and several factors other than mere space requirements indicate that the individual scenes occurred separately in the prototype, presumably within the body of text. There is little consistency of arrangement among the ninth-century Genesis pages, which differ even in the number of horizontal registers; and although the four frontispieces begin with the Creation of Adam and - with the exception of the Bamberg Bible - end with the Labor after the Expulsion, the selection of episodes and of specific narrative phases varies greatly. Agreement between the individual registers on the four pages and distinct patterns of scene linkage, which we would expect if the model were an analogous frontispiece, are lacking. A Genesis manuscript with individual illustrations inter- spersed throughout its text is the type of model most con- sistent with all the evidence. Two principal members of the recension, the Cotton manuscript itself and the Millstatt Genesis, have this layout; and some sense of the separate scenes is still preserved by the neat columns of the Grandval page. From this model, we believe, the Carolingian artists selected scenes to construct their frontispieces - at times choosing the same episode, at other times illustrating a somewhat different phase of the story, and frequently con- flating several narrative moments into one scene. By omitting the Bamberg and San Paolo Bibles from his iconographic investigation, K6hler also excluded valuable controls on the reliability of features, vis-a-vis the model, in the Grandval and Vivian Bibles, consistently favoring the former over the latter. On the basis of the Bamberg and San Paolo manuscripts, we may now conclude that such scenes as the Enlivenment and the Hiding in the Vivian Bible, which posed troublesome problems to K6hler,36 were avail- able in the model. Even more important for revising K6hler's theory, however, is our new understanding of the Cotton Genesis recension, particularly through the Millstatt paraphrase. Because of the expansion and clarification of this recension, we can determine more precisely the relationship of the Carolingian illustrations to this family of monuments and, thus, to their model. For example, the problem of deciding which Creation of Adam scene derives from the model may now be resolved: as in the Millstatt Genesis, both the Enlivening and the Animation were illustrated in the prototype. In this way, too, we have been able to show that the Grandval Bible is not always the most accurate reflection of the model. Each manuscript reproduces certain elements of the prototype more faithfully than do the others. In arguing that the four Carolingian Genesis pages derive from a single manuscript prototype of the Cotton Genesis recension, we must also be aware of differences that exist and we must seek to define, as accurately as possible, the relationship of the ninth-century manuscripts to other members of the recension. Clearly it is not within the scope of this paper to establish the stemma of the Cotton Genesis recension. That must await an exhaustive study of all the material. However, several observations may be made on the basis of the Carolingian examples. First, the Genesis manuscript available in Tours was not one of the extant members of the Cotton Genesis recension nor was it directly related to any of these monuments. It lacked the Christological features such as the cross-nimbus and cross-scepter which identify the Creator of the Cotton Genesis as Christ,38 and it did not have such characteristic elements of the Millstatt-Hortus Deliciarum branch of the recension as the bearded Creator or the partially-formed Eve emerging from Adam's side.39 Significant affinities with Italian Genesis cycles such as the San Paolo fuori le mura frescoes and the Salerno Antependium exist, but the exact relationship of these to the ninth-century Bibles is impossible to determine at present. For the moment, we must conclude that the model of the Carolingian Bibles was an independent reflection of the Cotton Genesis archetype. As now reconstructed, the model of the Carolingian Bibles conforms closely to the Cotton Genesis archetype re- established by Weitzmann40 - namely, a Genesis text densely and literally illustrated with column pictures. The adherence to the Genesis narrative was close, almost every distinct event being represented with an illustration; but certain iconographic elements in our miniatures do not find explanation in the biblical text and hence deserve special consideration. These are: (I) an angel in prayer at the 35 Throughout this paper, we assume an intermediate Touronian model for the San Paolo Bible. 36 K6hler, Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, 119ff. 37 See notes 7-10 above. 38 Weitzmann, "Cotton Genesis Fragments," i23. 39 The possibility that the model of the Carolingian Bibles and the Millstatt-Hortus model were more closely related than is immediately apparent should not be excluded. 40 Weitzmann, "Cotton Genesis Fragments," 12ff.</page><page sequence="13">GENESIS FRONTISPIECES 155 22 Naming of Animals, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco Creation of Adam;41 (2) Eve anachronistically present at the Admonition; (3) the tree of knowledge represented as a fig tree; (4) the tempter as a combed and bearded serpent; (5) an angel rather than the Lord God as the Expeller; (6) Eve sitting in a booth after the Expulsion; and (7) the Burial of Cain. All members of the Cotton Genesis recension depict the tempter as a serpent entwined around the tree, but in the Grandval and Vivian Bibles (Fig. 27) - and hence presum- ably in the prototype as well - the serpent has a spotted back, dark underside, and bears a vermilion comb. In the Vivian Bible, he also has teeth. The peculiar features of this animal conform to those of a mythical python-like beast described in classical writings and named 8p6Kov.42 In the section on poisonous snakes in Nicander's Theriaca,43 for instance, we read of this dragon, "radiant indeed does he appear, but in his jaw above and below are arrayed rows of teeth; gleaming eyes are below his brows, and lower down beneath his chin there is ever a beard of yellow stain," and in the De venenatis animalibus of Philumenus, the dragon is described as having projections above his eyes as well as a beard.44 From representations of the dragon in such manu- scripts as the Morgan Library Dioscurides (Cod. 652, ..... i.i.. .i..i iii..i..... ....... :" ::: ii:i:i ::i~:::i::::::i:i::i:: :::::::::::::::: I id.i l-i- . It 23 Naming of Animals, Millstatt Genesis. Klagenfurt, Mus. Cod. vI, 19, fol. 9r fol. 352r),45 we may be certain that the Grandval and Vivian serpent is the classical paKKwv. What inspired the artist of the prototype to depict Satan in the form of a dragon is the association of this beast in classical literature and art with the serpent that guarded the tree of the Hesperides in the famous Hercules legend. It is mentioned by Pherekydes and Euripides46 and is depicted in numerous works of art, including an antique pelike in Turin (Fig. 28).47 The dragon entwined about a tree in the Her- cules scene provided a perfect model for the illustrator of Genesis48 in the same way that Prometheus scenes were used for the Creation sequence.49 The source for the other extra-biblical elements may now be identified as the Vita Adae et Evae, wrongly called in its Greek version the Apocalypsis Mosis, a translation of a first- century original in Hebrew or Aramaic.50 Passages from the Vita fully explain these extra-biblical details of the minia- tures: "When God blew into thee [Adam] the breath of life and thy face and likeness was made in the image of God, Michael also brought thee and made [the angels] worship thee in the sight of God . . ." (Vita, xIII, 2).51 "When God made us, me and your mother, and placed us in 41 The watching angels in the Grandval and Vivian Bibles and in the Millstatt Genesis are not to be confused with the personifications of the days that appear in scenes from the first chapter of Genesis in the Cotton Genesis (cf., Marie-Th'rbse D'Alverny, "Les anges et les jours," Cahiers Archeologiques, Ix, 1957, 271ff.; T. Klauser, "Engel in der Kunst," Reallexikon fir Antike und Christentum, v, col. 314). Judging from the Mill- statt Genesis, we may conclude, as K6hler did, that the single angel of the Vivian Bible is a more accurate replication of the model. Pickering's identification of this angel as the Holy Spirit is not based on a study of the history of the pictorial recension and is unconvincing ("Genesis," LXXXIII, I07). 42 Cf., Pauly-Wissowa, Realencyclopiidie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, V2, I64f., and second series, II, 50o8f. 43 Nicander of Colophon, The Poems and Poetical Fragments, ed.

Mos., XLVII, 3).55 Identification of the Vita Adae et Evae as the source, or at least the tradition, for the extra-biblical elements of the Carolingian Genesis pages leads us into the complex ques- tion of the ultimate nature of the archetype and, in turn, into the difficult problem of the origin of Old Testament illustration. It may be determined at the start that the legendary elements were features not just of the model of the Caroling- ian frontispieces but also of the Cotton Genesis archetype itself.56 The fig tree is common to all members of the recen- sion and the angel-expeller occurs in the Italian branch of the family (cf., Fig. 15) as well as in the North. Just as significant is the fact that the major scene of Admonition is missing in all Cotton Genesis monuments except the Grand- val Bible and the Hortus Deliciarum, a deletion probably resulting from Eve's anachronistic presence in the arche- typal cycle. Most telling, however, is the prayerful, watching angel who appears in the Touronian Bibles and in the Mill- statt Genesis, and who therefore must have occurred in the common model.57 If the archetype of the Cotton Genesis recension was rich in extra-biblical elements, why, then, are its most extensive witnesses, the Cotton manuscript and the San Marco mo- saics, relatively free of them ? Weitzmann has already shown that the thirteenth-century mosaicists Christianized the Early Christian manuscript model.58 In turn, the Carolingian frontispieces suggest that the Cotton Genesis already reflects a Christianization of the archetype. Thus, for example, the cross-nimbus and cross-scepter of the Cotton manuscript did not distinguish the Creator in the model available at Tours and, judging from the considerable variation within the recension, they were not features of the archetype. It is our suggestion that the Cotton Genesis represents an extensive revision of the archetype which involved the deletion of many extra-biblical details. If so (and verification of this hypothesis requires a full study of the Cotton Genesis), the Carolingian Genesis pages gain in importance as independ- ent witnesses of a purer state of the recension. Scholarship of the past two decades has uncovered the extensive penetration of legendary elements into Old Testa- 52 The presence of Eve at the forbidding is also described by Flavius Josephus, Antiquitates Judaicae, I, 40. 53 For a detailed discussion of the fig tree in Genesis iconography, includ- ing references to other literary sources, cf., O. Goetz, Der Feigenbaum, Berlin, 1965, 18ff. 54 The similar bower in the Ashburnham Pentateuch has been associated with the Vita Adae et Evae by H.-L.

The Bible implies that Cain buried Abel when it reports that the "brother's blood that has been shed is crying out to me from the ground," but only the Vita Adae et Evae fully accounts for the unusual scene in the Bamberg Bible. 56 Weitzmann has discovered the penetration of legend elsewhere in the Cotton Genesis illustrations ("Zur Frage," 4o9f.; Studies in Manuscript Illumination, 88ff.). 57 The angel also appears on the Hildesheim door - further indication of the Touronian origin of these sculptures. 58 K.

Two basic positions have been argued: (I) that the transmission of Jewish exegesis and apocrypha to Christi- anity was fundamentally a literary phenomenon and hence that the presence of so-called Jewish legendary elements in Christian works does not necessarily imply underlying Jewish pictorial models,59 and (2) that exegetic and legend- ary motifs in Christian Old Testament illustrations reflect Jewish pictorial prototypes - Bibles and perhaps even illus- trated apocrypha and paraphrases.60 To this continuing discussion of the Jewish contribution to Christian art may now be added the evidence of the Carolingian Bibles. Not all elements from legend or exegesis are equally useful in defining the nature of the archetype. The fig tree, for example, results from the artist's need to render a specific plant in his pictorialization of the Bible text which does not indicate the species of the tree of knowledge. To clarify this detail, the artist referred to legend, and whether he knew a pictorial model or merely the literary tradition cannot be determined with certainty. Disruption of the Genesis narrative by the Admonition scene and anecdotal expansion of the Bible account by the Burial of Abel are more difficult to explain. For these elements, we would naturally think of an illustrated paraphrase or apocryphon, for it seems unlikely that an artist would have digressed to include still other narrative material in his already dense biblical cycle. However, the whole sequence does not really conform to the Vita Adae et Evae but, in general, follows the Genesis narrative so faithfully that there can be little doubt that the Adam and Eve cycle originated in a Bible and was supplemented with details drawn from legend. Because the ideas in the Vita Adae et Evae were common property of Jews and Christians, we cannot use them to determine the origin of the pictorial archetype.61 Motifs that derive from exegesis are more informative than legendary elements because they communicate a pre- cise theological interpretation which should be traceable to its specific source. The anthropomorphic Creator - in the Carolingian Bibles, a beardless young man with long dark hair parted in the middle, wearing a tunic and long mantle, with a simple gold nimbus and carrying a book roll62 - is one such element and indicates a Christian rather than a Jewish prototype for this cycle. A priori it seems extremely unlikely that Jews ever went so far as to depict God anthro- pomorphically. No parallel example exists; instead, Jewish art avoided representing God by using the symbol of a hand issuing from heaven.63 Even Philo, whose doctrine of the Creator Logos became the basis of the Christian formula- tion,64 did not conceive of the Logos as a corporeal being. He states this clearly in his Questions on Exodus, "But the divine Logos, which is established over all things, is im- material, being, as it were, not impressed upon them but expressed, for it is external to all substances and to all cor- poreal and incorporeal elements" (II, 122).65 Incarnation distinguishes the Christian from the Jewish conception of the Logos. Attempting to merge the incarnate Logos of St. John with the Creator-Logos of Philonic philosophy, Christian apologists espoused his corporeality and identified him with Christ.65 Thus, it would seem that even without the cross-nimbus, the Creator depicted in the model of the ninth-century Bibles was intended to be the Christ-Logos, as he is specifically identified in the Cotton Genesis and in the tituli of the Grandval and Vivian Bibles. The Christian origin of the prototype cannot be doubted.66 That the archetype of the Cotton Genesis also was Christian is less certain. It is quite possible, even likely, that the Christ-Logos was inserted into a Jewish cycle at a later stage. He appears only during the Creation and is replaced by a hand after the Expulsion from Eden. Until a full study of the Cotton Genesis recension is completed and all the "Jewish" elements are considered, any decision about the ultimate origin of the archetype is premature.67 The same problem faces investigators of the Ashburnham Pentateuch where the original dual-Creator also derives from Christian 59Recently, H.

In the Grandval and San Paolo Bibles, the Creator appears to be holding a book roll, an attribute found also in the Salerno Ante- pendium. 63 Cf., H.

Permeated with legend- ary motifs and free of most Christianizing details, this prototype was a dense narrative cycle not yet condensed or abbreviated. From this Early Christian model, artists at Tours fashioned a new type of image suitable for their full Bible manuscripts. The Construction of the Touronian Frontispieces Verses on the bands which divide the four Genesis pages into horizontal registers identify the scenes depicted on each. The simplest, though not necessarily the earliest, set of tituli accompanies the Bamberg illustrations. Adapted directly from the Vulgate, these verses exhibit a close connection to the illustrations which, as we have seen, also derive from the Bible text.70 Where the Vulgate text was very long, or for the last scene where no appropriate Bible passage existed, a verse was invented: HIC CAIN INTFECTUJ ABEL ABSCDIT HUMO, indicating that the tituli were composed to conform to the pictures. If the verses do in fact follow the illustrations, what was the principle of selection of the scenes ? A number of years ago, Corssen suggested that the Bamberg Genesis scenes copy an earlier cycle related to a set of preserved Alcuinian tituli.71 These tituli have only a general relationship to the Bamberg cycle, however; several narrative episodes includ- ing Noah and Abraham sequences described in them are not illustrated in the Touronian manuscript and not all of the scenes depicted are referred to in the verses. If there was a program behind the Bamberg Genesis page, its principles are lost to us. The tituli common to the Grandval and Vivian Bibles are quite different.72 Composed in verse, they are not mere ad hoc creations designed to serve as labels. K6hler assumed that these tituli were features of the model, presumably also a full-page illustration, and he used the verses to determine the relative authority of each scene in the Grandval and Vivian pages: "Wenn bei Unterschieden zwischen den beiden Fassungen die eine dem Wortlaut des zugeh6rigen Titulus mehr entspricht als die andere, hat sie Anspruch darauf, als die zuverlaissigere Wiedergabe der Vorlage zu gelten."73 Our procedure has differed from that of Kohler. We have demonstrated that the Genesis text, supplemented by the Vita Adae et Evae, not the tituli, was the basis for these illustrations and we have used the Bible to interpret the pictures. Careful comparisons reveal a rather general relationship between titulus and illustration in the Grandval and Vivian Bibles (Figs. 2 and 3). For instance, as K6hler himself pointed out, both manuscripts supplement the verse, SUADET NUPER CREATAE ANGUIS DOLO PUELLAE With scenes of the Fall.74 The Genesis text is the basis for our full under- standing of the depictions. Similarly, the titulus POST HAEC AMOENA LUSTRANS ADAM VOCAT REDEMPTOR refers generally to the reproval but is not the source of the Denial of Blame illustrated in the Grandval Bible. Numerous other details such as the orant angel at the Creation of Adam and the angel-expeller derive not from the tituli, but from the Bible or an apocryphon text.75 Whereas the details of the Carolingian Genesis scenes were not based on the tituli, neither were the verses in the Grandval and Vivian Bibles formulated from a precise analysis of the pictures. For instance, the titulus describes cultivation of the fields as the labor imposed on Adam and Eve and makes no reference to Eve nursing the child. Never- theless, because the general correspondence between cap- tions and images in the Grandval Bible (Fig. 2) is quite close and because in no case does a verse refer to an element not depicted in the illustration, it is likely that the tituli were composed to function with this page. This is clearest in the unusual detail of Eve present at the Admonition, which, as we have seen, derives from the Cotton Genesis recension which, in turn, depends on an apocryphon. The titulus AST EDANT NE POMA VITAE PROHIBET IPSE CONDITOR follows the picture in referring to the couple. As in the Bamberg Bible, scenes selected from the Cotton Genesis recension model were arranged along four registers on the Grandval page and explanatory verses - for the Exodus, Majestas and Apocalypse pages as well - were composed to accompany the pictures. Guided by these same tituli, the artist of the Vivian Bible selected scenes from the identical model but arranged them along three rather than four registers (Fig. 3). The crowding that resulted from this new arrangement necessitated the placement of certain verses in the upper margin of the page and the omission of the Admonition scene. This procedure explains the considerable coincidence in the two pages as well as the differences. Thus, for example, to fit the titulus CUIUS COSTA SACRAE CARPITUR EVAE, the Vivian master chose the same scene from the prototype that had been used also by the Grandval illustrator, while for the verse ADAM PRIMUS UTI FINGITUR ISTIC he selected from this model a different phase - perhaps to save space. The implication of our study, that the Grandval and Vivian tituli are Touron- ian creations, is at variance with the conclusions of philolo- 68 Narkiss, "Ashburnham Pentateuch," 45ff. 69 Gutmann, "Illustrated Jewish Manuscript," 40; Weitzmann, "Zur Frage," 412ff.; Studies in Manuscript Illumination, giff.; Helen Rosenau ("Contributions to the Study ofJewish Iconography," Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, xxxvIII 1955/56, 469) admitted that the Ashburnham Pentateuch probably derives from a Jewish prototype, but had con- cluded that "the figure of God, on the other hand, must be derived from a Christian tradition since it is alien to the Jewish iconography which included no representation of the deity except by inference from the symbol of the hand.... " In the Octateuch recension, the Creation is accomplished by God, symbolized by a hand emerging from a starry arc. A Trinitarian image was introduced at a later stage in this recension, cf., Schade, "Paradies," IoIff. and figs. 8-12. 70 For example, the sixth caption: APERTIS OCULIS CONSUER FOI FICI depends on Gen. 3: 7, ". . . et aperti sunt oculi . . . consuerunt folia ficus."

London, British Museum, Add. I0546, fol. 5v (detail) 26 Slaughter of Abel, atrium mosaic. Venice, San Marco gists who, basing their opinions entirely on internal evidence, have favored a pre-Carolingian origin.76 A ninth-century date fits the pictorial evidence, however, and leads us to consider the verses, like the illustrations, to be products of the Carolingian renaissance. The Touronian model of the San Paolo Genesis page probably followed the same tituli as the Grandval and Vivian frontispieces. This appears to have been the case also for the other "Touronian" pages77 in the San Paolo Bible and is evident in the selection of episodes for the Genesis page. Although the specific phases again vary, the San Paolo manuscript (Fig. 4) presents the basic sequence out- lined in the Grandval-Vivian tituli: Creation of Adam, Creation of Eve, Introduction (Admonition - as in the Vivian Bible, missing), Temptation, Calling, and Expul- sion. That the present tituli in the San Paolo Bible were invented from the pictures explains their particularly close relationship to the illustrations.78 Carolingian artists and not a fifth-century illuminator first created the full-page miniatures from a column picture model of the Cotton Genesis recension, thereby transforming a typically Early Christian mode of illustration into a more medieval one.79 These Touronian artists were not the first to piece together individual narrative units to form separate and more monumental illustrations. The sixth-century illustrator of the Christian Topography of Cosmas Indico- pleustes, following introductory formulae, had already constructed large, loosely organized miniatures from an Octateuch model,80 and other examples of this process are known.81 Most important and quite possibly directly influ- ential on the Carolingian Bibles is the Ashburnham Penta- teuch which was probably known to the ninth-century artists at Tours.82 Although quite heterogeneous, the Ash- burnham Pentateuch includes full-page miniatures con- taining narrative scenes arranged along horizontal regis- ters, the Cain and Abel page (fol. 6r) being a prominent example.83 Whether the Ashburnham Pentateuch actually inspired the Touronian artist remains an open question. What is certain is that the procedure of creating full-page narrative compositions which we find in these manuscripts 76 The tituli were included by Ludwig Traube in the third volume of the MGH. Poetae latini, 248. Later in "Palaeographische Anzeigen," Neues Archiv der Gesellschaft fiir iiltere Deutsche Geschichtskunde, 1902, 264ff. (re- printed in Vorlesungen und Abhandlungen von Ludwig Traube, Munich, I920, 244ff.), Traube revised his Carolingian dating and argued that the tituli were from a "viel iiltere italienische Bibel." K6hler (Schule von Tours, I, pt. 2, i09 and 212), supported in his opinion by Karl Strecker, agreed that the tituli were not of Carolingian origin; but he divided them into two groups: (i) those common to the Grandval and Vivian Bibles (which Strecker dated to the 6th century) and (2) those unique to the Vivian Bible. Nevertheless, he added, "Es wire sehr zu wtinschen, dass das Problem dieser Tituli, das hier nicht behandelt werden kann, von philologischer Seite nachgepriift wiirde." Nordenfalk, in his review of K6hler's study ("Beitrage," 281ff.) returned to the view that the set of tituli in the Vivian Bible is of one origin, but believed that the art- historical evidence precludes a date so late as the 6th century. 77 The seven frontispieces of the Vivian Bible all have counterparts in the San Paolo Bible. Cf., Gaehde, "Carolingian Bible Manuscript," I, 482ff. 78 Gaehde ("Carolingian Bible Manuscript," I, 137; Ii, 132 and 137) concludes that the verses were composed "directly into the manu- script." 79 Cf., Weitzmann, Roll and Codex. 8so Mouriki-Charalambous, "Cosmas Indicopleustes." 81 Weitzmann, Roll and Codex, Io04ff. and passim; idem, "Book Illustration in the Fourth Century: Tradition and Innovation," Akten des VII.

London, British Museum, Add. 10546, fol. 5v (detail) continues to be employed, not only in the West - indeed in the supplementary pages of the San Paolo Bible itself84 - but also during the Middle Byzantine period.85 What distinguishes the Carolingian manuscripts from antecedents such as the Ashburnham Pentateuch is the fact that they are the earliest extant illustrated full Bibles. In each, the Genesis page is part of a set of two, four, eight, or twenty-four frontispiece miniatures for the Old and New Testaments. To provide these editions of the complete Bible with illustrations, the Touronian artists abandoned the earlier system of column pictures interspersed throughout the text and adopted a more economical, more flexible arrangement, whereby the illustrations were gathered on single pages and the number of pictures could be varied without affecting the overall unity of the pictorial cycle. Each of the Touronian frontispieces must now be studied separately, and we anticipate that the history of each will be quite individual.86 Whether a program underlies the illus- 28 Drawing of antique pelike, Hercules and the Apples of the Hesperides, Turin (after Gerhard) trative system of the Grandval Bible as K6hler proposed87 must be decided on the basis of this analysis, but we may be certain from our consideration of the Genesis pages alone that such a program would have to be of Carolingian origin and not based on fifth-century theology. The system of Bible illustration found in the Carolingian Bibles does not repeat a single earlier model, after all, but was developed from heterogeneous sources during the ninth century. As is now realized also for the Utrecht and Stuttgart Psalters, the Carolingian artists at Tours were not mere copyists but created distinctly original works from their early sources. Further work remains to be done. A thorough investiga- tion of the Cotton Genesis will have to precede any conclu- sion concerning the origins of the apocryphal elements in- fused into the Genesis narrative, and a full study of the other Touronian frontispieces is necessary to test our and K6hler's theories further. Nevertheless, by applying the methods of picture criticism developed by Weitzmann to the entire set of related Genesis pages - those in the Bamberg and San Paolo Bibles as well as the Grandval and Vivian frontis- pieces - we have been able to demonstrate that the model available at Tours was not a single full-page miniature but a densely illustrated Genesis text; and by introducing new material concerning the Cotton Genesis recension - notably the Millstatt Genesis - it has been possible to evaluate more precisely the relationship of the Carolingian frontispieces to their Early Christian prototype.
