<plain_text><page sequence="1">the individual), resides in the living person's fore- head; thus, each duein fubara serves to locate this power of the honored ancestor. The Kalabari world is one of continual interaction of the living, the ancestors, the heroes, and the water spirits with carved and constructed images providing critical points of contact among these realms. As well as providing an avenue to Kalabari worldview, the duein fubara permit comment on Kalabari aesthet- ics which find application primarily in public dis- plays of dancing and costume rather than in ob- jects, which are secreted in sacred shrine areas as are the screens. At several points in the work, Barley discusses cross-cultural aesthetics and the difficul- ties in approaching Kalabari art. While the impor- tance of visual appearance which Westerners usu- ally associate with aesthetics may not be totally ap- plicable to these pieces, they do illustrate the "art of assemblage" which reflects a larger theme in Kal- abari culture, a culture which easily assimilates "foreign" elements. Barley suggests that the form and content of the screens may have been influenced by European photography (in contrast to an older suggestion of origin in the extraordinary bronze plaques which decorated the king's palace of the powerful Benin empire to the northeast). Although the screens seem to predate the introduction of photography to the Niger Delta, the relationship of such aspects of Eu- ropean cultures and indigenous cultures encoun- tered by European travelers, missionaries, and trad- ers surely needs to be better understood. The Kala- bari do view the screens' central figures as portraits of specific ancestors despite their highly stylized form. Although a somewhat specialized volume, this work serves as an excellent case study of how an artistic tradition reflects its culture and thereby pro- vides an excellent example of the value, to both his- torian and ethnologist, of considering a full cultural complex diachronically in order to understand a people and a process of acculturation. While Bar- ley's specific conclusions may be debated, his dis- cussion of the multifaceted interaction of European and Kalabari cultures is highly informative. This volume certainly belongs in any library serving pro- grams in art and anthropology as well as African studies. As we learn more about individual African cultures, I hope there will be more such tightly fo- cused studies. Sayings of the Ancestors: The Spiritual Life of the Sibundoy Indians. JOHN HOLMES MCDOWELL. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1989. x + 206 pp., photographs, ap- pendix, references, index. $21.00 (cloth). RAQUEL ACKERMAN California State University, Los Angeles The Ingano people in the Sibundoy valley of southwestern Colombia are at the juncture of three major cultural traditions: native Amazonian sha- manism, Inca Quechua, and Spanish Catholicism. Contemporary migration to large South and Central American cities has added to the array of cultural influences. Despite the syncretic nature of their cul- ture, their everyday life is guided by a vast corpus of proverblike sayings attributed to the first Ingano. These sayings in the Inga language-a dialect re- lated to Imperial Cuzco Quechua-have remained unchanged through the centuries, we are told. They provide key insights into the Ingano culture. Their first function is that of omens. They are used to foretell the future by helping in the interpretation of dreams and signs. In their second function, John McDowell regards the sayings as linking the present with the "ever-present ancestral past." The sayings bring an atemporal wisdom into the particular cir- cumstances of individuals' lives. Their third func- tion is that of accessing the otherwise obscure and hard to reach spiritual world. The spiritual world has a direct effect on the health of people. It is con- stituted by anthropomorphic, animal, natural, and fantastic characters. Close adherence to the moral principles of the sayings assures "spiritual health." Spirits share the ancestors' temporal sphere. It is through their ability to connect individuals with their ancestors in the past that the sayings serve as a means of making contact with the more inacces- sible spiritual realm. If the ancestors give advice as to how to behave in the world and interpret its signs, it is the spiritual realm that is responsible for the health and destiny of the Ingano. The sayings are just one door to the spiritual realm. Other insights are provided by the Ingano mythic corpus and by visions obtained through a variety of Amazonian hallucinogenic drugs. Two-thirds of the book is devoted to the compi- lation of 203 sayings and several myths. The sayings are grouped into two general categories-those that refer to dreams and those that refer to signs. Each of these categories is further subdivided into sets that share some element mentioned in the sayings. Each saying is presented in the Ingano language with a textual English translation. Some have an additional commentary made by Ingano informants, and oth- ers have comments made by John McDowell. McDowell claims that the sayings have "a logic and a frame of reference all their own, external to the human dramas to which they are applied" (p. 154), while at the same time "the spiritual life of the Si- bundoy natives [is seen] as a rational and coherent system" (p. vii). Regretfully, neither the "logic" of the sayings nor the "coherence" of the system un- derlying Sibundoy spiritual life becomes apparent at any point in the book. Rather these "logics" re- main opaque to the reader, probably due to the book's organization and the arguments advanced by the author. Moreover, insufficient cross-refer- ences among the sayings and poor indexing at the end of the book compound the problems. The data in this book are abundant. It has, how- ever, two serious flaws. Most of the sayings are de- contextualized from their conversational setting. The data lack a systematic presentation, and one is often puzzled by the purpose of specific informa- tion. These two flaws detract greatly from the use- fulness of the data. Livelihood and Resistance: Peasants and the Politics of Land in Peru. GAVIN SMITH.

SELIGMANN University of Wisconsin, Madison Gavin Smith argues that, for the Huasicanchinos, a Quechua- and Spanish-speaking people of the central Andean highlands of Peru, the economic and the political are continuously and dialectically interlinked. Smith squarely situates himself in the middle of debates over the relationship between class formation and political struggle. He acknowl- edges his debts to Gramsci, Hobsbawm, James Scott, E. P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams (but not Bourdieu) in the formulation of his thesis and the questions he raises: How does heterogeneity in terms of class membership and consciousness be- come transformed into sustained political resis- tance? How do we define class membership, and at what point does a mode of production change to such a degree that it must be recognized as quali- tatively different? Smith's goal is to "interlace thoroughly from the beginning the economic and the political" (p. 23), tracing from the mid-19th century through the 1970s the Huasicanchinos' history as herders, their participation in the War of the Pacific against Chile, the dynamics of hacienda expansion mediated by the international wool market, and events at the lo- cal level which finally forced two waves of migrants to establish themselves in Lima and Huancayo in the mid-i 950s and mid-i 960s. He then introduces us to five detailed case studies of migrant house- holds in order to examine "the effect of commodity penetration into different areas of the operation in such a way that the potential developmental trajec- tory of enterprises varies" (p. 113). Finally, he moves into the political domain to describe the for- mation of a "culture of opposition" in the land re- cuperation campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s, linked to the "experiential history" captured in the case studies. He concludes that Huasicanchinos live a "mobilized way of life, working to provision the resistance and resisting to protect the conditions for carrying out such work" (p. 170). "The bottom line issue of political struggle," Smith points out, is "the parallel experience of each participant in trying to keep bread on the table" (p. 170). The goals Smith sets himself are ambitious but the book is ultimately flawed because the reader cannot make direct links or correspondences between the specificities of each case study and the form, con- tent, and outcome of the political struggles in which the Huasicanchinos engage. Despite this underlying weakness, which I be- lieve is a result of making overly ambitious explan- atory claims in order to theorize heterogeneity from which patterns do indeed emerge, Smith tells a wonderfully textured story, especially when it is un- interrupted by sparring matches with invisible op- ponents over the definition of "peasant" versus "simple commodity producer." Among the signifi- cant contributions he makes to an understanding of the microdynamics of Andean political economy is his definition of who a Huasicanchino is. Rather than simply recognize the strength and importance of interpersonal ties between rural and urban mi- grant households, Smith shows that these ties create household confederations. This conforms closely to a variation upon the archipelago model of Andean political economy proposed by Murra (not explic- itly recognized by Smith). Migration settlements are constituted, at least partially through the efforts of the Huasincanchinos themselves, to become yet another archipelagic "island," connected to those in the highlands through all manner of exchange and production relationships and over which the Huasicanchinos exert some political and economic control. These flexible "confederations" may change over time, dependent upon the mainte- nance of alliances as well as on unpredictable eco- nomic forces. They are one means of reducing risk in households that are already operating on the margins of the economy. Smith describes the differ- ences in the livelihood of migrant households and their connections to rural households (one house- hold has 14 different kinds of livelihood which de- pend upon Huasicanchino labor and information gathering-from strawberry picking to retailing to running a piggery to street vending to car washing to saxophone playing). He proposes that the histor- ical depth of migrants' respective experiences and the differences in their original reasons for migrat- ing have a lot to do with the paths they take in po- litical struggle. At the same time, the social repro- duction of all of the households depends upon maintaining and activating ties with other house- holds, which are valuable and valid because of their interpersonal and cultural rather than their purely economic meaning. Smith argues that heterogeneity is the defining characteristic of Huasicancha as a sociopolitical unit. The Huasicanchinos depend upon interhouse- hold ties to make a livelihood; they are also in- volved in a political struggle to maintain these ties. This struggle, in turn, has depended for its success and longevity (Andean highland communities have participated in resistance movements for centuries) upon discussion and negotiation among these het- erogeneous households. The principal institution that is both created out of and is the forum for these negotiations is "the community" and its plasticity permits it to perpetuate itself and to provide the field for collective resistance. In his words, "What makes community is the discourse" (p. 234). He does not, therefore, see heterogeneity and self-interested be- havior of different households as an obstacle to po- litical resistance but rather as the means by which unity is forged. In short, he strives to describe a cul- ture of pluralism. This does not prevent Smith from recognizing, however, that as households experi- ence economic differentiation, they can manipu- late the community as an institution for personal political rather than collective gain, receiving more from the community than they invest in it. This is really two books rather than one, and when Smith moves from the history of migrant households to the meat of political struggles over land in Huasicancha, the narrative gains momen- tum. The Huasicanchinos use imaginative extrale- gal and legal tactics to maintain and regain control of their lands, directly taking into account national policy and political platforms which are often com- municated to them by urban migrants. In one land invasion in 1946, the Huasicanchinos astutely went so far as to build new but weathered houses with thatched roofs made of old straw on a contested piece of property as evidence that they had pos- 812 american ethnologist</page><page sequence="3">sessed and worked the lands for years, a precondi- tion for official community recognition. They oc- cupied the land and taught their children the names of the landmarks in the area so they would be pre- pared if and when inspectors came; they also trained the children not to call the adults by name so that, should a confrontation with authorities arise, the adults' identities would not be known im- mediately. Smith works hard to demonstrate the interplay between two themes and two domains. Although he falls short of his goal, he fills in a space that only recently has received the attention it deserves, and opens a window on the capacity of collectivities that have not been fully incorporated into a capital- ist mode of production to persist in defending their rights to land and control over their labor under ex- tremely adverse conditions. It may be that a capi- talist mode of production provides the precondi- tions for Huasicanchinos to engage in these strug- gles, but the particular economic position house- hold confederations occupy within a hegemonic ideology and economy, and the relationship of their economic history to a long history of producing cul- turally viable tactics of political resistance, deserve to be recognized. Smith succeeds in doing this and the details he gives us of these struggles permit an- thropology to move from a rhetorical recognition of the interlinked economic and political battles of rel- atively powerless collectivities to a more rooted grasp of their dynamics. Tangweera: Life and Adventures among Gentle Savages. C. NAPIER BELL (introduction by Philip A. Dennis). Austin: University of Texas Press, 1989 [1899]. xxi + 318 pp., map, illustra- tions, appendixes, references, index. $25.00 (cloth), $12.95 (paper). DAVID . DODDS University of California, Los Angeles Originally published in 1899, Tangweera is a timely reprint describing the Mosquito Coast (the eastern regions of Nicaragua and Honduras) of the mid-1 9th century. This book, rather than Paul Ther- oux's novel (Houghton Mifflin, 1982) should have been entitled The Mosquito Coast, for it evocatively captures the physical, historical, and cultural am- bience of the region: the climate and wildlife, and, most important, the daily life and language of its in- habitants. Bell, whose father was an English businessman extracting mahogany from the forests of eastern Nicaragua, grew up among the Miskito, Sumu, and black creole peoples of Nicaragua. Based on scraps of "fieldnotes" and his memories, first as a boy, then as a young man and lumber foreman, Bell wrote this account after retiring from his adult ca- reer as a civil engineer in New Zealand. As a fluent speaker of Miskito and a long-time resident of the Coast, Bell writes authentically about this part of the world; 90 years after its original publication, many of his descriptions remain strikingly vivid and con- temporary. The book might best be characterized as an eth- nographic memoir and travelogue. Though the 21 chapters contain many lengthy digressions sand- wiched between the recounting of chronological events such as "Our Voyage up the Coast to the Toongla River" (ch. V) and "Voyage up Twaka River" (ch. VI), the author's narrative is highly read- able. The digressions are much of what makes the book worthwhile since they contain a wealth of de- tail about local history and customs, and especially about the native flora and fauna. As a historical account, Bell's "Introduction" contains a useful summary of the history of the Mos- quito Coast from a 1 9th-century perspective: the se- ries of wars and treaties between England and Spain tussling for control over the western Caribbean; the cooperation of the Miskito with British buccaneers in raiding the Spanish; and the establishment of British governance of the region from Jamaica. He also mentions the importance of the Clayton-Bul- wer Treaty (1856) in which the British and Ameri- cans agreed not to compete for territorial rights to the Central American isthmus, and which ostensi- bly created a large reserve for the indigenous inhab- itants of the coast. More important, the book con- tains firsthand accounts of events in a Nicaraguan history. As Philip A. Dennis summarizes in a helpful introduction to the book: [Bell] accompanied a British military expedition up the Rfo San Juan in 1848, in a continuation of hostilities with the Spanish; he visited British war- ships in the harbor at Greytown; he helped sell firewood to the American steamship companies transporting gold seekers up the Rio San Juan on their way to California; and he had a personal en- counter with William Walker... [an American adventurer who briefly took control of the Nicar- aguan government]. [p. vii] As an ethnography, or ethnohistory, of the Mis- kito and their indigenous neighbors, this book is in- valuable. As Dennis points out, Bell's descriptions serve as a baseline of comparison for understanding the cultural changes that have produced contem- porary Miskito society, especially changes related to contact with the Moravian missionaries who ar- rived in the late 1800s. Bell describes the Miskito as living in palm-thatched houses with dirt floors, ob- taining the service of local shamans (sukias) to cure their ills, and marrying polygynously. As evidenced by Miskito life today, the Moravians later taught them how to build houses of sawyered wood on posts and discouraged the practices of shamanism and polygyny. Ethnic relations between the coastal- living Miskito and the riverine tribal peoples of the interior are also a major theme throughout the book: the Miskito served as middlemen in the flow of goods between these people and the British. Of special ethnohistorical note is Bell's personal ac- quaintance with one of the last Miskito "kings," George Augustus Frederick, a boyhood friend and playmate to whom Bell's father also served as guardian and secretary. (The institution of "kings" among the Miskito was established by the British as a means of indirect rule, but was discontinued after the territorial "reincorporation" of the Mosquito Coast by Nicaragua in 1894.) Any scholar interested in the ethnology, geog- raphy, or general history of the Mosquito Coast will find this book worthwhile reading. At a time when reviews 813</page></plain_text>
