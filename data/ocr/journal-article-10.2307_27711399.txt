Denise Nowakowski Baker has written a learned, graceful, and very welcome addition to the growing literature on Julian of Norwich. Where all too many studies of Julian seek almost anxiously to assimilate her harmoniously into the traditions of western spirituality, Baker presents a strong argument for Julian as a creative theologian, whose development is very much the focus for this study. For Baker, Julian's spiritual development also comprised a maturation of her interpretive powers; she therefore offers a close reading of the two texts for the Showings that is at once critical and contextual. Baker locates each text of the Showings within a cultural and theological field, going on to explore the ways in which the two versions testify to Julian's growing ability to understand her vision ary experience, to assimilate the theological literature that allowed her to un</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 543 derstand it, and to write lucidly about both the experience and the process of understanding. Baker admits early on that her book depends upon two presuppositions for which there is no hard evidence. First, she argues from the assumption that Julian was as learned as Edmund Colledge and James Walsh present her in their im portant edition of the Showings. However, as she demonstrates, this is no idle assumption; her careful analysis of Julian's theology in relation to the theologi cal currents of late medieval Christianity and to the revered authorities of the Church points up many times over the theological erudition and sophistication of Julian's thought. Second, Baker notes that the priority of the Short Text of the Showings to the Long Text is crucial to her argument (p. 5), but her astute handling of the relationship between the two texts provides strong internal ev idence for what cannot be proved externally. fulian of Norwich's "Showings": From Vision to Book is divided into six chapters. The first chapter explores the "interlace of themes" in the Short Text and their relation not simply to affective spirituality but, more specifically, to issues asso ciated with compassion, contrition, and contemplation. In Chapter 2 Baker fo cuses on the theme of compassion within the cultural context of this medieval tradition, pointing out ways in which Julian was good at the kind of visualization encouraged by affective devotional practices. She also suggests Julian's familiar ity with standard affective images of the period. In the next three chapters? which concern Julian's treatments of the problem of evil, of the nature of God, and of the ideology of the self?Baker moves into more controversial territory. The true strengths of her book lie here, for her command of medieval theolog ical literature allows her to note Julian's intelligent and careful exploitation of the traditions she inherited and, in some cases, subtly transformed. Baker thus offers a perspective upon Julian's thought that inevitably places the late fourteenth-century East Anglian anchoress in the company of Augus tine, Anselm, and Bernard of Clairvaux, among others. In particular, Baker suggests for Julian what must have been a period of profound thoughtfulness and study in the twenty years that supposedly lie between the production of the two texts of the Showings. For example, where Augustine in his treatment of human and divine nature had looked backward, to the origins of sin in the Fall, Baker asserts that, in her efforts to understand the nature of evil and the effects of sin, Julian chose to look forward, to the ultimate consequences of the Fall in divine redemption and grace. By reading Julian's theology in rela tion to key texts in the Augustinian tradition, Baker argues that, in order to arrive at the exposition of her vision of the Lord and the Servant, Julian had inevitably to set aside the anthropomorphic character of a punitive God (Chap ter 4). Similarly, Baker argues that Julian substituted a new conception of self? based in part on Bernard's description of the "godly will"?for the old, sinful one that so underpins the Augustinian theology of sin, punishment, and loss. The androgynous deity whom Julian eventually describes in the Long Text makes possible a theology that supplants one rooted in sexual difference and hence in distrust of (feminine) matter. In her exposition of Julian's intellectual development, Baker implicitly pro vides us with a picture of Julian as a writer who challenged the tenets of main stream medieval theology. I do not mean to overstate this because Baker is care ful to point out Julian's similarity to other thinkers who hint at (or seem to) such heterodox ideas as that of universal salvation. But her book nonetheless marks a milestone in studies of Julian of Norwich by quietly insisting on Julian's</page><page sequence="3">544 fournal of English and Germanic Philology, October 1996 thoughtfulness, her erudition, and her independence from the constrictions of dominant traditions. In the final chapter Baker seeks to demonstrate how we might detect the process by which Julian revised that original text. She there fore offers a close reading of the Long Text against the Short Text as a process of both revision and re-vision that serves as a methodology for reading the text itself. I found this chapter less clear than the preceding chapters, its argument slightly less assured. Quibble aside, Baker's own finely detailed reading makes her book a valuable experience for the contemporary reader, who cannot help but return to Julian with new respect for the serious and profoundly intellectual nature of the task she set herself.
