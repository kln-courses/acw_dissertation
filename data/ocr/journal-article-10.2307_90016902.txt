Significantly understudied, these new coin types were innovative in both  composition and content, and represented a dramatic departure from tradi- tional coin reverse types, which typically featured at most two figures. The  new designs depicted the emperor interacting directly with his subjects, civil- ian and military. In both composition and theme, the Trajanic coin reverses  are similar to the group scenes on contemporaneous monumental reliefs. The  group scenes on both sculpture and coins point to a key emphasis in the Tra- janic period on the relationship and interaction between the emperor and his  subjects, and broaden our understanding of both the artistic innovations and  official representation of the Trajanic regime. The reign of Trajan presents such a wealth of information that, even after centuries  of study, important developments have gone unobserved, and connections within  and between media still remain to be discovered. One development in the Trajanic  period that has escaped extensive study is the drastic increase in imperial coin  types depicting numerous anthropomorphic figures. Previous to Trajan, coin  reverses featuring multi-figure scenes had been limited primarily to depictions of  the occasional adlocutio, congiarium, or sacrifice. The reign of Trajan, in contrast,  saw fourteen new types of scenes with four or more figures.

Rather than using a single  figure, such as a personification, to embody an abstract concept, the new “group  scene” coins often depicted the emperor interacting directly with his subjects, both  civilian and military. Many of these group scenes, such as the presentation of a  foreign king before Trajan and his army, seem intended to represent (more or less  accurately) concrete historical events. In both composition and theme, therefore,  the Trajanic coin designs share many similarities with well-studied scenes in  Trajanic monumental reliefs. Taken together, the group scenes on both sculpture  and coins point to a key emphasis in the Trajanic period on the relationship and  interaction between the emperor and his subjects. The numismatic group scenes  thus broaden our understanding of both the artistic innovations of the Trajanic  period and representations of the Trajanic regime. I. Introduction: Definitions and Methodology  The goals of this article are twofold: (a) to present a definitive exposition of Trajan- ic group scenes in imperial coinage; and (b) to investigate the significance and re- lationship of these scenes to contemporary monumental reliefs. Following a brief  methodological discussion, I first present an exploration of the compositional in- novations of group scenes, through a description and preliminary discussion of  the individual designs. I then explore the thematic innovations of group scenes,  and the relationship between numismatic group scenes and Trajanic reliefs. I.1. Group Scenes “Group scenes” are defined in this article as compositions that include four or  more anthropomorphic figures. Most imperial numismatic designs featured only  one or two figures.1 In the initial stages of this study, I selected three figures per  scene as my defining criterion. While designs with three figures were in fact rela- tively infrequent, the resulting subset of coins was not sufficiently distinctive for  clear analysis. Narrowing the range to four figures, however, resulted in a distinct  and significant subset of imperial coin designs focused on historicizing scenes. One interesting aspect of Trajanic group scenes on coins is that they frequently  refer to specific historical events or programs. The legends of the coins may specify  to which particular historical event they refer (for example Trajan’s seventh, eighth  or ninth imperatorial acclamation).2 Some of the representations of these events  are purely symbolic, such as the alimenta type showing Trajan with a female and  two children.3 Others take the form of historicizing vignettes, designs that give the  impression of depicting an actual, specific historical event.  1 Anthropomorphic figures can comprise deities, personifications, and adult and child  human figures on any scale. 2 MIR 497, 548, 549. 3 MIR 357, 358, 447. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="3"> The Emperor in Action 91 This is not to say that these numismatic representations were meant to act  as believable snapshots of the events they commemorated, or that they necessar- ily incorporated any particular historical details. Just as scenes in sculpted reliefs  presented an ideal, not a documentary, of imperial behavior, the numismatic vi- gnettes were carefully contrived compositions that may have had only tenuous  connections to history. The representation of these events is often abstracted and  simplified, and can feature personifications or deities, albeit rarely. It is not even  necessary to assume that the events commemorated in historicizing vignettes  ever occurred as discrete proceedings. What connects the designs in question is a  compositional choice: to memorialize an event by depicting it as an interaction of  numerous human actors, often with realistic details. Circus Maximus coins (MIR  182) that include an abstract personification of the circus also include concrete  details such as a cheering crowd, the imperial podium, and metae. The use of historicizing vignettes can be contrasted with more common  mythological or symbolic coin types, which allude to events but do not represent  them directly. For example, some Iudaea Capta coins of Vespasian (e.g. BMC 532)  show a captive, downtrodden female representing Judaea, but do not actually  show the capture of Jerusalem. Similarly, coins commemorating the dedication of  a temple typically show the temple without any illustration of its actual dedication  (e.g. Vespasian’s dedication of the Capitoline temple; BMC 721). Trajanic group  scenes, on the other hand, often seem to present the commemorated event in a  more literal manner. This warrants specific study. I.2. Methodology This article is founded on a systematic examination of coin types minted in Rome  under the reign of Trajan. This examination draws on B. Woytek’s authoritative  systematic work on Trajanic coinage, Die Reichsprägung des Kaisers Traianus (98– 117) in the Moneta Imperii Romani series (Woytek 2010). All typological distinc- tions and chronologies for Trajanic coinage presented in this paper are derived  from Woytek’s volumes. This article compares imagery on Trajanic coinage and monumental reliefs,4  the two major media associated with the emperor and designed for a broad pub- lic audience. In making comparisons between imperial coinage and monumental  reliefs, one must be careful to avoid several theoretical pitfalls. The first involves  preservation. Coins were mass produced and have survived in large numbers, to  such an extent that scholars can be plausibly certain that what survives in the ar- chaeological record is a reasonable record of what was once minted in Rome. The  same cannot be said for reliefs. Few examples of monumental reliefs survive, and  4 This article uses the term “monumental reliefs” to refer to large scale sculptures in relief,  which were set up in publicly accessible space, by groups or individuals acting in the capac- ity of official positions of authority. These sort of sculptures are traditionally referred to as  “historical” or “state” reliefs; see Sobocinski and Wolfram Thill forthcoming. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="4"> 92 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill it is not at all clear to what extent the surviving sample is representative of what  was once produced. Nevertheless, a sufficient number of individual imperial relief  monuments survives to allow for a discussion of general trends, albeit a cautious  one. A further problem in comparing coins to monumental reliefs is the question  of scale and production. The small size of a coin flan meant that any numismatic  design would be severely restricted in surface area. No comparative restriction  existed for reliefs. The mass production of coins also meant that any numismatic  design normally would need to be repeated in numerous dies, while a design for  monumental reliefs needed to be executed only once. Coins are portable objects,  while reliefs are not; coins are free-standing, while reliefs were incorporated with- in architectural frames and complexes; coins could be personally owned, while  monumental reliefs were public monuments set up in public spaces. All of these  important differences must be kept in mind when comparing reliefs with coins. One area of common ground for coins and reliefs is that questions of patron- age, artistry, and audience for both media are fiercely debated. It is not within the  scope of this article to discuss these issues in depth. Speaking broadly regarding  patronage and artistry, however, it seems the most likely scenario is that at differ- ent times, different emperors took different degrees of interest in different aspects  of different projects. Sorting out who was involved in what stage of a project or  process remains nearly impossible. In this article, therefore, the neutral term “the  production team” is used, to refer to anyone and everyone involved in the produc- tion of coins and sculpture. In terms of audience, the fact that coins were mass produced and reliefs were  not would have serious implications for the intended audiences of both media.  Unlike relief monuments, coins came in distinctive denominations with differ- ent circulation patterns, both physical and social.5 This raises the heavily debated  question of whether denominations and designs may have been intended to tar- get diverse audiences, separated by class or location.6 Woytek and M. Beckmann  have both examined the denominational distribution of Trajanic types, noting  that the more complicated designs are found primarily on aurei and the larger  base metal denominations, often contemporaneously (Table 1, below) (Beckmann  2009; Woytek 2009). It is difficult to tell, however, whether this reflects ideological  5 Admittedly, access patterns for relief monuments are generally a matter of speculation.  The two in situ monuments specifically considered in this article, the Column of Trajan and  the Beneventum Arch, are located in a forum and along a road, respectively, and thus were  probably publicly available. 6 There has been considerable debate on the extent to which coins were designed to  convey (potentially complicated) messages to various audiences: see Charlesworth 1937;  Sutherland 1959; Levick 1982; Crawford 1983; Crump 1985; Metcalf 1993; Cheung 1998;  Hekster 2003; Kemmers 2005; 2006; Beckmann 2009; Woytek 2009; Elkins 2010; Noreña  2011. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="5"> The Emperor in Action 93 machinations or the production logistics of the imperial mint (see below). Even  if we assume that the distribution of types was ideologically motivated, it is un- certain how to interpret a given distribution.7 Since this article cannot hope to  do sufficient justice to questions of audience and reception, I will follow the basic  hypothesis that the various designs of Trajanic coinage were intended to convey  some message to the viewers who handled them, leaving aside any question of the  efficacy of the message. The issue of the distribution of group scenes will be ad- dressed below. 7 The appearance of the same image on both aurei and sestertii, for example, could mean  that separate demographics were being targeted through the same image, but it would not  be clear whether those audiences were meant to draw different or identical messages from  that image. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="6"> 94 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill ©2014 American Numismatic Society Table 1: Chronological overview of group scenes in Trajanic coinage.8  MIR Scene Type # of Figures Denomination Date (CE) Description Legend Period 1 11 Adlocutio 6 Sestertius Jan.–Feb. 98 Trajan, with attendant, stands Obv: IMP NERVA CAES TRAIAN  on podium, addressing AVG GERM P M. soldiers below.

Group Scenes in Trajanic Coinage The following section presents a description of the various types of Trajanic group  scenes on coin reverses.9 I organize the types by composition, since composition  would have been one of the most striking features of these new coin types. The  group scenes thus can be divided into three main categories, proceeding from  simple to complex:  1. Designs with figures on single level. 2. Designs with mounted emperor. 3. Designs with emperor on suggestus. II.1. Designs with figures on single level 1. Military Oath MIR 41 Sestertius, February–Fall 98 ce Description: This subject appeared in only one group scene design. Trajan, in toga  praetexta, stands to the left, his right arm extended over a small altar topped with  flames (Pl. 11, 1a). Facing him across the altar are four soldiers. One soldier is  clearly in the foreground, standing nearly frontal and reaching his right hand out  to grasp that of Trajan. Standing behind the soldier to the right are two other sol- diers, one of whom holds a shield. A fourth soldier appears only as a face above the  leading soldier’s right shoulder. A legionary eagle and a second standard are in the  background. Trajan stands more than a head taller than the other figures.  Discussion: As Woytek has demonstrated, this design is clearly based on Domiti- anic predecessors.10 These predecessors all share the basic composition of emperor  standing left, grasping the hand of a soldier over an altar with other soldiers watch- ing. BMC 344 (85 ce) is particularly close to the Trajanic example, sharing the  number of soldiers (four), the position and number of standards (two), and even  smaller details such as the shield on the far right soldier’s shoulder (also seen in  BMC 301 and 368) and the “floating” face above the frontal soldier11 (Pl. 11, 1a, 1b).  9 These descriptions conform to examples illustrated in Woytek 2010, which are, to the  best of my and Dr. Woytek’s knowledge, representative of the material. I use the term “type”  in this article to designate a set of coin reverses that refer to the same subject (e.g. the set of  coins celebrating the alimenta). “Design,” on the other hand, indicates particular, distinct  imagery within a type (e.g. the design, within the alimenta type, featuring Trajan and a  kneeling woman). A design may have multiple “compositional variants,” where certain ele- ments are divergent within a constant overall design (e.g. the alimenta design with Trajan  and a kneeling woman may feature one or two children). 10 BMC 301, 344, 368; Woytek 2005: 202–204. 11 BMC 301 reveals that the face belongs to a standard bearer. 590 Trajan and 4 Sestertius 20 Feb. 116–Aug. 117 Standing Trajan; reclining Obv: IMP CAES NER TRAIANO  Armenia Armenia and 2 river gods OPTIMO AVG GER DAC  below.

Statue Group13  MIR 184 Sestertius, c. 103–104 ce Description: This type appeared in only one design and shows a statue group erect- ed for Trajan, probably following the victory of the First Dacian War (Pl. 12, 2).   The focus of the composition is a large togate statue of Trajan standing on a prom- inent statue base. In his left hand he holds an imperial scepter, and in his right a  laurel branch. He is crowned by a Victory, suspended in the air to the right. On  either side of Trajan, reaching up to him, are two kneeling Dacians, wearing tradi- tional costumes of cloaks, trousers, and pilei (caps). Compared to Trajan, the Da- cians and Victory are on a miniature scale. Below the Dacians are four eagles, two  on each side, each with a vexillum behind them. The eagles stand on a garlanded  trapezoidal base. Discussion: As a likely representation of an actual statue (as suggested by the statue  bases), the composition is determined in part by the design of the actual statue  group. At the same time, it is probable that the statue has not been depicted strictly  faithfully. The floating position of the Victory in particular is difficult to imagine in  a statue group. Typically the crowning figure in such a composition is positioned  behind the emperor.14  12 I am grateful to an anonymous reader for pointing out that the brief use of this type  may be related to its connections to Domitian, which could have proven offensive to some  influential party. If this were the case, it would raise interesting questions of patronage and  reception, since it would imply that a design was produced, noticed and subject to negative  feedback (from someone, the emperor, the senate, some mint official, or the people at large),  and then recalled. To speculate further, it is possible to envision a scenario where Nerva’s  sudden death, and Trajan’s absence from Rome, led to the hasty reliance on a preexisting  type, which was subsequently reviewed and revised. Mint designers did return to Domi- tianic predecessors later in Trajan’s reign for elements of the Trajan and Armenia design  (MIR 590; see main text), although here the parallels were not so obvious. 13 Although Trajan stands on a base in this design, all human figures are on the same  level, with the bent knees and feet of the Dacians on the same plane as Trajan’s feet.  14 This can be seen in a few obvious examples, such as the Gemma Augustea, the Chariot  Frieze on the Arch of Titus, the Great Trajanic Frieze, and the Beneventum Arch. The mo- tif can also be seen in Trajanic coinage (MIR 121–122, 167, 185, 320–322; Woytek 2005:  204–209). If part of the actual statue group, the Victory in the Statue Group type may have  been moved in the numismatic design in order to make her more visible, or simply to take  advantage of the medium’s greater freedom (Strack 1931: 112). The production team may  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="15"> The Emperor in Action 103 The inclusion of multiple figures in the numismatic design was ultimately a  compositional choice, since the emperor and Victory, combined with the legend,  should have been sufficient to clarify the identity of the statue. The Dacians nev- ertheless are included, and with great care: even given the small scale, the produc- tion team was able to make the figures’ identity clear through the careful rendering  of their costume. Rather than simplifying the design to identifying elements, an  attempt was made at a detailed rendering of a complicated, multi-figural group.  3. Alimenta (Trajan, female figure, and two children) MIR 357, 358, 447 Sestertius, dupondius, and as, 111–113 ce Description: Only one design explicitly commemorating the alimenta program  took the form of a group scene. A togate Trajan sits on a sella curulis with his feet  on a small stool (Pl. 13, 3a). His left hand is raised, balancing a long, eagle-topped  scepter on the sella, and his right hand is lower and outstretched. To the left, fron- tal but with her head turned towards Trajan, stands a woman wearing a stephane.  Her identity is unclear but she is probably a personification, perhaps Annona or  Italia.15 To her left stands a boy, who clings with a raised hand to her dress; in her  left arm she holds a smaller child, who leans out with both hands towards Trajan.  Discussion: Under Trajan, three separate reverse designs commemorated the  institution of the imperial alimenta.16 The imperial alimenta program provided  one-time loans to landed estates of Italian towns, with the interest on the loans  providing income (in perpetuity) for the distribution of funds to a select group  of the towns’ children.17 Possibly begun under Nerva, the program was expanded  greatly under Trajan. The first Trajanic alimenta design on coins features a traditional composition:  a personification of Annona (Mattingly 1936: 183; Woytek 2010: 372) standing  center holding a cornucopia, with a much smaller togate child standing on the  left (Pl. 13, 3b). This personification design appeared on three distinct base metal  also have been working from a description, rather than from the statue itself. 15 For an identification as Italia, see Strack 1931: No. 404; Mattingly 1936: 184; Woytek  2010, 374. Mattingly and Sydenham (1926: 278) refer to the figure only as a woman.  16 I do not include under the alimenta category MIR 352, whose legend includes ALIM  ITAL in exergue but whose imagery clearly follows that of the Italia Restituta design type  (see text). For discussion of the alimenta types as a group, see e.g. Torelli 1997: 170–171.  17 The imperial alimenta program apparently was inspired by preexisting private alimen- tary schemes, which had important connections to ideologies of patronage. For background  on the alimenta, see e.g. Duncan-Jones 1964; Garnsey 1968; Patterson 1987; Bossu 1989.  For a convincing argument that the alimenta should not be connected to modern concep- tions of poverty relief, see Woolf 1990. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="16"> 104 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill series between 111–113 ce and on denarii of c. 112–113 ce.18 The second Trajanic  alimenta design (MIR 345, 376) appeared on aurei of 111 ce and features a togate  Trajan with two small children (Pl. 13, 3c). Trajan stretches out his right hand to  the children; the child on the left, a boy, raises one hand to nearly meet Trajan’s,  while the girl raises two hands.  Taken together, the three alimenta designs show interesting variation in the  expression of the idea of the alimenta. The Trajan-and-children design is odd in  and of itself: it features simply Trajan and two children, who, while broadly sym- bolizing the newly-assured prosperity of the Roman people, most likely represent  human recipients of the alimenta program. For the emperor to appear with generic  children that are not his own relatives, the children of vanquished kings, or so on,  was unusual. The more complicated Trajan-and-female figure design adds a per- sonification, and changes the size of the smaller child to almost that of an infant.19  The composition of the female figure with a child standing to her left is also seen  in the traditional personification design; in the latter design, however, the female  holds a cornucopia instead of a second child. Despite the overlap of elements, the Trajanic alimenta coins do not show a  clear chronological progression from simple to more complicated compositions.  Instead the traditional composition centered on a single standing personification  came into play alongside the more populated scenes. There is little denominational  overlap: not only was the Trajan-and-children design reserved for aurei, but it is  also the only design on gold coinage to explicitly mention the alimenta in its leg- end (the related Italia Restituta coinage also appeared on gold; see below). Finally,  no literal depiction of the alimenta program in action, along the lines of the Congi- arium or Imperial Acclamation types, is preserved on coinage. This is all the more  striking, given that a more narrative-driven depiction of the alimenta program is  preserved on the Beneventum Arch (Pl. 14, 3d; see below). 4. Italia Restituta  MIR 349, (352), 366, 367, 368, 369  Aureus, sestertius, dupondius, as, 111 ce Description: This type appeared in only one design. The design had two compo- sitional variants, one of which was a group scene (Pl. 15, 4a). In the basic design,  a frontal, togate Trajan stands to the right, extending his right hand to a kneeling  female figure in flowing drapery. This presumed personification holds a globe and  18 The design appeared on sestertii, dupondii, and asses in early 111 ce (MIR 354, 355,  356; Woytek 2010: 372–373); on sestertii and asses in later 111 ce (MIR 382, 383; Woytek  2010: 385); on sestertii, dupondii, and asses in c. 112–113 ce (MIR 444, 445, 446; Woytek  2010: 411–412); and on denarii of c. 112–113 ce (MIR 395; Woytek 2010: 390).  19 It has been suggested that this type may have been based on a Trajanic statue group,  depicted on the Anaglypha reliefs; see infra n. 65.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="17"> The Emperor in Action 105 in some examples wears a mural crown. She extends her hand to grip Trajan’s.  In the first compositional variant, seen on aurei (MIR 349), a single togate child  stands between the kneeling personification and Trajan, raising two hands to the  emperor. In the second compositional variant, found in the base metals, a smaller  but otherwise identical child stands to the right of the first child.20   Discussion: The Italia Restituta type is obviously related, in terms of conception,  composition, and chronology, to the Alimenta type, particularly the design incor- porating Trajan, the female figure, and the two children. Both types celebrate Tra- jan’s personal active interest in Italy, and the children draw special attention to his  concern for Italy’s future. The close relationship between the types is particularly  apparent in MIR 352, most likely a mistake, where the Italia Restituta design is  combined with the legend ALIM ITAL in ex. 5. Trajan and Armenia MIR 590 Sestertius, 20 February 116–August 117 ce  Description: This type appeared in one design, with three compositional variants  (Pl. 16, 5). In the basic design, a frontal Trajan in military dress stands in the  center, holding a parazonium and lance. His head is turned towards two figures  seated on the ground. The one closest to Trajan is a heavily draped female wearing  a tall crown. Her legs are stretched forward in front of Trajan’s, and her left arm  falls behind her. The other seated figure, a half-nude bearded male, leans back  against a water jug and holds a reed. Across from the two figures, also facing  Trajan, lounges a nearly identical half-nude bearded male, also with a water jug  and reed. The legend identifies the figures as Armenia and the river gods of the  Tigris and Euphrates.21  The three compositional variations are distinguished by Trajan’s pose and the  direction of Armenia’s gaze (Woytek 2010: 478):  (a) Compositional Variation 1: Trajan stands in three-quarter view facing left  (Pl. 16, 5a). He holds the lance in his left hand and the parazonium in his  right. His right foot is raised and steps firmly on the legs of Armenia. Arme- nia sits oriented to the right and looks up at Trajan. (b) Compositional Variation 2: Trajan stands in three-quarter view facing right  (Pl. 16, 5b). He holds the lance in his right hand and the parazonium in his  left. His left foot is raised and steps firmly on the legs of Armenia. Armenia  sits oriented to the right. She looks either directly in front of her or behind  her at the river god. 20 MIR 366, 367, 368, 369.  21 ARMENIA ET MESOPOTAMIA IN POTESTATEM P R REDACTAE.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="18"> 106 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill (c) Compositional Variation 3: Trajan stands frontal in classic contrapposto pose,  his weight on his right leg and his glance firmly to the right (Pl. 16, 5c). He  holds the lance in his right hand and the parazonium in his left. His left foot  rests on Armenia, although the positioning of the leg is awkward. Armenia  sits oriented to the left. She looks dejectedly downwards and holds her head  in her right hand. Discussion: This design is related to two earlier Trajanic designs. Both of the earlier  designs feature a figure, either Trajan or Pax, standing in three-quarter view facing  left, with the left hand raised holding an object (a lance for Trajan and cornucopia  for Pax), and right leg striding on a protome of Dacia.22 The examples with Trajan  resemble Compositional Variation 1 very closely. Woytek has shown as well that  the Trajanic type clearly is based on a Domitianic predecessor (BMC 298), which  shows Domitian in military garb with parazonium and lance, his foot on a reclin- ing river god (presumably the Rhine) (Woytek 2005: 224–226). The later Trajan  and Armenia type, coming at the end of Trajan’s reign, takes this central motif of a  figure treading on an enemy and complicates the design, expanding the (literally)  downtrodden enemy to include a full figure of Armenia, and adding the additional  figures of the river gods. This same motif of an emperor striding on a defeated enemy can be seen most  famously in a statue of Hadrian found at Ierapetra in Crete, now in Istanbul. In- deed, several elements of the latest numismatic design lend it a statuary feel, not  least the classic contrapposto stance of Compositional Variation 3, which obviously  evokes famous statue types. There is no need, however, to reconstruct an actual  Trajanic statuary group as a direct model. In the first place, there are no statue  bases shown on the coins, in contrast to several other Trajanic types. Secondly, the  important variations in the poses of both Trajan and Armenia, the two main fig- ures, suggest that the production team was not copying a model directly.23 Thirdly,  the design has clear numismatic predecessors. The Trajanic design, then, should  be seen as a numismatic phenomenon, showing experimentation within new freer  parameters for the numbers of figures that could be included in reverse designs. 22 The design featuring Trajan appeared on aurei (MIR 180) and sestertii (MIR 181) in c.  103–104 ce (Woytek 2010: 273). The design showing Pax was more popular; it appeared on  denarii (MIR 194, c. 103–105 ce), aurei (MIR 200, c. 104/105–107 ce and later), dupondii  (MIR 206, c. 104/105–107 ce and later), and asses (MIR 207, c. 104/105–107 ce and later).  In one variant (some examples of MIR 200), there is a tropaeum to the right of Pax (Woytek  2010: 288–289).  23 These are not minor variations, since elements such as whether or not Trajan was em- phatically striding on Armenia, and where the captured province was looking, would pre- sumably be crucial components of any theoretical statue group’s composition, message, and  affect (although these three components need not necessarily be successfully integrated, or  apparent to the coin production team).  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="19"> The Emperor in Action 107 II.2. Designs with mounted emperor  6. Adventus MIR 259, 260 AR multiplum, Æ medallion, c. 106–107 ce  Description: The adventus type appears in one basic design under Trajan (Pl. 17, 6a).  The center of the composition is taken up by a mounted Trajan, in military dress  and holding a lance. His horse strides to the right with one foreleg raised. In front  of the horse is a draped female figure, probably Felicitas,24 holding a cornuco- pia and caduceus(?). She moves forward to the right while looking back towards  Trajan. In the foreground to the left of the horse is Mars,25 a striding nude figure  holding a spear and shield. Two armored soldiers can be seen between Mars and  Trajan and behind the horse. Discussion: The adventus numismatic type was a Trajanic invention. In monumen- tal reliefs, the earlier Domitianic (?) Cancelleria Relief A preserves a broadly simi- lar composition to that of the Trajanic numismatic type, in that it features Mars  and a female divine figure moving to one side in companionship with the emperor.  In the relief, however, the emperor is not mounted, and there is no (preserved)  legend to specify the subject.26 The numismatic adventus design was, therefore,  novel, at least as far as we can tell from extant evidence.  Under Trajan the adventus type appears on one small group of multipla and  medallions, celebrating Trajan’s adventus from the Second Dacian War. The design  seems to have been created specifically for these presentation pieces and does not  appear on any regular Roman denominations. The brief production of this type  is surprising, given the subject’s later prominence in Trajanic monumental reliefs  (see below). On Trajanic coins the basic composition was given over to the profec- tio scene (Pl. 18, 7), which would be more popular. 24 For identification of this figure as Felicitas, see Strack 1931: No. 118; Mattingly 1936:  68; Koeppel 1969: 182; Woytek 2010: 322.  25 Strack (1931: No. 118) and Mattingly (1936: 68) group the figure with the other sol- diers. Woytek (2010: 120, 322) sees this figure as Mars.  26 The topics of the Cancelleria Reliefs are debated extensively, and no interpretation has  gained broad consensus. Based on its emphasis on movement, Relief A is generally thought  to show either an adventus or a profectio. For interpretations of Relief A as commemorating  an adventus, see Magi 1945; Simon 1960; Hölscher 1992; Fehr 1998; Baumer 2007; 2008; for  a profectio, see Toynbee 1957; Koeppel 1969: 138–44; 1984: 29; Hannestad 1986: 132–39. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="20"> 108 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill 7. Profectio MIR 430, 486, 496, 508, 515 Aureus and sestertius, October 113–early 115 ce (maximum span) Description: The Profectio type appears in one basic design under Trajan, with two  compositional variants (Pl. 18, 7). As for the Adventus design, the center of the  profectio composition is dominated by Trajan in military dress with lance, mount- ed on a horse that strides to the right with one foreleg raised. To the right in front  of the horse stands a male figure, probably Mars, given his greater scale, open  composition, and position set off from the other figures, a position formally held  by a personification in the Adventus design27 His head is turned back towards  Trajan. The figure wears armor and carries a lance across his body and a round  shield behind him. To the left of the horse is a group of armored soldiers facing  right. In the first compositional variant, found on the earliest examples (MIR 430),  two soldiers follow the horse; in the second compositional variant (Pl. 18, 7),28 one  soldier directly follows the horse, with two soldiers behind the body of the horse. Discussion: The Profectio numismatic type was also a Trajanic invention. Unlike  the Adventus type, a profectio scene appeared on two major denominations, one  gold and one base metal, and was in production for several years. The Profectio  design also differs from its adventus predecessors in the substitution of a male  figure for a female figure leading the emperor. The profectio scene would go on to  be popular on the Column of Trajan as well. II.3. Designs with suggestus  8. Adlocutio MIR 11, 43 Sestertius, January–Fall 98 ce Description: The adlocutio type appears in two designs in the Trajanic period. In  the first design, produced briefly from January–February 98 ce (MIR 11), Trajan  stands in a dynamic pose on a low platform on the right (Pl. 18, 8a). He wears mili- tary dress and holds a lance in his left hand, with his right hand raised and his right  leg slightly behind him. Behind him, also on the podium, is a second standing  figure in military dress, probably an officer. A group of four soldiers stands to the  left, looking up at the emperor. The soldiers wear helmets and hold long shields;  two standards can be seen in the background above the soldiers. 27 For identifications of this figure as a soldier, without discussion of Mars, see Mattingly  and Sydenham 1926: 262; Strack 1931: 218, no. 208; Mattingly 1936: 102–103; Koeppel  1969: 180; Woytek 2010: 406, 431, 436. Dr. Woytek (personal communication) now accepts  this figure as Mars.  28 MIR 486, 496, 508, 515.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="21"> The Emperor in Action 109 In the second design, produced from February–fall 98 ce (MIR 43), Trajan and  an attendant again stand on a low platform, but this time on the left (Pl. 18, 8b).  Trajan does not hold a lance and neither hand is raised emphatically. The right side  of the composition is taken up by two soldiers, again helmeted, holding shields  and facing up towards Trajan, with standards in the background. In this design, a  horse, meant to evoke the cavalry, has been added to the group. Between Trajan  and the soldiers are two figures (one of them certainly a lictor, standing in front of  the podium facing the soldiers). These figures are on a smaller scale and may be  meant to be in the background. Discussion: The Adlocutio type is one of the few group scenes to appear on impe- rial reverses before the Trajanic period. While broadly similar, the two Trajanic  designs depicting an adlocutio nevertheless show significant differences: in the  emperor’s stance (dynamic vs. static); in the number of soldiers; in the inclusion of  a lictor; and in the inclusion of a horse. This is especially interesting considering  the short chronological gap between the two designs. Trajanic adlocutio scenes  appear exclusively on coins from the first year of Trajan’s reign. This brief appear- ance of the subject is striking, given the later importance of adlocutio scenes on the  Column of Trajan (Baumer 1991). 9. Congiarium MIR 64, 160, 312 Sestertius, fall 98–108 ce Description: The Congiarium type appears in two designs that share several ele- ments. The focal point of both designs is two large podia (Pl. 21, 9a, 9b). Trajan,  togate, is seated on a sella curulis on the right podium, facing left with his right  arm outstretched. On the left podium, two figures, one seated (henceforth Figure  A) and one standing (Figure B), face a third figure who approaches via a stairway/ ladder (Figure C). Figure A, probably an official, leans forward with a stylus. Fig- ure B holds up a board or plaque-like object, usually interpreted as a tessera or  some sort of counting device. There has been little consensus as to whom Figure  B represents.29  In the first design (MIR 64, fall–end 98 ce), the two podia are clearly separated  (Pl. 21, 9a). Figure A and Figure B are joined on the left podium by an additional  standing figure, who holds out the fold of his toga to receive a donation (Figure D).  Figure C is below, his hands engaged in his task of climbing. Trajan is on a much  29 Suggested identifications of Figure B in the Trajanic coins include: a tablifer with a  tessera (Strack 1931, 88; Woytek 2010: 220, 265, 349); “statue of Liberalitas” (Mattingly  and Sydenham 1926: 277 [RIC 450/MIR 160]); “Liberalitas standing, holding abacus in r.  hand” (Mattingly 1936: 147; see also 161); “statue of Libertas” (possibly a typo, Mattingly  and Sydenham 1926: 272 [RIC 380/MIR 64]); Liberalitas explicitly as personification (Ham- mond 1953: 158).   ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="22"> 110 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill larger scale than the other four figures; he and his podium are large and clearly  dominate the scene, taking up approximately half of the composition and leaving  the other four smaller figures markedly cramped. In the second design (MIR 160, first half of 103? ce; MIR 312, second half  107–108 ce), the two podia are now adjacent, although the podium beneath Tra- jan is still differentiated by its slightly greater height (Pl. 21, 9b). Figure A and Fig- ure B are on the left podium, but Figure D has been omitted. Figure C takes over  the supplicant’s role by holding out his toga. A tall tripod, set on the left podium,  forms a longitudinal axis for the scene and clearly separates Trajan from the rest  of the composition. The tripod may indicate location, since earlier examples of  congiarium coins under Nero (e.g. BMC 138, 140; Pl. 22, 9c–d) and Nerva (BMC  87) feature a figure of Minerva in this position. Trajan is again on a significantly  larger scale than the other figures. Discussion: The Congiarium type had been introduced under Nero, with signifi- cant variation (see below). Under Trajan, in contrast, the type shows consider- able continuity over time in its basic composition and constituent elements. At  the same time, there is a clear compositional evolution, with general movement  towards consolidation, simplification of composition and narrative, and clarity.  More room is given over to the action on the left podium, and the number of sup- plicants is reduced. 10. Circus Maximus MIR 182 Sestertius, c. 103–104 ce Description: The subject of the Circus Maximus restorations appears in one group  scene design (Pl. 22, 10a). To the right, a togate Trajan stands on a small, low po- dium with his right arm outstretched. Another attending figure, slightly shorter,  stands behind him. Below the emperor to the left is a crowd of four standing togate  figures; the crowd members all look up towards Trajan and raise their hands. The  closest figure to Trajan also holds a scroll. The outstretched hands of both Trajan  and crowd are isolated clearly in the central open field of the design. The meta of  the circus, represented by three pillars, rises to the left of the crowd. Below and  slightly in front of the crowd lounges a bearded personification, presumably the  spirit of the circus, resting on a wheel.  Discussion: Under Trajan, two separate, contemporaneous designs commemorat- ed the restoration of the Circus Maximus (Pls. 22–23, 10a–b). Only one of these  designs (MIR 182) was a group scene. The other design (MIR 175, c. 103–104 ce)  shows a detailed aerial view of the Circus Maximus building, complete with monu- mental arches, temple, and spina (Pl. 23, 10b). Woytek has shown that the two  circus designs are connected through at least one obverse die link (Woytek 2010,  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="23"> The Emperor in Action 111 pl. 142). Thus two very different approaches towards commemorating the same  topic were in operation at one and the same time. It may be that the group scene  type commemorated a particular event associated with the restorations, while the  more typical building design commemorated the restorations in general. If so, this  would be an interesting experiment in moving beyond commemorating the physi- cal restorations of a building, towards immortalizing an associated event. The mix- ing of human and divine figures is also intriguing. 11. Rex Parthus MIR: 431, 498, 509, 516, 551 Aureus and sestertius, late 113–beginning 116 ce (maximum span) Description: This type appeared in one basic design, with compositional variation  (Pl. 23, 11a). The basic design depicts the Parthian King of Armenia presenting his  diadem to a seated Trajan, in the presence of the Roman army. Trajan, in military  dress, is seated on a sella castrensis on a podium to the right. His feet are set apart  on a stool, his right hand outstretched. Behind him stands an official, also in mili- tary dress. Directly in front of the podium, at the center of the design, is the Parthi- an king, shown in profile with his knees bent slightly and his hands outstretched  to Trajan’s feet. Behind the king, seen between the king’s hands and emperor’s feet,  stands a lictor with fasces, his back to the podium. Filling in the rest of the design  behind and to the left of the king are five to six soldiers, facing Trajan. They wear  full armor and hold shields, spears, and three standards. The main differences between this design’s compositional variants have to do  with the relative compression of the design. The first compositional variant fol- lows the basic design just outlined and was seen on both aurei and sestertii.30 The  second compositional variant appeared only on sestertii (MIR 509) and features a  larger podium, a larger Trajan, larger lictor and attendant, and more open space  (Pl. 23, 11a). The lictor is turned outward, clarifying his identity. As a result of  these changes the design is clearer, taking advantage of the larger flan size. The ex- aggerated discrepancy in scale and size of the emperor and his attendant, however,  decreases the sense of realism.  Discussion: This design apparently commemorates a very specific historical event,  namely the subjugation of the Parthian king of Armenia before Trajan.31 The de- sign does so in a highly historicizing manner, creating a sense of realism that is  nevertheless undermined by subtle distinctions in scale. The primary components  creating this sense of realism are the inclusion of the soldiers and lictor, which  emphasize Trajan’s camaraderie with the army. At the same time, these elements  complicate the design. As seen below, this sort of complicated design would not  30 Aurei: MIR 431, 498, 516; sestertii: MIR 551.  31 See e.g., Cassius Dio 68,19,2f; Beckmann 2009: 149–150; Woytek 2010: 142.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="24"> 112 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill be repeated in the later commemoration of a similar event, the crowning of the  Arsacid King of Parthia (Rex Parthis Datus, MIR 594; Pl. 23, 11b), which features  a more open, clearer composition. 12. Imperial Acclamation MIR: 497, 548, 549 Aureus, sestertius, summer 114–beginning 116 ce (maximum span) Description: This type appears in only one basic design, with compositional vari- ants (Pl. 25, 12a). Trajan, in military dress, is seated on a sella castrensis on a large  podium to the left, his right hand outstretched. Two officials in military dress join  Trajan on the podium; one stands at the emperor’s back to the left, and the other  stands in the background to the right, appearing over the emperor’s outstretched  hand. This latter figure sometimes holds a scroll. A much smaller figure, a lictor  with fasces, stands on the ground with his back to the podium. A group of soldiers  stands to the right of the lictor, looking up at the emperor. They raise their hands in  the air towards Trajan’s own outstretched hand, with their hands isolated and seen  clearly in the center of the composition in the space between soldiers and podium.  The soldiers wear helmets and hold long shields. In the middle of the soldiers is  the forepart of a horse, as on the Adlocutio design. Standards can be seen in the  background above the soldiers. The primary compositional variations in the basic design are in (a) the num- ber of soldiers (5 to 6); (b) the number of standards (2 to 3); and the legend. The  first two variations are probably related to the available size of the flan. The last is  related to the imperial acclamation commemorated, which is specified, and the  denomination.32  Discussion: This is the first appearance of an imperial acclamation on a Roman  coin (Woytek 2009: 127). The type, begun on aurei and then continued on ses- tertii, shows the acclamation of Trajan as imperator by the army, and was used  to commemorate the seventh through ninth acclamations. It is not clear why this  subject was introduced only with the seventh acclamation, but it may be related to  a sudden intense interest in all things having to do with the Parthian campaigns  (Beckmann 2009: 149–150; Woytek 2009: 130–131). The introduction of this type under Trajan fits well within a general Trajanic  numismatic trend to emphasize historical events, and to illustrate them directly.33  32 In the aurei (MIR 497) the legend reads IMPERATOR VII in the exergue. In the two  sestertii versions (MIR 548, 549) the legends read IMPERATOR VIII and IMPERATOR VIIII in  the exergue, respectively, with S C below.  33 The Trajanic coins can be compared to a related Augustan type that shows two fig- ures, presumably generals, presenting olive branches to the seated emperor (e.g. BMC 446).  Whatever the exact ritual or occasion portrayed on the Augustan coins (unlike for the Tra- janic coins, there is no specifying legend), the effect is certainly more abstract, and the  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="25"> The Emperor in Action 113 In some respects, the acclamation design is conventional within Trajanic coinage,  since it incorporates several elements from previous adlocutio designs, such as  the emperor (although seated instead of standing), a crowd of soldiers, and the  forequarters of a horse. The theme of harmony between emperor and army is  also conventional. The topic, however, is novel, since it represents not a gift or act  of the emperor to the people, but an act of the people towards the emperor. The  outstretched hands of the emperor and soldiers is a gesture seen in many Trajanic  group scenes, and one that emphasizes both the connection between emperor and  subject, and their respective roles as giver and receiver (e.g. Pl. 13, 3a, 3c and Pl.  14, 4a). In this variation, however, Trajan is the receiver. Despite this role, he still  maintains the dominant visual position traditionally held by the giver; the raised  hands of the soldiers not only fit within the narrative, but also echo the appeals of  the receivers seen in other coin types. The choice of commemorating the imperial  acclamations on coins, and its portrayal in a historical vignette, elevated what had  become an almost routine (and no longer optional) occurrence to the status of an  important event.  13. Regna Adsignata MIR: 531, 550, 564, 593 Aureus, sestertius, winter 114–August 117 ce (maximum span) Description: This type appeared in one design, with two compositional variants  (Pl. 26, 13a). In the basic design, Trajan sits in military dress on a sella castrensis  on a prominent podium, his right hand extended in front of him. Behind him to  the right stands another figure in military dress, probably an officer. A third figure  in military dress, a lictor, stands behind and to the left of Trajan, holding fasces  (not always clear) in his left hand. Three figures stand on the ground in front of  the podium. These three are dressed identically in foreign dress (a long cape and  trousers), and have identical hair styles. The figure closest to Trajan reaches up  with both hands to receive a diadem from the emperor.  The two compositional variants have to do with the position of the lictor’s  right arm. In the aurei examples (MIR 531, 564), the lictor’s arm is generally close  to his side, while in the sestertii examples (MIR 550, 593; Pl. 26, 13a) he extends  his arm more clearly towards the first foreign figure, as if presenting him to Trajan.  This greater clarity of action is probably made possible by the increased flan size.  In some examples of both compositional variants, the lictor holds a staff in his  right hand. Discussion: Like the Rex Parthus and Imperial Acclamation types, this scene com- memorates a specific historic event, namely the allocation of kingdoms by Trajan  emphasis is not on the army as a whole. My thanks to C. Gazdac for bringing this to my  attention.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="26"> 114 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill to eastern client kings. Unlike these other types, however, the design in this case is  much more schematic. The army is represented not by an intricate background of  a crowd of soldiers, but by the attendant and lictor, the latter now on the podium.  This has several effects. The first is of course to increase the clarity of the com- position, although at the expense of a sense of realism. The second is to remove  the common soldier from the representation of the army, which is now presented  through the imperial entourage. The third is to emphasize the distinction between  Romans and foreigners, by moving all Roman actors, even the lowly lictor, to an  elevated position above the client kings.  14. Rex Parthis Datus  MIR: 594 Sestertius, 20 February 116–August 117 ce Description: This type appeared in only one design (Pl. 23, 11b). Trajan, in military  dress, is seated on a sella castrensis, on top of a large podium. He holds a parazo- nium in his left hand and his right hand is outstretched. Behind him stands an  attendant, probably an officer, also in military dress; his pose is dynamic, with his  weight on his left leg and his right leg slightly behind him. In front of and to the  left of the podium, with his back towards the emperor, is an apparently royal fig- ure. The king wears Parthian costume, with a long shirt, trousers, and beard. His  weight is on one leg, and he raises his right arm towards his head, where Trajan  sets a diadem. To the left facing this king kneels the personification of Parthia. She  too wears a long shirt, flowing cloak, trousers, along with a cap, and stretches both  hands towards the king. Discussion: This type commemorates Trajan’s crowning of Parthamaspates, the Ar- sacid King of Parthia (Woytek 2010: 157, 481). The design is interesting, since it  represents a discrete historical event, but in a primarily abstract manner that com- bines purely symbolic elements (the personification, Trajan’s exaggerated scale)  with more prosaic elements (the attendant, the podium). The poses of all figures  are emotive and dynamic, and the realistic detail of an audience (either military  or civil) has been replaced with the abstract element of Parthia. This last feature is  particularly interesting when compared with the related, near contemporaneous  Rex Parthus type (Pl. 23, 11a).  III. Trajanic Group Scenes: Innovations III.1. Numismatic Group Scenes Before Trajan Before Trajan, group scenes in imperial coinage were relatively rare. An extended  survey of all pre-Trajanic group scenes is beyond the scope of this study, but some  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="27"> The Emperor in Action 115 broad observations may be made using the coin catalogs of the British Museum  as a sample.34  The first imperial group scene of note with four or more (non-statuary) fig- ures35 was issued under Caligula. This was the first Adlocutio type:36 it featured a  standing, togate emperor, alone on a podium with a sella castrensis behind him,  addressing a tight group of five small, helmeted soldiers holding shields, swords,  and standards (BMC 33–35; Pl. 19, 8e). The legend—ADLOCVT above and COH in  exergue—made the subject clear. Group scenes were more popular under Nero. An adlocutio design was minted  on sestertii sometime between 64–66 ce (Pl. 20, 8f).37 In this design, the emperor  stands with attendant on a low podium to the right, facing left in contrapposto  pose with his right hand raised. Three soldiers face him in a line; the front two  hold standards and all three wear parazonia. Nero and his attendant are togate. A  building and possibly a camp wall are in the background.38 The design features a  legend of ADLOCVT COH S C. Two separate congiarium designs were also minted under Nero, both on ses- tertii of 64–66 ce.39 In the first design,40 Nero, togate, sits alone on a podium to  the left (Pl. 22, 9c). On a second adjacent podium are Figure A, Figure B,41 and  34 Mattingly 1923; 1930; 1936; 1940. While such an approach may not be exhaustive, it  has the potential to reveal general but important trends.  35 Tiberius issued several designs depicting temples with statuary groups that included  numerous human figures (e.g. BMC 116).  36 This design was minted on sestertii in Rome from 37–38 ce.  37 The design was minted in both Rome (BMC 122–126) and Lugdunum (BMC 303– 304).  38 The nature of this background structure is unclear. A line of columns capped by a  horizontal element can be seen behind the soldiers; a large crescent shape, its line broken  by projections, curves above, following the upper edge of the flan. The scene has been iden- tified as showing an address to the imperial guard, with the building representing part of  the praetorian camp or a building on the Palatine (Mattingly 1923: clxxvi; Mattingly and  Sydenham 1926: 156).  39 Tacitus dates Nero’s first congiarium to 57 ce, and the relative chronology of the two  designs is unclear (Mattingly 1923, clxxvii). This is in part due to debate over the authentic- ity of some legends (CONG I vs. CONG II etc.) and which event(s) are shown on which coin  types (Mattingly 1923: clxxvii, 261). Mattingly (1923: clxxvii) also sees the two designs as  commemorating two different kinds of donation, specifically one of money (Types D1 and  C1) and grain (Types D2 and C2), as indicated by the horrea (his interpretation) in the  background of the latter types.  40 e.g. BMC 136–138 (“Rome, Type D1”) and BMC 308–309 (“Lugdunum, Type CI”); RIC  Type 8.  41 Figure B is interpreted in this case by Mattingly (1923: 224) as “a figure of Liberali- tas standing right...holding up tessera;” see also Mattingly and Sydenham 1926: 156; Uzzi  2005: 35.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="28"> 116 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill a large figure of Minerva (perhaps indicating locality or the event’s patroness),42  with Figure C and a male child below and in front. The second design43 shows  Nero again togate and seated on a podium, but this time the podium is lower and  to the right, and an attendant Figure E44 stands behind the emperor (Pl. 22, 9d).  In front of the podium stands Figure D, who faces a variation on Figure B, who  maintains a raised right arm holding a plaque, but this time features a short tunic  and a wide stance.45 In the background are a standing Minerva and a schematically  rendered structure. Thus not only are the two Neronian congiarium designs early  group scenes, but they represent two clearly differentiated approaches to depicting  the same type of event. This is in striking contrast to the standardization that this  type would undergo in subsequent years. Group scenes were also issued in Galba’s name. One remarkable design (BMC  205) depicted a triumphal arch with three prisoners and a marshal processing be- neath it. Another elaborate design (BMC 249) presented an adlocutio: the emperor  in military dress stands with an attendant on a podium, facing a crowd of soldiers  with standards and a single horse (Pl. 21, 8g). This design is notable not only as the  first adlocutio to depict the emperor in military dress, but also for its close compo- sitional connections to the later Trajanic designs. Even Vitellius managed to issue a  coin type with a group scene design: a togate Vitellius, seated on a podium, grasps  the hand of one of three togate citizens, with a seated attendant in the background  (BMC 49). Group scenes continued to grow in popularity under the Flavians, culminat- ing in the famous ludi saeculares coins of Domitian (BMC 419–438), an apparently  coherent commemorative set that included group scene designs and depicted vari- ous imperial religious performances associated with the most recent ludi. Accord- ing to M. G. Sobocinski, under Domitian the ludi base metal coins were meant to  document and demonstrate the emperor’s religious activities and careful fulfill- ment of his duties in Rome (Sobocinski 2006).46 By the time of the Flavians, then,  the general numismatic foundation had been laid for the use of group scenes in  the Trajanic period. Nevertheless, what would be seen under Trajan would be truly  remarkable. Group scene compositions on coins were not a Trajanic invention, but  they would become a truly Trajanic phenomenon.  42 For discussion of the possible meanings of this figure, see Mattingly 1923: clxxviii.  43 e.g. BMC 139–141 (“Rome, Type D2”) and BMC 310 (“Lugdunum, Type C2”); RIC  Type 9.  44 Figure E is interpreted by Mattingly (1923: 225) as the praefectus annonae.  45 Figure B in this case is interpreted by Mattingly (1923: 225) simply as “attendant... holding out tessera to citizen.” (see also Mattingly and Sydenham 1926: 156).  46 Sobocinski (2006) outlines a difference in denominations for the Domitianic ludi  saeculares coins, with aurei and denarii types recreating Augustan symbolic ludi saecula- res designs, and base metal types representing Domitian sacrificing at various locations  throughout Rome.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="29"> The Emperor in Action 117 III.2. Trajanic Group Scenes: Chronology and Development The group scenes of the Trajanic period threw open the door to numerous new  possibilities for what could be depicted on Roman coin reverses. Not all of these  possibilities came into being immediately. The first three group scenes to appear— the adlocutio, military oath, and congiarium scenes—were exactly those that had  established precedents (Table 1, above). None of these types differed greatly from  their predecessors. Yet the trend towards additional and complicating details was  already there in nascent form. While the first Adlocutio design is relatively simple,  inspired by the Caligulan example (BMC 33–35), the second Trajanic Adlocutio  design is already more complicated, following more elaborate designs such as  those of Galba (BMC 249) (Pl. 18, 8a–b; Pl. 19, 8e; Pl. 21, 8g). The trends introduced in the early group scene types do not follow a simple,  uninterrupted pattern to culminate, for example, in the complicated, historicizing  Imperial Acclamation sestertii. In the first place, there was a significant time lapse  between the introduction of the initial three group scenes (all between January  and the end of 98 ce) and the introduction of the next group scene coinage in the  first half of 103 ce. Furthermore, two of the first three Trajanic group scene types,  the Adlocutio and Military Oath, would not be repeated in Trajan’s coinage, despite  the subjects’ popularity in other periods.  When group scenes appeared again, in early 103 ce, it was in the well- established Congiarium type, the only original group scene to continue past  this initial period. This type, however, had undergone substantial compositional  modifications (Pl. 21, 9a–b). The second design had a greater sense of realism  and added the (possibly) localizing detail of a tripod. The next group scene to  materialize was the Circus Maximus group scene, a truly innovative composition  that combined the basic elements of adlocutio scenes (standing emperor  and attendant on podium with crowd below) with localizing elements and a  personification. Before this type, historical events represented on coinage had  primarily been repeated imperial actions. The renovations of the Circus Maximus,  in contrast, presumably were not meant to be repeated any time soon. The fact  that the group scene design appears alongside the sort of building design that  traditionally monumentalized architectural dedications or renovations seems  to stress the group scene’s connection to a one-time imperial celebration. A  precedent had been set in expanding the types of imperial actions that could be  commemorated and depicted in coinage. The second Congiarium and Circus Maximus designs ushered in a second pe- riod in group scene compositions, lasting from 103 to c. 109/110 ce. This period  is characterized by further experimentation with group scenes, introducing new  types while still maintaining relatively simple designs. The introduction of the Ad- ventus type in 107 ce produced another type that commemorated a (potentially  recurrent) imperial event. The design of this type was relatively uncomplicated,  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="30"> 118 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill but did incorporate repeated, undifferentiated figures, previously seen in the sol- diers of adlocutio scenes and now seen in the soldiers following Trajan’s horse. Like  the Circus type, this design celebrating a historical event included a personifica- tion. The topic of the adventus did not appear in standard denominations, and this  topic, if not the design, would not be repeated under Trajan. The third period in group scene compositions was confined to the years 111– 113 ce and was characterized by group scenes featuring children and celebrating  Trajan’s promotion of the alimenta program. This topic was a natural for group  scenes, since the program targeted children, and pairs of children were an estab- lished symbol of fecundity and imperial providential concern for the realm’s fu- ture. At the same time, the marriage of multiple figures and the alimenta should  not be taken for granted, as illustrated by the popular contemporary personifica- tion type, where for whatever reason the personification was only presented with  a single child (Pl. 13, 3b). The fourth period, from the beginning of the Parthian campaign in late 113  ce, to as late as the beginning of 116 ce, may be considered the heyday of group  scenes. This period saw the greatest number of new types created, and these new  types were more revolutionary in their composition and content. The group scenes  of this period primarily deal with the army and the Parthian war, and began with  the revival of the Adventus design, modified to include only male figures, to com- memorate a profectio. The primary innovation of the beginning of this period was  the Rex Parthus type (Pl. 23, 11a). The design for this subject achieved new levels  in terms of both the number of figures included (nine) and the sense of realism.  The effect is almost photographic, and is reminiscent of monumental reliefs. One  must never confuse effect and actual accuracy, however. What is presented was an  idealized interaction between emperor, army, and foreign powers. What was new  was the approach and sophistication of that message’s numismatic presentation. This sort of historicizing presentation was undertaken again in this period in  the Imperial Acclamation type. By the introduction of the Regna Adsignata type  (winter 114–beginning of 116 ce), however, the move had already begun towards  simplified, more schematic and symbolic types with clearer compositions, from  which the undifferentiated army had been excised (Pl. 26, 13a). Throughout this  period, however, the complicated historicizing vignettes continued to be issued,  along with more generally symbolic (Profectio) group scenes. The three group scene types certainly (re)issued in the final, brief period of  group scenes (20 February 116–c. Fall 117 ce) showed a preference for more  schematic, symbolic representations. The Trajan and Armenia type is of course  purely symbolic, although still taking advantage of the greater possible numbers  of figures. The Regna Adsignata type was already in circulation and was the most  historicizing of the three types appearing in the latest period. The Rex Parthis  Datus type, in contrast, took a more symbolic approach to its subject (Pl. 23, 11b).  Rather than showing logistical aspects of a commemorated event, the design  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="31"> The Emperor in Action 119 focused on the symbolic importance. Although this approach clearly was different  from that of the more literal Rex Parthus type, the two designs’ compositions were  similar (Pl. 23, 11–b): both featured a seated Trajan on a suggestus interacting with  a central foreign figure in an unusual pose, with a prominent audience rounding  out the composition. The Rex Parthis Datus type’s composition, however, replaced  the Rex Parthus’ watching army, a literal audience, with the symbolic audience of  Parthia.  To take all this as definitive evidence for a return to symbolic, simplified com- positions is perhaps misleading: chronological control of the production dates of  many coin types is not secure enough to rule out their reissue as late as 116 ce,  and the period obviously was brought to an arbitrary close by Trajan’s death. Nev- ertheless, the evidence as we have it points, however vaguely, to a trend towards  simplified, symbolic compositions. It is interesting to note that the more compli- cated group scenes appear at approximately the same time as the dedication of the  Column of Trajan in 113 ce. This significance of this coincidence will be taken up  below. III.3. Crowd Scenes and Imperial Interactions One of the most striking features of Trajanic coinage is the frequency and prom- inence of crowd scenes, defined here as scenes involving three or more figures  that are indistinguishable in terms of their identity. Eight different types take the  form of crowd scenes.47 Such repeated, nearly identical figures borrow a technique  from painting and sculpted friezes, where such figures were used to represent large  numbers of individuals. In addition to metonymy, the crowd scenes of the Trajanic  period drastically expanded the number of figures that could be included in a  single numismatic scene. The use of crowds in a design furthers the impression  that the design realistically depicts an actual event, by highlighting one of the most  important features—indeed, in some ways the raison d’être—of imperial events:  the audience.  While not an invention of the Trajanic period, the inclusion of crowds in so  many Trajanic types meant that new numismatic emphasis was placed on repre- sentations of Roman citizens. These were not a representative cross-section of the  population of the Roman Empire: in six out of eight crowd scenes, the crowd is  made up of legionary soldiers, and in the one crowd scene involving civilians the  civilians are clearly togate (i.e. citizens). This is not surprising, however. In Rome,  these were the people that mattered.  47 Crowd scenes, with the number of undifferentiated figures given in parentheses: Adlo- cutio (4); Military Oath (4); Circus Maximus (4); Adventus (3); Profectio (3); Imperial Ac- clamation (5–6); Rex Parthus (4–5); Regna Adsignata (3). It is possible that the three foreign  kings in the last type are meant to be identifiable as historic individuals. An identification  cannot be made from numismatic evidence alone, however.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="32"> 120 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill The subjects of the Trajanic group scenes can be roughly divided into two  broad themes: Trajan interacting with the civilian population, and Trajan interact- ing with the army. A subset of the latter theme is Trajan interacting with foreign  powers in a military context. These two main divisions, between civilian and mili- tary contexts, are distinguished carefully, not only by subject but also by details  such as Trajan’s dress and type of seat.  In the civilian designs, all male human figures, including Trajan, are shown  togate. This is most obvious in the congiarium designs, where Figures C or D hold  out a toga to receive the imperial gift. In the two designs where Trajan is shown  seated, his chair is the sella curulis. These types are set, therefore, within a specifi- cally civilian context. With the exception of the Oath Scene type, where religious  concerns would have precluded any other form of costume, Trajan wears military  dress for all types dealing with the army. His seat is also specifically marked as a  sella castrensis, a throne type used in the field and also seen several times on the  Column of Trajan (e.g. Scene VI, XLIV; Pl. 27, 13b). These elements, along with  the presence of armed soldiers, make clear that the events depicted take place out- side of Rome, in a military context. Four group scene types show Trajan interacting with civilian populations.  Three out of four reference specific imperial benefactions (Alimenta, Congiarium,  and Circus Maximus), while the Italia Restituta type is more general. Two of these  types (Congiarium and Circus Maximus) certainly reference events in Rome, while  the other two types specifically reference activities outside of Rome. In all of these  types, Trajan acts as a paternal figure, taking care for the physical welfare of his  subjects. Eight types show Trajan interacting with the army. Four of these types refer to  unique historical events, namely Trajan’s interactions with foreign powers. All but  the last of these types (Rex Parthis) include ordinary soldiers in the design. The  number of ordinary soldiers (not counting attendants or lictors) in a design varies  from one to an impressive six. The cavalry, signified by a horse, is sometimes high- lighted, although auxiliaries are not specifically differentiated. The theme of Trajan  interacting directly with the army thus was stressed repeatedly through eight dif- ferent coin types stretching from the beginning to the end of Trajan’s reign, with  types emphasizing the role of the army becoming more numerous and frequent  towards the end of Trajan’s reign. IV. Trajanic Group Scenes in Coinage and Monumental  Reliefs The Trajanic period is a particularly fruitful area for the study of monumental  reliefs, with numerous well preserved monuments extant and available for close  comparison. Three of these monuments will be discussed in this article: the  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="33"> The Emperor in Action 121 Column of Trajan, dedicated in 113 ce48 in the Forum of Trajan to celebrate Trajan’s  victories in the two Dacian Wars; the Beneventum Arch, set up in 114 ce outside  of Beneventum to commemorate the inauguration of the new Via Traiana between  Brundisium and Rome; and the Great Trajanic Frieze, a monument whose exact  date and original location in Rome is unknown, but which must have once been  part of a major architectural complex (an 18 m section is preserved in four parts  in the Arch of Constantine in Rome).49 As the previous discussion has indicated,  there were numerous important points of correspondence between Trajanic group  scenes in coinage and reliefs. These points of correspondence include scene types,  particular compositions, and themes. IV.1. Specific Points of Correspondence IV.1.1. Scene Types Adlocutiones appear frequently on the Column of Trajan,50 looking very much like  their numismatic predecessors (Pl. 18, 8). These are the first preserved appearanc- es of an adlocutio in monumental relief. Yet after an initial presence in the first year  of Trajan’s reign, this traditional numismatic type disappears from his coinage.  A similar story pertains to sacrifice scenes. Sacrifices appear on the Beneventum  Arch and eight times on the Column of Trajan, in both civilian (e.g. Beneventum  Arch east passageway, Column of Trajan Scene LXXXVI) and military contexts  (e.g. Column of Trajan Scene VIII) (Pl. 11, 1c and Pl. 12, 1d). The later popularity  of the subject in Trajanic monumental reliefs is striking, given that the topic was  produced on coins only for a few months, before Trajan even returned to Rome. Not surprisingly, the compositions, if not the popularity, of adlocutio and  sacrifice scenes are similar for both media. Other scene types also appear in  both coins and relief, but the approaches to the same subject are different. The  Beneventum Arch depicts Trajan’s adventus into Rome, but while the adventus  scene on coins was in a military context with soldiers and showed the emperor  mounted, on the arch the emperor is togate and enters the city, indicated by  architecture and personifications, on his own two feet (Pl. 17, 6). The adventus  scene on the Great Trajanic Frieze combines the military associations of the coins  with the arch and walking composition of the Beneventum Arch. A passageway  panel on the Beneventum Arch commemorates the alimenta, but the scene has  more of a sense of narrative than do the coins (Pl. 14, 3d). Like the coins, the  sculptural scene employs the motif of symbolic females in the personifications of  Italian cities with mural crowns. But the depiction in relief is also more historicizing  48 In this article I follow the consensus view that the Column of Trajan frieze was effec- tively complete at the time of the monument’s dedication in 113 ce (pace Claridge 1993).  49 Although the bibliography on each of these monuments is extensive, an excellent syn- opsis and discussion of reliefs in the Trajanic period can be found in Hölscher 2002.  50 Scenes X, XXVII, XLII, LIV, LXXIII, CIV, CXXV, CXXXVI; Baumer 1991.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="34"> 122 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill than the coins, since it pairs symbolic female elements with purely human fathers;  in particular, the unpretentious motif of fathers carrying their children on their  shoulders adds lifelike flavor.51  Profectiones and more general scenes of Trajan riding with the army are also  depicted on the Column of Trajan (e.g. Scenes III, LVIII), although depictions of  Trajan mounted are relatively rare on this monument. An imperial acclamation  is depicted on the Column of Trajan at the close of the First Dacian War (Scene  LXXVII; Pl. 26, 12b). This scene at first glance is indistinguishable from other ad- locutio scenes on the Column, with Trajan and attendants standing on a podium  with a group of facing soldiers below. Closer inspection, however, reveals that the  soldiers are bareheaded and in civilian dress, and, most importantly, their hands  are raised (somewhat awkwardly) towards Trajan. In the numismatic example, in  contrast, Trajan is seated and the soldiers are in military dress. Finally, the Column  of Trajan features numerous scenes of enemies being presented before or submit- ting themselves before the emperor (e.g. Scenes XLIV, LXXV), the same broad  subject as the Rex Parthus (Pls. 23–25, 11 and Pl. 27, 13b). IV.1.2. Composition On a basic level, the most obvious similarity between Trajanic reliefs and numis- matic group scenes is the sheer abundance of figures. While large numbers of fig- ures had been a staple of monumental reliefs since at least the Augustan period,  the frequent use of numerous figures was new to imperial coinage. More specifi- cally, however, both Trajanic reliefs and coinage featured large numbers of figures  representing anonymous Romans, particularly soldiers. Previous to the Trajanic  period, the appearance of non-elites in extant monumental reliefs was limited to  generic roles as sacrificial assistants and figures in sacrificial or triumphal proces- sions. This changed drastically in the Trajanic period.  Modern scholars have emphasized how the Column of Trajan acts as a monu- ment to the Roman soldier,52 since over one thousand anonymous soldiers, both  legionaries and auxiliaries, appear on the monument’s frieze. The Great Trajanic  Frieze similarly pairs the emperor with a crowded field of nameless soldiers. The  Column of Trajan also shows numerous examples of the emperor interacting with  crowds of anonymous provincials, frequently sacrificing alongside them (e.g.  Scenes LXXXI–VI). The Beneventum Arch is swimming with packs of anony- mous figures, with a broad range of interactions between emperor and subjects.  Trajan is shown entering Rome among a sea of people (Pl. 17, 6b), receiving mer- chants in a harbor (Pl. 27, 14), and assigning veterans to colonies, among other  51 This motif is also featured in Pliny’s Panegyric, in the context of the congiarium (Pliny,  Pan. 26.1).  52 For an overview of the role of the Roman soldier on the Column of Trajan, see e.g.  Richmond 1982; Coulston 1988; Hölscher 1999; Clarke 2003.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="35"> The Emperor in Action 123 scenes.53 It is instructive to compare the alimenta panel on the Beneventum Arch  to the numismatic representations of the same subject. On the one hand it is not  surprising to see a greater number of figures in the sculptural example, given the  greater space involved. On the other hand, the scene is still crowded with figures,  despite the extended space of the passage relief: Trajan has numerous attendants,  there are more children, and both female and male “parental” figures appear. There were more specific compositional similarities between coins and reliefs  in this period, however, beyond a large number of figures. Adlocutio scenes are  particularly close between sculptures and coins (Pls. 18–20, 8a–d). Scene CIV on  the Column of Trajan even includes a horse among the listening soldiers.54 The  Beneventum Arch features a depiction of Trajan raising a kneeling female per- sonification, surrounded by two water gods (Pl. 15, 4b):55 this combines the theme  and kneeling figure of the Italia Restituta type with the composition (Trajan in  contrapposto stance facing a sunken female and river god, with another river god  behind him) of the Trajan and Armenia type (Pls. 15–16, 4–5). The panel on the  Beneventum Arch commemorating the alimenta employs an identical motif seen  on the coins, of a mother holding a small child while presenting an older child to  the emperor (Pl. 14, 3d). Another scene on the arch, related to Trajan’s concern for  the future of Italy, pairs Trajan with two children of different heights (although the  children face away from Trajan; Pl. 14, 3e).  The motif of the emperor seated on a podium with attendants and crowds in  front appears numerous times on the Column of Trajan (e.g. Scenes VI, LXXV; Pls.  23–24, 11c–e).56 In several examples of this arrangement, foreign powers specifi- cally submit themselves before the elevated Trajan (e.g. Scene LXXV; Pl. 23, 11c,  and Pl. 27, 13b). This motif, combining a seated emperor and crowd, becomes  popular in coins right around the time of the Column’s dedication. This seems an  amazing coincidence, particularly since these types have no clear compositional  precedence, in either coins or monumental reliefs. Any compositional influence between the Column of Trajan and the coins was  certainly not one sided. The adlocutio motif on coins predates the examples of the  same motif on the Column of Trajan. Images on the Column of the emperor riding  53 For the interpretation of the scenes on the Beneventum Arch, see e.g. Hassel 1966;  Fittschen 1972; Rotili 1972; Gauer 1974; Koeppel 1985; Heitz 2005–06; Speidel 2005–06.  54 While the numismatic examples abbreviate the horse by showing only its front half,  Scene CIV includes the full horse, with the forequarters and attendant soldier in similar  positions to their numismatic equivalents. A second horse and soldier fill out the composi- tion to the right and connect Scene CIV to the following scene.  55 There has been no consensus as to the identity of the kneeling personification, and thus  the specific meaning of the scene; Dacia and Mesopotamia, among other solutions, have  both been suggested. See e.g. Fittschen 1972: 759–765; Torelli 1997: 166–167; Simon 1998:  189.  56 As is fitting for the narrative’s setting outside of Rome, in these scenes Trajan is always  in military garb and seated on a sella castrensis. ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="36"> 124 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill with attendants seem very close to designs on earlier adventus and profectio coins.  The design of the emperor seated on a podium not only was most likely inspired by  actual events, but also appeared on congiarium coins before the Column, although  notably on the coins the emperor is alone, togate, and on a sella curulis, not a sella  castrensis. After the Column’s construction, the coins and the monumental reliefs  are particularly close in composition (although as we have seen the imperial ac- clamation is handled somewhat differently between media). What we see in the  Trajanic period in general, then, is apparently a close relationship between coins  and monumental reliefs, with specific compositional elements from one medium  appearing on the other, and vice versa.  IV.1.3. Theme Speaking on the broadest level, the general subjects and themes of Trajanic monu- mental reliefs and coinage are strikingly coincident, even when their approaches  to the same subject are different. The glorification of a particular imperial program  such as the alimenta in both reliefs and coins appears to be unprecedented before  the Trajanic period, although admittedly it is difficult to identify the specific oc- casion of most monumental reliefs. The scene on the Beneventum Arch shows  Trajan raising a kneeling female personification, a topic reminiscent of the Italia  Restituta type (Pl. 15, 4).  Similarly, although numerous military subjects had long been popular  on coins, the Trajanic period was the first time that purely military (i.e. non- triumphal) subjects were depicted frequently in both coins and monumental relief.  The Column of Trajan and the Great Trajanic Frieze were the first (preserved)  major monumental reliefs in Rome to depict soldiers in battle.57 No literal battle  scenes are depicted on coins, but the subject of military action is common to both  coins and relief.  The sculptural illustration of events taking place outside of Rome was unusu- al before the Trajanic period. In Trajanic monumental relief, in contrast, events  outside Rome were depicted frequently. The Beneventum Arch combines events  inside and outside Rome, with those inside Rome placed on the face of the arch  closest to Rome, and events outside Rome on the opposite. The Column of Trajan  depicts a grand journey and war outside of Rome and even the Roman Empire. As  a battle frieze, the Great Trajanic Frieze obviously takes place outside Rome, but  this fact is still underscored by the inclusion of rustic huts in the background. In  terms of numismatic subjects, eight Trajanic group scenes refer to specific events  outside of Rome (compared to five group scenes referring to specific events inside  Rome.)58 In the Trajanic period, therefore, events taking place specifically outside  57 The metope reliefs of the contemporary Tropeum at Adamklissi, admittedly a provin- cial monument but still a major one (Florescu 1965), also consisted primarily of depictions  of ordinary soldiers in battle.  58 Three Trajanic numismatic group scene types refer to specific events inside Rome:  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="37"> The Emperor in Action 125 Rome were becoming frequent for the first time in both monumental reliefs and  coinage. The common theme of Trajanic group scenes was the emperor interacting di- rectly with his subjects. Trajan provided for the future generations of Italy, not  only through the vague idea of imperial providentia, but also through the specific  alimenta program. This program could be expressed, albeit symbolically, by Trajan  giving something to two children. Trajan provided a newly renovated circus for his  people, and the direct interaction of grateful citizens thanking Trajan in that cir- cus was visualized on coins. When Trajan was proclaimed imperator by his loyal  troops, the scene was depicted as a direct interaction between the emperor and his  troops. Even in the more abstract types, the commemorated concept is presented  as an interaction: in the Rex Parthis Datus design, Trajan’s establishment of a rul- ing power friendly to Rome is conceptualized visually as the emperor, seated on a  podium as in the Congiarium designs, giving a gift, in this case a king, to a subject,  in this example a personification standing in for all subjects in Parthia. This theme is also well established in Trajanic monumental reliefs. The Col- umn of Trajan is replete with images showing the interaction of Trajan with his  subjects. Indeed, scholars such as T. Hölscher have shown that the frieze of the  Column of Trajan in fact is made up of a series of “vignettes” that simply repeat  various shared activities between the emperor and his subjects over and over again  to create a sense of narrative, with the occasional specific historical event thrown  in (Hölscher 1991a). On the Column of Trajan, Trajan oversees construction of  fortifications, leads his men in sacrifice, and is welcomed by civilian populations.  He passes judgment on enemies, granting mercy to those that surrender, and per- sonally overseeing the resettlement of others. On the Beneventum Arch, Trajan  sends out colonists, receives the submission of foreigners, and oversees the es- tablishment of the alimenta program. The numismatic evidence thus fits within  a general artistic trend of the period, namely the representation of the emperor  interacting in numerous practical ways with Roman subjects outside of the impe- rial family or even the senatorial class. To summarize, the major innovation of Trajanic group scenes was the in- creased prominence of the ordinary Roman, especially the ordinary Roman sol- dier. The average Roman citizen was more frequently depicted, often in crowds,  and the common theme of the majority of group scenes was his interaction with  the emperor. While some group scenes referred to general, repeated interactions,  such as the adlocutio or sacrifice, more frequent were references to specific pro- grams or events, from individual congiaria or acclamations, to the alimenta pro- Congiarium, Statue Group, and Circus Maximus. Two more group scene types—Adventus  and Profectio—refer to liminal events involving the city. Five group scene types refer to  specific events outside of Rome: Rex Parthus, Imperial Acclamation, Regna Adsignata, Tra- jan and Armenia, and Rex Parthis Datus. Three numismatic group scenes refer to general  events or programs outside of Rome: Adlocutio, Oath Scene, and Alimenta.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="38"> 126 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill gram, to the one-time event of a submission of a particular foreign king. The em- peror interacted with his people, and the coins were there to prove it.  IV.2. Trajanic Group Scenes: Significance If the themes of the emperor interacting with his subjects are already well known  from Trajanic monumental reliefs, what can the study of Trajanic numismatic  group scenes add to our understanding of the period? In the first place, the close  and complex compositional similarities in group scenes on coins and relief call  attention to the complexity of the artistic climate under Trajan. While we cannot  reconstruct the exact artistic connection between the two media, we can see that  clearly there was some connection. This has important implications for how we  view the artistic climate of Trajanic Rome and how we study Trajanic monuments.  The group scenes remind us that we can not study the Column of Trajan and other  sculptural monuments without studying the coins, and we can not study the coins  without studying the sculpture. Furthermore, a comparison between the use of vignettes, illustrated as group  scenes, in both Trajanic monumental reliefs and coins perhaps can help us to un- derstand the artistic traditions in the background of both media. Scholars have  long debated the artistic origins of the Column of Trajan, which seems to spring  ex nihilo from the archaeological record. While the idea of a continuous frieze  was nothing new, the format of an extended series of discrete vignettes strung  together like beads on a string was innovative, at least as far as we can tell from  extant evidence. Scholars have postulated that the Column of Trajan may have  been inspired by triumphal paintings, not a single example of which now sur- vives.59 Literary descriptions of triumphal paintings60 suggest that they were pan- els featuring segmented depictions of individual historical events, similar to the  Column’s vignettes. But the idea of discrete vignette representations of historical  events had also appeared on coinage long before the Column of Trajan. This phe- nomenon was in fact reaching new heights under Trajan’s reign, and the types of  subjects commemorated were expanding, moving beyond generic military events  to specific civilian concerns and unique historical events. This is not to imply that the Column of Trajan frieze is really a series of coin  reverses strung together. In fact, the subjects of the Column of Trajan vignettes  only occasionally coincide with the subjects of coin reverses. But the coins show  that the relationship between the Column of Trajan and triumphal painting, if it  existed, was probably neither unique nor straightforward. It is possible that the  59 For discussion of triumphal paintings in general, see e.g. Holliday 1997; Hölscher 2002:  38, 44; Lusnia 2006. For the influence of triumphal paintings on the Column of Trajan,  see Lehmann-Hartleben 1926: 2, 29; Coulston 1988: 124, 131–132; Settis 1988: 94–96;  Coulston 1990: 295; Hölscher 1991b: 293–294; Coarelli 2000: 11; Koeppel 2002: 248; Beck- mann 2003: 111–113.  60 E.g. Livy 41.28.10, Josephus BJ 7.132–157.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="39"> The Emperor in Action 127 phenomenon of group scenes on coins was inspired by triumphal paintings. By  the Trajanic period, however, this relationship, if it existed, was most likely also  highly complicated and possibly reciprocal. Many of the subjects of the Beneven- tum Arch panels are not military in nature and are unlikely subjects for triumphal  paintings. They have more in common with coin reverses. Yet they share with  the Column of Trajan and the coins the use of vignettes to present the emperor  interacting with his people in discrete, historicizing events. We are witnessing not  a one-to-one correspondence, the transfer of painting to stone, but the spread of  a phenomenon. Understanding the importance of emperor-subject interaction in imperial  monumental relief under Trajan, furthermore, is to understand only one aspect of  a crucial, widespread message. It is well established that in this period relief em- braced the use of vignette compositions to show the emperor interacting directly  with his subjects, taking that idea to new heights in the Column of Trajan. But  it is important to recognize as well that at the same time the same idea was also  reaching new heights in imperial coinage. The message of the emperor directly  connected to his people, and particularly to the army, was pervasive.  We also must take into consideration the architectural activity underway in  this period. The Forum of Trajan was a vast public complex built by the emperor for  his subjects, financed by his personal share of the booty from the Dacian Wars.61  While this much was standard imperial practice at the time, the scale and opulence  of the Forum of Trajan was clearly meant to surpass all such previous benefactions.  Unlike preceding victory complexes, which typically were focused on a central  temple surrounded by a portico,62 the Forum of Trajan added a gigantic basilica,  a non-religious space dedicated to secular interactions between the imperial  apparatus and individual subjects. The Forum also featured particularizing details  such as inscriptions listing and commemorating the individual legions that served  in the Dacian Wars (Meneghini and Santangeli Valenzani 2007: 90). Central  to the complex was the Column of Trajan itself, a memorial to the interaction  between emperor and subject. That memorial, furthermore, featured dozens of  61 For the Forum of Trajan in general, see Zanker 1970; Richardson Jr. 1977a; Packer  1981; 1997a; 1997b; 2004; 2008; Meneghini et al. 1990; Meneghini 1995; 1998; 2001a;  2001b;2007; La Rocca 1998; 2000; Galinier 2007.  62 For Republican victory temple-portico complexes, see e.g. Morgan 1971; Richardson  Jr. 1976; 1977b; Flory 1984; Isager 2006; Gorrie 2007.

The possible location of the so-called Templum Divi  Traiani within the Forum of Trajan complex is much debated, but scholars generally agree  that any temple present did not occupy an exactly analogous position to the temples of  other imperial fora; see e.g. Meneghini 1993; 2001b; 2002; 2007; Ponti 1995; Meneghini et  al. 1996; Packer 1997a; 2003; 2008; La Rocca 1998; 2000; 2004;Gros 2000; 2005; Stamper  2005; Staccioli 2006; Claridge 2007; Galinier 2007.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="40"> 128 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill images of elaborate, sophisticated architecture in towns friendly to the emperor,  demonstrating that loyalty to Trajan would bring architectural benefits even  into the provinces (Wolfram Thill 2010). Finally, this architectural complex was  commemorated extensively in coins, including coins specifically depicting the  Basilica Ulpia.63  Taken together, Trajanic monumental relief, coinage, and architecture present  three intersecting lines of evidence demonstrating a unified theme that empha- sized Trajan’s connections to his people.64 These were not abstract connections,  such as the religious piety of Augustus. These were concrete, often tangible con- nections, forged through practical benefits and actual, unique historical events. V. Conclusion: Group Scenes after Trajan The close interaction between group scenes on coinage and monumental reliefs  apparently was short lived. Historicizing vignettes showing the emperor inter- acting with his subjects continued to be very popular in relief. The Anaglypha  reliefs—of uncertain date but certainly close to, if not from, the Trajanic period— featured a civilian adlocutio scene (Pl. 28, 15a) and what has been interpreted  traditionally as a scene showing the cancelation of debts, a genuinely logistical  interaction between emperor and subjects.65 In addition the Anaglypha adlocutio  takes place in front of what has been argued is a depiction of a statue group com- memorating the alimenta, with a seated emperor facing a standing woman who  holds a child in one arm and (presumably) guides another standing child with her  free left hand, in a layout identical to Trajanic coins (Pl. 13, 3a and Pl. 28, 15b).66  A panel from the Hadrianic Arco di Portgallo shows another civilian adlocutio  (Koeppel 1986, 40–42; VanderLeest 1995). A relief from the late Hadrianic or early  Antonine period and now in the Museo del Palazzo dei Conservatori in Rome  preserves an adventus scene very similar to that of the Beneventum Arch (Koeppel  1969, 156–158): the emperor is greeted by Roma and other symbolic figures, but  is also accompanied by generic humans. The Column of Marcus Aurelius adopted,  but also adapted, the Column of Trajan’s basic layout of historicizing vignettes: the  63 E.g. MIR 398, 403, 409, 424, 425, 465, 472, 473. Basilica Ulpia coins: MIR 399, 404,  464.  64 Although this is not the proper venue for a full exploration of this subject, it is worth  noting that this same theme of practical connection between emperor and subject can be  found throughout Pliny’s Panegyric. In particular, the image of an emperor surrounded by  subjects with easy access to the imperial presence is emphasized to a striking degree (see  e.g. 48.2: scis enim sibi quemque praestare, quod te videat, quod te frequentet: ac tanto libera- lius ac diutius voluptatis huius copiam praebes). 65 For the Anaglypha reliefs, see e.g. Hammond 1953; Torelli 1982: 89–118; Pollini 1983;  Smith 1983; Koeppel 1986: 17–24.  66 For full discussion see Hammond 1953. The Anaglypha reliefs are of uncertain date,  and, while possible, it is not definitive that they depict a historical statue group, from or  after the Trajanic period.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="41"> The Emperor in Action 129 battle scenes are more drawn out and there are fewer “vignettes” than in the later  monument (Balty 2000; Beckmann 2011). The most famous examples of this vignette phenomenon are the Marcus Au- relius Panels, now in the Museo del Palazzo dei Conservatori and Arch of Con- stantine. These panels show the emperor going through a series of standardized  motions: sacrifice in Rome, sacrifice in the field, accepting the submission of  barbarians, returning triumphant to Rome, and even distributing gifts to citizens  (Ryberg 1967; Angelicoussis 1984; Koeppel 1986, 47–75). Although always ideal- ized, the style continues to be one that presents the events in a generally realistic  manner, although several panels incorporate symbolic elements such as the city  goddess. The habit of depicting the emperor in action with his subjects continued  even to the Arch of Constantine, which not only incorporates the Marcus Aurelius  Panels, but also adds new reliefs depicting the emperor addressing his people and  giving out gifts. In imperial coinage the story is different. Under Hadrian numismatic group  scenes were still prominent, but show limited continuity with Trajanic group scenes.  New types, such as the Disciplina Augusti were created (BMC 602) (Pl. 29, 16a),  and old types that were taken up again, such as the Adlocutio, show significant in- novations in design (BMC 1310) (Pl. 29, 16b). In particular the Congiarium type  was modified to include a personification and a legend proclaiming the emperor’s  liberalitas (Pl. 29, 16c) (Kloft 1970; Metcalf 1993; Schmidt-Dick 2008). The em- phasis thus moved from a concrete historical event to the associated abstract im- perial virtue.  After Hadrian, group scene types become more and more sporadic. New types  were rarely created and old types were rarely reproduced. Designs, furthermore,  became increasingly stylized, with increasing emphasis on the emperor. This can  be seen clearly in the evolution of the Congiarium/Liberalitas type, which contin- ued to be popular. In the type the emperor becomes bigger, and the common man  becomes smaller. By the time of the coins of Severus Alexander, the common man,  and the message of his direct interaction with the emperor, had become almost  unrecognizable (Pl. 29, 16d). The popularity of group scenes on imperial coinage thus appears to have been  primarily a Trajanic phenomenon. This may be due to the logistical concern that  the complicated designs were difficult to produce. It is notable that under Trajan  no group scenes appeared on the denarius, the denomination that saw the greatest  production. Beckmann has suggested that the absence of complicated designs on  Trajanic denarii may be related to the denomination’s production in extremely  high volumes in short amounts of time, calling for types whose dies could be easily  and quickly replicated.67 Indeed, most types for Trajanic denarii were simple single  67 Beckmann 2009: 153–154 . Beckmann (2009: 153) points out that the quality of work- manship in denarii dies is often lower than that for aurei dies. For the role of aurei designs in  testing new topics, which then crossed over onto sestertii, etc., see Woytek 2009: esp. 131.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="42"> 130 Elizabeth Wolfram Thill figures (Beckmann 2009: 153). This suggests that the complication of group scenes  put limits on their production even in Trajan’s time, and subsequent authorities  may have not thought the group scenes worth the hassle of their production. This raises a related issue: it may have become apparent that it was difficult to  understand the group scenes in the limited space of the coin flan, even for sestertii.  This is suggested by the simplifying transformation of the congiarium/liberalitas  designs. It is also suggested by the fact that many of new group scene designs that  were introduced on coins after Trajan featured clearer compositions (although not  necessarily easier production). For example, in Hadrianic adlocutio designs there  is a clear separation (in both distance and scale) between the emperor and his au- dience, especially when compared to Trajanic examples (Pl. 29, 16b). The crowded  Trajanic group scenes simply may have been too difficult to see and comprehend. Whatever the cause in the decline in the popularity of group scenes on coins,  the close compositional interaction between monumental relief and coins seen in  the Trajanic period would not be repeated. This means that the Trajanic period  represents an exceptional high point of integration for an artistic climate dedi- cated to the proclamation of the emperor’s magnificence. Surprisingly, the Trajanic  period nevertheless has not yet seen the sort of definitive, synthesizing work that  Zanker has provided for the age of Augustus.68  The emphasis on the common man would also not be repeated. Yet it is inter- esting that more than a hundred years after Augustus established himself as primus  inter pares, someone in the Trajanic period apparently still deemed it politically  useful to emphasize practical connections between the emperor and the common  civilian and soldier. This recalls the ideal of the emperor that we see in the prob- ably apocryphal story preserved in Dio, where a widow tells a protesting Hadrian  that if he is too busy to attend to her needs, then he should not be emperor.69 The  Trajanic emphasis on the common man, furthermore, seems to have been quite  successful. To this day, hundreds of years after he was granted the title Optimus,  Trajan is still known not only as one of the good Roman emperors, but as possibly  the best. By the Middle Ages even the Hadrian story became attributed to Trajan,  meaning that Trajan ultimately got all the credit for helping the poor widow (and  the special heavenly intercession of Gregory the Great).70 It is difficult to tell if the  imagery of the group scenes on Trajanic coins and monumental relief had any tan- 68 Zanker 1988. There have been several attempts to synthesize the political policies, mes- sages, and artistic output of the Trajanic period; see e.g. Paribeni 1975; Scheiper 1982 (nega- tively reviewed in Hölscher 1984; Lahusen 1986); Seelentag 2004; Galinier 2007. None of  these have yet become definitive in the field.  69 Dio LXIX, 6.  70 Hammond 1953: 130. Hammond (1953: 130–131 n.10) makes the interesting sugges- tion that the post-classical insertion of Trajan into the myth may have been inspired in part  by the Anaglypha alimenta motif itself, since the reliefs may still have been visible in the  Forum until quite a late date.  ©2014 American Numismatic Society </page> <page sequence="43"> The Emperor in Action 131 gible, effective beneficial correlates in real life.
