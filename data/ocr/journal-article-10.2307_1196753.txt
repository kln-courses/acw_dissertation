<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING JAMES BISSETT PRATT Williams College, Williamstown, Mass. HE question set for our discussion I take to be this: What is the relation between the Buddhism of our day and contemporary scientific thinking? This is a straightforward question, and if one is to give a straightfor- ward answer, that answer must be: there is very little relation indeed. An indirect relation doubtless there is, and a negative relation in the sense that Buddhism is in no wise hostile to or inconsistent with modern science. But as to direct relations be- tween Buddhism and the methods or achievements of contem- porary science, of these there are very few. Two or three of the more advanced sects of Japanese Buddhism make use of a few of the principles of recent educational psychology; but with contemporary scientific thinking, in the usual sense of that word, Buddhism has very little to do. Nor need this confession be taken as in any way a reflection upon Buddhism. What relation have mysticism in religion and monistic absolutism in philosophy, what relation have moral living, discipline, self-control, helpfulness, kindness, unselfish devotion, love for one's neighbor and one's enemy-what rela- tion have these with modem scientific thinking other than the negative and very general one which Buddhism also bears? Scientific thought is a great and valuable thing; but it is not the only great and valuable thing in man's possession. In a very real sense, then, I feel that I have answered the question set me by the committee which arranged these lec- tures; and having done so, if I had sufficient grace and suffi- cient sense I should sit down and let you all enjoy a recess. But having come eight hundred miles to speak for two half- hours on Buddhism, and having before me an audience which I3</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION will probably feel itself bound by courtesy to listen, no matter what I say, I confess that I have neither the grace nor the sense to surrender this opportunity to keep on talking for the rest of my allotted minutes; and there are various more or less irrele- vant things concerning Buddhism which I might, more or less inappropriately, bring before you at this time. For one thing I might say a word or two of a more specific sort in explanation of the negative attitude of Buddhism toward modern scientific thinking. Southern Buddhism, as found in Ceylon, Burma, Siam, and Cambodia, centers its interest, as the Founder centered his, upon the practical and moral ques- tions of the conduct of life. The Buddha taught his disciples not to speculate on matters that profit not, that do not tend to absence of passion, to quiescence, supreme wisdom, Nirvana. Following in the footsteps of his Master, the Southern Buddhist as a Buddhist has very little interest in modern scientific thinking. The sects of Japanese and Chinese Buddhism may be roughly divided into three groups: the metaphysical, the mystical, the evangelical. The first of these share a common philosophy which is the center of their intellectual life. It is a philosophy of absolute and monistic Idealism. Ultimately understood, Real- ity is experience and Reality is one. The Buddha nature is in all things: in the last analysis, the Buddha nature is all things. The world of multiplicity which natural science studies is real in its way, but its reality is of a secondary and relative sort, and this does not interest the Buddhist. Nothing that science can discover will have any bearing on the Absolute Truth: the Buddhist world-formula has room for every conceivable kind of purely empirical fact. Hence Buddhism takes a rather pat- ronizing tone toward science. It is true in its way, but its way is not a very important one. Tai Hsu, the great Chinese Bud- dhist says: Science is always open-minded, but scientists have one obstinate super- stition, and that is that the scientific method is the only method for I4</page><page sequence="3">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING arriving at the truth. They fail to realize that the reality of this universe cannot be penetrated by it ..... When scientists insist that their meth- od is the only method of arriving at the truth of things they remind one of blind men trying to understand an elephant by the sense of touch. They will get partial impressions of the different parts of the animal, and what strange impressions as compared with the view of a living elephant that a man of normal sight has .... Buddhism denies the reality of all things or selves. Science can never let go of this phenomenal existence whereas Buddhism carries one beyond it. So Buddhism is non-scientific. Possibly I should suggest one slight modification of the general position of Mahayana philosophy here expressed. The small Kegon sect, and the large sect of Shingon (which draws most of its philosophy from Kegon), while asserting with other Buddhist thinkers the ultimate identity of the Many and the One, lay their emphasis upon multiplicity rather than unity. And a few members of both sects-we might call them the radi- cal left-carry this tendency to the extent of something very like what we know as Naturalism. I suspect that the influence of Western thought has been here at work. I hasten to add, how- ever, that the number of these radical thinkers is very small and their influence limited; and I would point out, furthermore, that so far as Western influence is here responsible, it is the influence of a certain school of philosophy rather than of science. The mystical group of Buddhists-including the Ch'an sects in China, the Zen sects in Japan, and, in addition, a large por- tion of those Buddhists whom I have called metaphysical- take the same negative attitude toward scientific thinking as the monistic absolutists. To quote Tai Hsu once more, for he belongs in both schools, "the central core of Buddhism science can not reach, for Buddhism has to do with inward illumina- tion, the direct insight into the reality of the universe, an intui- tive experience only acquired by one himself, where all logic, analogy, or scientific method or hypothesis are of no avail." The Reverend Sokei-ann Sasaki, a Japanese Buddhist mission- ary who is the head of the First Zen Buddhism Institute in New York, writes me thus: I5</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION The correlation of science and Buddhism is a task of the Buddhist which belongs to the future. We occasionally illustrate to our students this possibility by comparing our thoughts with what we can see in the demonstration of the science of physics, the law of optics, et cetera; but no Buddhist plans such systematically and no Buddhist has ever started such phases of the work .... As we teach the student, many times we borrow from science, as for instance, when we explain that all phenomena are transitory and the uttermost Reality is indemonstrable, by using any method relating to our five senses; but to conceive Reality as Noumenon, that invisible side of existence, is not so easily explained .... We must understand that Buddhism speaks truth by ancient method. Today in this age we certainly must use modern methods to disclose the truth which Buddhism conceived. This belongs entirely to the work of the future. There science and Buddhism will combine. If you read the Prajna Para- mita Sutra you will get many hints pertaining to this problem. It is in Chinese and consists of five hundred volumes. There are a few Japanese students of Zen, as there are a few members of Kegon and Shingon, who seek to make a more inti- mate alliance between it and Western science, notably Profes- sor Nurakiya, of one of the Zen colleges in Tokyo, who gives his Buddhist philosophy an essentially materialistic coloring and who owes quite as much to Haeckel as to Gotama. He rep- resents a small school of very modern-minded Buddhists to be found in all three of the groups I have mentioned. The school itself, however, is hardly representative of Buddhism, and cer- tainly not of the Ch'an of China and the Zen of Japan. Very fundamental to Ch'an and Zen is the assurance that all scientif- ic theories, even the most true of them, are but "fingers point- ing at the moon." Only by the inner vision can the true light be apprehended. Toward the gaining of this vision science can contribute only in a very preliminary and crude fashion; and once the vision has been gained, nothing else is of much im- portance. The third group of Northern Buddhists, whom I have called Evangelical, is made up of the various Amida sects, in both Japan and China. Some of these sects, notably Shin and Jodo, are the most advanced and up-to-date members of the Buddhist I6</page><page sequence="5">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING world. It is chiefly they who have made use of Western methods in religious education, and here, as I have said, they come into direct relation with one limited field of modern science. To the rest of modern science, however, they have, as Buddhists, no relation. Doubtless many Japanese and Chinese gentlemen of various Buddhist sects happen to be interested in science, and some of them doubtless are scientists. But there are also many Republicans of my acquaintance who are scientists; and I should hardly think of deducing from that fact a relation be- tween modern science and the Republican Party. Amida Bud- dhism has no relation to scientific thought other than the general and negative one to which I have several times referred-a type of relation which it might well share with the Republican Party. Its active efforts toward spreading and intensifying the good life have no close relation to science, and its philosophy is, in the last analysis, reducible to that of the metaphysical schools. In a letter from Professor Suzuki of the Otani Buddhist Col- lege in Kyoto (received just before I started for Chicago) he writes: Formerly Buddhists were glad to welcome a scientific approach to their religion. But nowadays a reaction seems to have taken place among them. Instead of relying on scientific arguments for the rationalization of the Buddhist experience they are at present trying to resort to its own dialectics. There is a growing conviction among the Buddhists that their philosophy does not require the support of Western logic, especially of modern science. But while the Buddhism of our time is (as Tai Hsu expressed it) emphatically non-scientific, there are interesting parallels between certain typically Buddhist conceptions and some of the dominant ideas of contemporary science. Buddhist thought anticipated the modern Western notions of the spatial world by many centuries. Tai Hsu points out that in ancient times men thought of heaven as above and earth beneath: then came Copernicus, who taught that the sun was the center of our system. Now we have arrived at the idea that there is no one center anywhere in I7</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the astral universe. This supports the Buddhist idea of the great unlim- ited Void, embracing numberless worlds, all interwoven like spiders' webs. In their conception of time, also, ancient Buddhist thinkers- and in fact Indian thinkers of various schools-were far in ad- vance of our Western ancestors. The Sukhavati Vyuha refers to a series of eighty-one hundred thousand niyutas of kotis of past Buddhas who succeeded each other long before the ap- pearance of Gotama, at the rate of one in perhaps five thousand years. A niyuta is one million and a koti ten million, and I leave it to you to determine how many years are here involved; it will, of course, be eighty-one hundred thousand times five thousand times one million times ten million. There is no word in the English language, so far as I am aware, capable of expressing so tremendous a number; one can only say that it makes geologic time look like yesterday and is capable of being phrased only in light years. This was the common Buddhist conception about 200 A.D. Fifteen hundred years later, when Western scholar- ship first began to have some slight interest in the benighted heathen of the East, its representatives took to India the ortho- dox teaching that the world was created in the year 4004 B.C. By about the year 500 A.D. Buddhist logicians had come to a view of the nature of matter which is of considerable interest. Although in their ultimate philosophy they were idealistic, their conception of the material world was essentially realistic: matter for them was in no wise dependent on being known. Reality was to be found only in the particular; the universal was a construct of the human mind. This particular, in which alone reality was to be found, was not to be identified with the gross objects which we see and handle, for all these are analyzable into atoms. But the atoms themselves, the Buddhist logicians taught, are capable of analysis, as is every material thing. The ultimately real is therefore not a chunk of hard matter. It is rather to be understood as energy. Stcherbatsky, in his "Buddhist Logic" (Vol. I, p. I90), says,</page><page sequence="7">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING "Our image of an external thing is only an effect of external efficient reality. Thus reality is dynamic; all the elements of the external world are mere forces." This conception would seem to be something like that of Leibniz's monadism. But the Bud- dhist thinkers did not stop here. From early times Buddhist thought had rejected the concept of substance, both physical and psychical. There is no such thing, it taught, as a real self, and no such thing as a substantive and abiding material entity. In reducing matter to a collection of centers of force it did not surrender its fundamental denial of substance. The doctrine of impermanence and transiency it had inherited from some very early stage of Buddhist history, and this it applied to its dy- namic view of matter, as the early monks had applied it to human personality in the anatta doctrine. There is no enduring material particle, and there is no enduring and identical center of force. There are but instantaneous existences, without dura- tion. The seeming continuity of change and motion is thus illusory. "There is no motion," says Vasubandhu, "because of annihilation." Things do not move; they have no time to do it. They disappear as soon as they appear. "Momentary things," says Kamalasila, "cannot displace themselves because they disappear at that very place at which they have appeared." At this point I want you to observe that I am skipping nearly two pages of my manuscript. In those two pages I said, in a number of polysyllabic words, that the Buddhist logicians thought that matter was ultimately composed of point-instants, with no duration and no extensity. This reduction of reality to a collection of dynamic point- instants is a rather striking anticipation of thinkers like Alex- ander, Russell, Whitehead, and Jeans. It is closely and logically connected with the Buddhist doctrine of causation. The Bud- dha himself, if we may trust the Nikayas, was one of the first thinkers, perhaps the very first, to emphasize unbroken and invariable sequence as the one character of causation. This comes out especially in his exposition of the twelve Nidanas, I9</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the causal chain that leads ultimately to decay and dying. The manner in which he puts his question concerning death is sig- nificant: "What now being present is decay and dying present; what conditions decay and dying?" His answer is birth. And he then asks the same kind of question concerning birth: "What now being present is birth also present?" It is not his answer that here interests us but, as I have said, it is the form of his question. Invariable accompaniment is the touchstone of causation. In some respects the Buddha was a pragmatist; like that of Professor Dewey and Professor James, his method of investigating the nature of a thing was to ask, "What is it known as?" Cause is known as invariable accompaniment. That is its one unfailing earmark. Hence that is its very nature. The Buddhist denial of substance also had its logical effect in leading up to the final doctrine of causation formulated by the later logicians. As one might easily foresee, it was in many ways like that of Hume, Mill, and Russell. Let me quote from Stcherbatsky's recent and authoritative work: The standpoint of J. S. Mill would probably have been shared, in the main, by the early Buddhists, since their moments are impermanent sense-data, sensible qualities without any substance. Stability and dura- tion are for the Buddhist nothing but "chains of moments" following one another without intervals. The notion of a "chain of moments" corre- sponds very nearly to the modern notion of a "string of events." Accord- ing to Mr. Russell the "string of events ... is called one piece of matter," and the events are "rapid but not instantaneous changes," they are sep- arated by "small time like intervals." "The common-sense thing," says he, "is a character which I should define as the existence of a first order dif- ferential law connecting successive events along a linear route." This re- minds us of the Buddhist view, with the difference that the events are instantaneous and succeed without intervals or with infinitesimal inter- vals. If, as Kamalasila puts it, "not the slightest bit of what was found in the former moment is to be found in the next following moment," the change must be instantaneous. The interpretation of causal laws of functional interdependence, the principle "this being, that becomes," we have seen is also a direct con- sequence of the theory of "Instantaneous Being." Causality obtains be- 20</page><page sequence="9">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING tween point-instants, not beween stabilities or durations. This is like- wise the opinion of Mr. Russell. The same must be said regarding the repudiation of a series of prejudices connected with the common- sense realistic idea of causation. The prejudice that causes "operate," that they "compel" the result to appear, the inclination to consider a causal relation on the anthropomorphic pattern, the prejudice, further, that the result must be "similar" to the cause-in all these cases the coin- cidence is striking. On the negative side the coincidence is almost com- plete. On the positive side there is all the difference which lies between a point- instant and a brief event. From the standpoint of ultimate reality there is but very little difference between a brief event and a long event; these characteristics are quite relative. But there is a great difference between duration and no duration. The point instant is for Mr. Russell a mere "mathematical convenience." But for the Buddhist it represents tran- scendental or ultimate reality. As a limit of all artificial constructions of our reason, it is real; it is the reality. There is no other reality than the point-instant; all the rest, whether brief or long, is constructed by our reason on this basis. Not only in physics but in psychology, also, the early Bud- dhists anticipated by two thousand years or more the general analytic methods of Western science. I cannot say that in the content of their psychological teachings the Buddhists antici- pated Western psychology; nor can I agree with the common Buddhist belief that Gotama was the greatest psychologist of all time. Buddhist psychology is badly mixed up with moral con- cepts, and a good many traditional and primitive Indian ideas have been combined with it. But the general aim and method of Buddhist psychology, namely, to analyze the various constit- uents of human experience, with no reference to a self or sub- ject, was set up by them about four or five hundred B.C., and rediscovered by Western science in the eighteenth century. More important than these occasional and separate parallels of ancient Buddhist and modern Western thought is the general intellectual attitude of the Founder and of his abler followers through all the ages. Among the saints and the founders of re- ligions, the Buddha is distinguished by his essentially scientific 21</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION attitude of mind. He had a warm and loving heart, but his loving sympathy for all sentient life did not cloud his vision nor dull the keen edge of his native and trained ability to see things as they are, to make distinctions, and to think relevantly and to the point. Among all the great men of the past whom it is our privilege to know, few have combined in so excellent a fashion a soft heart and a hard head. The fact of universal suf- fering and his loving eagerness to heal it were the prompting emotional motives of his thought. But having thus selected his problem, he went at it as a scientific physician. "What," he asked, "are the symptoms?" And then, "What is the cause of these symptoms? .... What now being present is decay and dying present?" Then, have discovered the cause of sorrow in desire and ignorance, he asks, "What can be done to destroy this cause?" The scientific spirit of the Founder was handed on to his fol- lowers. Moreover, as I have previously pointed out, the type of metaphysics built up by the Northern School of Buddhism (the only school that constructed a metaphysics) is such that there is room within it for every new discovery that science has made or is ever likely to make. And thus we can under- stand how it came about that while Christianity and Judaism have been so deeply affected by the advance of science, Bud- dhism has been affected so little. Christianity inherited, in part from Judaism, in part from Greece, a diminutive conception of the spatial and temporary universe. Buddhism inherited from Indian thought a universe whose time and space (in so far as they were real at all) were boundless. Judaism began with an anthropomorphic and very limited tribal God, who indeed de- veloped magnificently, but who at the time of the birth of Chris- tianity was still emphatically finite and still possessed the limi- tations of human personality and psychology. Buddhism grew out of Indian thought at the time when the Upanishads were being completed, and its Founder's attitude on theological questions was either skeptical, or indifferent, or atheistic. 22</page><page sequence="11">BUDDHISM AND SCIENTIFIC THINKING Judaism and Christianity began with belief in the creation of the world by the personal Yahveh, as an act of will, at a definite point in past time. Buddhism inherited the view that the world either developed from within in the manner of living growth, or that it was merely the appearance of a deep- er reality. With theological beliefs such as they possessed, Juda- ism and Christianity taught that the personal God interfered with the processes of His creation: they taught miracles, spe- cial "providences," and specific answers to prayer. Buddhism, of course, made nothing of these things. Judaism and Christian- ity, centering their interest on the finite world of existence and of history, made use of empirical arguments, such as asserted specific historical events and particular "marks of design" in nature, to prove the truth of their theological positions. Bud- dhist metaphysics, like the Hindu Vedanta, having little or no interest in events or in the limited facts of a particular existen- tial world, relied chiefly upon a priori considerations. With such divergent philosophies, it is not surprising that the attitudes of these religions toward the advance of physical science should have been markedly different. With every great scientific discovery Judaism and Christianity have found it necessary to modify considerably some of their accepted and most treasured conceptions of the world, of God, and of man. Witness the skepticism, the undermining of old foundations, the heartbreak, the struggle, the painful and even bloody hostility between Christians, the disingenuous reinter- pretation of old creeds, the right-about-face of theologians, that have followed every scientific advance such as that associated with Copernicus or with Darwin. All through the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries the theologians were busy reconciling Christianity with the new astronomy; and during the second half of the nineteenth century the best Christian brains were exercised to the uttermost, at first in attacking evolution and then in adapting Christian theology to it. None of these dis- coveries, none of these new hypotheses, has had any effect upon 23</page><page sequence="12">24 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Buddhism. Within its fold such things as the insistence on Ga- lileo's recantation or the recent "monkey trial" in Tennessee would be unthinkable. Is it the sun or the earth that moves? Are our human bodies descended from apes? Whatever answer you give to these questions, the Southern Buddhist will remind you that there still remain birth, old age, misery, despair, death: and the Northern Buddhist that only the One is real and the Buddha nature is in all things. And so at the end of our investigation we come back to the conclusion proposed at its beginning. Between Buddhism and modern scientific thinking there is no close or significant rela- tion. And after all, why should there be?</page></plain_text>
