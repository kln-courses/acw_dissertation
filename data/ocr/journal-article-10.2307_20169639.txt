The Russian nihilists borrowed few specific doctrines from Proudhon. They sought instead in his writings a negative spirit akin to their own which denounced the state and society. They saw in Proudhon, as had Herzen earlier, a call for an annihilation of the old social mode of life. Proudhon's works began to appear in Russian translation in the i86o's. This unexpected popularity in Russia sur prised Proudhon, who noted that he was "read and discussed even in the far reaches of Siberia."3 The young nihilist, P. G. Zaichnevskii, translated Proudhon's Qu est-ce que la propri?t? ? into Russian, but the police arrested him in 1861 before the manuscript could be delivered to the underground press.4 The early Russian nihilists found congenial not only Proudhon's attack upon the political and economic foundations of the state.

Russian radical thinkers of the later 1850's and early 1860's believed that the natural sciences were related to revolutionary thought and socialism as idealism was related to Orthodoxy and the maintenance of the Russian autocracy. The nihilists called upon the natural sciences to attack idealism and to supply those principles by which contemporary Russian society could be judged and condemned.1 The literature popularizing the natural sciences which entered Russia from Western Europe in the late 1850's encouraged a belief in the pro gressive value of the natural sciences. Moreover, the enthusiasm for the natural sciences in Russia extended beyond the radical thinkers to include much of educated society. It reflected larger changes taking place within Russia. The defeat in the Crimean War emphasized the need to rationalize the Russian state and to bring Russian society into the modern world. A qualified belief in the natural sciences, a type of quasi-positivism, consequently became the creed of many thinkers who had no connection with radical thought. More books in the natural sciences than in any other field were published in Russia in the 1860's. This is a significant clue to the general intellectual climate of that decade because the number of books published in Russia doubled in the years from 1861 to 1868.2 The young Russian nihilists were not content, however, with a passive positivism which merely wanted to extend the methodology of the natural sciences as widely as possible. They sought in the natural sciences absolute answers to the problems of human existence. This attitude of 'scientism', when carried to its logical and absurd conclusion, dissolved the barrier between fact and value and led to a nihilistic pursuit of the brute fact for its own sake. Nihilism began to take root among some of the young Russian radicals in the early 1860's. This attitude found encouragement from two different sources: the literature of scientism from Western Europe and increased pressure from the Russian autocracy on dissident student opinion.3 The young nihilists lost faith not only in reform from above but also in revolution from below. They believed that they could depend only on themselves. This attitude led to the concept of a critically thinking elite verifying its ideas only by the laws of the natural sciences. This nihilist doctrine that human progress depended only on an understand ing and diffusion of the teachings of the natural sciences met a strong challenge in 1864 with the appearance of Charles Darwin's The origin i.

He strongly emphasized that the core of Darwinian natural selection was a literal interpretation of the idea of the struggle for existence which Darwin had borrowed from Thomas Malthus. Pisarev overlooked Darwin's own insistence that natural selection was far more complex than the idea of the struggle for existence which Darwin had used only in a meta phorical sense.2 Pisarev interpreted Darwinism to mean that in the struggle for existence in nature or human society only the 'fittest' survive. He saw the contemporary European in his historical struggles with less developed peoples as a manifestation of this superiority.3 Pisarev's application of Darwin's biological theory of evolution to human history contained within itself the seeds of racism. It was not Pisarev, however, but his friend, Varthalomew Zaitsev, who created out of Darwinism an overtly racist philosophy. In a review for the radical journal, Russkoe slovo, Zaitsev discussed in August 1864 a book on the unity of human species by the eminent French naturalist, Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages.4 The book advocated a theory of monogenesis regarding the human species. This meant that all races were ultimately of one species and that any racial differences were only of degree rather than of kind.5 Zaitsev, a former medical student, violently disagreed with the theory of monogenesis. Following Karl Vogt, whose writings circulated widely among the young nihilists,6 Zaitsev insisted upon the validity of the polygenetic theory of man. This theory saw in the differences i. The translator was Sergei Aleksandrovich Rachinskii, who began the trans lation in 1862. His translation was reprinted several times until a new Russian translation by Kliment A. Timiriazev appeared in 1895. 2. "I should premise that I use the term Struggle for Existence in a large and metaphorical sense," Darwin wrote in The origin of species, "including dependence of one being on another, and including (which is more important) not only the life of the individual, but success in leaving progeny."

Pisarev made no distinction in his review between biological and social evolution. He saw no difference between the struggle for existence in nature untouched by human activity and the struggles of human history. Pisarev crudely interpreted the collapse of the Roman Empire and the colonization of the Pacific as two obvious examples of the struggle for existence resulting in the survival of the fittest. 4. De Quatrefages' theory of monogenesis was independent of Darwin's theory of natural selection which de Quatrefages did not completely accept. He had, however, great respect for Darwin and proposed him for election to the French Academy of Sciences. Darwin considered de Quatrefages an 'excellent naturalist.'

Zaitsev concluded in his review that this unbridgeable gap between the white and black species meant that the black race was inferior to the white and therefore 'naturally1 enslaved.1 Zaitsev's overt racism shocked the radical thinkers. M. A. Antono vich spoke for the revolutionary intelligentsia when he replied in the other major radical journal, Sovremennik, that whatever zoology might say, common sense and the general welfare of humanity must be respected.2 The controversy over Zaitsev's racism led the revolutionary thinkers to question the human implications of Darwinism, the relation ship of Darwinism to the idea of progress, and finally the basic assump tion that Darwinism, like the natural sciences in general, was the repo sitory of an impersonal and objective truth. Reflections upon the human implications of Darwinism gave rise to an anthropomorphic criticism of Darwinism guided by the precepts of Proudhon. Among the radical thinkers, Proudhon was widely read. His destructive criticism of the state and its institutions found an echo in the nihilists' approach to political, social and philosophical questions in the early i86o's. They saw in the individual, as did Proudhon, the supreme source of all values. But for the young Russian nihilists, Proudhon was at first only another Western European thinker offering a doctrine with which they could covertly attack the ideals of the society in which they lived. By the middle i86o's, the Russian radical thinkers began to emphasize the positive side of Proudhon's thought: his belief that once liberated from political, economic and spiritual tyranny, men could by voluntary cooperation (mutualit?) fully develop themselves in realizing their own goals.3 The idea of mutuality furnished the young biologist and anarchist revolutionary, Nikolai D. Nozhin, with his basic concept in developing an anthropomorphic criticism of Darwinism. Nozhin's revolutionary interpretation of Darwinism was significant because it was the first to come from a trained biologist. Nozhin was born into a well-educated gentry family in 1841 and tutored at home. When he entered the Imperial Alexander Lyc?e in 1854, he appeared physically under developed and extremely nervous. Many attributed these qualities to his premature birth which left him during his short life with the appearance of a child. The majority of Nozhin's classmates, in prep aration for high positions in the government, studied law and history. But a small group became passionately interested in the natural sciences. i. V. A.

It was translated into Russian in 1867.</page><page sequence="5">5i8 JAMES ALLEN ROGERS Nozhin was one of this group. The study of the natural sciences was linked in the lyc?e as elsewhere in Russia with a revolutionary attitude towards the Russian state and society. Hectographed copies of B?chner, Vogt and Moleschott circulated surreptitiously among the students and spread a materialistic and revolutionary outlook. In i860 the students read with equal enthusiasm Darwin's Origin of species in German translation.1 After graduation from the lyc?e, Nozhin continued his education in chemistry at the University of Heidelberg where he became close friends with Alexander Kovalevskii. Their strong interest in Darwinism led them away from the study of chemistry. Nozhin was the first to give up chemistry for zoology, and was soon followed by Kovalevskii. Both young men read a small German brochure on Darwinism in 1864 which stimulated them to study evolutionary embryology.2 This eventually led them to research in Italy where Kovalevskii gathered the data for his doctoral dissertation while Nozhin prepared his first scientific article.3 When Nozhin returned to St. Petersburg in the beginning of 1865 his friends found that the acclaim which greeted his scientific work had given him new confidence in his analytical powers. He responded to Zaitsev's racist article with a long and sweeping statement incorporating his own scientific experience and the insights into society which he had acquired through the reading of Proudhon. It seemed to Nozhin that Zaitsev was trying to appear brilliantly provocative by his espousal of a rigid scientific determinism that doomed black peoples to an inferior position. Nozhin suggested that the philanthropic point of view, treated with such contempt by Zaitsev, was necessary in the resolution of all practical questions. The natural sciences were limited to the resolution of empirical questions. Science could present alternative answers to social questions but science itself could not make the final decision as to which was morally right. That decision belonged to man alone. Zaitsev, for example, had insisted that the slavery of blacks occurred not by chance but for 'natural and historical' reasons. Nozhin replied that all of human existence was 'natural-historical' and the i. Sergei Svatikov, "Nikolai Dmitrievich Nozhin (1841-1866)," Golos minuv shego (Oct. 1914): 1-5.

Nozhin expressed his theory of history in both scientific and moral terms. He criticized Zaitsev's use of 'scientific authorities' and pointed out that neither Vogt nor Thomas Huxley sanctioned slavery even though both believed in the existence of lower and higher races.2 More over, even if lower and higher races did exist, Darwin's theory opened the possibility for lower races to evolve to higher stages. Nozhin explained that if Zaitsev carefully studied the relationship of Darwinism to human progress, he would see that the problem was not one of race but of the development of individual personality. Developed individuals could appear anywhere if they were not repressed because of the color of their skin. The supposedly superior white race sank even below the level of animals when it took to itself the right to exercise tyranny over other peoples. Nozhin concluded that the inhuman attitude of racism always arose from the same source: indifference to the suffering of others camouflaged as 'scientific' thought.3 Zaitsev was caught in a dilemma by Nozhin's article. Here was science used against the advocates of scientism. Worse, this was science infused with the insight of Proudhon. Zaitsev, one of the leading Proudhonists among the young Russian radicals, claimed that he found it impossible to understand Nozhin's article: "I would willingly have answered the much more considered article in no. 8 of I skr a if it were not so obscure."4 What Zaitsev found 'obscure' was Nozhin's ability to take the slogans of the nihilists and turn them to radically different conclusions. In Nozhin's developing theory of history, the nihilists' materialistic and mechanistic idea of progress was giving way to a sub jective doctrine in which the objective truth of the natural sciences could not be separated from the subjective goals of man. Nozhin's biological basis for his new theory became more apparent in late 1865 when he reviewed a work by Rudolph Virchow. Nozhin opposed Virchow's emphasis on cellular physiology for scientific and for sociological reasons derived from Proudhon. He believed that what is healthy for the individual cell may not be healthy for the individual as a whole. The health of the individual cell may benefit from the specialization of the organ of which it is a part. But the i. N. D.

The division of labor between individuals of the same species forced such specialization which violated the integrity of the individual and gave rise to the struggle for existence.1 A criticism of the division of labor was not a new doctrine among the Russian revolutionary thinkers. What was new was the way Nozhin used it to criticize the Malthusian aspect of Darwinism applied to human society. Economists erred, according to Nozhin, in attribut ing the struggle for existence in society to an unjust distribution of wealth. In fact, such struggle was the result of the division of labor which the economists thought was necessary for the accumulation of capital. By encouraging a division of labor, the economists only further exacerbated the class struggle in society.2 Nozhin's solution to the division of labor was a Proudhonist one: individual anarchism working for the solidarity of all human beings. It was Proudhonist rather than Bakuninist because Nozhin saw in Bakunin's conspiratorial and revolutionary anarchism only the old panaceas of the political economists turned to revolutionary use. Nozhin and Bakunin had met while Nozhin was in Italy, but they did not find each other compatible. Nozhin wanted to reach 'moral' conclusions about social conditions in a 'scientific' way using theories such as Darwin's. Bakunin's ritualized formulas and conspiratorial approach to an anarchist revolution struck Nozhin as obsolete and ill founded. Bakunin, in turn, found Nozhin far too bookish for his own taste, and did not trouble to conceal his contempt for this 'caricature of a nihilist'.3 Moreover, Bakunin saw no value for revolutionary anarchism in Darwinism.4 In St. Petersburg, by contrast, Nozhin found support for his develop ing philosophy among the circle of Proudhonists working on the journal, Knizhnyi vestnik. With them he worked out his ideas in an unfinished series of articles on the meaning and goals of the natural sciences. In the first three articles, Nozhin stressed that the goal of science should not be the growth of the individual scientist nor of science itself but the revolutionizing of social problems. Following Proudhon, Nozhin asserted that state socialism was no panacea for human problems because the political approach was either the result of na?vet? or the desire for exploita tion. Nozhin believed that science as practiced in the past served only to support the existing order. Science as practiced by the 'new man' would stand in direct opposition to the ruling order. Science i.

The ultimate goal of science like that of society should be the achievement of solidarity of all its members by the fusion of their interests. By recognizing this essential goal of development, men would have a cri terion with which to judge the progress and direction of scientific research.1 Nozhin found in the contemporary attitude toward Darwinism a lack of any criterion by which to judge human progress. Darwinism was accepted and applied uncritically by various groups without any study of the significance of Darwinism for the achievement of solidarity for society as a whole. Nozhin blamed Darwin's Malthusian assumption for this uncritical attitude: "Darwin talks about the connection between the struggle for existence and natural selection as if he did not notice that every such connection is limited by the antagonism between these two conditions of growth; therefore, he does not see that the struggle for existence is not helpful for evolution, that by itself it is only the source of pathological phenomena, phenomena diametrically opposed to the laws of physical evolution."2 Nozhin's new insight into the importance of mutual aid in biological evolution came not from the natural sciences but from the reading of Proudhon's De la capacit? politique des classes ouvri?res (1865). Nozhin saw in Proudhon's idea of mutuality the basis for a moral and scientific critique of the nihilists' impersonal attitude of scientism. He also found in mutuality the criterion by which to judge human progress. He agreed with Proudhon that mutuality was more than community. It was not merely association but reciprocity of services based on reciprocity of respect. Mutuality growing out of such reciprocity gave each indi vidual meaningful freedom of action in every aspect of his own life.3 Nozhin's primary interest in Proudhon's theory of mutuality was its application to biological evolution rather than to political economy. It seemed to Nozhin that a scientific theory of human evolution ought to stress healthy physiological laws of development over pathological ones. A sound physiological law of development would recognize that organisms of the same species do not struggle for existence against one another unless society has forced them to do so by creating an antagonism of interests through the division of labor. The struggle for existence arises not from population pressure on subsistence as Malthus believed, but from the organization of society around the division of labor. In the absence of a division of labor, organisms of the same species strive to combine with one another, to i. N. D.

Ibid.: 176-178.</page><page sequence="9">522 JAMES ALLEN ROGERS unify their homogeneous forces, to struggle only with the external forces of nature. This process of cooperation, according to Nozhin, must be the foundation of a healthy law of physiological evolution. Only in this way could society avoid those social contradictions which Proudhon called 'contradictions ?conomiques' and which were enshrined in the theory of Malthus. Nozhin concluded his long polemic against the Malthusian aspect of Darwinism with the declaration that only mutual aid among men, in the Proudhonist sense of mutualit?, could produce fully integrated individuals enjoying health, freedom and anarchy.1 Nozhin's unexpected death in 1866 did not end the controversy over the application of Darwinism to social questions among the Russian socialist revolutionaries. But from that time, the socialist revolution aries began to accept Darwinism largely within the biological and Prou dhonian interpretation first espoused by Nozhin and later elaborated by Nikolai Mikhailovskii. That interpretation suggested that Darwin ism in its relationship to the evolution of human society must emphasize mutual aid over the struggle for existence to produce human solidarity and healthy and fully integrated personalities. The concept of human solidarity also furnished a criterion to relate Darwinism to the idea of historical progress. Any interpretation of Darwinism, such as the Malthusian one, which did not further human solidarity was regressive and inimical to the development of the integral personality. Finally, by replacing the impersonal and mechanistic view of science, advocated by the nihilists, with an anthropomorphic interpretation of Darwinism, Nozhin brought purpose into Darwinian evolution. That purpose was the fullest development of the freedom of the integral personality derived from a transformation of society based on Proudhonian mutual aid rather than on a division of labor. Nozhin's writings on Darwinism marked the decline of the belief, exemplified by Pisarev's early writings, that science existed for its own sake. The nihilists had believed in the objectivity of the natural sciences and the inevitability of human progress but they had never clarified the relation between the two. The controversy over the social signifi cance of Darwinism had raised the question of that relationship once again. Nozhin had insisted that the natural sciences were no longer the haven of an objective truth separated from the goals of mankind. Using the ideas of Proudhon to interpret Darwinian evolution, Nozhin transformed the nihilist doctrine of objective science and automatic progress into a subjective theory of historical development finding its fullest expression in human solidarity and mutual aid. Nozhin's close friend, Nikolai Mikhailovskii, developed in much greater detail Nozhin's belief that human solidarity is a subjective although 'necessary' choice of man. It became the basis of his 'subjective method' in historical i. Ibid.: 178.
