<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOB'S COMPLAINT IN PARADISE REGAINED BY VICTORIA KAHN In the whole Old Testament there is not one figure one approaches with so much confidence and frank-heartedness and trustfulness as Job, just because everything about him is so human, because he lies upon the confines of poetry. S0ren Kierkegaard, Repetition All readers o? Paradise Regained know that the poem is modeled in part on the book of Job, the book Milton described as a "brief epic" in The Reason of Church Government.1 Just as Job begins with a prologue in which God permits the trials of Job, moves to a central dialogue between Job and his comforters, and concludes with an epilogue in which everything is restored to Job, so Paradise Regained begins with a discussion between God and the angel Gabriel in which God permits Satan's temptations of Jesus, moves to a central dialogue between Jesus and Satan, and concludes with the angels singing and Jesus returning home from the wilderness. Just so we won't miss the parallel, in the discussion between God and Gabriel, God snidely remarks of Satan, [L]et him tempt and now assay His utmost subtlety, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to that throng Of his Apostasy; he might have learnt Less overweening, since he failed in Job, Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.2 In the rest of the poem, Jesus is compared four more times to Job, who is continuously described as a "just man" of "constant persever ance," who bore his wrongs with "saintly patience" (PR, 3.93-95).3 This emphasis is consistent with the reading of Job in the New Testament Epistle of James, where James refers to "the patience of Job," in a passage that Christians read as foreshadowing the suffering of Christ.4 For all these reasons, the Son of Paradise Regained is regularly in terpreted as the antitype of Job, heroically and patiently suffering his ELH 76 (2009) 625-660 ? 2009 by The Johns Hopkins University Press 625</page><page sequence="2">temptations, which in turn prefigure the crucifixion. That, anyway, is the standard line.5 In this essay I want to propose a counterplot to this standard typo logical reading of Milton's allusions to Job. Milton, I believe, was less interested in such hermeneutical closure than he was in the ongoing process of interpretation enjoined by scripture itself. In his mature articulation of his own principles of scriptural interpretation, Milton urged the comparison of scriptural passages, but he also insisted, in Dayton Haskin's words, that "one ought not presume to know in ad vance, merely on the basis of custom and traditional interpretation, 'the uniform tenor of Scripture.'"6 Of particular relevance to Paradise Regained is Milton's cautiousness in Christian Doctrine about inter preting New Testament passages describing Jesus as the Son of God. In elaborating his own interpretation of these and other passages, Milton "looked to the practice of those biblical authors who were reinterpreting the work of earlier writers."7 That is, he was unusually sensitive to the different voices in scripture and to the ways in which these voices, including Jesus's, could quote and reinterpret the Hebrew Bible to different ends. Milton was also capable, as we know from the Divorce tracts, of privileging the Hebrew scriptures over the New Testament as a key to interpreting Jesus's own words, rather than vice versa. In light of these interpretive practices, Milton's allusions to Job in Paradise Regained deserve a closer look. In Paradise Regained, as in so many of his other works, Milton is exploring God's ways, and the fault-lines within the book of Job provide a model for this exploration. I have in mind in particular the tensions between the frame story of the book of Job and its troubling central dialogue, in which Job refuses the arguments of his comforters and demands to speak with God. In the reading I propose here, Paradise Regained counterbalances a conservative typological understanding of Job's patience with an acute sense of Job's ironic and subversive prac tices of interpretation in the central dialogue. In particular, I suggest that Job is a model not only for the structure of Paradise Regained but also for the Son's distinctive rhetoric. Milton's repeated allusions to Job invite us to see that many of the poem's most striking rhetorical features?quotation, irony, mimicry, playing with the dual meaning of a single word or phrase?find echoes in Job, as does the phrase that most provokes and perplexes Satan: the description of Jesus as "the son of God" (PR, l.lll).8 The Son's Jobean rhetoric is thus crucial for understanding the Son's nature, including the political, hermeneutical, and literary exemplarity of the Son as "perfect man" (PR, 1.166). Let me take each of these kinds of exemplarity in turn. 626 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="3">The Son's irony is directed in the first instance against Satan's theo logical politics and his apocalyptic rhetoric of zeal, whose historical equivalents are the corrupt Restoration monarchy and the inadequate millenarian responses of sects such as the Fifth Monarchists. Here we could say the Son's irony serves to defend the saeculum, the space of time between the Incarnation and the Second Coming that dictates the separation of church and state, and the patient anticipation of right occasion for political action.9 But, as John Coffey, Thomas Corns, and others have argued, it is wrong to equate such patient anticipation with pacifism: rather, the vision of Paradise Regained is consistent with the goals of the "committed polemicist" of the 1640s and 1650s.10 At the same time, the Son's irony raises questions about divine as well as human justice. If the oxymoron "perfect man" invites us to see the Son's Jobean irony as the rhetorical equivalent of his double nature, this irony in turn suggests that the questions raised by the book of Job about God's justice are not ancillary but central to Milton's understanding of Jesus. As we will see, the Son adapts Job's rhetoric to the activity of interpreting scripture, which Milton describes in Christian Doctrine as the entirely human "business of research and discussion" about the meaning of God's ways.11 To be a "perfect man," then, is to be a perfectly human reader of scripture, one whose ques tions can serve as a model for any human reader. But to be a "perfect man" is also to be an incarnate God, one who will suffer on the cross to save mankind. Here the book of Job has more subversive implica tions for Paradise Regained, for once we read the poem in terms of Job's vehement questioning, we are forced to revise the traditional reading of Jesus's patient suffering. In particular, we see that Jesus's irony is directed not only against Satan's theological politics, but also? like Job's?against God.12 Through the Son, Milton does not simply articulate political resistance to the false comforts of the Restoration; he also raises questions about God's justice and about the crucifixion that amount to a Christian version of Job's complaint. The Son's ironic questioning, I suggest in conclusion, serves as a model for Milton's poetry. Here we see that the saeculum, as defended by the Son, is also a condition of the poet's work. Milton's critique of political theology, by which I mean the conflation of church and state, goes hand in hand with a conception of scripture as a text to be read and interpreted like any other. In asserting the distinction between church and state, while breaking down the distinction between scripture and poetry, Milton helps produce our modern secular notion of literature. If Paradise Regained offers a critique of theological politics, it does so Victoria Kahn 627</page><page sequence="4">in particular by helping us to understand that literature takes place?if I can put it this way?in the space vacated by religious enthusiasm. This is the space of Job's complaint. I. JOB'S IRONY (1): "TROUBLES WILL MAKE A MAN RHETORICALL" When we turn to the central dialogue between Job and his comfort ers, we begin to see the inadequacy of the critical emphasis on Job's patience. Instead, Job is impatient and sarcastic, and his characteristic rhetorical mode is to quote his friends ironically, to exploit verbal ambiguity, to anticipate their responses to him, and to mimic them mercilessly.13 Although Job explicitly mocks his friends' platitudes ("I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you" [Job 16:4]), Job does in fact very often "reuse" the language of his comforters to ironic effect.14 When Job's friends speak to him in the language of traditional Wisdom literature, Job parodies a line from Psalm 8, which reads, "What is man, that thou are mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visiteth him? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honor" (Ps 8:4-5). In Job's mouth, this marveling at God's elevation of man becomes an ir ritable wondering at God's excessive attention: "What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? And that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him? And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?" (Job 7:17-18). When Job's wife urges him to "curse God and die," Job responds ironically by playing on the fact that the Hebrew word for praise?"barek"?could ?so be used to mean "curse." In a sharp rebuke to his wife's temptation to distrust, Job asserts he will praise God, even though God has persecuted him (Job 2:9-10). In his reply to the rhetorical questions of Eliphaz and Bildad?"Shall mortal man be more just than God?" (Job 4:17); "Doth God pervert judgment? Or doth the Almighty pervert justice?" (Job 8:3), Job uses their legal language to question the possibility of justice before God: "Man cannot win a suit against God!" (Job 9:2, Greenberg's translation; the King James translation is "How can man be just with God?"), and, a little further on, Job asserts: "For [God] is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment. Neither is there any daysman [arbiter] betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both" (Job 9:32-33).15 In all these exchanges, quotation, mimicry, and ironic reuse are the corollaries of Job's refusal to be silenced, and of his righteous demand to speak with God. 628 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="5">It is not only modern commentators who have noted these features of the central dialogue of the book of Job. Early modern readers were just as interested in Jobs rhetoric as they were in his putative patience. There were, of course, precedents among the Church Fathers for this interest: Gregory the Great had called Job's rhetoric harsh ("?spera"), while Thomas Aquinas repeatedly called attention to the debate struc ture of the book of Job, and quoted Aristotle's Rhetoric ("contraries placed next to each other shine forth all the more") to illustrate not only Job's way of speaking but the logic of testing Job to prove his virtue.16 Seventeenth-century readers appear to have been even more attuned to Job's verbal irony, though with varying estimates of its exemplarity. Commenting on Job's murmuring against God, John Calvin asserted that Job had a good case, though he did not always plead it well.17 In Job Expounded (1589), however, Theodore Beza described the book as "most divinely written: wherewith even in the iudgement of man, no writing of any Poet, either in respect of matter or words, may rightly be compared."18 And he went on to attribute this eloquence to Job, whom he quotes as saying in 19:28: "Yee shall finde that I st?nde in a good quarrell and maintained a cause, which is iust and which is stronglie and deepelie rooted."19 Like Beza, the seventeenth-century Congregational minister Joseph Caryl seems to have understood that the poetry of Job was less a mat ter of meter than of irony, parallelism, repetition, and quotation.20 But Caryl went even further than Beza in characterizing Job's irony as a weapon in the service of God's justice, as well as a model for Christ. In his Exposition upon Job of 1647, Caryl observed of Job's complaints that "Troubles will make a man rhetoricall," and proceeded to analyze in great detail the double-edged rhetoric of Job, and the many pas sages in the Hebrew text that can be read in several, often contrary, ways.21 Commenting on the ambiguity of Job's wife's "curse God and die," Caryl noted, in a phrase Milton would have appreciated, "we must therefore examine both sides, that we may finde out more fully the sense of these words."22 Caryl then pressed his analysis further when he linked the distinctive rhetoric of the text to its theological and political dimensions. In one passage, Caryl moved from commenting on Job's language to drawing an analogy between Job's rhetorical irony and the irony of the incarnation: Satan would have man aspire to be God, that he might be ruined; and God becomes man to ruine Satan; This was the greatest counterplot that ever ivas. God tooke the Devill in and by his own craftinesse. As if Victoria Kahn 629</page><page sequence="6">God had said; Satan, thou shalt see what afine devise thou hast devised. I will meete thee in thy owne way, and turne it upon thee.23 Caryl alludes here to the notion that the incarnation (God becomes man) undoes or compensates for the fall (man aspiring to become God), and he describes this inversion as God's counterplot, which God has modeled on Satan's own contrivance or "device."24 (Elsewhere, Caryl reminds us that a similar formulation of this device, 1 Corinthians 15:33, "It is written, he taketh the wise in their own craftiness," derives from Eliphaz's words in Job 5:13.)25 In another passage, Caryl argues that Job's sarcasm, which Elip haz calls "the scourge of the tongue" (Job 5:21), provides a model of divine justice. They that smite with the sword, shall perish [by] the sword; so, they that smite with the tongue shall perish [by] the tongue. The tongues of Saints are in some sence, sharper and sorer scourges, than the tongues of wicked men. The word of God in their mouthes, is a Two edged Sword, yea sharper than any Two-edged Sword. ... At the last Christ himselfe will smite them with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.26 In Caryl's commentary the weapon against Satan is "the word," sug gesting that the incarnation is effective first and foremost as verbal action. Caryl alludes here to Paul's image in Hebrews 4:12: "For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart." For both Paul and Caryl, the two-edged sword is a perfect image of the ironic ability of God's word to cut both ways. Correctly understood (that is, with faith), God's word has the power to save. But it also has the power to condemn the unbeliever. Depending on the recipient, God's word can mean two different things or act in two different ways; its contingent action is one of the ways divine justice manifests itself in the world. In these passages, we begin to see the relevance of Job's rhetoric not only to the Son's desire "By winning words [to] conquer willing hearts" (PR, 1.222), but also to his ironic exchanges with Satan in Paradise Regained. For Caryl's Job is not only a figure of patient heroism but also of irony and criticism. This irony is directed primarily against Job's "friends," but also at times against God: as Caryl observes in his Preface, "For here is one of the greatest battels fought, that ever was between man and man, between man and 630 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="7">hel, yea between God and man."27 God, according to Caryl, "is ready to hear both [the sinner's] prayers, and disputes. ... he loves to heare the righteous holding out and maintaining the righteousnesse of their ways (against all the clamours and calumnies of men) before him."28 When Milton turns his attention to Job in Christian Doctrine, he stresses even more than Caryl the double nature of God's justice and of Job's own rhetoric.29 As Mary Ann Radzinowicz has shown, "In Book I [of Christian Doctrine] Milton used Jobean texts to describe the nature and attributes of God. . . . God's use of the Son to make all things, the nature of creation, the contingency of God's decrees, God's use of good temptations, and the possibility of human virtue."30 Thus, to cite just one example, Job figures centrally in Milton's discussion of the "good temptation," or divine test of virtue: "Good temptations are those which God uses to tempt even righteous men, in order to prove them. He does this not for his own sake?as if he did not know what sort of men they would turn out to be?but either to exercise or demonstrate their faith or patience, as in the case of Abraham and Job, or to lessen their self-confidence and prove them guilty of weak ness, so that they may become wiser and others may be instructed" (CD, 1.8.338). We could say that the good temptations of Abraham and Job are ironic temptations, since they do not really tempt so much as provide an opportunity to exercise or display an already existing virtue. At the same time, Milton cites Job to prove that human virtue is not predestined by God but rather an achievement of free will in response to a divine call: "There are striking exhortations to penitence in . . . Job xi. 13, etc. . . . But all exhortation would be pointless un less it were addressed to men in whom renovation, at any rate of this natural kind, had to some extent taken place: to men, that is, gifted with some powers of judgment and with free will. The kind of faith which corresponds to penitence is a submission, itself natural, to the divine call" (CD, 1.17.459).31 Milton's reading of Job is thus consistent with what we know of his Arminianism, including his belief that the efficacy of God's grace depends in some measure on the individual's response. But when Milton turns to a discussion of the virtue of patience in book 2, chapter 3 o? Christian Doctrine, he offers a more complicated appraisal of Job. Initially Job figures as an example of patience: "PA TIENCE is the virtue which shows itself when we peacefully accept God's promises, supported by confidence in the divine providence, power and goodness: also when we bear any evils that we have to bear calmly, as things which our supreme Father has sent us for our Victoria Kahn 631</page><page sequence="8">good. Job. i.22: in all this Job did not sin or attribute foolishness to God, and ii.10: have we not received good from God, and should we not receive evil?" But Milton goes on to note that Job is also a figure of impatience: "Opposed to this [patience] is impatience towards God, a sin which even the saints are sometimes tempted to commit. I Kings xix.4: he prayed for death; Job iii.2, etc.: perish the day . . . and xix.6, etc.: see, I cry out violently, but I am not heard; though I shout, I receive no judgment . . ." (CD, 2.3.662-63). A similar duality appears when Milton adduces Job as an example of sincerity, integrity, and a good conscience. Milton first defines these virtues as "pursu ing a single good course of action with a sincere and heartfelt desire and sense of purpose"; he then gives as an example Job's desire for justice: "as when Job says in xxvii.5, 6, "till I die I shall not abandon my integrity," or when he declares in xiii.15, "7 approve of my ways before his face . . . and xxxi.5, 6: let him weigh me in a just balance, and let God know my integrity" (CD, 2.2.652-53). While it might seem that Milton is distinguishing between impatience, which is a sin, and the desire for justice, which is a sign of a good conscience, Job's complaint belies this distinction. In this way, Job himself figures ironically as a two-handed sword in Christian Doctrine, an exemplary figure of patience and virtue who also cries out violently and asks to be heard. His words can be quoted to illustrate the foolishness of human wisdom and the sublimity of God's creation; but they can also serve to articulate the entirely human demand for justice in the face of suffering and incoherence. These quotations from Christian Doctrine suggest that Milton was just as interested in Job's demand for justice as in his patient suffering. II. THE SON'S JOBEAN RHETORIC Ever since Barbara Lewalski's pioneering work, critics have agreed that the hermeneutical contest between Satan and Jesus is modeled in a general way on the temptations of Job.32 But what about the Son's distinctive rhetoric? Lewalski noted the rhetorical similarity between the speeches of Satan and Jesus?Satan, she argued, tries to sound reasonable like the Son?but she made no connection to the style of the book of Job. Like Lewalski, Northrop Frye also noted the structural parallels between Paradise Regained and the book of Job. But when he turned to the Son's strategy of quotation, he argued that Satan and Jesus's ironic playing on the same words was sui generis.33 For Frye, the Son's special dialectical skill was appropriate to his uniqueness as 632 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="9">the incarnate Word.34 Most other critics, as far as I can tell, seem to agree. As the previous discussion has shown, however, there is an im portant precedent not just for the structure of Paradise Regained but also for the Son's irony and ambiguity in the central dialogue of the book of Job. I believe that the vehement and ironic Job of the central dialogue is at least as important a model for Milton's Jesus as the pa tient and subservient Job all other critics have emphasized. In other words, I think Milton alludes to Job at least in part to alert his readers that the Son's rhetorical strategies?quotation, mimicry, irony, parody, and playing with the dual meaning of a single word?are precisely the strategies employed by Job in dealing with his comforters. Like Job with his comforters, Jesus likes to echo Satan and, in the process, reveal the false assumptions underlying Satan's tempta tions. When Satan offers to conjure up a banquet in the wilderness, and urges Jesus to eat because he has a "right to all Created things" (PR, 2.324), he is trying to understand the prophecy that Jesus is God's "beloved Son" (PR, 1.32) and to discover the truth of the Son's nature; but he is also tempting the Son to alleviate his hunger with Satan's "gift" rather than rely on God. In this, Satan acts like Job's comfort ers, whose consolations are really temptations. Specifically, they tempt Job to abandon his understanding of God's justice. Just as Job rejects his comforters by parodying their words, so Jesus replies by quoting Satan's own earlier remarks back to him and pointing up the irony of Satan's purported gift: "Saidst thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command?" (PR, 2.379-82) In this reply, Jesus turns Satan's language against him, rejecting Satan's understanding of "right" as the immediate exercise of power in favor of a moral conception of right that may involve deferring the exercise of power. This does not mean that Jesus refuses to act in the world; only that the mere exercise of power is not equivalent to legitimacy: power cannot confer right.35 The Son's Jobean irony and his distinction between right and power prove to be characteristic moves in Paradise Regained. In the course of the poem, Jesus continues to play on Satan's literal-minded understanding and his irony is consistently directed against Satan's theological politics. When Satan offers Jesus wealth to achieve his Victoria Kahn 633</page><page sequence="10">kingly mission on earth, the Son replies by distinguishing between religious doctrine and political power: "to guide nations in the way of truth / By saving doctrine . . . / Is yet more kingly" than the political office offered by Satan (PR, 2.473-76). When Satan sarcastically asks whether Jesus hopes to "regain / [His] right by sitting still or thus retiring" (PR, 3.163-64), Jesus quotes Ecclesiastes 3:1: "All things are best fulfilled in their due time" (PR, 3.182) and effectively equates his political state with the state of humility. After Jesus has rejected the kingdoms of Rome, Parthia, and Athens, Satan in exasperation calls attention to the riddle of Jesus's kingship : "A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, / Real or Allegoric I discern not, / Nor when" (PR, 4.389-91). Satan, that is, urges apocalyptic haste and "zeal" (PR, 3.172), and tries to distinguish real from allegoric, literal from merely figurative. Jesus, however, confounds these expectations with ironic indirection?either by refusing to answer directly or by quoting scripture. The effect of this rhetorical strategy is to help the reader understand that Satan's distinction between real and allegoric is poorly conceived. As Jesus himself tells us later in the poem, he will assume a real throne in the tradition of King David at the end of time; but this throne is also allegorical?a sign not of political power but of moral right. In the intervening period of secular time?the saeculum?however, Milton's Jesus insists on the distinction between political power and religious doctrine, church and state. As the previous quotations have already begun to suggest, the con nection between Jesus and Job is thematic as well as rhetorical. Satan shares certain assumptions with Job's comforters while Jesus acts in ways that are consistent with Job's rejection of their arguments. Sa tan, like Job's comforters, urges that virtue be accompanied by signs of worldly success, such as wealth and power: "all thy heart is set on high designs," Satan says (PR, 2.410); "if at great things thou wouldst arrive, / Get riches first, get wealth, and treasure" (PR, 2.425-26). A little later, Satan asks in exasperation: "These godlike virtues wherefore dost thou hide? . . . wherefore deprive / All earth her wonder at thy acts, [and] thyself/ The fame and glory, glory the reward" (3.21-25). In response, Milton makes Jesus voice Job's radical challenge to a view of God that assumes a direct correspondence between virtue and reward, punishment and vice. (This is the view of Job's friends.) And, in case we missed the connection, he explicitly links the Son's rejection of earthly power to the example of Job: This is true glory and renown, when God Looking on the earth, with approbation marks 634 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="11">The just man, and divulges him through heaven To all his angels, who with true applause Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, They err who count it glorious to subdue By conquest far and wide, to overrun Large countries[.] But if there be in glory aught of good, It may by means far different be attained Without ambition, war, or violence; By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance; I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with saintly patience borne, Made famous in a land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? (PR, 3.60-95) It is a mistake, Jesus asserts, to assume that mastery over oneself must yield mastery over others and that internal kingship must be represented and validated by external kingship. Jesus, that is, rejects Satan's conception of a God whose notion of justice is commensurate with human success and, in doing so, implicitly adopts the patience of Job. It is important to see, however, that this is patience of a very particular kind, one that includes impatience with those "who count it glorious to subdue / By conquest." Just as in Christian Doctrine, where Job's patience was compatible with his demand for justice, so here the Son's patient suffering of Satan's temptations is compatible with his insistence on the distinction between right and power, justice and omnipotence. Satan also seems to share Job's comforters' complacency about wisdom.36 For Satan, wisdom amounts to a kind of figurative empire: "Be famous then / By wisdom: as thy Empire must extend, / So let extend thy mind o'er all the world, / In knowledge, all things in it comprehend" (PR, 4.221-24). In rhyming extend with comprehend, Satan betrays his own sense that wisdom can be measured, mastered, and possessed. Jesus, however, rebuts this complacence with his gno mic reply: "Think not but that I know these things; or think I know them not; not therefore am I short / Of knowing what I ought" (PR, 4.286-88). Here we might hear a riff on Job's sarcastic reply to Zophar: "No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you. But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?" (Job 12:2-3), a passage Milton quotes in a discussion of justified arrogance in Christian Doctrine Victoria Kahn 635</page><page sequence="12">(2.9.734). When Jesus goes on to ask of the Stoics, "what can they teach, and not mislead; / Ignorant of themselves, of God much more" (PR, 4.309-10), we can see that Milton is drawing on Paul's warning against philosophy in Colossians: "philosophy and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after the rudiments of the world" (Col 2:8).37 But we also detect something like Job's reply to the putative wisdom of his friends: "Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value" (Job 13:3-4). III. JOB'S IRONY (2): "ALL MEN ARE SONS OF GOD" Satan's temptations are ostensibly in the service of determining in what sense Jesus is the Son of God, a phrase, Satan shrewdly remarks, which "bears no single sense" (PR, 4.517).38 Milton, too, clearly thought the phrase needed interpreting, not least of all by the Son himself, who struggles to understand his mission throughout the poem. Here, again, Job is an important subtext, one that helps us understand that ques tions of rhetoric in Paradise Regained are inseparable from questions about the Son's nature. For it is a little-noticed fact that throughout Paradise Regained the central question of in what sense Jesus is the "Son of God" is debated through allusions to Job. In book 1, Satan describes how he "came among the sons of God, when [God] / Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job / To prove him, and illustrate his high worth" (PR, 1.368-70). Here Satan alludes to Job 1:6, "The sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord, and Satan came also among them."39 In the passage that follows in the Bible, the whole plot of the book of Job is hatched: Satan tells God he has been "walking up and down in the earth"; God inquires whether Satan has "considered my servant Job"; Satan impugns Job's faith; and God allows Job to be tested (Job 1:7-12). In Paradise Regained, Satan presents his testing of Job as a service to God and a "good temptation" ("to illustrate [Job's] high worth"), and he goes on to insinuate a similar desire to serve God in approaching Jesus: What can be then less in me than desire To see thee and approach thee, whom I know Declared the Son of God[.] (PR, 1.382-84) In response, Jesus rebuts Satan's interpretation of his actions to wards Job: 636 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="13">Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions, but his patience won? (PR, 1.422-26) In this exchange, the book of Job?including God's motives?is itself an object of contradictory interpretations. Satan claims God's direct authority, while Jesus argues for something like God's permissive power and Satan's, Job's?and, by extension, his own?free will. In book 4 of Paradise Regained, Satan again muses on Job 1:6: "The Son of God I also am, or was, / And if I was, I am; relation stands; / All men are sons of God" (PR, 4.518-20). Here, too, the debate about Jesus's sonship becomes a version of Satan's and God's debate about Job's relationship to God. Even the wording of the final scriptural contest recalls Job 1:6. When Satan urges "Cast thyself down; safely if Son of God; / For it is written, He will give command / Concerning thee to his angels," he alludes to Psalm 91:11-12 and, proleptically, to Luke 4:10-11, but the phrase "Son of God" refers us back to Job 1:6. When Jesus replies, "Also it is written, / Tempt not the Lord thy God," he alludes to Deuteronomy 6:16 and proleptically to Luke 4:12, but he also refers us to the distinction between a Son of God and the Lord in Job 1:6. Satan and Jesus, that is, read the same text and use the same phrases, as though to dramatize that the difference between these two "sons of God" cannot be established dogmatically?with reference to particular doctrines or signs?but only ironically, that is, with reference to a mode of speech and its interpretation. In this way, the Son's irony serves to focus our attention not only on his refusal to settle the question posed by Satan, but also on the theological impurity of his dual nature and of a world in which "relation stands," including his relation to Satan. Barbara Lewalski is the only critic I know of who has offered an interpretation of these allusions to Job 1:6. Noting that "the central issue in the dramatic encounter between Christ and Satan is the problem of determining, as Satan put it, In what degree or meaning thou art call'd / The Son of God' (4.516-17)," Lewalski goes on to argue that both God and the Son emphasize Christ's humanity over his divinity. God "affirms the Son's 'birth divine,' but his emphasis is upon Christ's humanity." The Son "has no consciousness of himself as the 'first-begot' or of any pre-existent state in heaven. Instead he displays his merely human, limited understanding." The fact that "hero and antagonist Victoria Kahn 637</page><page sequence="14">begin this duel at approximately the same degree of knowledge" then produces the genuinely dramatic encounter of Christ and Satan in Paradise Regained. Noting the allusions to Job, Lewalski then argues that the emphasis on Christ's humanity and partial knowledge means that "Christ is a man 'far abler' than Job to resist Satan."401 think this is right as far as it goes?but it doesn't go far enough.41 Here, it is important to recall that, according to patristic and seven teenth-century commentators, Job was not a Jew but instead a gentile, who lived before the dissemination of the Law. In Job Expounded Beza noted that Job was noi an "Israelite," but, like other virtuous pagans, he was still knowledgeable about true faith.42 In his sermons on Job, Calvin wrote that it was uncertain whether the law of Moses had been "published" in Job's lifetime, but that God had planted the seed of faith in his heart and engraved it on Job's "conscience."43 This view was con sistent with Paul's assertion in Romans that gentiles had access to the law of nature, even if they did not know scripture directly. In his De jure naturali et gentium, John Seiden argued that Job kept all the Noachide laws?the seven natural laws incumbent on all mankind. (Seidens De Jure, as Jason Rosenblatt has argued, was "the principal source of Milton's natural law thinking.")44 The late seventeenth-century Bishop of Ely, Simon Patrick, drew on Seiden to gloss the biblical description of Job as a "perfect man": because Job kept the Noachide laws he was one of the righteous among nations, entitled to eternal life. For Beza, Calvin, Seiden, Patrick and others, Job was both an example of a virtu ous life and proof that the Holy Spirit spoke to the Gentiles "by such good men as Job."45 Connecting the gentile Job with the Holy Spirit in this way not only made Job a prophet or forerunner of Christ; it also made Christ into an example of the human virtues exhibited by Job. According to Patrick, Christ "came to repair and renew the precepts of natural law" and to cancel "the Law of Moses, in which the Jews had placed too much confidence, while they neglected these natural Precepts."46 In exemplifying the knowledge of natural law, including its transcendence of positive or ceremonial law, this Jobean Christ could sometimes draw near to the interpretation of Christ's patient suffering as a "holy example" of praiseworthy behavior, rather than a sacrificial act of atonement. That is, although seventeenth-century readers rec ognized that Job was a gentile, both their exemplary reading of Job and their reading of Job as a type of Christ could on occasion support a reading of Christ as "Socinian."47 Paradise Regained balances an orthodox view of the Son with a Socinian view. If the frame story makes Jesus's divine nature perfectly 638 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="15">clear and in this sense removes ambiguity, the central books show us a Jesus who is consistent with seventeenth-century readings of Job as a gentile who followed only the precepts of natural law or natural reason. In this sense, the structure of the poem as a whole, like Jesus's ironic mode of speaking, dramatizes the ambiguous relation between divine and human in the incarnation. Rather than asserting the Son's dual nature as a matter of dogma, the poem stages this nature as a problem. For most of the poem, the Son has no supernatural knowledge of his mission. Instead, like other first-century Jews, he demonstrates his faith and obedience through the rational activity of interpretation and debate.48 This activity of interpretation is ultimately dialectical. Not only does Jesus turn Satan's language against Satan, Jesus also turns the Jewish law against itself, revealing a fuller understanding of faith and obedience. In Milton's Christ (as perhaps ultimately in the book of Job itself), Job's legalistic understanding of justice gives way to what we might call dialogue or conversation. But it also reverts to a conception of Jesus as himself embodying the precepts of natural law, which dwell "In pious hearts, an inward oracle" (PR, 1.463). As Jesus says in book 4 of Paradise Regained, "he who receives / Light from above, from the fountain of light, / No other doctrine needs, though granted true" (PR, 4.288-90). This Jesus does not gain his knowledge from scripture so much as he brings the divinely inspired natural light of reason to his biblical reading.49 As Job might, the Son appears to read divine positive law through the precepts of natural law. But this mode of reading, which validates natural understanding (however divinely authorized), in turn poses problems for the orthodox understanding of the crucifixion as the remedy for the fall. And this, I think, is precisely the effect Milton intended with his allusions to Job, including those to Job 1:6. Here it is helpful to turn to those critics, such as William Kerrigan, who have noticed the syntactical confusion of Jesus and Satan as "sons of God" in the pinnacle temptation: So Satan fell and straight a fiery globe Of angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, Who on their plumy vans received him soft From his uneasy station[.] (PR, 4.581-84) According to Kerrigan, through the syntactical ambiguity ("him") that confuses Jesus and Satan, Milton reminds us that they are both created sons of God. In doing so, he implicates God as the source of evil and Victoria Kahn 639</page><page sequence="16">substitutes for the crucifixion (the destruction of the "wrong" son of God), the Son's defeat of Satan. The ambiguity of "him" then suggests that Satan should rightly substitute for Jesus on the cross (which would amount to punishment of the real guilty party). Kerrigan writes: What God has put asunder, Milton joins. Relation stands. There will be a mysterious substitution. Although the future of his hero is not subject to his wish, the poet knows that at the hour when the wrath of God falls on his forsaken Son, charged with the sins of the world, the Son is Satan. The angels receive him, preparing him for the cross that will one day stand on the pinnacles of temples[.]50 Although Kerrigan does not mention Job, his reading of the Jobean phrase "sons of God" as implicating God in the problem of evil points us in the direction of Job's complaint. IV. JOB'S COMPLAINT In the previous pages, I've argued that Job's impatience with his comforters, including his ironic repetition of their own words, is one model for the Son's ironic responses to Satan. But early modern readers understood that Job's impatience extended above all to God, whom Job wished to call to account. For these readers and commentators, Job's irritable disputing with God was ultimately a sign of his faith. In the preface to Job Expounded, Beza distinguished between Job's constancy and the "unsensibleness" of the Stoics. According to Beza, Job's constancy is compatible with his passionate outbursts, which are a sign that he is being tried by God. In his sermons on Job, Calvin also rebutted the Stoics and linked Job's passionate outbursts against God to the capacity for virtue: Brute beasts sometimes feel nothing, but they are not virtuous on that account. So then, let us note that the word 'patience' does not mean that men should be drugged, that they should have no sadness, that they should not be offended when they experience some affliction; but the virtue is when they are able to restrain themselves and so hold themselves in bounds that they do not cease to glorify God in the mist of all their affliction.51 Elsewhere Calvin was even more explicit about the legitimacy of Job's complaints: [Job says] "Behold, yet must I dispute with God concerning my ways; that is to say, the hope that I have is not such that it is utterly unmixed 640 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="17">with complaints...." It is true that this proceeds from weakness [Calvin observes] . . . but though such is the case, God does not altogether let him go. . . . When we hope in God, and call upon Him, that is not to say that we should never have any conflicts in ourselves; but faith must get the upper hand.52 In his Exposition upon Job, Caryl had a more humorous take on the question of whether Job was really so patient: "Is it not strange, that a man should not be weary with arguing, while he often professes he was wearied with living?"53 Noting that some Jewish writers thought Job's "cursing the day" bordered on blasphemy, Caryl responded that Job's cursing is analogous to Christ's sorrowful questioning of God on the cross in Matthew 27:46.54 Such questioning is allowed, according to Caryl, as long as the questioner retains his faith: Wee may aske God, the question [why do the wicked prosper?], and plead with him about his judgements, but we must not have the least jealousie or suspition of his righteousnesse or of his judgements.55 These defenses of Job's quarreling are consistent with Milton's posi tion in Christian Doctrine. There Milton remarks that "Sensibility to pain, and complaints or lamentations, are not inconsistent with true patience, as may be seen from the example of Job and of other holy men in adversity" (CD, 2.10.740). I now want to suggest that Milton pursues the analogy between the Son and the impatient Job of the central dialogue further than Beza, Calvin, and Caryl. Specifically, Milton makes the central dialogue of Job a model for his own questioning of God. To put this another way, although the Son doesn't complain to God in Paradise Regained, Milton does through his representation of the Son. Let me explain what I mean by returning to the book of Job. In the passage I quoted earlier, Caryl refers to the divine counterplot, by which he means God's plot to have Christ defeat Satan by using Satan's own "device." As we've seen, the Son does this rhetorically in Paradise Regained by turning Satan's language and assumptions against him. But, as many readers of the Bible have recognized, there is a further?one might say deeper?counterplot at the heart of the book of Job, which in turn casts a shadow on Paradise Regained. This is what one modern com mentator has called Job's imagining of a counter-deity.56 In particular, the impatient Job of the central dialogue uses a highly charged legal vocabulary to stake his claim for justice. (Aquinas, Calvin, Beza, and Caryl all explicitly noted this legal vocabulary.) This Job objects to a Victoria Kahn 641</page><page sequence="18">deity who combines judicial and executive power, that is, the functions of judge and the person who has the power to enforce the judgment. He wishes for a legal transcription of his complaint (see Job 19:23-24). In Job's famous line "I know that my redeemer liveth" (Job 19:25), which was regularly interpreted by Christians as a foreshadowing of Christ, Job is in fact calling for a legal advocate or mediator (Hebrew: go'el), who will represent his complaint against God. He also imagines a heavenly courtroom where an impartial judge would hear the com plaints of Job and God alike. He reiterates this request in Job 31:35: "Oh that one would hear me! Behold, my desire is that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book."57 In one reading of Job, then, the central dialogue or poem presents us with Job's radical imagining of a counter-deity, one who will advocate for Job against the angry primary deity58 This is, of course, very much how Milton imagines Christ in book 3 o? Paradise Lost. There God is, notoriously, the angry God of the Hebrew Bible, and Christ is a kind of counter-deity who pleads with God not to be vengeful in dealing with Adam and Eve. In book 11 of Paradise Lost, Christ explicitly refers to himself as an "advocate" for fallen man (11.33).59 The Son of Paradise Regained functions in a similar way. On the one hand, Jesus is himself a Job figure vis-?-vis Satan, turning Satan's language against itself and resisting the temptation to blaspheme God. On the other hand, the Son's verbal combat amounts to a tacit Jobean complaint against God; in this complaint, Jesus functions as Job's (and his own) advocate and counter-deity. This view of Jesus is supported by the fact that, in the poem as a whole, Milton plays down the crucifixion and "mutes the vicarious activity of atonement," thereby implicitly raising questions about penal satisfaction and gesturing towards Socinianism.60 Interestingly, one seventeenth-century critic of Socinianism, Francis Cheynell, associated the critique of the doctrine of penal satisfaction with quarreling with God. Socinus, according to Cheynell, "taught the world a new way of disputing in Divinity," that held God to the standards of the "light of reason." In his attack on Socinus, Cheynell went so far as to call this rationalist demand for justice "Jewish" rather than Christian.61 Taking a cue from Cheynell as well as Job, we could see Paradise Regained as a sotto voce disputing with divinity about the justice of the crucifixion. Despite CheynelPs slurs, however, this does not mean that Milton is of the devil's party. Just as seventeenth-century commentators saw Job's complaining as a sign of his faith, so here too Jesus's concern with justice?both earthly and divine justice?is compatible with faith in Milton's understanding. 642 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="19">At the same time, it seems clear that Milton carries Job's demand for justice one step further than the author of the book of Job. When in the Bible God appears from the whirlwind, he both legitimates and silences Job's demand for justice. That is, although he deigns to speak with Job rather than his comforters, he refuses to answer Job's questions about the reasons for his suffering. In the book of Job, divine omnipotence ultimately trumps the rational demand for justice. In Paradise Regained, by contrast, God does not appear out of the whirlwind to put an end to the Son's activity of interpretation. Although the Son is caught up by the angels near the end of the poem, he ultimately returns to his mother's house to work out his this-worldly vocation. The poem suggests?in a way that is consistent with Milton's Socinian interpretation of the Son?that salvation takes place not through penal suffering but through the verbal action of debate or dialogue. But if the poem dramatizes the way paradise is regained by "vanquishing / [the] Temptation" of Satan's wily propositions through the rational activity of biblical interpretation (PR, 4.607-608), it also suggests that quarreling with God is a crucially important aspect of Milton's rationalist faith.62 V. JOB'S SECRETARY I have argued that Milton's comparison of Jesus to Job insinuates a Job-like complaint, a subliminal counterplot questioning the God who permitted the crucifixion. That is, in modeling Christ on the rhetori cal Job of the central dialogue in the book of Job, Milton allusively suggests that both Jesus?and Milton?have a legitimate complaint against God. Milton intensifies this effect by not having God appear from the whirlwind at the end of Paradise Regained to manifest his own omnipotence, as God does in the conclusion to Job. Moreover, because Milton stops short of the theophany in Job, in which God effectively squashes Job's complaints, and because he plays down the idea of Christ's vicarious atonement for mankind, he keeps the focus on the horizontal dimension of secular time and on the questions about divine justice and ethical human action?as though to say these are the pressing human questions which we must continue to engage until the question is foreclosed. Here, Milton's allusions to Job open up a space for a secular notion of poetry. Let me explain what I mean. In the Bible, in the passage just before Job wishes for an advocate and counter-deity, Job imagines a legal transcription of his com plaint: Victoria Kahn 643</page><page sequence="20">Oh that my words were now written! Oh that they were printed in a book! That they were graven with an iron pen, and [with] lead in the rock for ever! (Job 19:23-24) These lines have usually been understood as Job's request for a graven monument to his suffering. It might seem that, once God ap pears from the whirlwind, no such monument is possible for its very premise (a legitimate complaint against God) is destroyed. From this perspective, the ultimate irony of the book of Job is that?in Joseph Caryl's words?God does eventually provide Job with a "secretary."63 If he hadn't, we wouldn't have the scriptural book of Job. But in the central poem of Job, in Job's own imagination, it is the advocate who authorizes the writing of Job's legal complaint. The advocate, that is, authorizes a different kind of writing, the kind that is preoccupied with justice in the present?that is, in secular time. I'm suggesting, in other words, that when Milton presents the Son as Job's advocate, the Son becomes a figure who authorizes not only Milton's criticism of the Restoration state, but also his own politically charged, secular activity as a poet. This is the poet who, in writing Paradise Regained, does not simply defer to scripture as the authoritative record of the life of Jesus; instead, he "tell[s] of deeds / Above Heroic, though in secret done, / And unrecorded left through many an Age" (PR, 1.14-16).64 But can the Son really be authorizing a secular conception of po etry, by which I mean a conception of poetry that has an independent status as a purely human creation? What about the famous temptation of learning in Paradise Regained, where Satan offers Jesus classical learning and eloquence, presumably including the classical poetry that Milton loved and imitated, and Jesus appears to reject them? One standard response is to assert that, late in life, Milton came to believe in the incompatibility of humanist literature and faith, or the irrelevance of the former to the latter. Another?in my view more compelling?response is to argue that the Son didn't really reject all of classical learning, only some of it: when he condemns pagan literature, he explicitly makes an exception for literature in which "moral virtue is express'd / By light of Nature, not in all quite lost" (PR, 4.351-52).65 Here we might say that, just as some Christians saw Job as a pagan figure whose faith could serve as a supplement?however redundant?to Christian faith, so pagan literature is imagined here as a supplement?however unnecessary?to scripture.66 It is unnecessary not only for doctrinal but also for literary reasons?that is, not only because the man of faith doesn't need to be instructed by pagan writ ers, but also because scripture is already poetry: 644 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="21">All our Law and Story strew'd With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib'd Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, That pleas'd so well our Victors' ear, declare That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv'd; 111 imitated^] (PR, 4:334-39)67 Jesus' claim here conforms to the patristic and Renaissance view that the Bible was itself a compendium of literary forms. Paradoxically, however, the Son's claim for the literary exemplarity of scripture and the derivativeness of classical "Fable, Hymn, or Song" (PR, 4.341) ends up authorizing a secular notion of literature. In the patristic tradition, Job was regularly singled out as one of the most poetic books of the Hebrew Bible. When Beza praised the style of Job, he was drawing on a long tradition of commentary extending at least as far back as Jerome, who argued that the central chapters of Job were written in hexameter verse.68 Thomas Aquinas also drew on Jerome to argue that Job "is written in the manner of a poem. Hence, through this whole book the author uses the figures and styles which poets customarily use."69 But, as Barbara Lewalski has noted, the effect of this literary account of the Bible was not simply to assert the superiority of scrip ture to the classics, but also to authorize the writing of poetry.70 Thus, when Milton describes the book of Job as a brief epic in The Reason of Church Government, his point seems to be not just that scripture uses tropes and figures, but that poets may use scripture to authorize their own interventions in the specifically literary tradition inherited from the ancients. This is precisely what happens in Paradise Regained, where the Son articulates what Robert Alter has called "the double canonicity" of Hebrew scripture?its literary as well as doctrinal ex emplarity.71 In arguing that scripture alone is the repository of all the wisdom that is necessary for faith, Milton makes his own poetry not only redundant but also autonomous. If scripture is self-sufficient and doesn't need Milton's poetry, it follows that the poet is not bound by what scripture "records." Ironically, what has been left "unrecorded" in scripture, judging from Paradise Regained, is the Son's own poetry. Poetry is what Milton adds to the biblical account of Jesus. In this way, Milton suggests that poetry is the rhetorical mode most appropriate to the Son s ambigu ous nature, most appropriate to his existence in the saeculum, which is itself constituted by its ironic "relation" to the sacred. At the same time, Milton makes it clear that poetry is also the proper mode for Victoria Kahn 645</page><page sequence="22">ordinary human beings, among them John Milton, to understand their own ambiguous location in secular life, including their relation to sacred texts. Poetry is privileged in this way because, for Milton, the secular realm is ideally defined not by the absence of faith or religion (as it has often been in modern discussions) but rather by the absence of dogmatism, in the form of detachable pronouncements that bear only "a single sense." Milton's Jesus is thus a redeemer in more than one sense of the word (as is appropriate for a poem in which so much turns on double senses). He will ultimately redeem mankind, but in the meantime he redeems Job's iron pen and rock, that is, he authorizes the independent activity of poetry, which we might think of as the "counterplot" to the "authorized version" of scripture.72 VI. DISMANTLING SCRIPTURE We can now return to the literary and theological implications of Son's own practice of biblical quotation?his own practice of interpret ing the Hebrew Bible before that interpretation is canonized as the New Testament. A particularly striking example is the final temptation scene where Satan and Christ struggle over the new meaning of the Jobean phrase "son of God." As we've seen, Satan alludes to Psalm 91 and the Son counters with Deuteronomy 6:16 (both of which then appear in Luke 4:10-12). From one perspective, Milton could be said to be dramatizing the way canonical Christian scripture is created out of a process of interpretation.73 But in reading backwards from Luke to its pre-texts in Hebrew scripture, Milton could also be said to be dismantling scripture for the purposes of its dramatic exposition in poetry. As an exemplary reader of the Hebrew Bible, Jesus not only demonstrates that scripture is itself a thing indifferent that can be put to better or worse uses (as Stanley Fish argued long ago); he also engages in an ironic practice of repetition and quotation, one that does not decide the question at issue. Rather than staging a sublime drama of divine power?as the Job poet does in the final theophany?the Son imitates the radical irony of Job, especially Job's ironic reuse of the language of his comforters. This foregrounding of interpretive practice is consistent with Milton's view that God deliberately made scripture unreliable in order to force Christian readers to assume re sponsibility for interpretation, to rely on their individual consciences rather than a text whose material transmission was uncertain.74 Irony, here, is the rhetorical equivalent of a theology and ethics that stress human responsibility and choice. The focus on interpretive practice 646 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="23">is also consistent with Milton's representation of Jesus as defeating Satan through moral resistance and verbal wit rather than through the crucifixion. Such a representation of Jesus corresponds to what Harold Fisch has described as "Milton's desire to naturalize, or [even] . . . 'demythologize' the gospel narrative."75 This is precisely what Milton in Paradise Regained does to the language of scripture, when he models his poem on the language of Job. I'm suggesting, in other words, that in his ironic allusions to Job, the Son doesn't simply register a complaint against God the Father; he also helps us see that this critique is?at least in Paradise Regained?a model for the secular work of literature. That is, in modeling the Son's speech on Job s ironic repetition of his friends, Milton also demon strates the critical appropriation of religious discourse for literature through the process of repetition or quotation. In a well known article on Milton, Fredric Jameson once suggested that this is precisely what happens?albeit unintentionally?in Paradise Lost.76 Figuration, he argued, does not merely replicate the reigning ideology, including re ligious ideology. Instead, in representing ideology, literature decisively transforms and unmasks it. Jameson illustrates this claim by referring to Milton's unpleasant depiction of God in book 3 of Paradise Lost. We should take this picture of God, he argues, "less as testimony about Milton's theological beliefs" than as a demonstration of the way in which the anthropomorphic representation of God ends up undermining the very ideology of Providence it sets out to embody.77 Paradise Lost, that is, produces an unintended critique of the theology it claims to defend. I believe, to the contrary, that Milton intended to produce the unpleasant God in book 3 of Paradise Lost; and that the references and allusions to Job in Paradise Regained produces the same challenge to God the Father.78 Figuration, irony, repetition, and quotation are central to this chal lenge, as we see when the Son appropriates the sublime power of the Hebrew Bible for his own purposes. While, in the Son's hands, this appropriation will eventually produce the New Testament, in Milton's, it produces Paradise Regained.79 Moreover, I believe Milton went out of his way to call our attention to the specifically literary achievement of this imitation of scripture in the prologue to the poem. Here the poet describes his singing "Recover'd Paradise" in lines that allude to the opening of Renaissance editions of the Aeneid: I who erewhile the happy garden sung, By one man's disobedience, now sing Victoria Kahn 647</page><page sequence="24">Recovered Paradise to all mankind, By one mans firm obedience fully tried[.] (PR, 1.1-4) Just as the Son will save mankind by passing (in theological terms, re capitulating) the test of obedience that Adam failed (and Job passed), so Milton will save the epic by recasting the classical epic of empire as the epic of self-mastery. Paradise Lost now appears as mere pastoral ("the happy garden"); that is, as a mere prelude to the real epic of self-conquest. In other words, the allusion to Renaissance editions of Virgil in the opening lines of Paradise Regained invites us to read Paradise Regained as a sublime troping of the epic tradition. As Louis Martz has shown, these lines do so in part by gesturing towards Virgil's fourth G?orgie, where they can also be found. And the same is true of the structure and style of Paradise Regained. In his brief epic, Milton conspicuously imitates not only Job but Virgil's Georgics, borrowing both its four book structure and its middle style. Moreover, as Anthony Low has shown, there are striking parallels between Milton's Jesus and Virgil's laborer, as well as between Virgil's reluctance to write epic before the time is ripe and the Son's own waiting for the right occasion to act.80 The centrality of the Georgics to Paradise Regained is just one of the ways Milton invites us to see that the Son's Job-like patience involves labor?specifically a labor of interpretation and appropriation?rather than mere passivity.81 In this light, it is particularly striking that the Son's final contest on the pinnacle?a contest in which he ironically parries Satan's scriptural quotation with another scriptural quotation? produces in turn an explosion of epic similes, comparing the Son's defeat of Satan to Hercules s defeat of Antaeus and Oedipus's destruction of the sphinx. In contrast to the conclusion of the book of Job, with its fierce assertion of God's creative power as "manifested in the natural world," Paradise Regained directs our attention to the creative power of the literary tradition and its continuing effects in the human world.82 It's as though Milton were suggesting that, while the ultimate defeat of Satan is deferred ("when time shall be / Of Tempter and Temptation without fear" [PR, 4.616-17]), the immediate achievement of the Son is to both appropriate the rhetorical power of classical literature and preserve the saeculum in which Milton's poetry has a role to play. The epic of self-conquest thus takes the form of an activity of interpretation, whose completion is, in Paradise Regained, ostentatiously deferred. For Milton, then, paradise regained is not the literal-minded paradise of the martyr, who imagines heavenly rewards in the afterlife. Nor 648 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="25">is it the earthly paradise of the biblical Job who?at the end of his trials?receives such rewards in this life. Instead, paradise regained is a specifically ironic mode of understanding. The effect is not to disable the scriptural idea of the covenant but rather to enable the secular version of this contract?the ongoing activity of interpretation that we know as literature.83 What, then, we might ask, is the difference between scripture and literature, between a sacred text and a secular one? In the previous pages, I've argued that the Son distinguishes between scripture and literature. Sacred texts are the inspired word of God; secular literary texts comment on or interpret scripture, when they do not turn their attention elsewhere entirely84 But, in another way, we could say that the implication of Paradise Regained, as of Milton's oeuvre as a whole, is that there are no privileged sacred texts. In appropriating the sublimity of scripture through the ongoing activity of interpretation, Milton also breaks down the distinction between scripture and poetry. Like Satan, who easily overleaps the garden wall in Paradise Lost, thereby breaking down the distinction between the inside and outside of paradise; or Michael, who instructs Adam to attribute to sanctity no place; Milton does the same to the boundary between sacred and secular texts and in the process produces, though not for the first time, the secular activity of literature.85 But literary sublimity in Paradise Regained has not yet been sublimated into a merely aesthetic phenomenon, since the activity of literature in turn intervenes in contemporary politi cal debate.86 If we think of Job's irony and Christ's lowly manner of speaking as sublime (as both were regularly thought to be), we could say that Milton turns this rhetorical sublimity into a metaphor for his politics. In rejecting the temptations of Satan and quietly returning to his mother's house, the Son dramatizes a conception of religious faith as a matter of private, individual belief; belief that cannot be coerced by public institutions or state power. This belief was a central aspect of Milton's conception of politics, as well as of the distinctive role of literature in public life. VIL JOBEAN RESISTANCE In my reading of Paradise Regained, then, Milton has imagined a Jesus who is modeled on Job, conceived of not merely as a theological figure but also as a literary one. The literary strategies of the Son are in turn inseparable from his ethical and political exemplarity. As we have seen, in Paradise Regained Milton is less interested in theodicy than in Victoria Kahn 649</page><page sequence="26">questioning God's ways. Rather than focusing on the saving work of the crucifixion, Milton interprets Jesus as an exemplary figure of constancy and ironic critique, like Job. This interpretation in turn makes Jesus and Job figures for the purely human resistance to diabolical tempta tion, including the temptation to theological politics. Sixteenth- and seventeenth-century commentators on Job regularly singled out the topical relevance of Job's resistance. To cite just one example, in the 1640s Joseph Caryl read Job as a topical meditation on the trauma of the English civil war. In the process, he explicitly distinguished Job, whose sufferings bore no relation to his "uprightness," from the English, who were guilty of "wickedness" and needed to repent. Caryl then went on to comment on the difficulty of understanding scripture and the even greater difficulty of making one's life a commentary on scripture.87 Milton, I believe, read Job in much the same way, and in Paradise Regained he suggests to Restoration readers that the Son's irony and his Job-like powers of resistance have purely human uses as well. If we accept that Milton's allusions to Job are designed to bring the Son's rhetorical irony to the fore, we can see this irony as an instrument of liberty at a time when Milton's contemporaries, as well as Jesus's, had fallen victim to tyranny from without and servitude from within.88 The Son of Paradise Regained, then, is a critic of the state power offered by Satan (the regular gloss on Job's Leviathan) and his problem is how to be in the world without simply reinforcing the status quo. The answer turns out to lie in the Son's Job-like strategy of quotation and his ethical posture of irony. Irony is the rhetorical equivalent of the Son's avoidance of theological politics and its apocalyptic rhetoric of zeal. In this context, the Son's ironic rejection of David s throne? that is, the earthly throne offered by Satan?places the emphasis on the horizontal medium of secular time in which the Second Coming is necessarily deferred so that human deliberation and action?including literary activity?can take place. In making Jesus a Jobean ironist, Milton makes the Son's rhetoric both a vehicle of political resistance to the totalizing power of Leviathan (in his refusal to conflate divinity and worldly power, theology and politics), and a metonym for the work of literature. In neither case can the Son's patience be equated with passivity or quietism or even simply heroic suffering; verbal action is the form that agency takes in the meantime of the Restoration.89 The Son's Jobean irony, however, is not only directed against Satan's political vision; as I have argued, it is also implicates scripture. Here, in conclusion, we need once again to recall that the central dialogue of 650 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="27">the book of Job presents a radical critique of the biblical God, framed by a Prologue and Epilogue that try to squash all such questioning. In the conclusion to Paradise Regained, however, God does not appear out of a whirlwind to put an end to debate and dialogue. Instead, the final defeat of Satan is deferred and the Son returns home to his mother's house "private" and "unobserv'd" (PR 4.639, 4.638) In a Jo bean disputing with divinity, Milton displaces our attention from the soteriology of the crucifixion to the ethical exemplarity of the Son's verbal activity. In this light, the Son's verbal sparring in the wilderness is not only the preparation for his subsequent ministry of preaching, it is also a model for our own regaining of paradise. This in turn has consequences for poetry. Like Job, Milton's Son is a literary critic of scripture, whose characteristic mode of speaking involves the ironic quotation of passages from the Hebrew Bible. This ironic reuse in turn provides a model for John Milton, the poet, whose poetic supplement of the New Testament account of Christ's temptations allows him to "record" what was previously "unsung." Thus, if the figure of Job suggests Milton's own desperate condition at the Restoration, we can also say that in Paradise Regained Job's irony is the model for Milton's literary success.

Press, 1966) and Mary Ann Radzinowicz, Towards "Samson Agonistes": The Growth of Milton's Mind (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1978), 251-262. In chapter two of her book, Lewalski describes two main interpretive traditions regarding Job: the Reformed Protestant exegesis of Job, which focused on Job's frailty in the central dialogues, and the dominant Catholic tradition (which was also adopted by many Protestants) which focused on the frame story and emphasized Job's heroic?and Victoria Kahn 651</page><page sequence="28">thus epic?combat. See Lewalski, 10-36. Lewalski goes on to claim that "this heroic exegesis of Job was predominant not only in Catholic, but in Protestant, and especially Calvinist commentary" (24). The typological reading of Job as foreshadowing Christ's sufferings is, according to Lewalski, part of this epic exegesis. See Lewalski, 27. As the title of her book indicates, Lewalski believes Milton follows this second tradition. Elsewhere, Lewalski writes, "Although martial imagery is used to describe Christ, and although he is engaged in a transformed epic duel, he belongs in the category of the patient and suffering heroes?Christs, Magdalens, Adams, Susannas, Josephs, Jobs" (107). In Radzinowicz's sensitive reading, "the function of the book of Job as Milton read it was to shatter the 'mistaken . . . doctrine' or false orthodoxy of its protagonist without shattering his faith, that is, to replace his inherited theology or implicit faith with an understanding and truer faith that can equip him for the realities of mortal life" (Towards "Samson Agonistes," 253). In my reading, Milton is equally interested in the complaining Job of the dialogues and the legitimacy of those complaints. In unpublished recent work, Annabel Patterson has proposed an alternative model for the dialogic form of Paradise Regained, which I address below in note 35. Although most critics note that the book of Job is a model for Paradise Regained, I'm not aware of any critic (besides Victoria Silver whom I discuss in note 41 below) who explores the implications of Jobs irony for a reading of the poem. 6 Dayton Haskin, Milton's Rurden of Interpretation (Philadelphia: Univ. of Penn sylvania Press, 1994), 120. The phrase "the uniform tenor of scripture" is taken from Milton, Christian Doctrine. 7 Haskin, 121. 8 Although one might argue that these features of the Son's rhetoric are characteristic of Milton's poetry throughout his career, it's striking that critics of Paradise Regained have tended instead to claim that the rhetoric of the poem?including playing on the meaning of a single word?is unusual. See below on "The Sons Jobean Rhetoric." 9 On the language of occasion in the poem, see David Norbrook, "Republican Occasions in Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes," Milton Studies 42 (2003): 122-48. 10 John Coffey, "Pacifist, Quietist, or Patient Militant?

Hereafter abbreviated CD and cited parenthetically by book, chapter, and page. 12 In his Milton's God (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1961), William Empson offers the extreme version of this line of interpretation with regard to Paradise Lost, though he seems not to have thought that Milton intended to raise such questions about God's justice. 13 See Moshe Greenberg, "Job," in The Literary Guide to the Rihle, ed.

See OED, s.v. "device." Milton is clearly alluding to the same inversion of Satan's device in the opening lines of Paradise Regained: "now sing / Recover'd Paradise to all mankind, / By one man's firm obedience fully tried / Through all temptation and the Tempter foil'd / In all his wiles" (PR, 1:2-6). 25 Caryl, Preface to the Reader, in his An Exposition . . . upon the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th chapters of the Book of Job, n.p. 26 Caryl, An Exposition . . . upon the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th chapters of the Book of Job, 357, 358. 27 Caryl, Exposition , . . upon the three first Chapters of the Book of Job, 13. 28 Caryl, An Exposition . . . upon the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th chapters of the Book of Job, 354. 29 Milton was familiar with Caryl's commentary on Job but found it wanting, though his complaint seems to have been motivated primarily by Caryl's criticism of his divorce tracts. In Colasterion, Milton wrote that Caryl was incapable of understanding real "discontents" and that he had "no more true sense of a good man in his afflictions, then those Edomitish Freinds had, of whom/o?&gt; complains, and against whom God testifies his anger" (Colasterion, in Complete Prose Works, 2:728, quoted in Haskin, 75). 30 Radzinowicz, Towards "Samson Agonistes", 258-59. See also Milton, Christian Doctrine, 1.17.459. 31 According to Radzinowicz, passages such as these clearly show that Milton "read the Book of Job as declaring truths about the nature of God which in their effects upon men could lead to growth in virtue" (Towards "Samson Agonistes," 259), once their inadequate understanding of themselves and of God had been revised. See also Radzinowicz, Towards "Samson Agonistes," 253. 32 See, for example, Haskin, 148, and Radzinowicz, "How Milton Read the Bible," 210. 33 See Northrop Frye, "Revolt in the Desert," in his The Return of Eden (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1965), 129. Frye acknowledges the "dialectical colloquies" of Victoria Kahn 653</page><page sequence="30">Plato, Boethius, and Job as precursors, but goes on to assert that "these forms usually either incorporate one argument into another dialectically or build up two different cases rhetorically; Milton's feat of constructing a double argument on the same words, each highly plausible and yet as different as light from darkness, is, so far as I know, unique in English literature" ("Revolt in the Desert," 135-36). Frye also asserts that only Satan quibbles while the Son of Paradise Regained "speaks throughout with . . . simplicity and plainness"; but this ignores the ironic rhetorical effect of the Son's quota tions of scripture. See also Frye, "The Typology o? Paradise Regained," in Milton's Epic Poetry, ed. C. A. Patrides (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1967), 309, 314. 34 To turn Satan's words inside out was the verbal equivalent of Christ's "rejecting everything that Satan offers in Satan's sense [in order to get] it again in its true or spiritual form" (Frye, "Revolt in the Desert," 129). This Christ is able to decipher riddles, including the riddle of the Sphinx at the end of the poem. Frye comments: "Christ has not only overcome temptation, but, as the Word of God, he has solved the verbal riddle of human life, putting all the words which are properly attributes of God into their rightful context" ("Revolt in the Desert," 13). 35 Joan S. Bennett makes this point about Christ's redefinition of "right" in her Reviving Liberty: Radical Christian Humanism in Milton's Great Poems (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1989), 172. Of course, one might argue that Job is not the only biblical or literary figure to engage in this strategy of ironic quotation. In an obvious way, the entire New Testament is made up of ironic or typological quotations of the "Old Testament" or Hebrew Bible. In recent, unpublished work, Annabel Patterson has argued that Milton derived the debate version of this New Testament practice of quotation from John Bale's Temptacyon of Christ (1547). According to Patterson, Bale correctly perceived that the temptations were presented in Luke as a "contest of wits," and that Satan learned his strategy of quotation from Christ himself. In other words, "It was Bale who showed Milton that the Gospel account of the temptation could be construed as an exercise in biblical citation, legitimate and illegitimate." The parallels are impressive (though Patterson does not definitively establish that Milton read Bale's play), but many of the points she makes?such as that Bale departs from the usual understandings of the temptations and substitutes distrust of God's word or blasphemy?can be found earlier in Job (for example, Job's wife tempting Job to "curse God and die"). Moreover, Milton explicitly links both the critique of earthly power and Christ's strategy of quotation to Job, not Bale. 36 Lewalski notes the connection with Job when she observes that Milton could have found a model for this particular temptation in Francis Quarles's Job Militant (1624). See Lewalski, 120, 125-26. 37 See also Haskin, 152. 38 Milton scholars are divided over the question of whether Milton's Satan knows Jesus is the Son of God and, if he does, what this means. They are also divided about what it means for Jesus to know he is the Son of God. Haskin follows Lewalski in arguing that "the Son of God in Paradise Regained is thoroughly human and does not possess any advantage of superhuman knowledge" (152). 39 Lewalski cites the allusions to Job (see her Milton's Brief Epic, 133-34), as does John Carey in his edition of Milton's Complete Shorter Poems (Longman: New York, 1992). Carey draws no conclusion; I discuss Lewalski's conclusion below. The phrase also appears in Psalms 2.7. Of course, the phrase reappears prominently in the New Testament. See, for example, Hebrews 5.5, Romans 8.14, Galatians 3.26 and 4.4-7, Matthew 3.17 and 26.64. Also relevant is Milton's chapter on "The Son of God" in Christian Doctrine (see 1.5.204-80). 654 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="31">40 Lewalski, Milton's Brief Epic, 134, 159, 134. 41 Lewalski explores in detail Milton's views on the dual nature of Christ. While arguing that Milton emphasizes the Son's human nature in Paradise Regained, she also argues that "the incarnate Christ is the occasional recipient of special divine il lumination" (Milton's Brief Epic, 159). At the same time, she reads the final angelic choir as merely confirming Christ's humanly gained understanding of his identity. See Lewalski, Milton's Brief Epic, 318. Besides Lewalski and Radzinowicz, Victoria Silver is the only other critic I know of who has offered an extended interpretation of Paradise Regained'?, allusions to Job, in her Milton and the Predicament of Irony (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 2001). While acknowledging that the frame and central poem were written at different times, Silver claims that Milton read them as a single text which concludes by celebrating both God's accommodation of himself to humankind through the covenant and his ultimate unknowability. See Silver, 26-44. According to Silver, Jesus is like Job because "he expands human possibility by his preternatural poise, expressing his belief that there is another meaning potential in his predicament than his own guilt or God's abandon ment" (30). Drawing on Gerhard von Rad s claim that "the question absorbing Job is not the great existential crux of human suffering," Silver argues that Job is concerned instead with "God's apparent absence or indifference" to his covenant with man (31). Eventually, however, Job undergoes a conversion or revised understanding of God, according to which the covenant serves to accommodate but not fully capture God for human understanding (see 38). Jesus, by contrast (in Silver's reading), does not make the mistake of identifying "the covenantal picture with the nature and extent of deity, as though the human were bound to human expectations and human necessities of meaning" (34). Unlike Job, Milton's Christ "does not assume that God is like us" (30). This is a brilliant but still conventional reading of Christ as the antitype of Job, one that is anticipated by Radzinowicz's reading of the allusions to Job in Paradise Regained in Towards "Samson Agonistes". Elsewhere, Silver compares Job's lamentations to those of the speaker of the invocations of Paradise Lost (see 197, for example). This is closer to my own sense of Milton's use of Job in Paradise Regained. 42 Beza, "Preface," n.p. 43 Calvin, Sermons from Job, 219. 44 Jason P. Rosenblatt, Torah and Law in 'Paradise Lost' (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1994), 126.

Press, 2006), especially 155-57 on Seiden s "midrash" on Job 31 as providing evidence that Job kept the seven Noachide laws. Rosenblatt argues that the Noachide laws for Seiden were not simply the same as intuitive natural law but encompassed specific divine pronouncements uttered by God at a particular historical moment. The point here is that natural law has to be learned. 45 Simon Patrick, Appendix to Volume 3 of his A Commentary upon the Historical Books of the Old Testament (London, 1738-1743), 60. See also Patrick, The Book of Job Paraphras'd (London, 1679). 46 Patrick, Preface to his The Book of Job Paraphras'd, n.p. 47 Socinianism designates a reformed sect of Protestantism deriving from the work of Faustus Socinus, whose beliefs included anti-Trinitaranism, the notion that Jesus?though conceived by the Holy Spirit?has only a human nature, and the idea that scripture was accessible to rational interpretation. Equally important, according to Michael Lieb, Socinians downplayed the crucifixion "as a work of salvation," and Victoria Kahn 655</page><page sequence="32">stressed instead "the Resurrection and Ascension of Christ as a sign of the eventual salvation of his brethren in the fullness of time." The work of salvation was thus "not in any way tied to the doctrine of penal satisfaction" (Lieb, "Milton and the Socinian Heresy," in Milton and the Grounds of Contention, ed. Mark R. Kelley, Lieb, and John T. Shawcross [Pittsburgh: Duquesne Univ. Press, 2003], 241). On Milton's knowledge of and attitude towards Socinianism, see also Hugh MacCallum, Milton and the Sons of God: The Divine Image in Milton's Epic Poetry (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1986), esp. 53-58; and John Rogers, "Milton's Circumcision," in Milton and the Grounds of Contention, 188-213. Rogers also presented a paper on Milton's Socinianism in Para dise Lost at Yale in May 2006. In this note I have drawn on Earl Morse Wilbur's A History of Unitarianism: Socinianism and its Antecedents (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1945). On Socinianism in seventeenth-century England, see Hugh Trevor-Roper, Catholics, Anglicans, and Puritans (Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1987), 186. I return to Socinianism in the section entitled "Job's Complaint" below. 48 See Lieb, 240 on the Socinian insistence on the compatibility of reason and scripture. In Christian Doctrine 1.14 and 1.15, Milton explicitly rejects the Socinian view of Christ as mere man and of the crucifixion as an example rather than an act of redemption or ransom. He defends the Arian view that Christ was created by God, and that his incarnation involved the hypostatic union of divine and human. At the same time, he insists that Christ was entirely man in his incarnate form and asserts, in line with Hebrews 4:15, that Christ endured temptation as a man. Milton's poetry, however, shows some kinship with Socinian rationalism and the view of Christ's obedi ence as exemplary rather than compensatory. In my thinking about Milton's view of Christ I have been influenced by John Rogers s "Milton's Circumcision." Rogers argues that in his early poem on the circumcision, Milton "works hard to empty the atone ment of its foundation in a logic of blood sacrifice and penal substitution" (205). On Christ as "perfect man," see also Christopher Hill, Milton and the English Revolution (Harmondsworth, England, 1977), 414; Irene Samuel, "The Regaining of Paradise," in The Prison and the Pinnacle, ed. Balachandra Rajan (Toronto: Univ. of Toronto Press, 1973), 111-34; Thomas Langford, "The Nature of the Christ of Paradise Regained," Milton Quarterly 16 (1982): 64; and Hugh MacCallum, Milton and the Sons of God (Toronto, 1986), 226-67, esp. 230. MacCallum stresses Milton's view that the incarnate Son was both human and divine, but notes that, up until the end of the poem, the Son is portrayed as displaying "human virtue rather than divine power" (234). 49 This is consistent with Seiden, who argued that the precepts of natural law were divinely given; that they were not self-evident but had to be learned. See note 44 above. 50 William Kerrigan, "The Riddle o? Paradise Regained," in Poetic Prophecy in West ern Literature, ed.

Caryl has to do some fancy footwork here. He begins by reading Job 31:35 ("O that one would hear me!") as a request for an "unbyast and un-ingaged" third party. He then asserts "And while Job begs for a Judge or a hearer, he doth not appeale from God, as if he were unwilling to acquiesce and rest in his Judgement: but he desired that God would order him such a Judge, or such a hearer as might doe him right, accord ing to the integrity of his heart, and the equity of his cause" (Caryl, An exposition . . . upon the thirtieth and thirty-first chapters of the Booke of Job, [London, 1659], 727). Ultimately, Caryl argues, God is both advocate for and judge of Job. 58 This is also the reading of Philippe Nemo in his Job and the Excess of Evil, trans. Michael Kigel (Pittsburgh: Duquesne Univ. Press,1998), 126-27. 59 Milton, Paradise Lost, 11.33. 60 Irene Samuel, "The Regaining of Paradise," 119n8. See especially Milton, Paradise Regained, 3.188-94.

Lieb writes that "the idea of contending with one's God is part of the fabric of Old Testa ment theology. God's faithful are forever engaged in controversy with him, whether in the form of Job who wishes to arraign God in a court of law (Job xiii, 5; xl, 2), or Jeremiah who is prompted to dispute with God concerning the nature of God's ways (Jer. xii, 1)" (231). 63 Caryl, An Exposition . . . upon the eighteenth, nineteenth, twentieth and twenty one chapters of the Book of Job (London, 1658), 315. 64 In his edition of Milton's Complete Shorter Poems, Carey glosses "unrecorded" as "not in the modern sense, since they were recorded in the gospels, but 'unsung'" (432). But the OED offers no such assurance; to the contrary: unrecorded seems to mean just that: "1585 SANDYS Serm. 287 Had Salomon neuer beene, or had his fall been vnrecorded. 1662 STILLINGFL. Orig. Sacrae II. i. ?2 Supposing that God had left the matters of Divine revelation unrecorded at all. 1671 MILTON PR. I. 16 Deeds ... in secret done, And unrecorded left through many an Age" (OED, s.v. "unrecorded"). This suggests that Paradise Regained is not simply recording scripture but offering a literary account of its significance. 65 See Irene Samuel, "Milton on Learning and Wisdom," PMLA 64 (1949): 708-23. Samuel writes, "to Milton the desirability of any branch of learning is never in the learning itself, but in its use by the learner. . . . Certain books are doubtless more inherently and immediately useful than others?notably the Bible; and even so their use depends on their reader" (718), as we see from Satan's use of scripture. Stanley Fish also makes this point in his "Things and Actions Indifferent: The Temptation of Plot in Paradise Regained," Milton Studies 17 (1983): 163-85. As should be clear, however, I disagree with Fish's argument about plot. 66 On Job as providing a supplementary testimony of faith, see St. Augustine, Con cerning the City of God against the Pagans, trans. Henry Bettenson (Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1977], book 18, chap. 47, page 829. 67 On the man of faith not needing instruction by pagan writers, see also Milton, Paradise Regained, 4:325. Victoria Kahn 657</page><page sequence="34">68 The book of Job was regularly recognized as one of the poetic parts of the Old Testament in the Renaissance (though it is sometimes hard to know whether this is because it was thought to conform to classical norms or depart from them). Sir Philip Sidney described Job as an example of Biblical poetry in his Defence of Poesie. The Junius-Tremellius Protestant Latin version of the Bible named Job as one of the poetic parts of scripture. In his Annotations on Five Poetical Books of the Old Testa ment (London, 1657), the Protestant Edward Leigh wrote that "The Book o? Psalms, Job, and the Songs of Moses, are the only patern of true Poesie" (quoted in Lewalski, Protestant Poetics and the Seventeenth-Century Religious Lyric [Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1979], 7). 69 Aquinas, 102. 70 See Lewalski, Milton's Brief Epic, 13. 71 Alter, Canon and Creativity: Modern Writing and the Authority of Scripture (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 2000), 21-62. '2 See Bennett on how Christ's rejection of pagan learning amounts to a distinction between "knowledge in its own sphere, the natural order, and sapientia, religious wis dom" (191). Barbara Lewalski also makes this point in Milton's Brief Epic, 291. Bennett comments, "We have no reason ... to think that Milton regretted the humanistic study he did for his own 'other art' of poetry" (191). 73 In Milton and the Burden of Interpretation, Dayton Haskin argues that in Paradise Regained and Samson Agonistes Milton is exploring the way canonical scripture is cre ated out of a process of interpretation. As Haskin recognizes, the argument works the other way as well: in showing how scripture is constructed, Milton also dismantles the independent authority of scripture and gives greater authority to the individual reader who may be, as in the case of Milton, also a writer. See Haskin, 119. 74 See Milton, Christian Doctrine, 1.30.589. 75 Harold Fisch, "Milton and the Heresies," in his Jerusalem and Albion: The Hebraic Factor in Seventeenth-Century Literature (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1964), 153, commenting on Paradise Regained. 76 See Fredric Jameson, "Religion and Ideology: A Political Reading o? Paradise Lost," in Literature, Politics, and Theory, ed. Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, Magaret Iverson, and Diana Loxley (London: Methuen, 1986), 35-56. Jameson is drawing on Pierre Macherey's notion of internal distantiation and on the work of Louis Althusser. 77 Jameson, 48. 78 In explaining his Marxist-literary mode of demystifying religion, Jameson observes that "[r]eligion is not a cognitive but a figurai mode, and any attempt to reappropriate it must include a meditation on the nature of figuration itself (40). It is surprising, given Jameson's sensitivity to figuration (including his claim that Milton's Arianism stems from his attempt to cordon off the problem of representing and thereby demystifying God the father [see Jameson, 47]), that Jameson fails to notice the radical challenge to God in Paradise Lost, a challenge that goes hand in hand with a meditation on the nature of figuration and representation. 79 This, I believe, is what Milton is gesturing at when the poet writes that, with the aid of the spirit, he will "tell of deeds / Above heroic, though in secret done, / And unrecorded left through many an age, / Worthy t' have not remained so long unsung" (Paradise Regained, 1.14-17). 80 See the chapter on Paradise Regained in Louis Martz, The Paradise Within (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1964), and "Paradise Regained: G?orgie Form, G?orgie Style," Milton Studies 42 (2003): 7-25; and Anthony Low, "Milton, Paradise Regained, and 658 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page><page sequence="35">G?orgie," PMLA 98 (1983): 152-69, and The G?orgie Revolution (Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985). 81 It also helps us understand that the critical opposition of the labors of Milton's Samson and the inactivity of the Son is misconceived. 82 Radzinowicz, Towards "Samson Agonistes, " 257. On the final display of God's creative power in Job, see Alter, "Truth and Poetry in the Book of Job," in Art of Biblical Poetry, 85-110. 83 Two other paradigms, I think, are suggestive with respect to the argument I'm making here. In his "Milton and the Scene of Interpretation: From Typology toward Midrash," in Midrash and Literature, ed. Geoffrey H. Hartman and Sanford Budick (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 1986), Sanford Budick argues that Milton supplements a typological hermeneutic (which yields closure or finite meaning [see Budick, 201]) with a midrashic hermeneutic. In this midrashic or open-ended activity of interpretation, what is stressed is "the peculiarly unfulfilled and open (or opened) nature of... spiritual fulfillment" (207). Midrash is "symptomatic of a desire to describe a delayed messianic coming;" it affirms "the continuity of interpretation and even make[s] its endlessness part of the essence of divine meaning" (208). Budick also suggests that Milton might have been influenced by Hugo Grotius's 1660 commentary on Hebrews?especially 4:12: "the word of God is . . . sharper than any two-edged sword"? in elaborating his own midrashic practice (208). In "The Riddle o? Paradise Regained," William Kerrigan (drawing on Paul Ricoeur) argues that Milton's poem demonstrates a dialectic between law and prophecy construed as the inspired and open-ended activity of interpretation. Both Kerrigan and Budick stress the religious dimension of prophecy/midrash. But their accounts of these interpretive modes suggest that what we know as literature emerges when prophetic or midrashic interpretation is taken to the extreme, and the activity of interpretation takes precedence over the canonical text. 84 In an essay on "The Sanctification of Literature," Commentary 63 (1977): 63-69, Harold Fisch argues that "[s]acredness does not imply a special ontological category of writing; it is not really a literary quality at all. It is more a matter of a special kind of contract between the reader and the text. The essential terms of this contract are practical. The text claims for itself a certain historical validity . . . while the reader for his part says, in effect, T will accept and I will obey'" (69). In short, "texts are sacred because they command and because we assent to their commands" (69). In contrast, secular texts such as Paradise Lost do not command. What is left instead?according to Fisch?is the literary "pathos, [and] the sublimity" of retelling the story of the fall (69). This contrast between sacred command and secular literature applies to Paradise Regained as well as Paradise Lost. By not having God appear from the whirlwind, by assimilating Christ to the gentile Job, and by demystifying the authority of scripture, the poet also removes the possibility of any kind of divine command. In other words, Paradise Regained takes as its explicit subject the secular space created by the defer ral of theophany. 851 owe this reading of Satan's leap to Joanna Picciotto's Labors of Innocence in Early Modern England (Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, forthcoming). 86 In his "The War in Heaven and the Miltonic Sublime," in A Nation Transformed, ed. Alan Houston and Steven Pincus (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001), 154-179, Nicholas von Maltzahn presents Milton as a Platonic and apocalyptic poet, whose critique of "fleshlie force" was obscured by the late-seventeenth and early-eighteenth-century reception of Milton as sublime, a reception that amounted to an aestheticization and secularization of Paradise Lost. See von Maltzahn, 155, 159. Although I agree with Victoria Kahn 659</page><page sequence="36">von Maltzahn's characterization of Milton's support of the separation of church and state, and of the political dimension of Milton's work, I don't accept von Maltzahn's account of Milton's claims for revelation. In my view, Milton was suspicious of such claims. Moreover, I don't agree that the secular reading of Milton's poetry assumes a depoliticized view of aesthetics. 87 See Caryl, An Exposition ... upon the three first chapters of the Book of Job, "To the Christian Reader" (on Job as "an Epitome of our former prosperity and of our present troubles"), and 2 (on the difficulty of making one's life a commentary on scripture). 88 On the poem's critical relationship to Charles II, see, for example, Malcolm Kel sall, "The Historicity o? Paradise Regained," Milton Studies 12 (1978): 235-51; Stella Revard, "Milton and Classical Rome: The Political Context of Paradise Regained," in Rome in the Renaissance, ed. P. A. Ramsey (Binghamton: State Univ. of New York at Binghamton Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, 1982); David Quint, "David's Census: Milton's Politics and Paradise Regained," in Re-membering Milton, ed. Mary Nyquist and Margaret W Ferguson (New York: Taylor &amp; Francis, 1987), 128-47; Laura Lunger Knoppers, Historicizing Milton: Spectacle, Power, and Poetry in Restoration England (Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, 1994), 13-41; and David Loewenstein, Representing Revolution in Milton and his Contemporaries (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 2001). 89 This foregrounding of rhetoric is in keeping with traditional Protestant glosses on the temptations of Christ as a period of trial before Christ took up his ministry of preaching. See Ken Simpson, "Lingering Voices, Telling Silences: Silence and the Word in Paradise Regained" Milton Studies 35 (1997): 179-95, esp. 180. 660 Job's Complaint in Paradise Regained</page></plain_text>
