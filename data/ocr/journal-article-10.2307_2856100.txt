<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAUCER'S USE OF GIN AND DO BY H. M. SMYSER TAUNO F. MUSTANOJA'S admirable first volume (Part I: Parts of Speech) of his emerging two-volume Middle English Syntax' fills a need perhaps longer and more acutely felt than any other in the field of Middle English Philology. Professor Mustanoja has done yeoman work in defining and classifying the multifarious phenomena and in summarizing concisely and objectively theories hitherto set forth. Yet I am going to be so ungrateful as to cavil at what he says about the use of the auxiliary gin by Chaucer, since I think it could to some extent distort our interpretation of a host of lines. Thereafter, I wish to make some remarks about the auxiliary do and Chaucer's use of it, and in these remarks, too, I shall use Mustanoja's study as a point of departure. I Since ginnen, the ME survival of OE onginnan, appears most frequently in narrative poetry and thus most frequently in the preterite singular, I shall refer to the verb in the form "gan" and speak of the "gan-periphrasis" - the use of gan go or gan to go or gan for to go as an alternative to wente. Mustanoja points out that this gan-form, so lavishly employed by Chaucer, and seldom with its original full ingressive sense, appears most commonly in the Parliament of Fowls, the House of Fame, the Troilus, and the Legend of Good Women, and that it serves mainly the purpose of metrical convenience. He goes on to say, however, that "consciously or unconsciously the poet often achieves a special stylistic effect by means of this construction." For example, in the quotation, For with that oon encresede ay my fere, And with that other gan myn herte bolde; That oon me hette, that other dide me colde, (PF 143-146)2 he finds that "the poet produces a highly effective variation between a substan- tival and verbal end-element (fert,-bolde)," and he continues: We have good reason to believe that in addition to metre and rhyme other stylistic con- siderations play a certain role in a good poet's choice between the simple preterite and the gan-periphrasis. The point is emphasized by Elizabeth Homann [as cited on p. 73, below], who argues that in many cases where gan is taken to be redundant this verb in fact has an intensive and descriptive character. She supports her argument by quotations like the following from Chaucer's House of Fame: (1) tho gan I loken under me And beheld the ayer- isshe bestes (965); (2) this egle ... I gan behold more and more To see the beaut6 and the wonder (532). In the first example the simple beheld records the mere fact, while in the second gan behold seems to bring out in a vivid way the poet's aesthetic experience (p. 612). One thing may be made clear at the outset. Whether the gan-form has such nuances of meaning as are here claimed for it, or whether, as I think, it is used 1 M6moires de la Soci6t6 N6ophilologique de Helsinki, xxiii (Helsinki, 1960). 2 The Works of Geoffrey Chaucer, ed.

In Chaucer's verse, the various forms of gin appear nearly seven hundred times;3 in the very considerable bulk of his prose, they appear only three times. These three occurrences are all in the Tale of Melibee; the first two, in respectively the sev- enth and ninth lines of the Tale, seem both to have been inspired by a (single) commenSa in the original.4 Otto Funke has given us the definitive treatment of the construction gan-plus- infinitive in Middle English,5 using as background Alfred Wuth's study of the verbs in Cynewulf;6 some supplementary data and some useful elaboration of Funke's definitions of terms have been offered by his pupil Hans Walter Hajuser- mann.7 Since Funke concludes that by the time of Chaucer - or at any rate in Chaucer - gan go has become merely a colorless alternative to wente (pp. 925 f.), we might well here bypass his work and turn directly to a consideration of the claims made by Mustanoja and Miss Homann for more than merely colorless usage in Chaucer. On the other hand, we may get a better perspective of Chau- cer' s use if we look at what Funke and hiausermann have to say of the history of the form. To be brief: An ingressive auxiliary cannot logically be used with an action that is not continuing, durative - we cannot logically say "He began to stop," or "He began to drop his sword." When we do use "begin" with a durative we make that durative perfective, that is to say, from being a word of continued action it be- comes a word of completed action. The verb in "He runs" is a durative; "He begins to run" gives a complete act, i.e., the instantaneous act of beginning. Thus we cannot say, "He began to run for an hour." When, therefore, we find, already in Old English, that onginnan is sometimes used with non-durative verbs, or with duratives that in context do not cease to be durative ("He ongann run for an hour"), we are forced to conclude that ongann must at least in such circumstances mean something other than "began," unless indeed it has no intrinsic meaning and serves only to make a pleonastic preterite, like did in Early New English "He did stop," "He did drop his sword," "He did run for an hour." This latter possi- bility - onginnan as a colorless grammatical device - Funke does not entertain, though he grants that in the course of time the auxiliary in its ME form of ginnen was to undergo such "Grammatikalisation." Instead, he holds that onginnan developed a meaning parallel to its earlier ingressive sense of "to begin."

The lines are 973, 975, and 1870. It might be noted that both the first and second come in that early part of the Melibee so especially noted for its cadences, which Saintsbury attributed to "the persistent beat of the couplets so often occupying Chaucer's mind" - see Margaret Schlauch, "Chaucer's Prose Rhythms," PMLA, LXV (1950), 568- 589 and especially 569 and 585.

It is not precisely an intensive9 - it does not affect the action of the infinitive but merely directs the attention of the reader or hearer to it as something new, unexpected, or (p. 12) it makes more striking a series of actions. The semantic evolution Haiusermann explains as follows: from the origi- nal meaning of "to begin" the idea of a beginning of a continuing action was lost and there remained only the idea of beginning or commencement per se as a signal of the introduction of a notable or surprising event.'0 An example of deskriptiv use appears in Genesis A, lines 19 ff. We have been told that the angels praised the Lord and lived without sin and in peace ever with him; then elles ne on3unnon raeron on roderum, nymle riht and sob, aer bon en3la weard for oferhy3de dael on 3edwilde . . . , that is, "they performed [on3unnon raeron] in heaven nothing else but righteous and true deeds until they fell into error through pride." Funke translates this: "Fiurwahr [his emphasis] nichts vollfuhrten sie im Himmel ausser gute und ge- 8 This is the deskriptive Aktionsart. Since the Aktionsarten are all Schilderungen, or descriptions, of the action, the name deskriptiv is confusing to English-speaking people. Funke has substituted it for Wuth's "Intensive Umschreibung," which is misleading in a different way. - It would take a long chapter to define - or attempt to define - what Wuth, Funke, and Hausermann mean by Aktions- arten, and this would leave the concept undefined as used in various other authorities, including Friedrich, whose work we shall be looking at later. Suffice it to say that to Funke the durative or im- perfective is an Aktionsart; and the perfective, a pair of Aktionsarten, depending on whether the moment of action is a beginning or a conclusion, etc.; and there are also other Aktionsarten, such as the Terminata, the Iterativa, and the Intensiva, as well as the Deskriptiv (or Deskriptiva). The concept of Aktionsart differs from the concept of Aspekt, which is subjective and, in the definition which Haiusermann offers, concerns not the nature of the action but its meaning for the speaker (p. 3). See Wuth, pp. 9-13 and, for a good example of the use of the concept of Aktionsart as a tool in semantic analysis, the treatment of cuman on pp. 36-38; Funke, esp. pp. 1-8; Max Deutschbein, System der neuenglischen Syntax (Leipzig, 1931), pp. 67-94; Hausermann, pp. 1-5; and Heinz Friedrich, Gibt es eine intensive Aktionsart im Neuenglischen?, Max Forster's Beitraige (Leipzig, 1936), pp. 1-24. For an analysis of the terminological difficulties, see Harry Spitzbardt, " 'Aspekte und Aktionsarten' - ein Tummelplatz der Terminologie," Zeitschriftfiur Anglistik und Amerikanistik, ii (1954), 56-60. Among other things, Spitzbardt shows that much of the confusion has a familiar source: the superposition on one group of languages (in this case the Germanic) of the grammatical concepts of another (in this case Slavic). Mustanoja follows the English tradition, which gives Aspect a much wider meaning. 9 Funke seems a bit uncertain as to the boundaries between his deskriptive Aktionsart and the inten- sive. He does not exactly repudiate McKnight's opinion that gan is frequently intensive (emphatic) in King Horn, and he makes such statements as "Hier gehen also Wege zu einem Intensivum weiter" (p. 8; cf. p. 1). 10 Funke, p. 8, and Haiusermann, p. 19. Haiusermann here is more explicit than Funke, but that he may be assumed to represent Funke's outlook is the implication of his Foreword, in which he thanks Funke "fUr seine Anregung zu dieser Arbeit und fur das stete Wohlwollen, mit dem er ihren Fortgang verfolgt hat."</page><page sequence="4">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 71 rechte Taten, bis.... " Rweran is seen as signalized, as particularly marked out, by on3unnon: "indeed" or "definitely" they performed nothing, etc. A second example, also from Genesis A (2905-08), is this: Abraham goes up to the hilltop with Isaac to where the Lord had directed him. Then On3an ba ad hladan, aeled weccan Ond 3efeterode fet ond honda bearne sinum ond ba on bael ahof Isaac 3eon3ne .... Perhaps with Funke's views in mind we might translate on3an here by a "Lo!" to call attention to the event introduced - "Lo! he piled up wood, kindled fire, bound his son and then put him, young Isaac, on the pyre." A final example, in prose, I take from Wuth (p. 56) as cited by Funke: Blickling Homilies, ed. R. Morris, EETS, 72, p. 199, line 19: "And ba mid geaettredum straele ongann sceotan wip Paes Pe he geseah Paet hryper stondan" - "And then he shot [ongann sceotan] a poisoned arrow to where he saw the bull standing." There is no question here of "started shooting": only one arrow is shot and it is blown back by the wind to strike the shooter. These are representative, I think, of the dozen or so OE examples of deskriptiv onginnan-plus-infinitive quoted or cited by Funke. Mustanoja touches on OE onginnan as preface to his treatment of ME ginne. After pointing out that it may be ingressive, he says, In a number of instances, however, this meaning is somewhat weakened, although still clearly discernible, suggesting that the verb is becoming an auxiliary to express the ingres- sive and perfective aspects of the governing verb. A further stage in the development of onginnan as an auxiliary is reached when this verb loses its original meaning altogether and becomes a mere intensifier of the main verb, to enable the speaker or writer to describe the dynamic qualities of an action in a more vivid and forceful way than would be possible by using a simple verb form.... Thus OE onginnan, when it occurs as an auxiliary with an infinitive, can be said to carry out two principal functions: (1) it brings out the ingressive and perfective aspects of the action represented by the infinitive, and (2) it intensifies the descriptive force of the infini- tive (pp. 610 f.). It seems to me that, on the basis of the examples offered by Wuth and Funke, this is pure hypothesis. Granted that onginnan often cannot be a pure ingressive, we are quite in the dark as to what if any precise function it had. It may go against the grain to assume that in such statements as "He began to shoot an arrow" the "began," which is clearly not the verb of ingression as we now know and use it, could have had no meaning - could have been merely a pleonastic periphrasis for "shot." Though Funke, like most scholars, sees the auxiliary ulti- mately becoming a mere "grammaticalization," he naturally supposes, like the rest of us, that on its first introduction it had a real meaning or function - such as intensification or "attention- calling" - and that it merely lost this meaning or function in the course of time. Editors have traditionally glossed onginnar as "to begin" and translators have offered such anomalies as "he began to shoot an arrow and the arrow was blown back." Such anomalies seem to me inevitable: to translate as "he did shoot an arrow" would be to assume that the "grammaticali-</page><page sequence="5">72 Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do zation" which ultimately came about was already present as the first extension of function of onginnan, and it may not have been. But I think we are quite in the dark as to what other force it had, tempting as are the hypotheses offered. To Funke the deskriptiv (i.e., "attention-calling" and quasi- or wholly intensive) meaning carries on deep into Middle English. He freely admits that the deskriptiv use of ginne is often hard to distinguish from its pleonastic, colorless use. Perhaps the best way of testing the validity of his distinction between ME ginne as de- skriptiv and ME ginne as pleonastic (like did in ENE "he did say") would be to take from him and Hiusermann four or five examples of each kind and, mixing them, leave it to the reader to separate the two kinds. I choose cases which they offer as unambiguous and give them in full. 1. The tygre gan hyt awey take. 92. Als i sat up-on bat lowe [mound], I gan Denemark for to howe [think on].

Let us return now to the use of the word in Chaucer as seen by Mustanoja and Miss Homann. Mustanoja's assertion that "consciously or unconsciously the poet often achieves a special stylistic effect" by means of the gan-construction and his quota- 11 Numbers 1, 4, 6, 9 are from Funke; 02, 3, 5, 7, 8 from Hiusermann. Numbers 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 are de- 8kriptiv; numbers 1, 3, 5, 8 are pleonastic. I was forced to draw upon HaLusermann because, as it hap- pens, Funke does not offer very many examples of gan as unambiguously pleonastic. See Funke, pp. 11-25, and HMusermann, pp. 18-20.</page><page sequence="6">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 73 tions from Miss Homann are conservative compared to what Miss Homann says at length in her article, "Chaucer's Use of 'Gan'."'2 Here we learn that gan is used on one or another occasion to make "distinctions in tempo, intensity, and man- ner"; "as a trenchant verbal subtlety for character behavior"; and to give the reader "a sense of cumulation, a growing of the emotion to a pitch."'3 We may focus our attention on one of the uses of gan cited by Mustanoja from Miss Ho- mann's article. Miss Homann's full statement runs as follows: The difference between Chaucer's two preterits is most clearly exemplified in "behold," a vei b of no large or sharp bodily movements, but of both physical reactions and emotional significance. In Chaucer the simple preterit 'beheld' seems consistently to mean "saw," "became aware of visually." In the soaring eagle's claws, when Chaucer looked at the stars And beheld the ayerissh bestes, (HF 965) he gazed at them as a child looks at fireworks. On the other hand 'gan behold' appears to mean "looked straight at fully," "absorbed the meaning of," "gazed on and into signifi- cantly," containing also a sense of immediacy and, further, an accumulative interest dic- tated by desires and emotions: I gan beholde more and more To se the beaute and the wonder ... (532-533) The 'gan' form implies both intellectual activity and aesthetic participation, different from the surface gaze with wbich Chaucer looked at the constellations. It supplies a meaning, lost if we think of both forms as simply "beheld" or as "did behold" (p. 389). When we are analyzing the significance of a word, as we are here analyzing the significance of gan used as an auxiliary, we must be concerned, not with the color which the word takes or seems to take from any particular context, but with what the word brings to any and all contexts. If the gan-form "implies both intellectual activity and aesthetic participation" in line 532 ("I gan beholde more and more"), then it must imply the same thing in line 531, which Miss Homann does not quote but which runs: "[This egle] Which that so hye gan to sore." If in line 531 it seems to bring something else than intellectual and aesthetic participation - such as, let us say, a sense of exhilarating motion tinged with acrophobia- then we are simply sampling the "feelings" of passages in Chaucer, not defining the meaning or meanings of gan. Miss Homann says that the word behold has "emotional significance." A more accurate statement might run something like this: in our own day behold, a word of Biblical and poetic associations, is obsoles- cent and is used only in emotional contexts, such as " 'Behold!' he cried, 'the price of a woman's shame' " (Upton Sinclair, The Brass Check, Ch. 1), but not other- wise - not, for example, as in "Bihoold the murie wordes of the Hoost to the Shipman," or "Biholde the wordes bitwene the Somnour and the Frere." This is not to deny that the word behold can appear in an emotional context in Chaucer; 12 JEGP, Llll (1950), 389-398. 13 On pages 394-397, Miss Homann's use of the words "inception," "duration," "causative," "in- gressive" is hard to follow. See, e.g., p. 396: "Although any romance of the latter half of the [four- teenth] century will yield incidences [sic] of 'gan' which appear to be formulae or are used for prosodic exigency, also in all of them occurs now aind again the sense of duration or continuing time as well as the active ingressive precision of tense or adverbial color."</page><page sequence="7">74 Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do it does so frequently. The point is that the "emotional significance" comes from the context, just as the variegated meanings which Miss Homann attributes to gan come from various selected contexts. The real advantage that gan behold had for Chaucer over beheld was a matter of meter and rhyme Gan go, gan to go, and (less common but not rare) gan for to go are convenient alternatives metrically to wente, and the infinitives of many verbs - particularly of weak verbs - are more easily rhymed than the preterites. Beheld(e) appears in Chaucer's verse thirteen times and in rhyming position five times; beholde appears sixty-five times, with fifty-one of these appearances in rhyming position. Of these fifty-one rhyming behold's, seventeen are gan behold's. The article on gan in the Tatlock-Kennedy Concordance shows that 73% of lines containing gan present the infinitive in rhyming position. We may try a test. Some ME verbs are identical in form in infinitive and preterite. Among these are hente, sette, stente (stinte), and sterte. If gan does not have an intensive-descriptive function, we should expect it to turn up only rarely with these verbs - it can offer no rhyming convenience, only the metrical convenience of an extra syllable. And it does turn up rarely: hente and sette appear twenty-four times each in rhyme and only once each governed by gan; stente (stinte) is rhymed twenty-five times and has no gai 's at all; sterte appears in thirty-five rhymes, only once with gan. On the other hand, where a preterite is difficult to rhyme, Chaucer makes much use of gan-plus. infinitive; for example, cried appears in rhyme only six times and gan crie twenty-one. It would seem from all this that the gan-periphrasis is a matter of metrical and rhyming convenience in Chaucer. I see no evidence of any intensive-descriptive function. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how a verb could serve as a prosodic con- venience if its use or non-use were dictated by semantic considerations. II With do the case is very different; in Chaucer it almost always has a meaning - it is causative There is only one certain exception to this rule, as we shall see. Mustanoja, in his article on Gin says, The use of periphrastic gan is . .. in some measure comparable to that of periphrastic do ... Chaucer, who favors the periphrasis with gin, makes sparing use of periphrastic do (p. 614). When we turn to the article on do we find a very able presentation, including the following succinct and circumspect statement of the accepted view as to emphatic do: It is difficult to assess the degree of emphasis in the ME uses of periphrastic do, and it may be assumed that there is a great deal of variation between individual cases. There is nothing to indicate, for example, that the do-periphrasis is unemphatic in cases like Pou dost hym bere fals wytnes (R. Mannyng, Handlyng Synne, 641) and I leve lelly . . . pat pardoun and penaunce and preyeres don save soules (PPI B vii 177). Yet unambiguous cases of em- phatic periphrastic-do are not recorded until the 15th century.... The emphatic do becomes common in the 16th century.... While the unemphatic or only lightly emphatic periphrastic do disappears in affirmative statements towards the end of the 17th century, emphatic do is used even today (she does like you, etc.) (p. 606)</page><page sequence="8">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 75 I should like briefly to rehearse the uses of do in our current speech, with a view to examining the concept of "emphatic do," past and present, and its supposed appearance in Chaucer. Do, of course, is one of the most used words in the language. As a verb in its own right, meaning "to bring about, to effect, to pay, to make," etc. it has vast utility, but it is also our vicarious or "pro-verb" par excellence, and in this role, too, it is in constant use - "He said he would go and he did." Besides these uses, it serves to make periphrastic predicates in questions ("Do you want to go?") and negatives ("He did not go"), and also in such emphatic affirmatives as that cited by Mus- tanoja, "She does like you." It might be called the factotum word of English. Though Chaucer keeps do as a causative and uses the gan-periphrasis, the do- periphrasis was coming into general use in his time, and it appears frequently in Lydgate;'4 it became very common in the sixteenth century. Scholars once thought that it came into use first in affirmative declarations - the use which is rarest today - and spread thereafter to negative declarations and interrogatives, but Alvar Ellegard in his exhaustive The Auxiliary Do has shown that there are no grounds for such a chronology.'6 As to origin, the do-periphrasis is usually thought to be a weakening of the older causative; some hold, with much less co- gency, it seems to me, that it is a development of the pro-verb.'6 The persistence of the do-periphrasis in negative and interrogative sentences to this day is not wholly understood, but, as Mustanoja says, it seems likely "that the phenomenon is somehow connected with word order, possibly with a desire to avoid inversion" (p. 607). We prefer "Did he go?" to "Went he?," for example, and it is notable that we do not use do in questions of the type" Who painted the flagpole?," where there is no need to avoid inversion. The do- form is also used, evidently to avoid "the inconveniences of verbal inversion," in varieties of sentences of the type "Never did he think."'17 In three types of constructions we seem to have "emphatic do" in Modern English: 1. "But reward him he did." 2. "Do lend a hand." 8. ."She does like you." The first example chosen to illustrate "emphatic do" is the earliest unambigu- ous case on record; it is from William Gregory's Chronicle of London,18 of before 1470: and the mayre, seynge that hys place was occupyd, bylde hym contente and went home 14 See Alvar Elleggrd, The Auxiliary Do: The Establishment and Regulation of its Use in English, Gothenburg Studies in English, ii (Stockholm, 1953), pp. 56 ff., and J.

In contemporary English no less than in fifteenth-century English this would be an emphatic statement, even though spoken with no stress on did. But the em- phasis comes, be it noted, from inversion of sentence order, not by virtue of the word do. In exactly the same way the sentence "He asked for trouble and trouble he got" is emphatic, and so is "It may not have been wicked but foolish it was." Or we could say of the interloper, "But rewarded he was." Actually, "reward him he did" is merely a variant of our No. 3 type, with inversion substituted for word stress. The imperative-plus-infinitive "Do lend a hand" appears in OE sometimes as a double imperative ("Do ga, and ne synya Ju naefre ma"), sometimes as an im- perative-plus-infinitive ("Do me aefter Jinum wordum wel 3ecwician") - see NED, do 30. In either case it has all the appearance of do used purely for empha- sis, but I should say that in Modern English "Do lend a hand" differs from "Lend a hand" not in being more emphatic - it may be even less emphatic - but in being more polite; it introduces a note of pleading to what would otherwise be a raw command. This form appears unambiguously twice in Chaucer;20 but if we choose to take it as emphatic we shall not be able to get any support for that interpretation by arguing back from present-day usage. In the third and last case, "She does like you," the word do is a vehicle of emphasis, but we should perhaps remind ourselves that the emphasis is in no way a connotation of do. It resides in the secondary phoneme of stress; we must say, or read, "She does like you." The statement "She does like you," if spoken evenly, would be a mere archaism and would probably elicit some such scoffing reply as "Doth she, forsooth?" In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when the periphrastic do was used in plain affirmative indicative sentences, an em- phatic statement was indistinguishable in writing from an unemphatic one, as witness the following passage from Twblfth Night (III, i, 3 if.): Clown. No, sir, I live by the church. Viola. Art thou a churchman? Clown. No such matter, sir. I do live by the church; for I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by the church.... Viola. I warrant thou art a merry fellow and car'st for nothing. Clown. Not so, sir; I do care for something; but in my conscience, sir, I do not care for you ... The only certainly emphatic do here is in "Not so, sir; I do care for something." The first do in the passage may also have been stressed, but the second do and the doth certainly were not.2' They were of the very common sort that led Palsgrave 19 Reward is here used in the rare sense of "serve with food." See NED, reward, v., 5 d. 20 "Do, dame, telle forth youre tale, and that is best," CT III WB 858; and BD 754: "Do thanne holde hereto." There are a number of other cases of imperative do-plus-infinitive, but in these the do is either certainly causative or, as in the following, very possibly causative: "Do strepe me and put me in a sak" (CT IV Merch 2200). 21 For other examples of stressed periphrastic do's in Shakespeare, see Friedrich, Intensive Aktions- art, pp. 65-71.</page><page sequence="10">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 77 to write in 1530: "It is all one to say 'I do speake... ' and suche lyke, and 'I speke... ?"22 If it be asked why the do-periphrasis has been preserved to the present day in emphatic affirmative statements, the answer is perhaps to be found, at least as regards the first impetus to its preservation, in some words written by Henry Sweet over sixty years ago. Such emphatic forms as we are discussing, says Sweet, are always generalizing; that is, such a form as I do see does not emphasize anything in the meaning of see itself, but implies some general antithesis such as that between assertion and denial, the real and the unreal ... 23 In other words, "She does like you" means something different from "She likes you." The former counters only a statement or implication or supposition that "she does not like you"; the latter can have a range of special meanings - it can counter such possibilities as "she loves you," or "she is indifferent to you," or even answer such a question as "Wlhat did she think of my solo?" "I do care for something" could not become "I care for something" without change of meaning. It is to be noted that this "generalizing" emphatic (to use Sweet's word), while associated ordinarily with do, may be used with any auxiliary - "She can be agreeable." There is, however, a second sort of emphatic affirmative in Modern English, likewise usually associated with do, as Heinz Friedrich has made clear: "She does like,you" in the sense of "She likes you very much" (or "She can be agreeable" in the sense of "She can be very agreeable indeed"). We may call this the "intensive" form. Friedrich derives it from what we have called the general- izing form and holds that it is distinguished from the generalizing by a different sentence intonation. He traces the intensive form back to the eighteenth century but shows reason to suspect its existence as early as Shakespeare.24 22 Page 528 in L'esclaircissement de la langue frangoyse, ed. F. P. Genin (Paris, 1852), as quoted by Elleggrd, Auxiliary Do, p. 170. That emphasized periphrastic do in affirmative declaratives became progressively more conspicuous as unemphasized periphrastic do's went out of use is the probable implication of statements in Wallis and Gill. Cf. Engblom, Origin, p. 44, and especially Elleg'ard, pp. 171-178. 23 A New English Grammar, Oxford, 1908, 11: Syntax, Para. 2179. 24 Intensive Aktionsart, espec. pp. 86 ff. Friedrich takes issue with Deutschbein's conception of an intensive Aktionsart. What I have here called the "generalizing do," Friedrich calls the Modal, or Modal intensive, do, contending that the emphasis is a matter of the speaker's feeling - the strength of his conviction that "she no doubt likes you" - and therefore is a matter of Mood rather than Aktionsart; the second do, which I have called "intensive," he looks upon as the chief agent and stress- bearer of an "intensive Aktionsart" - the actual force or strength of the infinitive is magnified "She likes you very much"; variations of this sort are to be known as Aktionsarten. le holds that these two uses of do (and other auxiliaries) are distinguishable by the kind of stress employed: the Modal has simple stress, the Intensive a circumflex, rising on the auxiliary and falling on the infinitive. le bases this phonetic hypothesis evidently on observations made in England, where he found the Intensive, in keeping with English habits of reserve, to be used rather sparingly and chiefly by women. There is no doubt that the emphasized auxiliary of affirmative declarations in Modern English often strength- ens the force of the verb instead of "generalizing." For the statement of derivation of this intensive, see pp. 50 and 75.</page><page sequence="11">78 Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do As is no doubt apparent in the foregoing description of modern do, I am pro- testing the concept of "emphatic do" as an historical entity, as though do had in itself some particular force. I suppose that it was the frequent appearance of stressed do that led to the excogitation of the concept, and I do not think that it has proved very helpful. Victor Engblom, Alvar Elleg&amp;rd, and many other scholars treat of emphatic do as parallel to pro-verbal do, causative do, and the pleonastic periphrastic do.25 Since, as Ellegard puts it, "the chief difficulty we en- counter when trying to get an idea of the frequency of emphatic do is that empha- sis and stress cannot generally be observed in a written text," they are forced to confine themselves to those "certain instances . . . where the construction of the sentence makes the emphasis evident."26 These instances prove to beambiguities of the type "I truly believe pardon and penance do save souls" (see above, p. 74), numbers of sentences of the type "Reward him he did," and many more of the fol- lowing type: "Like it unto your kingly mageste to understonde that. . . [the city] hath stonde, yit doth, and ever shal, by the help of oure Lord almyghty, in ... gret pees and tranquillite.... "27 Examples of this last sort are particularly baffling. No doubt the do cannot have been totally unstressed, but what we seem to be faced with here is not a matter of emphasis within any proper meaning of the term but of tense, and the problem in regard to do would seem to be whether we take it as a pro-verb or as a periphrastic with unexpressed infinitive. Engblom holds that the emphatic do is derived from the pro-verb; Ellegxard that it is de- rived from the periphrastic. To another scholar, Hans Marchand,28 emphatic do, like other do's, is anthropomorphic: as causative do is slipping, periphrastic do comes on the scene, accompanied by emphatic do, an objectionable, colloquial in- truder; causative do dies about 1600, evidently of disgust, and periphrastic do fol- lows within the century.29 "Den Sieg ... traigt also emph. do, das sich als das biologisch stirkste erweist." Scholars who see emphatic do less vividly than this, on the other hand, sometimes find signalizing instances of emphatic do difficult. In the Middle English Dictionary, to take a very recent example, in the massive and excellent entry on don, a distinction is made between don la "As an emphatic [stressed] auxiliary verb expressing actuality, insistence, pleading, etc.... [Some of the examples may belong to lib, below]," and don lib "Unstressed don plus inf., used as equivalent of the simple verb [hard to distinguish from the emphatic do phrase.... ]30 25 Note, however, that Mustanoja several times refers to "emphatic periphrastic do," which may imply some lack of confidence in "emphatic do." 26 Auxiliary Do, p. 171. 27 Engblom, Origin, p. 50. The quotation dates from 1417. 28 "Syntaktische Homonymie: das umschreibende do," Englische Studien, LXXIII (1938-39), 227- 252. 29 The emphatic do "brachte es mit sich, dass der Gebrauch von kausativem do von nun an nicht mehr frei war von soziologischer Deklassierung.... Der Grund fur die Erkrankung von kausativem do liegt also in der anstbssigen Provenienz des neuen do" (pp. 236 f.). 30 Edd. Hans Kurath and S. M. Kuhn, Part D 4 (University of Michigan Press, 1962).</page><page sequence="12">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 79 III Chaucer uses do as an auxiliary something like 140-150 times;3" most of these uses are unambiguously causative. For example: 1. The newe love, labour, or oother wo, Don olde affecciouns alle over-go. (TC 4.422 if.) 2. For which the drede doth me so to smerte That with a swerd it stingeth to myn herte. (LGW 1728 f.) 3. "Freend, I shal for thy sake Do striken hire out of oure lettres blake."32 (CT III Fri 1363 f.) 4. But, as I trowe, I schal nat greetly travailen to don the remembren on thise thynges. (Bo II pr 1, line 24)33 The ambiguous cases are interesting to ponder. They range from do's in which the sense of causation is weak - for example, in the lovely passage about the nightingale in TC 3.1233-37: "And after siker doth hire vois out rynge," or in "Whan Phebus doth his bryghte bemes sprede" (TC 2.54) - to do's which may be verbs per se with objects rather than auxiliaries: "do him smerte" may mean "give him pain" rather than "cause him to suffer."34 Among auxiliary uses, students of Chaucer's do's agree pretty well as to which are ambiguous, and they tend to deem the ambiguous ones probably causative, except for J. F. Royster, who, confessing to "a generosity of interpretation" between the causative and the periphrastic, is quite willing to consider several ambiguous cases periphrastic.35 In my ungenerous opinion, none of these cases has the unimpeachable credentials 31 The reason for this indefiniteness of number is the ambiguous cases cited below. 32 This type, causative without accusative logical subject of the infinitive (such as affecciouns in No. 1 or me in No. 2), is somewhat less common than the other types. 33 A curiously tautological use of auxiliary do may be mentioned here. The dide doon of CT III Sum 2042: "And thus he dide doon sleen hem alle thre," and leet (lat) do(on) of CT V Sq 46; VI Phys 173; and VII Mk 2152 are earlier than any such duplications cited by Elleg'ard (who does not deal with Chaucer's verse) except one case in Mannyng's translation of Langtoft, of the early fourteenth cen- tury (see Auxiliary Do, pp. 110-115). The double form became very common later, but it is notable that it appears most frequently in texts that use the causative do, like Chaucer, almost exclusively. For example, the second part of Melusine (ca 1500) has only two periphrastic do's as against forty-five causatives, and almost half of the causatives appear in the doubled did-do form; and as periphrastic do's increase with the passage of time in Caxton's work, the number of did do's decreases. Elleg'ard suggests that the double form reflects the semantic conflict between periphrastic and causative do, but if this is the case one would expect to find did do becoming more, and not less, common as causative do was overwhelmed by periphrastic do. 34 For example, "This honurable Phillis doth hym chere" (LGW 2452) and "For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne" (CT VII Mk 2604). Other examples of such ambiguity are CT I Kn 1555 (shame); TC 5.350 (cure - nearly always a noun in Chaucer), 5.958 (care), and several instances of smerte: TC 2.1097 var.; 2.1288; 3.1182; Comnp. L. 20; and Mars 62. 85 "The 'Do' Auxiliary," p. 451.</page><page sequence="13">80 Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do needed by an exception to a broadly based rule. One case that comes close to qualifying as a periphrastic, though I do not think that it has ever been nominated before, is in Pandarus' words to Troilus: 'Awake, ye slepen al to longe! It semeth nat that love doth yow longe, That slepen so that no man may yow wake.' (TC 2.545-547) The second longe in this context would be most naturally translated "pertain to," making the doth periphrastic; but on the other hand, longe can with fair plausibil- ity be translated "yearn," so that if the instance is not surely causative it is at least ambiguous. Another do, contributed by Royster as a periphrastic, offers a problem that is less lexical than literary: hende Nicholas, making preparations for his prolonged "trance" in his chamber, doth ful softe unto his chambre carie Bothe mete and drynke for a day or tweye. (CT I Mill 3410 f.) "It was quite necessary," writes Royster, "that Nicholas himself 'carie bothe mete and diinke' to his room, for had he caused an agent to perform the work, his deception would probably have been discovered." The "softe" would of course support this view. But even so a doubt must remain whether or not Chaucer meant this as causative - must remain even in the minds of those who decline to accept R. Hittmair's ingenious solution: that Nicholas caused Alisoun to bring up the provisions.36 Another proposed exception is HF 1036: "Whan tempest doth the shippes swalowe." The NED cites this line under Swallow, v. 3. transf. "To take into itself (physically); to cause to disappear in its interior or depths; to engulf." This makes the doth periphrastic; it also, rather disconcertingly, makes a tempest swallow ships. On the other hand, J. S. Kenyon's observation that "there is still here the possibility that we have a weakened causative: 'tempest causes to swallow the shippes' "3 does not bring strong or instant con- viction. Perlhaps what Chaucer actually wrote was wallow, but the text as we have it is swallow and this verb, I think, makes the doth ambiguous. To some it has seemed that "But how this cas doth Troilus moleste" (TC 4.880) is periphrastic, but moleste is evidently a noun - see the NED, s.v. Molest, sb., where the four- teenth-century King Alisaunder is quoted: . . -tempestes, That hem duden grete molestes"; and see also Chaucer's Boethius III pr 9, line 103; "hym .. that moleste prikketh."38 The sole passage in Chaucer containing unambiguous periphrastic do's (one as the auxiliary of a question) occurs in the Monk's Tale: 36 As quoted by Engblom, Origin, p. 12. 37 The Syntax of the Infinitive in Chaucer, Chaucer Soc., 2d ser., 44 (Oxford, 1909), p. 154. 38 See Kenyon, p. 154. Royster thinks that the do in Bo. III m. 3, line 5 ". . . and though he [a rich man] do ere his feeldes plentevous with an hundred oxen . . . " may be periphrastic, pointing out that neither the Latin original nor Alfred's translation suggests a causative here. But certainly the causa- tive is logically implicit in the sense. See "The 'Do' Auxiliary," p. 452.</page><page sequence="14">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 81 His yonge sone, that thre yeer was of age, Unto hym seyde, "Fader, why do ye wepe? Whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage? Is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe?" (CT VII 2431-34) It is of course noteworthy that these do's come in the speech of a child. The MED quotes the first do under lla (emphatic), along with all other do's in questions; the second it quotes under lib (periphrastic). It is the second do that has usually been called emphatic. Those who believe that the emphatic do is of colloquial origin point to this as a prime piece of evidence. But they fail to explain why the realist Chaucer never makes his uneducated adults use the form. Langenfelt suggests that "what a child might be permitted to say (in a literary work), was not fit for grown-up people. Hence Chaucer never took the same liberty with adults and suppressed their syntax when it offended the inherited laws of his own language." In view of other linguistic liberties allowed adults, this seems un- likely.39 The exception remains puzzling. IV The meaningless gan-form in Chaucer serves metrical and rhyming conveni- ence; paradoxically the do-form, though meaningful, may often do likewise, for the causation may be stated with a do (or make or let) or it may be left to infer- ence. "The king did build a church" or "The king built a church" - in the latter case no less than the former it will be understood that the king caused the church to be built without himself actually using a trowel. Chaucer moves freely between the explicit and implicit causatives, and no doubt convenience of meter and rhyme often governs his choice. For example, Cleopatra made hire subtyl werkmen make a shryne Of alle the rubyes and the stones fyne In al Egypte, that she coude espie, And putte ful the shryne of spicerye, And let the cors enbaume, and forth she fette This dede cors, and in the shryne it shette. And next the shryne a pit thanne doth she grave, And alle the serpentes that she myghte have, She putte hem in that grave. (LGW 672-680) Here made, let, and doth are explicit causatives; fette, shette, and at least the second putte are implicit causatives (the first is possibly a second infinitive with made). Yet Cleopatra is as little likely to have carried Antony's body in her own arms, or to have collected serpents with her own hands, as to have dug a pit. In 1920, F. Beschorner published a careful statistical account of verbal rhymes, 39 See 0. Zilling, Das Hilfsverb do im Mittelenglischen (Halle, 1918), p. 73; Gosta Langenfelt, Select Studies in Colloquial English of the Late Middle Ages, Lund, 1933, p. 111; Engblom, Origin, pp. 41-43; Ellegard, Auxiliary Do, pp. 22 f.; and Herbert Koziol, review of Elleg'ard, English Studies, xxxviii (1957), 76.</page><page sequence="15">82 Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do especially of infinitive rhymes, in Chaucer,40 taking particular notice and keeping a separate account of the gan go type of periphrasis in rhyme. There is a vast range in the frequency of Chaucer's use of this gan go alternative. The variation is not essentially a matter of metrical form: in the short line Book of the Duchess .90% of all rhymes are gan-go's, in the short line House of Fame, 2.96%; in the stanzaic Man of Law's Tale, .68%, in the stanzaic Troilus and Criseyde, 2.76%.41 Obviously chronology is involved. Beschorner's tables and conclusions may be summarized as follows. In the early BD, Chaucer uses gan sparely (.90%7, as above), but after, say, his return from Italy in 1373, from 1.50% to 3.00% of all rhymes are gan+infinitives. The Parliament has a ratio of 2.86; the House of Fame, 2.96; and TC, 2.76. The ratio drops in the Legend of Good Women (omitting both versions of the Prologue, which, however, would not materiallv alter the figures) to 1.49%. Thereafter, in the Canterbury Tales, the use of gan go is rather sparing, running from 1.30% down to zero, if we except the Prioress' Tale (2.10%7) and the Second Nun's Tale (3.23%), the latter probably written in the "middle" or gan period. The proportion of gan go rhymes in all the Canterbury Tales (not including prologues or links) is .84%. Beschorner thinks that Chaucer's use of gan continued to dwindle through the Canterbury Period. It would seem that at a point in his career Chaucer decided that such lavish use of "eines reimtechnischen Hilfsmittels" was undesirable and accordingly cut down on it. When was this? Beschorner lists his percentages not as 1 have done by whole poems, but by Books or Legends; thus: HF 1, 1.57; II, 2.92; III, 3.65; TC 1, 2.20; II, 3.76; III, 3.35; IV, 1.88; V, 2.41; Legend 1, .82; 1I, 4.13;42 III, 1.35; etc. He thinks that Chaucer's change of practice came at the end of the third Book of Troilus and Criseyde. I think that this is cutting things a bit too fine (though I should hasten to add that Beschorner in general uses his figures with care and great good sense). Against this view is not only the fact that the ratio rises again in TC V to a higher level than TC 1, but also the evidence of auxiliary do, to which 1 turn briefly before closing. Causative do, we recall, can serve conveniently to bring the infinitive into rhyme. I count in all Chaucer's poetry 86 unambiguous uses of auxiliary do (did, etc.) which place an infinitive in rhyme (let me say that in such work the Concordance is the Poor Man's Computer). Of these 86 cases, 46 appear in Troilus and Cri8eyde, where they are frequent enough to be something of a man- nerism. Though the numbers are too small to be of much worth, they are sug- gestive, and there is no break at the end of the third Book.43 But it is the gan that really marked a habit, and we may say that Chaucer used it more and more down through TC, after which he used it less and less. Though in these generalizations 40 "Verbale Reime bei Chaucer, Studien zur englischen Philologie, XL (Halle [Saale], 1920). 41 Though there is, of course, a tendency toward greater use in stanzaic poems than in couplet poems on the whole. 42 Nine in the 218 lines of the Thisbe! Gans tend generally to come in clusters, but this is an extreme case. 43 TC by Books: I. 55; II 74; III. 49; IV. 76; V. 26. The numbers drop to .29 in LGW and .11 in the Canterbury Tales.</page><page sequence="16">Chaucer's Use of Gin and Do 83 I have used Beschorner's figures on gan-plus-infinitive-in-rhyme, I have also made my own tally of all uses of gan, since gan can serve as a metrical convenience even when it does not put the infinitive in rhyming position. My figures support the above generalizations fully; for example, gan appears per hundred lines of verses as follows: BD .97; PF 3.29; HF 3.66; TC 3.93; LGW 1.83; and the Canterbury Tales (all verses) .98. The form is perhaps a concession - perhaps even Chaucer's greatest conces- sion - to the popular. The fastidious Gower used it hardly at all,44 but it is common in the romances."5 In his greatest period Chaucer used it seldom, but he never altogether abandoned it: quite understandably, he did not burlesque it in his Thopas, and in the 238 exquisite lines of the presumably late Prioress' Tale he used it five times. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE 44 Miss Homann reports that it is used only 95 times in the 28,708 lines of the Confessio Amantis "Chaucer's Use of 'Gan,' " p. 394 n). 46 It appears about one hundred times in King Horn's ca 1550 lines.
