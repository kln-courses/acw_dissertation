<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY.' [Cozntributed by EDWARD JENKS, ESQ., D.C.L.] THE word " Law " is used in many senses; and a lawyer, though he may have succeeded (with the acquisitiveness so readily attributed to his craft) in annexing it as his peculiar possession, is certainly not entitled to any monopoly of the subject. Some half-century ago, for example, the great naturalist Huxley indignantly repudiated the alleged attempt of the legal profession to monopolize the term, and contrasted, somewhat scornfully, the " law " which emanated from the mouth of the ruler or the judge- its vacillations, its inequalities, its crude generalizations-with the majestic laws of the physical universe, existing unchanged from time immemorial, perfect in their operation, unbreakable in their irresistible might, perfect in their harmony. He was right ; and a similar claim might be made-is in fact made--by the theologian, the psychologist, the economist, the mathematician, and the geologist. This is instructive ; because a very slight acquaintance with the history of language suggests that at the back of apparently incon- sistent uses of the same word, there is usually to be found an identity of essentials which at least hints at a common origin of all. And it is not, perhaps, without significance in this connexion that one of the most difficult questions in jurisprudence, viz. the definition of insanity, should at the present time be the subject of rival claims by the jurist and the physician. It is true that, among human faculties, invention is rarer than imitation, and that, in undeveloped man at least, the tendency to appropriate the work of others is more attractive than working to satisfy one's own needs. Yet so closely is the growth of language -an almost unconscious process-bound up with the growth of ideas, that (save in a very few cases) it is only a matter of patience and observation to separate the essential from the accidental in the apparently inconsistent uses of a common word. Paper read before the Sociological Society, June 26, I923. 169</page><page sequence="2">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. Rejecting, then, the elements in the word " Law" which are, obviously, special to particular uses of it-the element of direct inspiration in the laws of the theologian, the rational consistency in those of the mathematician, the inevitability in those of the geologist-we seem to find that every use of the word " law " implies two elements: (a) compulsion, (b) order. The word "law" in English and kindred languages is said to be more closely associated with the former. What is " lawed " is that which is placed, bound, or fixed, either so that it cannot change its position, or so at least that it can only do so on pain of correction. In the laws of the physical universe the inability is complete. If it is found that an alleged "law" of the physical world does not operate, the scientist does not say that the law has been disobeyed. He says that it does not exist-that there has been a mistaken inference. In the case of laws which are imposed by the exercise of the human will, there is, clearly, no such accuracy. Indeed, by the average man, such laws are recognized as being frequently broken, and, in many cases, are only discovered to exist because they are broken. Still, it is the general doctrine of jurists that there can be no true law (even in their sense) without a " sanction "-some penalty or adhibition which makes the breaking of a law an unpleasant thing for the breaker. And it is somewhat suggestive that the actual word " law " is said to have become familiar in this country with the Danish invasions of the tenth and eleventh centuries, and the severely repressive regime which the conquerors established; the older English synonym (now reserved for other purposes)-the word " right " (" folc-rit ")-being significantly superseded by the word of foreign origin. The other essential element in the notion or idea of law is the idea of " order "-not, of course, in its purely arbitrary or technical meaning of absence of physical violence (though that special meaning has its own interest), but in the sense of symmetry or harmony. We are probably correct in supposing that this element, now so comprehensive, and, therefore, so hard to define, was in its origin physical-that, to the eye of primitive Man, there is something fascinating in the appearance of certainty or uniformity, in ever so simple a degree. The difference between a mob of wild cattle rushing heedlessly in all directions, and a file of horses or camels proceeding in regular succession, can hardly have failed to appeal to the rudimentary mind, long before the practical utility of the latter arrangement was perceived. We read in the instincts of 170</page><page sequence="3">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. children similar tendencies and admirations: the popularity of the methodical procession of the animals towards the Ark, the sym- metrical disappearance of each of the Ten Little Niggers. The progress of physical science has, of course, enormously strengthened the ethical aspect of this element, which is expressed in English by the word " right," a word which, as I have hinted, appears to have been the earliest English term for what we now call "law," and which, in many kindred languages, is still undistinguishable from that idea. Where an Englishman now speaks of " English law," a Frenchman will speak of "Droit frangais," a German of " Deutsches Recht," an Italian of " Diritto Italiano," and the like. A very curious extension of the idea is found in such phrases as " right angle" and " straight conduct," where the notion of symmetry as an ideal is clear, though not very easy to analyse. And it is, I think, not merely an accident that while the root-idea of " right " is what we call " straight," that of wrong is what is " twisted," as appears in the widespread use of the word " tort," as an equivalent for legal wrong, in the languages of Western Europe. It is, beyond question, again clear, that it is in the material universe that these two elements of compulsion and order are most perfectly united-that they are, in fact, inseparable. Hence the atti- tude towards his subject of the student of that universe. His science consists in discovering its laws; his art in adapting human conduct to them. It would, I suppose, be a perfectly arguable proposition, that if Man thoroughly understood and conformed to the laws of the physical universe-say on the subject of physical health-all illness, and, therewith, much of the evil in the world, would disappear. The trouble is: that, even if these laws were perfectly understood, many people would not conform to them-for example, that if the laws of nutrition were absolutely known, many people would still violate them, and suffer from indigestion. That would not, perhaps, matter so much, if mankind were composed of isolated individuals. It happens, however, that Man is a social animal, at least in the sense that he lives in groups, and that his indigestion and other ills react powerfully on his neighbours. Thus we come to the boundary-line which distinguishes the law of the jurist from the laws of the material universe. Briefly put, that law is, historically, and, still, in the main, actually, an attempt to prevent the individual encroaching on the interests of his fellows, or, to put it in another way, its object is the regulation of social conduct. The theologian and the moralist deal with Man I7I</page><page sequence="4">THE FUNCTION OF I.AW IN SOCIETY. as an individual; the lawgiver and the judge as a member of a social group. Can we suggest the scope of their functions ? It is, I think, an interesting fact to note that, so far as our know- ledge of primitive society goes, there seems to be little doubt that, of the two elements which seem to be the'root elements in law, it is the idea of compulsion which first attracts the mind of primitive Man. Also, to note that, in his belief, the compulsion is applied by non-human forces. No doubt, with his imperfect imagination, primitive Man attributes to those forces actions and feelings which he knows by experience to exist among his fellow-men. That is, of course, simple anthropomorphism-Man made God in his own image. The lightning strikes the tree, the flood washes away the hut. These are the acts of an offended Power. What has caused them ? Obviously some offence has been given. What is it ? Some act, probably quite irrelevant, is fixed upon; hence the system of " taboos," which are the first elements of a criminal code. Thus the social element comes in. The anger of the Unseen Powers is irresistible. Also it is apt to be indiscriminate. The victims of a tornado or a pestilence may have done no act to which the disaster can be attributed. But among the survivors may be one whose conduct has been suspicious, who has violated a " taboo." If he cannot be at once identified, he may be found by the sooth- sayer or wise man, or by the drawing of lots, which is, probably, an appeal to the offended Power himself to denounce the offender. Here are the elements of prosecution and trial, in their rudimentary stages. It is quite easy to trace the succession of changes which has developed them into the formal trial of the present day. The Christian Church in Western Europe took over the conduct of ordeals as the most natural thing in the world; though, to her credit, she abandoned it in the early thirteenth century. It is less than 300 years since the last witch was tried in England by the water ordeal; in southern Europe such things are still done. It would ill become me to speak disrespectfully of trial by jury. But I sometimes think that leaving the question of the prisoner's guilt in a doubtful case to that tribunal is not very far removed from the ancient ordeal by lot. In communities which we call " progressive," the ancient system of taboos is in time supplemented by a more positive code, in which "Thou shalt" takes its place beside "Thou shalt not." Due historically to the increased application of intelligence to industry of all kinds, as the gradually extending control of Man over material I72</page><page sequence="5">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. resources leads to the appearance of the economic arts-sheep and cattle rearing, agriculture, and simple handicrafts-this aspect of law becomes more and more prominent. It is commonly accepted that this development of economic life is intimately associated with a change in the organization of society, from the loose hunting or totem group, based on propinquity or primitive religion, to what may be broadly called patriarchal institutions, under which the economic, religious, and family rela- tions are only different aspects of the same bond, based ultimately on kinship, real or fictitious, through males. In the earlier stages of this change, the type may be said to be personal and autocratic; but, after a time, the single pastoral household expands into a class or tribe of closely inter-related families, living under a tradition both religious and economic, which, with the establishment of fixed agricultural settlement, becomes the " custom of the country." I am not going to stir the fiercely debated question, how far the self-supporting village of medieval Europe, India, or China, was a "communal" or "communistic " group. My object here is merely to emphasize the new importance of the positive aspect of law-the belief that law is no longer merely a series of inhibitions (" Thou shalt not "), but, much more, a series of positive commands (" Thou shalt "), the object of which is to ensure the continuance of a certain economic, religious, and social order, believed to be essential to the welfare of the group. The main object is no longer to avoid certain disastrous visitations by revengeful Powers; though, needless to say, abundant traces of the older ideas survive. It is, rather, to maintain a course of life which is believed to be productive of positive good. And, though this order is still deemed to rest on superhuman authority, that authority is no longer of absolutely unknown, incalculable, and mainly malignant Powers, but of persons believed by tradition to haveonce been human, and to have passed, by the portal of death, into the " Alcheringa " or Spirit Land, while their ghosts still haunt the dreams of their descendants. If revolt against this order is conceived of as possible, it is met with the simple expedient of outlawry or banishment from the group, admission to which is, necessarily, barred to all except those entitled to membership by kinship real or fictitious. This is the stage of Ancestor-worship. So essential is this scheme of things deemed to be, that it is extended, though with increasing difficulty, to the new groups which are thrown up by the yet further development of economic progress. I73</page><page sequence="6">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. The craft-gild and the merchant-league are essentially of this type. The rules of these bodies are, perhaps, more clearly recognized as of human origin than the immemorial custom of the village. Enrol- ment in the gild or league through apprenticeship to a full member is, obviously, not quite the same thing as birth in a village house- hold, though it is not very different from adoption, which is fictitious kinship. The patron saint is not, perhaps, believed to be the physical progenitor of the members of the gild or league; and the elder men or " aldermen " of the gild are not quite the same thing as the village elders, who are, in a physical sense, everyone's uncles. But the sequence of ideas is clearly the same-that obser- vance of certain practices will produce positive good, that the bonds of society include only those who will observe them, that the test of their validity is that they have " worked " from time immemorial. No one can fail to see the weakness of such a type of society. It ignores the fundamental fact of the individual intelligence, the restless mind which is constantly making new discoveries in which the average man is not interested, which he refuses to take account of in his way of life. Further than that, by adopting a fixed, in the place of a nomadic scheme of life, the new society offered itself as a tempting prey to enterprise. This was the situation which led, in what we call the " Middle Ages," to the establishment of the moder State, with its auto- cratic authority and its insistence on the ultimate verdict of military force. Historically, the same thing had happened in an earlier epoch, when the Roman armies conquered the then known world and established their autocratic Empire. After the fall of that Empire, the process began again; and though, this time, no world-State succeeded in repeating the achievements of Rome, the States of modern Europe, at least, are definitely of similar origin. Either they are the outcome of successful and organized conquest by an invading host, or they owe their origin to the emergence, within an ancient society of the patriarchal type, of a ruler whose power rests upon a military organization which has secured control of the ancient economic and industrial communities. Until the Swiss Bund of I308, there is no instance since the fall of the Roman Empire of any other way of creating a permanent State. The doctrine of State-sovereignty is simply the translation into political terms of the military doctrine of the supremacy of force. It may be used wisely or unwisely, benevolently or cruelly; but its character is essentially the same, and it is wholly different from the older system I74</page><page sequence="7">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. which it displaced as the custodian of law. It is, of course, admirably fitted to apply the inhibitive or negative side of law; and a well- known school of political thinkers has maintained, with much plausibility, that it is with this aspect of affairs alone that the State is, by its nature, qualified to deal. Be this as it may, it is an obvious fact that, in modern communities, " Law," in the sense of the jurist, has come to mean, to all intents and purposes, a rule of conduct enforced by the State. There is, therefore, a very real meaning in the antithesis ex- pressed by the phrase: The State and Society; and I distrust profoundly any attempt to treat the two as different aspects of the same thing. In some happier age, when the harmony of what appear at present to be irreconcilable forces and methods has been secured by means as yet undiscovered, this antithesis may well disappear. At present it seems best to recognize it, and treat it philosophically. Both institutions belong to humanity; both appear to be inevitable, if not essential, in certain stages of human development. Much has been done, in some countries, to harmonize them-notably in Western Europe by what is known as "representa- tive government " and the adoption of the principle of the majority vote. But there is a danger, in the very success of devices of that kind, that real and essential limitations may be overlooked. No serious person can believe that the vote of a majority can alter the fundamental conditions of the universe. These can only be ascertained, not affected, by the progress of knowledge. And the way to ascertain them is by observation and experiment, not by inhibition. The great virtue of the majority principle, strange as it may sound to say so, is that it has, historically speaking, promoted tolerance; and tolerance is as essential for the working of the social spirit as for the achievements of individual enterprise. In its origin a recognition of the supremacy of physical force, the very fact of the acceptance of majority rule has, in countless instances, prevented an appeal to force, perhaps because reasonable men have perceived that, given time, the views of a majority can be altered by other means. It is the modern version of the " truce of God," with which the Church in old days strove to mitigate the evils of anarchy. The surprising thing is, that this principle, of unknown though clearly modern origin, has extended from political, that is to say, military institutions, to those of a purely social type, and that it is found indispensable to the working of a vast number of economic, religious, and even educational enterprises. I75</page><page sequence="8">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. Putting together these fragments, it occurs to me that there is just one suggestion which I may venture to make towards a solution of the problem posed by the title of this paper. We find a social force which has, apparently, been working since the dawn of history in two directions-compulsion and order. In some mysterious way, which I am not sufficient of a psychologist to understand, this process has resulted in the generation of a tendency which, for want of a better name, I call " continuity." Unlike the elements of com- pulsion and order, it does not appear to have been an original element in the idea of Law. But it is not, I think, an exaggeration to say, that jurists now regard it as almost inseparable from the notion of law in its modern sense. We do not, in fact, lawyers or laymen, think or speak of isolated commands or expedients as " laws." We regard it as one of the tests of a " law," that it enables us to predict, with varying degrees of certainty, the sequence of future events. If there be anything in this view, we may perhaps regard law as the social memory, the nerve of consciousness which links one generation to another in the same society, and carries on the tradition of social life. I am not sure that this is true of all legal systems, especially modern legal systems. But in a system like our own, where precedent contributes even more than legislation to the structure of the legal body, there does seem to be some ground for thinking that we may here be on the right line of search. If this be so, it may not be immaterial to reflect, that the great work of the illustrious roll of English judges, stretching from the thirteenth century to the twentieth, has played a part in cementing the fabric of English social life the importance of which is not always sufficiently realized. For it is the peculiar characteristic of the English system, and of systems derived from it, that the judges, though historically and technically the servants of the State, and bound to enforce its commands, have, almost from the first, also played the important part of educating the community in the ethics of social conduct. And in that part they have drawn their inspiration, not from abstract and, possibly, unpractical ideals, but, by an almost imperceptible process of attraction and develop- ment, from the solutions arrived at by the better members of the community of the many problems of practical life. This is, I think, the inward meaning of their frequent appeals to the example of the " reasonable man," that favourite objective standard of the English judge. With unwearying patience, ingenuity, and unsparing labour, our Judges have, if I may so put it, woven into the national, I76</page><page sequence="9">THE FUNCTION OF LAW IN SOCIETY. that is, the political, life of the community that instinct of justice, that respect for ethical considerations, which, if it be not presump- tuous for an Englishman to say so, is one of the most conspicuous as well as one of the most honourable and abiding features of the English character. I know, of course, that a definition of " Justice " is a task which has baffled the wisest; but it is a task which no student of society can shirk. For the'difference between a mere crowd and a society is just the difference between body and spirit; and Justice, whatever else it may be, is a spiritual force without which no society can live. And as a mere crowd is converted into a society by the pursuit of a common aim, so the Law, by directing the energies of mankind towards the pursuit of Justice, has before it the ideal of welding mankind into a great and noble society. That is the historic function of Law in building up Society. 12 I77</page></plain_text>
