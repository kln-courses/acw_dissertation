Teaching and Learning Biology in the Primary School Classroom Anna Vikström Published online: 29 March 2008 © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008 Abstract Within the framework of variation theory, 7- to 12-year-old students' ways of understanding cellular respiration and photosynthesis were investigated against the background of their teachers' teaching. Eighteen students were selected by the teachers and interviewed by the researcher. Lessons were observed and video recorded, and stimulated-recall interviews with the teachers were conducted. The students' understanding of the function of oxygen and sugar in plants was described in four categories. The study concludes that young students can develop complex understanding if opportunities to learn are presented. The opportunities depended mainly on the language used by the teachers, such as metaphors, pointing out critical aspects of the object of learning. The study has implications for the rela- tionship between teachers' competence and students' learning. Introduction: Aims and Questions Is it possible for young children to understand abstract and complex biological processes, such as photosynthesis and cellular respiration? And if it is, how is it possible to bring about this understanding, and what is the quality of the understanding? The answers to these questions are, to a great extent, dependent on what is meant by "understanding something"; and, if we want to find the answers empirically, the theoretical framework of the study will be important. This paper presents and discusses some of the empirical findings made by Vikström (2005). The participants in the study were six primary school teachers and their students, ages 7-12. The object of learning in the study was the lifecycle of angiosperms. The relationship between the teachers' ways of teaching and the A.

Vikström learning outcome among the students was investigated, with a focus upon how the teachers' intentions were realized in the classroom, how opportunities for learning were enacted, and how this affected the students' learning. Theoretical Framework Theory of Variation The Object of Learning and Its Critical Aspects The most important theoretical tool for the study was variation theory as described by Marton and Booth (1997), Marton and Morris (2002) and Marton et al. (2004). Variation theory has sprung from the phenomenographic research tradition in which different ways of experiencing a phenomenon are investigated on a collective level, forming hierarchically ordered categories of description. The development of variation theory implies a shift from studying different ways of understanding something to studying how those different ways of understanding can arise and develop (Pang 2003). The theory takes the object of learning as the point of departure and claims that what actually comes to the fore of the students' attention is of decisive importance for what is being learned. The teacher may be striving for a certain intended object of learning, but what is decisive for the students is what they actually encounter in their classroom. What they encounter is the enacted object of learning, and this defines what is possible to learn in the actual learning situation. The lived object of learning is then what the students will experience of the enacted object of learning. Within this framework, ways of experiencing, ways of seeing, and ways of understanding something are looked upon as synonymous. If the object of learning is to make it possible for the students to see certain things in certain ways, it must be made possible for the students to discern certain critical aspects of these things and to discern them simultaneously. Marton and Morris (2002) wrote: Perhaps the most radical proposition in this volume is that what students learn is a function of what they can possibly learn. We have defined what the students can possibly learn in terms of the enacted object of learning, described as a space of variation. Our conjecture was that what was focused upon, what is taken-for-granted, what is invariant, and what varies simultaneously, is of decisive importance for what is possible for students to learn and to achieve, (p. 140) The critical aspects that define a certain way of seeing something must, at least in part, be found empirically for each specific object of learning. According to the variation theory, the only way to discern the critical aspects is to experience how they can vary, either at the same point in time (synchronic simultaneity) or by remembering earlier related experiences (diachronic simultaneity). Therefore, it is important to pay attention to what is varying and what is invariant in a learning situation. â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Teaching and Learning Biology 213 Patterns of Variation and the Space of Learning Patterns of variation created in the learning situation decide what is possible to learn, as the patterns can make the students aware of certain critical aspects. Patterns of variation cannot cause learning, but they can make discernment and, thus, learning possible. The space of learning then refers to the patterns of variation inherent in the learning situation; it is the enacted object of learning that depicts what is possible to learn. This space is, to a great extent, created by linguistic means in the interaction between teacher and student. Since the relationship between language and experience is dialectic, the experienced variation enables the student to discern distinctions that are realized in the language, and the linguistic distinction enables the student to discern the variation. Variation theory also makes it possible to study teaching and learning with the same tool, that is, by focusing upon the object of learning and the patterns of variation shown. Marton et al. (2004) stated, So now we can describe learning and teaching in relation to one another, from the point of view of learning, not as a relationship between cause and effect, but as a relationship between what is made possible and what possibilities are actually made use of. (p. 22) In summary, ways of seeing something can be defined in terms of the aspects that are discerned at a certain point in time. If learning means to become able to see a certain object of learning in a certain way, the conditions for learning must make it possible for the learner to discern certain critical aspects of that object of learning. Discernment is a prerequisite for learning and variation a prerequisite for discernment. What is varying and what is kept invariant with respect to the object of learning is of decisive importance for what is possible to learn. Different patterns of variation created by teachers and their students can be identified in a learning situation, and these patterns of variation constitute the space of learning (Marton et al. 2004). Metaphors and the Use of Language Sociocultural Perspectives Sociocultural perspectives, as in the contributions of Vygotsky (1999) and Wertsch (1998), have formed a complementary theoretical framework in the study as attention was paid to the role of language and communicative processes in the interaction between the teachers and the students. Vygotsky 's (1999) ideas about the zone of proximal development (defined as the distance between what the student is capable of doing on her or his own and what the student is capable of doing with the help of a teacher) were important, as well as the idea that learning precedes development. According to Vygotsky, understanding of scientific concepts on a general level is reached by communication and interaction. A teacher cannot transfer a certain way of thinking to the child; but, through â Springer</page><page sequence="4">214 A. Vikström linguistic interaction, the teacher can decide what direction the generalizations will take. A child's everyday concepts are developed "from below upwards" (p. 254), but the scientific concepts the child meets in school are developed the other way, from "the top downwards" (p. 254). The meaning of scientific concepts is then learned through explicit definitions that are connected with the child's concrete and personal experiences and observations (Vygotsky 1999). By scaffolding the student within the zone of proximal development, it is possible for the teacher to help the student to reach a general understanding of scientific concepts. The teacher's ability to evaluate the student's understanding and give instructions that are within reach of the student, but still close to the limit of what is possible to reach, is then critical (Mercer 1995; Westby and Torres- Val asques 2000). Metaphors According to variation theory, learning means to become able to understand a phenomenon in a new way. A new relationship is then formed between the learner and the phenomenon. Within this theory, language is the most important tool for building specific relationships between the learner and the object of learning. Metaphors are thus important in making the linguistic distinctions that form the space of learning (Tsui 2004). As in metaphors, anthropomorphic explanations in science teaching are controversial and debated issues. Upholders of the conceptual change tradition within the area of research in science education will argue that too simple explanations that are in violation of scientific explanations can become stable models that are hard to change (Eskilsson 2001). On the other hand, based on their longitudinal empirical findings, Helldén and Solomon (2003), as well as Holgersson and Löfgren (2004), claimed that it is possible to use different kinds of simple explanations and models because students have shown the ability to use those explanations in parallel and alternately with the scientific ones. Students' use of metaphorical explanations is then interpreted as part of their efforts to understand natural phenomena. Zohar and Ginossar (1998) argued for lifting this "taboo" because such explanations can make it possible to talk about very complex processes in less complex ways and because there is nothing that indicates that such explanations are an obstacle to further learning. Metaphors can give the students a personal relationship to the scientific concepts and help them to organize their knowledge into well-known forms. Another argument for lifting this taboo is that metaphoric descriptions of, for example, the life of plants are so commonly used in all kinds of popular science that children see and hear in the media that it is useless to try to avoid them. According to Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999), metaphors can help us to understand abstract phenomena against the background of our personal and concrete experiences. Our knowledge then becomes a part of what Lakoff and Johnson (1999) called our embodied mind. They argued that "true" nonmetaphoric scientific concepts do not exist. On the contrary, they claimed that conceptual metaphors actually are what make most abstract thought possible: â Springer</page><page sequence="5">Teaching and Learning Biology 215 The metaphoric character of philosophy is not unique to philosophic thought. It is true of all abstract human thought, especially science. Conceptual metaphors are what makes most abstract thought possible. Not only can it be avoided, but it is something not to be lamented. On the contrary, it is by the very means by which we are able to make sense of our experience. Conceptual metaphor is one of the greatest of our intellectual gifts, (p. 129) Rothenberg' s (1979) study of creativity in science also illustrates the importance of metaphoric thinking, the process of personal and internal language that might not be presented in the final description of the idea itself, yet is an important process that is integral to the practice of science. Methodology The Participating Teachers Six teachers, Annika, Birgit, Cajsa, Doris, Frida, and Eva, participated in the study. The teachers were not selected by me; it is more accurate to say that the teachers selected me as their participation in the study was a natural consequence of earlier collaboration between the teachers and the me in a competence development project initiated by the teachers. The six teachers worked in two different schools in a rural area. All of them were educated primary school teachers with between 10 and 20 years of teacher experience. None of the six teachers were science teachers though, meaning that their teacher education had not involved studies of science. Therefore, as often is the case in primary school, they found science teaching both difficult and challenging. The teachers' competence, especially in teaching plant ecology, was developed before the study described in this article. It was made possible in a competence development project (described in Vikström (2002)) carried out with the me in the role of teacher educator. One result of this earlier project was a change in the way the teachers focused and reflected upon their own teaching and their students' learning. Instead of focusing on activities and doing science and taking learning of the content for granted, the teachers started to focus upon learning science and to question this learning in a way that enriched both their own and their students' learning. All six teachers had the same educational background; they were involved in a similar way in this inservice project and were offered similar learning opportunities. This, of course, does not mean that they all reached the same understanding of the content. The teachers' individual understanding of concepts connected to plant ecology has not been investigated, only the ways the teachers talked about their own understanding. For example, Birgit and Doris frequently expressed difficulties in understanding the energy concept and cellular respiration. All statements of the teachers' competence in science teaching should therefore be considered with this limit in mind. The earlier cooperation between the six teachers and me formed an important platform for the study presented in this article. One outcome of the teachers' â Springer</page><page sequence="6">216 A. Vikström professional learning experience was a collective decision to teach students about the life cycle of angiosperms, with a special focus upon respiration and photosynthesis. This decision gave me the opportunity to carry out the study described here. By including the students' learning, the study describes a chain of connections between the teachers' competence, their teaching, and their students' learning. The Participating Students Annika' s, Birgit's, and Cajsa's students were between 10- and 12-year-old. They were organized in groups of about 15 students with varying ages. This means that the school-years four, five, and six were taught in the same classroom. Frida taught only school-year six, and all her 25 students were the same age, 12 years. The youngest students, taught by Doris and Eva, were between 7- and 9-year-old and organized in mixed groups of about 15 students in school-years 1-3. The backgrounds of the participating students were very similar, as they all came from middle-class families living in an environment that provided them with a good economic and social standard. I considered this an advantage in the study, as it strengthened the claim that varying opportunities for feedback and learning in the classroom made the main difference, not factors in the students' lives outside school. All students participated in the lessons, but only 18 students were interviewed. The students, 3 from each teacher, were selected by the teachers, not by me. There were several reasons for this: I knew the teachers well and had confidence in their abilities; the teachers were the ones who knew the students better; and this was considered to provide me with a better sample than by, for example, selecting the students with some kind of written pretest because of the students' young age. The predetermined criteria were to select students who were able to verbalize their thinking and could be expected to show different ways of understanding and reasoning about the life of plants. Based on their own experience of talking with the students about this content in general, the teachers selected students who they thought could meet these criteria. Finally, the theoretical background of the study supports this method of selecting the number and sample of students. The phenomenographic approach seeks to reveal different categories of understanding on a collective level, not an individual one, meaning that the categories represent abstract students and teachers. No attempts were made to find statistical evidence by, for example, collecting quantitative data about the number of students in each category. Preparations: Establishing the Object of Learning To understand why a specific object of learning is learned in one situation, but not in the other, it is necessary to study and compare different ways of teaching and learning the same content (Marion et al. 2004). The national curriculum in the â Springer</page><page sequence="7">Teaching and Learning Biology 217 Swedish compulsory school is principally organized as goals that should be brought about within either the first 5 years or by the end of the 9th and last school year. The life cycle of angiosperms was in focus throughout the study. "Being able to give examples of the life cycle of some plants and their growth processes" is formulated as a goal to reach within the first 5 years. This means that this particular object of learning can be dealt with many times during the first years in school, with the aim of reaching the goal in school-year 5 (Skolverket 2006/2007). The study started with three meetings, each of them lasting for about 90 min, where the six teachers and I established what was considered to be the intended object of learning. What does "being able to give examples..." really mean? How can that goal in the biology syllabus be interpreted? It was agreed that it could involve being able to answer such questions as: What is a seed? How is the seed formed? What is inside a seed? What happens when the seed germinates and the plant grows and reproduces again? The discussions also led to the important insight that these questions could be answered in many different ways and with different degrees of complexity. Since the teachers had an overall aim to bring about ecological understanding for their students, they particularly wanted to consider photosynthesis and cellular respiration, even if those processes are not mentioned in the biology syllabus as a goal to reach until school-year 9. This means that even the youngest students were exposed to a biology content that usually is not dealt with until much later. The main purpose of the preparation meetings was to make the intended object of learning as similar and shared as possible. In the discussions, critical aspects of ecological understanding found by Carlsson (2002a, b) were considered. The transformation of matter and the difference between matter and energy were focused upon in their relation to the understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, circulation of matter, and energy flow. For example, it was agreed that all students should understand that, during the right environmental conditions, cellular respiration is (a) going on inside the seed when it germinates and that (b) cellular respiration is a combustion process that demands fuel and oxygen and (c) that this process provides the seed with energy for different kinds of work. Work in this case could mean building carbohydrates in roots, stems, and leaves out of glucose. This was also something the teachers had studied during the competence development project mentioned earlier in this article. Data Collection About the Teachers' Teaching The preparation meetings led to agreements among the six teachers of what was supposed to be the common intended object of learning. Then the teachers were free to design their lessons as they wished to fulfill those intentions, and eight or nine 1-h lessons were conducted by each of them. As the researcher, I first observed two of the lessons and then video recorded the last one. The teachers were told to summarize the life cycle as a whole in the last lesson, so all the questions mentioned above were dealt with during that video- recorded lesson. The video recording focused on the interaction between the teacher Ö Springer</page><page sequence="8">218 A. Vikström and the students; the camera, therefore, followed the teacher and recorded conversations between the teacher and the students, as well as other kinds of activities, such as experiments. The video-recorded lessons provided me with the resultant data about the enacted object of learning represented by the created patterns of variation in the learning situations. Immediately after the lesson, the teacher and I watched the video recording together and carried out a stimulated- recall interview. That interview lasted about 2 h, and the teacher and I were able to stop the video to ask questions and make comments. The interview had the object of learning as its point of departure and provided data about each teacher's personal intentions and analyses of her own teaching, as well as difficulties she had experienced. Both the video recordings and the interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data Collection About the Students' Learning Eighteen students were interviewed before and after the lessons, and those interviews provided data about how the object of learning was experienced by the students. During the interviews, different kinds of artifacts, such as seeds and plants, were used to help the students to answer the questions. My knowledge of the previous experiences that the students had of the object of learning and of what they had encountered during the lessons was important for creating an interview situation where it was possible for the students and me to share a common ground and focus upon the same aspects of the object of learning (Linder and Marshall 2003; Tsui 2004). The interviews were semistructured and had as their point of departure the questions and critical aspects concerning the life of seeds and plants that were agreed upon during the preparation meetings with the teachers. The same questions, more or less, were asked in the first and the second interviews, but in the second interview, follow-up questions were added about aspects that had caught my interest during the lessons. The interviews with the students were also transcribed verbatim. The teachers and I also discussed the results from the initial interview, and the students' prior knowledge of the object of learning was, therefore, well known before lessons started. Analysis of Data The students' learning was analyzed against the background of their teachers' teaching. Critical aspects that defined varying ways of understanding the object of learning were identified, as well as the patterns of variation formed in the learning situations with respect to those critical aspects. This means that when a student, during the interview, talked about an aspect of the object of learning in a certain way, this was compared to how that aspect was enacted in the video-recorded lesson in terms of patterns of variation shown. It was also compared with intentions, interpretations, and difficulties in relation to the aspect that the teacher revealed during the stimulated-recall interview. ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">Teaching and Learning Biology 219 The aim of the study was not to find out how students as individuals understand or teachers as individuals teach, but to explore different kinds of understanding and teaching on a collective level (Marton and Booth 1997). Analysis started with an examination of the students' understanding and revealed the critical aspects that defined the four categories in the experienced object of learning. The video- recorded lessons showed different examples of the enacted object of learning, that is, the patterns of variation formed in the learning situation. When analyzing the video recordings, I focused upon how each teacher handled the critical aspects of the students' understanding in terms of what was - and what was not - possible for the students to discern in a situation. Stimulated-recall interviews with the teachers gave possible examples of the teachers' intended object of learning on a personal level, that is, aims and motives given by the teachers themselves. Thus, the students' experienced object of learning could be compared to the space of learning enacted in the classroom, which was the research focus of the study. The earlier cooperation among the teachers, the students, and me was seen as an advantage for the interpretation of data, as this made it possible to get closer to and understand the informants better (Hammersley and Atkinsson 1995) and to study the learning processes, in Vygotsky's words, "in movement" (Vygotsky, as quoted in Wertsch 1998, p. 35). The research design did not permit categorization of individual teachers or students. The categories in the "Results" section should be seen as examples of possible ways of teaching and experiencing this particular object of learning; therefore, they represent possible teachers and students (Marton and Booth 1997). The methods used and the number of teachers and students participating in the study were seen as sufficient for this purpose. Not all lessons were observed, and a limited number of students were interviewed; nothing is said about what happened and what was said when I was not present. This phenomenographic approach revealed different ways of experiencing the object of learning that could exist both between as within individuals (Marton and Booth). During analysis, the data material reached a level of saturation and resulted in the four categories. Any reasons to suppose that other categories would have been found with a different sample of students from the six groups are, therefore, not probable. Naturalistic generaliza- tions can be made, meaning that the result may be seen as relevant and valid for other teachers and students in similar situations (Stake 1995). I carried out the analysis of data, but the six teachers participating in the study have also taken part of the results through respondent validation (Hammersley and Atkinsson 1995). All transcripts were read by the teachers, who were allowed to make comments and clarifications, which they did in a few cases concerning insignificant details. I also met the teachers at two occasions during the analysis process: (a) to discuss the preliminary categories that were found at that stage and (b) to discuss the final result. The teachers found the final result trustworthy and recognizable; but, as Hammersley and Atkinsson have pointed out, while people are well-informed informants of their own actions, they are no more than that. However, it is important to remember the theoretical framework of the study - the aim is not to find the absolute truth, but a possible one. &lt;£) Springer</page><page sequence="10">220 A. Vikström Fig. 1 The research design Summary of the Research Design Figure 1 shows the different parts of the research design. The intended object of learning was established during the preparation meetings. In Student Interview 1, the students' prior knowledge of the intended object of learning was investigated. The agreements and findings from the preparation meetings and initial interviews influenced the lessons conducted. Observations and video recordings revealed the different enacted objects of learning in terms of different patterns of variation. Stimulated-recall interviews widened and enriched the picture of the teachers' intentions and difficulties. Finally, Student Interview 2 made it possible to analyze the relationship between teaching and learning. Results The Intended Object of Learning The result description in Vikström (2005) dealt with all the questions concerning the angiosperm life cycle mentioned above. This article focuses on just one of the questions, "What happens when a seed germinates and a plant grows?" and how the answer to this particular question was presented to and understood by the students. During the preparation meetings, it was agreed that they should be able to answer that question and that this could involve being able to talk about, for example, the conditions for germination, cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and growth in the seed, as well as in the green plant. There are several reasons for focusing upon this question. One is to limit the length of the article. More important is that this question was connected to the teachers' overall goal to bring about ecological understanding in terms of circulation of matter and energy flow in the ecosystems. Another reason is that this question involves some very abstract biological processes and I found it especially interesting that the most complex ways of understanding these were found among the youngest students. â Springer</page><page sequence="11">Teaching and Learning Biology 221 During the preparation meetings, agreements were made with the purpose of making the intended object of learning as similar and shared as possible among the teachers. Activities and experiments with the aim of offering the students the opportunities to fulfill the agreements were also carried out by all six teachers. A majority of the activities brought about were the same in the six teachers' classrooms; and, at a superficial glance, the lessons they conducted, therefore, seemed to be very similar. But at a closer look, the spaces of learning that were formed were different with respect to some important critical aspects. Different enacted objects of learning were created mainly as a result of the language used by the teachers. The language that was used reflected the teachers' own understanding of the concepts, as well as their personal intentions and decisions in practice. Even if a lot of time was spent to make the object of learning as shared as possible, it never became as shared as was intended. The Experienced Object of Learning The Initial Interviews The initial interviews showed that all students knew that seeds need water to germinate, but no one knew that oxygen also is a necessity. That seeds contain a food supply for the embryo was unknown, and most students thought that nourishment from the soil was necessary. Photosynthesis was a phenomenon they had encountered before in different contexts, and all students could somehow describe the process when sugar is produced by plants. Cellular respiration on the other hand was an unknown concept, with the exception of three students who expressed that this was "the opposite of photosynthesis," something they expressed without being able to explain it further. The Completing Interviews The interviews carried out after the lessons revealed four categories that described different ways of understanding photosynthesis and cellular respiration (Fig. 2). Category 1 represents knowledge that can be looked at as shared among all the students (e.g., seeds contain a food supply that the embryo can use during germination, and photosynthesis can start when they have developed green leaves above the surface). It was also shared knowledge that green plants produce sugar and oxygen in their photosynthesis out of water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air and that the sun is important for this process. All students also knew that sugar is then used for growing by the plant itself as some kind of "food" and that both seeds and plants "breathe," where breathing then included some sort of gas exchange with the environment. This shared knowledge is in itself worth mentioning as quite impressive, especially since earlier research (see, for instance, Driver et al. 1994; Wandersee et al. 1994) has shown that this kind of knowledge is rare among such young students. â Springer</page><page sequence="12">222 A. Vikström Fig. 2 The critical aspects that define the four categories of description An overall result of the study was that it is possible for even very young students to develop their understanding of abstract and complex biological processes, if that opportunity is offered to them in school. The opportunities are, in turn, dependent upon the teachers' competence, especially their competence to create patterns of variation in relation to the critical aspects of the object of learning. The following presentation of the four categories of description will focus upon the different ways of experiencing photosynthesis and cellular respiration that were found, and particularly upon how those ways of experiencing are related to the teachers' intentions and the space of learning that were enacted in the classroom. The hierarchically ordered categories of description that were found showed interesting variation in the students' ways of understanding the function of the sugar and the oxygen produced in photosynthesis. For example, if plants can make their own "food," what is it used for and how do they "eat"? And if the embryo needs "air to breathe," how does it breathe and why? The ways in which the students answered these questions varied, and their answers were also related to the opportunities of learning that had been offered to them. The students' understanding concerning those questions varied from the shared knowledge in Category 1 to the most complex understanding that is represented in Category 4. Description of the Categories and Their Relation to the Enacted Object of Learning Figure 2 shows the four categories of description. There is a focus upon the function of sugar and oxygen produced in photosynthesis in terms of the critical aspects that distinguish one way of understanding this from another way of understanding the same thing. ô Springer</page><page sequence="13">Teaching and Learning Biology 223 Category 1: Seeds and Plants Need Sugar and Air to Live and Grow In this category, sugar is seen as something that gives the plant "food," but the function of the "food" is not clear; it is just seen as necessary for the plant "to live and grow." The food supply in the seed is also "used by the embryo for growing," and embryos and plants "breathe in the same way as we do." Breathing is seen as just a transport of gases in and out of the seed or the plant. Like humans, the seed or the plant cannot live without air, but the function of oxygen is not clear, and it is not understood that oxygen is needed to combust sugar in cellular respiration. Metaphors are used to describe the importance of air. Without it, the seed can "suffocate," and too much water may cause the seed to "drown because it cannot breathe." During the interview, Beatrice (10), talked about photosynthesis as something that "produces food for the plant" and that "the food was made of sunlight and sugar." The interview continued with questions about the embryo in the seed: Beatrice: They use the food supply as nutrition. Interviewer: For how long do they need that food supply? Beatrice: Until it has come up to the surface, until the leaves have come and that... Interviewer: What happens then? Beatrice: Then it starts to produce its own food. Then it needs sunlight and carbon dioxide.... When it is a seed, it only needs oxygen, heat, and water... but then it needs everything. Interviewer: And why do they need oxygen, what is it used for? Beatrice: Well, they breathe the same way as we do.... But not with lungs... .But they breathe... Interviewer: The full-grown plant then, does it need oxygen? Beatrice: They breathe out oxygen when they breathe... During the stimulated-recall interview with Beatrice's teacher, Birgit, the use of oxygen was touched upon: O Interviewer: That seeds need air to germinate seems to be shared knowledge among your students, but do they know what oxygen is used for, why it is important? Birgit: Well, that is a question.... Actually I haven't thought about it. I have missed that completely. Birgit' s way of talking about the seed's need of oxygen was also illustrated in the video-recorded lesson. She showed her student Betty a glass filled with water with a pea at the bottom. Birgit' s intention was that Betty should figure out why the pea could not germinate in the water: Betty: Is it so that the seed does not get any oxygen there? Birgit: No, it doesn't. Betty: And then it can't germinate? Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">224 A. Vikström Birgit: No, it can't breathe; as with us humans, it drowns... Betty: Yes, I see, it suffocates... Another of Birgit' s students, Bob, showed the same way of reasoning in circles: "Seeds need oxygen to breathe" and "Cellular respiration, that is when they are breathing." Bob also wondered how it was possible for the seed to breathe "as they haven't any stornata to breathe with?" All six teachers, including Birgit, had the intention that the students should get an idea about cellular respiration in the seed. For that reason, all teachers wanted to show that seeds somehow use air and that oxygen is a necessity for germination. This was illustrated to all students by an experiment where moist peas were put in a closed pot. Then the peas start to "breathe" and oxygen is used in the combustion process, which can be proved when a lightened match goes out when the pot is opened close to it. Birgit' s student Bella explained this experiment during the interview by saying, "They breathe oxygen, oxygen is then finished, and the match goes out." Bella also had some idea that "oxygen is necessary for combustion," but she could not explain anything about combustion inside the pea or if there was any connection between the need of oxygen and the food supply inside the pea. During the stimulated-recall interview, Birgit also admitted, "Cellular respiration is difficult. I hardly understand it myself." Category 2: Sugar is Used as a Building Material in the Plant In this category, it is understood that plant itself is built up of sugar with the help of the energy from the sun. The function of oxygen is, on the other hand, not clear; and cellular respiration is seen as something that only occurs in animals and humans, "Animals and humans breathe oxygen and plants breathe carbon dioxide." The meaning of photosynthesis and the role of sugar and solar energy are developed through metaphors. Plants "build sugar" out of carbon dioxide and water. Energy from the sun is important so that the plant can "manage to build sugar" and then plants "use the sugar as building blocks" for further building. Those metaphors made it possible for the students to discern not only that plants are built up from carbohydrates with glucose as the monomer, but also the general concept that work demands energy, even if it is work carried out by a plant. This means that, in this category, it is somehow understood that there is a difference between matter and energy: Interviewer: You all know that sunlight is important, but what is it used for? Camilla (10): To grow. Interviewer: But why... what are they doing when they grow? Camilla: They make sugar, they use sugar to build with. Interviewer: And the sunlight, why is it important? Camilla: They need sunlight so that they can manage to build. Camilla's classmates, Christian and Carl, also knew that plants use sugar as a building material and that the embryo can "build roots and stems and leaves out of â Springer</page><page sequence="15">Teaching and Learning Biology 225 the food supply" in the seed. Their teacher, Cajsa, talked about carbon dioxide and water, as well as sugar, as building materials and compared them with other materials like building blocks and bricks. Photosynthesis was described as "work just as when we as humans build things." This metaphoric talk shows the need for materials and energy for the labor as something invariant, while the kinds of building materials and energy sources varied. The function of oxygen was unclear, and this could be described as "They breathe carbon dioxide and change it into oxygen that we need." The thought of "exchange" of oxygen and carbon dioxide was very significant in this category. The students who looked at it in this way have heard their teacher talk about this in words like, "What do we give to the plants that they need? And what do we get from them in return?" as both teachers Cajsa and Doris showed several examples of during the video-recorded lessons. This gave the students the impression that the processes inside and the needs of humans and animals compared to plants were quite the opposite. During the stimulated-recall interviews, Cajsa mentioned this with the importance of "knowing that we are dependent on each other" and that "It would be too much for the students if I should introduce the fact that also plants combust sugar in cellular respiration." The function of oxygen in the seed were unclear to both Cajsa' s and Doris's students, but for somewhat different reasons; while Doris had difficulties with her own understanding of the concept and, therefore, avoided it, Cajsa explained her choices differently by saying that it was too difficult for her students. Category 3: Sugar is Used as Fuel, and Oxygen is Needed for the Combustion of Sugar Category 3 can be seen as being hierarchically on the same level of complexity as Category 2. Compared to Category 2, in this category the metaphor of sugar as a "building block" is replaced by another way of describing the function of sugar. It is now seen as fuel in the cellular respiration, and oxygen is needed in the combustion process - and a way of experiencing that was most clearly demonstrated among Annika' s and Frida' s students. This was made possible by the forming of patterns of variation that in the learning situation were formed by various examples of combustion with, for example, an open fire as a metaphor for what is going on. In all combustion processes, the need of fuel and oxygen, the formation of carbon dioxide and water, and the loss of energy are invariant. But the contexts and the fuel used can vary, as in a fire; an engine; and cells in plants, animals, and humans. In the completing interview, Frida' s student Fanny seemed at first to be unsure about the function of oxygen in the seed, but when I asked her about the similarities between the processes in a seed and an open fire, she immediately answered, "They combust the food supply with oxygen." This also shows the importance of sharing a common ground and focus upon the same aspects in an interview. Another metaphor used to explain cellular respiration is when the plant, or the embryo in the seed, "eats the food," that is the sugar produced in photosynthesis. This metaphor is used to explain what is going on when the sugar produced in Ô Springer</page><page sequence="16">226 A. Vikström photosynthesis is combusted together with oxygen. The food supply in the seed is seen as "a meal packed by Mummy Plant," and this metaphor refers to the fact that it is the photosynthesis in the mother plant that is the process behind the food supply in the seed. Anna talks about seeds and plants this way: Interviewer: What is there inside the seed? Anna (11): There's a food supply, it is a food sack for the embryo. Interviewer: How is the food sack useful? Anna: They need it to grow... when they have reached the surface they can produce their own food. Interviewer: How do they "eat" their "food sack"? Anna: They combust it... when they get oxygen they combust, that means that they eat their glucose, their sugar. It is not only humans who need oxygen to combust their food, plants need it as well. Anna's teacher, Annika, made it possible for the students to look at the function of sugar and oxygen in this way through all the various examples of combustion mentioned above, which was clearly illustrated in the video-recorded lesson. Annika also talked about it in ways that connected the two processes of photosynthesis and respiration to each other in plants, as well as in other organisms. She was also perfectly clear about her intentions. During the stimulated-recall interview, Annika explained why she used examples like carrots and potatoes in her lesson: Interviewer: Storage of nutrition... I found that interesting, that you chose to talk about carrots, onions, and potatoes... why did you do that? Annika: Well, to show that there is nutrition inside the seed, but it can also be stored in plants. I wanted to point that out, in relationship to the seed. . .to store nutrition. It is possible to connect that to the cellular respiration, those carrots and potatoes, not just talk about the seed. In the stimulated-recall interview, Annika explained that she wanted her students to understand that plants also have cellular respiration and to give them some idea of the meaning of this concept. Annika' s student Anna expressed, "I used to believe that plants made oxygen merely for us, but it is also for them." Unlike the teacher Cajsa, Annika never talked about sugar as a building material, and neither did her students. During the interview Annika said that she had made a deliberate choice, to point out the function of sugar as fuel, but to leave the fact that it is also used as building material because "I don't think we had enough time, and I wondered if it would be wise to talk about that too?" Category 4: Sugar is Used as Both a Building Block and as Fuel This category is hierarchically above the previous ones and includes them all. In this category, it is possible to reach some initial insights into how matter circulates and energy flows through the nutrition chains in the ecosystems - insights that were â Springer</page><page sequence="17">Teaching and Learning Biology 227 demonstrated only among Eva's 7- to 9-year-old students. This indicated that it was the space of learning in Eva's classroom that mattered and that the young age of her students was not an obstacle. The most important critical aspects are the simultaneous discernment of the meaning of sugar as both building material and fuel and that photosynthesis transforms energy from the sun into chemical energy available to other living organisms. Patterns of variation are formed in the same ways as in Categories 2 and 3, but here the fusion between the two functions of sugar is focused upon and clarified. An example of a used metaphor that shows that fusion is "Plants use sugar as building blocks, but they also have to eat some of the sugar themselves so they can get energy and manage to go on building." Plants also "make the food of all living things" while they are "building" and "all living things respire," which means that they "eat and combust their food with oxygen." In this category, it is understood that the sun is the source of energy for building sugar, but for further building in the plant, the energy comes from the combustion of sugar. Interviewer: Does this plant need oxygen? Eric (9): Yes, but they can make their own energy... photosynthesis. No one else but plants can do that. We can't go out into the sunlight and say, "Now I'm going to be fed and fat!" Interviewer: Do plants have cellular respiration? Eric: Yes, they can do both... both respiration and photosynthesis. Interviewer: Can you tell me about some important difference between those processes? Eric: For respiration they need oxygen and for photosynthesis, carbon dioxide. Interviewer: What do they need more in photosynthesis? Eric: Sunlight... and water... Interviewer: And what happens then? Eric: They build sugar... and use that sugar as building blocks... Already at the initial interview, Eric talked about energy transformation: "The sun gives out energy, but not energy that we can... breathe... but plants can. They transform it into combustion energy." He also declared, "All plants and animals combust what they eat; and, when we eat, we get warm." Eric was also clear about the fact that without photosynthesis, "We wouldn't have any meat because animals eat plants, and plants are made of sugar." Only one teacher, Eva, made it possible for her students to see sugar as both a building material and fuel. During the stimulated-recall interview, she talked about this: Interviewer: How do they imagine cellular respiration, if that means that they "eat" the sugar? Eva: It's like we do; we eat food, and that's why we have cellular respiration. We don't produce our own food. At first they didn't understand. They thought it was either photosynthesis or respiration, they didn't think that both processes occurred at the same time in plants. ô Springer</page><page sequence="18">228 A. Vikström Interviewer: But what do they imagine happens? Eva: It falls apart... the sugar molecule, the building block... into carbon dioxide... and then the plants can rebuild the molecule again... Eva also explained that she took all opportunities to point out the difference between oxygen and carbon dioxide, as well as talking about the processes in different contexts: out in the forest, in the school garden, and in relation to the plants in the pots in the classroom. By this, her teaching formed patterns of variation that made the two functions of sugar possible to discern for her students. Conclusions and Discussion The Qualities of the Students' Learning Ways of Understanding and the Potential for Further Learning The four categories of description above represent possible students' potential ways of understanding the function of oxygen and sugar within plant cells. A more complex understanding of these processes is, in turn, useful in understanding circulation of matter and flow of energy through the ecosystems, as well as in our human societies. This also means that it can contribute to the development of the students' understanding of what is meant by sustainable development. Studies like this one can become valuable tools, as they point out critical aspects in specific objects of learning. Questions about what it means to understand something in a certain way are important to discuss among teachers; and the curriculum can then become a lived, evolving curriculum and a part of an increasing professional knowledge (as Marion and Morris (2002) argue for similar studies). "Understanding" can be looked at in different ways, depending on what theoretical perspective we choose. The kind of understanding that the students developed in this study can be seen as an increased potential for talking about abstract things in a meaningful way. According to Haliday's (1973) theories about language and learning, this potential consists not only of an increased potential of meaning, but also of the development of acting, talking, and thinking that enables the learner to participate in future intellectual activities. Wertsch (1998) stated that using other people's words, even if they are not fully understood, can have an important influence on the person who uses them in the long run. Thus, there are reasons to believe that in the students' capabilities of talking about the life of plants, there is potential for further learning. Understanding Cellular Respiration It is possible to tell students that seeds and plants "breathe" and make them repeat it without having achieved a new way of understanding the respiration concept. The â Springer</page><page sequence="19">Teaching and Learning Biology 229 words "breathe" and "respiration" can have different meanings, depending on what critical aspects the students have been offered to discern. Lakoff and Johnson (1980, 1999) claimed that metaphors can offer us a partial understanding of something, never a complete one. The system that makes it possible for us to understand a concept in terms of another will, according to Lakoff and Johnson, necessarily hide other aspects of the concept. By focusing upon one aspect of the concept, a conceptual metaphor can prevent us from focusing upon another concept that is incompatible with the first one. The metaphor "Seeds and plants breathe just as we do," with its ensuing metaphors "to drown" and "to suffocate," might be hard to unite with the metaphor "to eat." The students have very different experiences of those phenomena, which can give them completely different associations. The metaphor "to eat" as a partial description of the respiration concept, seemed to be more valuable for the development of a general understanding of the concept, as it points out the similarities of respiration in plants, animals, and humans and how the need for oxygen is related to the food we eat. Understanding Photosynthesis Metaphors were of decisive importance for the students' understanding of photosynthesis. Plants can "build" their own food out of carbon dioxide and water. "Building" means that carbon dioxide and water are "put together," forming sugar. The students have experiences that all kinds of building involve hard work. Work demands energy, and energy for the work made by plants is provided by sunlight. The metaphor "building block" is, therefore, followed by the metaphor "manage to build" when talking about the function of the sun. The metaphor "making their own food" could easily be transformed into metaphors concerning the seed and the food supply, "a food sack packed by Mummy Plant." "The food sack" can be "consumed" and "be finished." The metaphor "make their own food" was in this way followed by a whole system of conceptual metaphors that enabled the students to connect the abstract processes with their personal experiences (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999) and to start to develop scientific concepts "from the top downwards," as Vygotsky (1999) himself metaphorically put it. Concerning this, it may be noticed that when the teachers used metaphors in their explanations, they usually mentioned at the same time the scientific word for the concept: "Cellular respiration is when the embryo eats the food supply" and "What the plant is doing when it makes its own food is called photosynthesis" are examples of common expressions. Understanding Transformation of Matter and Flow of Energy Some metaphors pointed out that the food we eat gives us energy that has its origin in the sun and that this energy is available to us thanks to photosynthesis. "Plants can stand in the sun and get fed and fat," "make food for us," and transform solar energy into "combustion energy," as Eric expressed it. Such expressions as ô Springer</page><page sequence="20">230 A. Vikström "Animals eat plants, and then we get meat" and "All animals and plants combust their food" show that Eric has at least some initial understanding of the circulation of matter and flow of energy through the nutrition chains. The metaphors "Sugar is a building block" and "Cellular respiration is when they eat the sugar" are united in the metaphor "They have to eat some of the sugar themselves so they can go on building." This metaphor expresses the fusion between the critical aspects of sugar as both a building material and as fuel. Metaphors were frequently used by both teachers and students when talking about the processes, and they were more frequently used for abstract phenomena than for more concrete ones. Metaphors seemed to influence the students' understanding in different ways, and in that sense the metaphors were considered to be more or less useful for a good learning outcome. In the framework of variation theory, metaphors can be seen as an opportunity for the learners to use their earlier personal experiences, while offering them simultaneous discernment diachronically. For example, all students have experiences and memories connected with playing with building blocks. Building blocks can be used to build many different things, even if they still remain the same building blocks, and this metaphor therefore points out one of the critical aspects of understanding the nature of chemical reactions and transformation of matter. A conclusion drawn from this study is that the pedagogical values of the metaphors vary. Some of them, like the metaphor "the seed is suffocating," close the space of learning and hide the critical aspects. Others, like "sugar is a building block" and "cellular respiration means that the embryo eats the food supply" widen it, as they might enable the students to discern the critical aspects that help them experience the scientific concepts in a more general way. Whether metaphors should be considered useful or not is therefore an empirical question and a question that can be answered only with respect to the intended object of learning. Teachers Can Make Learning Possible If we want students to see certain objects of learning in certain ways, it must be made possible for the students to discern certain critical aspects of that object of learning and to discern them simultaneously. With the use of variation in respect to those critical aspects, teachers can point them out and make them discernable. In Birgit' s classroom, it was not possible to discern the function of sugar and oxygen within the plant, merely that it was somehow important. In Cajsa's classroom, it was made possible to discern that sugar is used as a building material, but the function of oxygen remained unclear. On the other hand, the function of oxygen in combustion processes was something Annika and her students talked about in general, in the open fire, in seeds and plants, as well as in their own bodies. The most complex understanding, the fusion of the two functions of sugar, was only made possible in Eva's classroom, and this knowledge was only expressed by her students, not by any of the others. As her students were the youngest, nothing in the study indicated that this complex understanding was a result of developmental readiness for abstract concepts. It is here important to emphasize that the relationship between teaching and learning in this study is not a question about cause and effect, but about ô Springer</page><page sequence="21">Teaching and Learning Biology 231 opportunities and how they are actually made use of (Marton et al. 2004). The study does not claim that all students taught by a certain teacher reached the same level of understanding. Only three students from each teacher were interviewed, but this is seen as sufficient enough to show that when opportunities are offered, they are made use of - but when the opportunities do not exist at all, it is impossible for the students to become able to see certain things in certain ways. According to the theoretical framework of the study, the categories of description and the critical aspects that define them are relative to the participating group (Marton et al. 2004). It cannot be totally excluded that if another sample of students had been chosen for the interviews, it might have revealed a category that is not described in the result. Moreover, if the same research design were used in a study conducted with, for example, secondary school students and teachers, other categories might be found. This does not, however, diminish the pragmatic value of the categories found in this study. Teachers' Intentions and Teachers' Competence An ability to present a certain object of learning in a certain way, that is, creating patterns of variation that make discernment of the critical aspects possible, presupposes that the teacher has the ability to see it in that way too (Runesson 1999). It also presupposes that the teacher has confidence in the students' abilities, and a deliberate intention to make the students understand the content in that way. In this study all the teachers shared the intentions that their students somehow should understand photosynthesis and cellular respiration. Birgit wanted her students to understand that sugar and oxygen were important, that seeds and plants need it to grow, and that they breathe just as we do; and she succeeded quite well. But she, just as Doris, also admitted that she found these parts of the object of learning hard to understand, something that made it hard for her to present it in certain ways. Cajsa pointed out the function of sugar in a more precise manner, but made the choice not to talk about respiration in plants, as Annika and Frida did. While Birgit and Doris made their choices with a wish to avoid things that they found hard to understand themselves, Cajsa's, Annika's, and Frida's choices were, to a greater extent, dependent on their confidence in the students' abilities to learn within the limited time. Eva's intention was to point out both of the functions of sugar in the cell, she had the competence to create patterns of variation that made those critical aspects possible to discern for the students, and she also believed that it was possible for her students to reach some understanding within the limited number of lessons. As noted above, despite all the efforts made to share a common intended object of learning, it never became fully shared, mainly because of the differences between the teachers' competence and personal intentions. This has implications for the use and effects of different national curricula and syllabuses and points out, once again, the importance of competent teachers. This conclusion is supported by Hattie's (1992) extensive investigations of factors influencing student achievement. One of his main findings was that feedback from the teacher has a much greater impact on achievement than new curricula. A teacher must be capable of interpreting the Ô Springer</page><page sequence="22">232 A. Vikström curriculum, something that requires knowledge about the qualitative differences between what it means to understand something in a certain way and another way of understanding the same thing. It then becomes a teachers' commission to make the critical aspects of that understanding discernable for the students. This might seem obvious, but it is important to make teachers aware of the power they have to make understanding accessible to their students. Implications for Teaching and Teachers' Competence Development By focusing upon the object of learning and upon how the students experienced it, all six teachers in the study developed their competence in science teaching in a way that would hardly have been possible if they had continued focusing on processes and activities as they did in the beginning of the preceding competence development project (Vikström 2002). The focus upon the object of learning made parallel learning possible for both the students and the teachers within their respective zones of proximal development (Ash and Levitt 2003; Vygotsky 1999). In conducting inservice competence development projects, it is not enough to propose hands-on activities that teachers can bring back to their classrooms. The activities have to be supported by insights about the understanding of the content - the teachers' own as well the students'. It is the responsibility of the teacher to make the meeting in the space of learning possible. Maybe the most important question a teacher should ask is "What is it that should be learned and achieved?" It is then important to find the specific critical aspects of that object of learning, and this is something that it is possible for a teacher to do in her or his own practice, together with colleagues, with or without the support of a researcher. Variation theory is, then, a valuable tool. It is not primarily a question of finding the right methods or the right ways to organize the learning situation, but a question of finding out what it means to understand something in a certain way. This way of understanding can then be described in terms of the critical aspects that must be discerned simultaneously. The opportunity to learn is, in turn, provided by the created patterns of variation, which make discernment of critical aspects possible. The teachers' professional competence, meaning their competence for promoting students' learning by forming patterns of variation, is then also developed. By accumulating knowledge about various objects of learning, teachers can develop their competence for doing their job. An overall conclusion is that collaboration between researchers and teachers in such a process of curriculum improvement is a way to increase teachers' professional knowledge. It is not the objects of learning in the curriculum document that matter, but the objects of learning that the students encounter in their classroom (Marton and Morris 2002).
