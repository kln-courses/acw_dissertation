<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Decade of Good Deeds and Wonderful Lives INDER C4H2ACCCN by Stephen Handzo Stephen Handzo teaches film at Columbia Uni- versity's School of the Arts. Optimism is critically suspect. Too often it implies insulation from the evidence of experience, or yea- saying to the status quo- the Norman Vincent Peale, Bruce Barton brand of sales-seminar boosterism that promises individual liberation while leaving the rules of the game unchanged. For Frank Capra, especially in the filmmaking decade beginning with MR. deeds goes to town and climaxing with it's a wonderful life, optimism was a dynamic force making possible what was thought impossible. His espousal of this philosophy has made him an easy, even willing target for those socially-conscious crit- ics who despise happy endings as the opiate of the masses. And yet, as has often been mentioned, Capra's own life is a success story more prepos- terous than any in his films. Contemporary American attitudes oscillate be- tween the poles of Capra (society can be redeemed) and, say, Samuel Fuller (society is so corrupt that the individual can survive only through guerilla war- fare). But it should be recalled that the films of the early Thirties were often as derisively cynical as those of today. It wasn't until the Depression's psychic shocks had been absorbed, and confidence was slowly being rebuilt, that Capra's optimism caught the public fancy. The director has always defended his "platitudes" by saying, "They're all true, aren't they?" If at this point he can still believe in the goodness of man . . . well, blasphemous old Harry Cohn surrounded himself on his deathbed with a priest, a rabbi, and a Christian Scientist, on the theory that "maybe one of them knows something I don't." Maybe Capra knows something the rest of us don't know, or have forgotten. I hope so. Mr. deeds goes to town (1936) continues to dominate discussion of the films synonymous with Capra's name. The facility with which the film can be attacked- by Raymond Durgnat, among others- indicates its weaknesses: obviousness and too many cheap shots at targets already exhausted by Warner Brothers (e.g. shyster lawyers, greedy heirs, culture parasites). Interestingly, the theme of country-boy virtue vs. city-slicker snobbishness (as well as its underlying anti-intellectualism) is more pronounced in ex- Broadway-playwright Robert Riskin's script than in cracker-barrel-story-teller C.B. Kelland's original "Opera Hat," an "up-to-date" murder mystery from which only the character Longfellow Deeds and some vestiges of the opera background survived. Rooting the film in such traditional American mytho- logy strategically countered its departures: fusing romantic comedy and social urgency, and casting doubt on the hero's sanity. Subsequently, Capra would draw his "little people" from an urban polyglot neighborhood for you can't take it with you, and attack rural political machines in mr. smith goes to Washington. The anti-intellectualism charge may be overdrawn, too; the greedy, power-hungry Capra villain- typically Edward ("Business-is-my-hobby") Arnold- is hardly intellectual, but Deeds can quote Thoreau. Politically, Capra films have something for every- body. His villains are stock characters from the demonology of the Left- an interlocking directorate of industry/press/government that is militarist and incipiently fascist (meet john doe)- while his heroes counter with 110% Americanism: voluntary associa- tion, self-reliance, Lincoln, the Boy Scouts. (Marx- ists found this especially vexing.) Capra films uphold the non-ideological nature of American politics (the most powerful American ideology of all), but the off-screen activities of his characteristic inter- preters, James Stewart and Gary Cooper, indicate the practical impact of these values. Of course, the iconography of popular stars transcends ideology. 8 NOVEMBER 1972</page><page sequence="2">f Theoretically, Ayn Rand's ideas are diametrically opposed to Capra's- and yet Cooper's trial in the fountainhead suggests nothing so much as Deeds all over again, with even the same silver-haired Establishmentarian character actors as antagonists. The politics of these films need not concern us further. The failure of the Durgnat approach is that it gives no sense of what watching deeds is actually like. Surely, the face of Gary Cooper and voice of Jean Arthur are the film's real "content." In their first appearances in a Capra film, Arthur and Cooper join the list of stars (Clark Gable, James Stewart, Ronald Colman) whose screen personalities were forever cast or recast under his direction. He, in turn, would hold up production for months to get the "right" cast, knowing that nothing flaws a film more completely than inappropriate or inadequate performances. For all the tumultuous precision of Capra's mass scenes, the best moments in deeds are the oases of feeling far from the madding crowd. Arthur and Cooper in Central Park (she playing "Swanee River" on a garbage can) foretell the equivalent Arthur- Stewart scene in you can't take it with you played in one five-minute unbroken shot, perhaps the long- est to that time, that intuitively anticipates Bazin's single-take aesthetic of psychological integrity through space/time unity. The nocturnal love scenes in deeds, played in the semi-darkness of Joseph Walker's backlighting, are some of the love- liest romantic evocations this side of Borzage- something for which Capra is never credited. While the acting in his films has been a source of wonder, Capra demagicalizes it, saying he doesn't believe in "acting" at all. While critics at- tacked stars for playing themselves, Capra en- couraged them to be hypertypically themselves. With no stage experience, but lots of life experience, Capra pioneered Stanislavsky acting without know- ing it, giving every extra an emotional history, cajol- ing grizzled Harry Carey into believing he really was Vice-President of the United States. Always "leery of the Method," Capra found in Peter Falk's total absorption during the filming of pocketful of miracles- wearing his costume overcoat every- where-the kind of affinity he always sought to inspire. By deeds, Capra had come so far from the embarrassingly flat line readings in, say, dirigible that the social clash of the film and the psychological "set" of the characters is conveyed in the rhythm of speech. One never doubts the absolute honesty of Cooper's laconic lines, while lawyer Douglas Dumbrille's rapidity and polish seem mentally pre- rehearsed, a product of too many business lunches with words used as the currency of self-advance- ment. Capra's characters are always doing something. Arthur plays with a yo-yo; Deeds' trial becomes a fugue of finger-drumming, doodling, and "O-filling." His films are very stingy with close-ups, which are used mainly for crucial reactions. Scenes are con- structed within the middle distance, where charac- ters can relate to the objects around them and to each other with their whole bodies. Watching Capra, who talks with his hands, makes it easy to see where such previously inert actors as Gable and Glenn Ford suddenly acquired those animated Sicilian gestures. Capra's reputed pacing isn't just speed; his Thir- ties films are not particularly fast by either today's standards or those of the time. Rather, Capra- a great story-teller on screen, in print, and in person- knows the value of a logical, well-developed narra- tive that nevertheless allows for digressions. Robert Riskin, who took over as regular script collaborator with his original story and screenplay for american madness, brought to Capra films a craft in story construction and an ear for dialogue previously absent. The earlier dirigible and miracle woman had been rickety structures whose only function was to frame the novelty elements (polar exploration, evangelical quackery) that absorbed the director's interest. Capra and Riskin eliminated outdated genre elements by creating their own genre. From his non-Capra scripts- the whole town's talking (with a proto-DEEDS Jean Arthur), magic town, and mr. 880- it seems probable that Riskin introduced the subject of the little people who march to their own drum and become prey for the cynical. But the undisciplined moralistic mawkishness of magic town and the low quality of his directed film when you're in love prove him dependent on a strong director. Ironically, Capra's most effective and visually sophisticated films- it's a wonderful LIFE, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, THE BITTER TEA of general yen- are all non-Riskin, suggesting that Riskin's virtue and limitation is his conception of film narrative in playwrighting and novelistic terms. (He once said he introduced "invisible act cur- tains.") Riskin's script for deeds, with its metrical alternation between Deeds and his antagonists, exemplifies Eisenstein's observation in his essay on Griffith: the application to film of Dickensian parallel action. The "reactive character" is a key to Capra's cinema. It's hardly an original device- Lubitsch played whole scenes from the viewpoint of keyhole snoopers- but Capra perfected it to serve the TV laugh-track function of cueing audience response. More importantly, for a director who walks a tight- rope between the ridiculous and the sublime, the reactive character anticipates audience skepticism and enables Capra to undercut his own sentimen- tality (and perhaps express his own qualms). When- ever things get too marshmallowy, there is always an insert of an abrasive Lionel Stander or Peter Falk to object. As Capra puts it: "The world objects." What William S. Pechter calls the quality of "irre- ducible foolishness" in Capra's heroes necessitates someone else with whom the audience can identify -like experienced, common-sensical Jean Arthur, the hero's simultaneous confidante and betrayer. If a sophisticated newspaperwoman can be "con- verted," the audience must succumb to the suspen- sion of disbelief. To a great degree, Thirties films, especially Capra's, are a "people's theater": the reaction shot is a kind of Shakespearean aside, and the on-screen crowd in deeds (shift- FILM COMMENT 9</page><page sequence="3">both photos: MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN, Gary Cooper and Jean Arthur. all photos: Museum of Modern Art /Film Stills Archive, unless otherwise credited. ing its allegiance as Cooper gains the initiative) is a continuation of the 19th-century melodramatic tradition of audience participation. Only three years older than mr. smith, deeds looks and sounds much more archaic and is often technically ramshackle: the opening shot of a box- car hurtling off a cliff looks like the "sock" opening of one of Harry Cohn's deadly "B"s, and the routine montages of newspaper headlines superimposed on crowds are only a pale hint of effects to come. "Good will" triumphs a little too easily; as "populist" values lose out to the New Deal, Capra films develop internal tensions that make them more interestingly ambiguous. But deeds still has some of the freshness that made it one of Hollywood's true originals, because the roles and situations are not yet hardened formu- lae. Longfellow Deeds is a genuine character, the greatest in the Capra gallery, and not a dour "archetype" like John Doe. Also remarkable is the Sicilian-born, slum-raised Capra's talent for evoking the hopes and dreams of Middle America, creating in Cooper the WASP's idealized image of himself. Perhaps the greatest tribute to deeds was paid by the Nazis, who made the film required viewing for officers in their prospective army of occupation for the United States! That deeds became the basis of Capra's later films was probably the audience's choice rather than the director's. Lost horizon (1937) was a complete departure in setting and plot, and proved two things: that an urbane Colman was as much a Capra hero as a folksy Cooper, and that Frank Capra could make a flop. One of Western man's great delusions, said H.L. Mencken, is that there is a great store of wisdom in the East. With the spell the photography, sets, and music can still cast, "Love Thy Neighbor" admittedly sounds more exotic from marmoset-like Sam Jaffe in a cardboard lamasery, but the great ironic truth of lost horizon is that Shangri-la is a bore. The power of lost horizon is in flfe early images: the hysterical mobs of refugees, the escape in an airplane mysteriously diverted and crashing, the treacherous trek to the hidden city. The dramatic momentum isn't regained until Colman and his brother brave the elements to leave. The implication is clear: without conflict, life stagnates. And so does film. "Utopia," after all, means "nowhere." "Shangri-la in a frame house" was one crit- ic's view of YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU (1938), a huge hit that today seems badly slowed by too many reaction shots, and by ponderous Lionel Barry- more's self-conscious, head-scratching impishness. When few had it, the film's anti-money philosophy was welcome, though today it smacks of sour grapes, since the Depression effectively froze social mobility. Actually, the Vanderhof clan's income is ambiguously adequate to support (Negro) servants; and massive socio-psychological evidence suggests that the least happy are the very rich and the very poor. You can't take it with you was praised for making the play's madcap menage of cartoon cut- outs into plausible people, for bringing warmth and balance to a "screwball" genre already out of public favor. Hawks' contemporaneous bringing up baby, in making everybody crazy, left the audience no-one to identify with- and paid for it. Today, diametrical- ly-reversed audience preferences have released the anarchic Id uncensured by the social Superego. But the shortlived "screwball" genre produced fewer important films than the serio-comic viewpoint: Stur- ges' Capraesque sullivan's travels and Christ- mas in july, Stevens' last stand of literate populism, the talk of the town, and the Cukor-Kanin the marrying kind, which deftly wedded Thirties sociol- ogy with Fifties sitcom. With three Oscars in five years for best direction under his belt, Capra combined the stars of you can't take it with you, the general plot line of deeds, and the symbols of popular sovereignty into the archetypal Capra political drama, mr. smith goes to Washington (1939). The pitting of Claude Rains, with a noblest-Roman profile demanding perpetua- tion on the face of coins, against James Stewart, the younger and more emotional counterpart of Gary Cooper, helped produce Capra's best pre-War film, and a significant escalation in aspiration and achievement. As in deeds, sudden death catapults a good- hearted nonentity into a lonely ordeal on the national 10 NOVEMBER 1972</page><page sequence="4">both photos: MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON, left: Claude Rains and Jimmy Stewart. right: Thomas Mitchell and Jean Arthur. stage; but in smith every scene, every shot exudes new assurance. From the opening profile close-up of a hawk-nosed, rat-faced reporter callously spew- ing the news of a Senator's death in office into the mouthpiece of an old-fashioned pay phone, a swish-pan /wipe sets in motion rapidly successive scenès leading to James Stewart's "honorary stooge" appointment, the expository pace driven relentlessly by wipes to establish the premises and power relationships in one minute flat. Capra's accidental entry into film inspired a con- viction that the neophyte who breaks all the rules, unaware that there are any, can triumph over sea- soned mediocrity. Stewart's elevation by the toss of a coin that lands on its edge is even more whimsical. His selection is heralded in a "star- spangled banquet" allowing montage-expert Slávko Vorkapich to gently satirize democracy's rites in a shower of stars, stripes, popping corks, and dutifully clapping hands. During an "Auld Lang Syne" send- off à la Deeds, Stewart receives his first briefcase in a triptych frame uniting the film's three main protagonists: Jefferson Smith (whose very name symbolizes agrarian democracy and the American Everyman) and, via portraits, Washington (the in- stitutional symbol of America's founding) and Lin- coln (martyred hero of rts greatest crisis- the origi- nal Mr. Smith and Christ-figure of U.S. politics). The scenes in the Senate rise above the rest, with the Chamber meticulously recreated and every word of the ritualistic procedure authentic, except for party and state affiliations. Though he is today regarded as a sentimental fabulist, Capra's main impact in the Thirties was as a realistic director; the veracity in smith is still astonishing, and Jean Ar- thur's explanation of how Congress works, or doesn't, should be in civics texts. A thousand details are woven into a tapestry: Smith's upheld hand unobtrusively framed against the flag during his swearing in; the microphone feedback adding hol- lowness to Rains' fraudulent testimony in hearings framing Smith in a land deal after his proposed Boy Ranger camp runs afoul of his mentors' graft schemes; the way Claude Rains' glasses, glinting wildly during his perjury, equate him with Boss Edward Arnold- whose rimless spectacles glare all the time, and whose tool Rains has totally become. Smith flags a bit at mid-point- with some hollow scenes between Arthur and Thomas Mitchell, and exposition-laden sequences of political machina- tions given visual interest only by Walker's use of table lamps for sinister low-angle source light- but reawakens with an amazing scene played in semi- silhouette at the feet of the statue of Lincoln (a continuous presence), in which Arthur finds Stewart, in tears, seething with the bitterness of the wounded idealist, and conceives the idea of the one-man filibuster. The last quarter of the film spirals to the most dizzying surge of dialectical frenzy since silent Eisenstein, with Capra orchestrating hundreds of vignettes and reactions into a virtuoso whirlwind. But unlike Eisenstein's analytic fragmentation, Capra's editing never loses the main character. The central image established early as a visual plot-cor- relative starts to pay off: Stewart standing behind his desk on the Senate floor, a slightly depressed angle suggesting heroic potential; the walls of the chamber converging behind him so that he is, figuratively and literally, cornered; fuzzily-focus- ed spectators- The People omnipresent- looking down from the galleries, passing judgment. The classical repetition of this core image makes Stewart an immobile bastion as the Senate Chamber be- comes both the eye of a cyclone and a gladiatorial arena. (Such imagery makes smith a film , rather than a good script well-directed, like deeds.) In place of Eisenstein's mass-hero, Capra gives us the mass "reactive character," the technical equivalent of a main tenet: individuals lead, masses huddle. The shortest vignettes are staged with re- markable density: as a youthful protester is carried kicking and screaming from a meeting, the camera pans a row of oblivious spectators and catches on one the fatuous expression of all the yes-men of history. With flawless timing, as Smith announces his filibuster will continue with a reading of "The Constitution of the United States," already-exhaust- ed Senators groan in unison; one spins in his chair and throws up his hands. Some of the cutting is almost subliminal. Into Harry Carey's hesitation on "The chair recog- nizes . . . Senator Smith," Capra cuts in flashes of Stewart and Rains vying for attention. And after Grant Mitchell deftly deflates Stewart's "Either I'm FILM COMMENT 11</page><page sequence="5">both photos: MEET JOHN DOE. left: Barbara Stanwyck and Gary Cooper. right: Gary Cooper. dead right or I'm crazy" ("You wouldn't care to put that to a vote, would you, Senator?"), Capra under- cuts him with a quick glimpse of Jean Arthur curling her lip- using a character of established sophistica- tion and intelligence to reinforce the audience's pain. Stewart's anguished expression and limp torso during his one-man filibuster suggest for a moment "Ecce Homo" as he faints and is buried in an avalanche of "Taylor-made" hostile telegrams. It would be hard to top that but Capra does, as Rains attempts suicide and rushes to the floor screaming "I'm not fit to be a Senator!" The film ends ambig- uously, with the Senate in turmoil and the fate of the political machine unresolved. Often hollow in its moralism and rhetoric, for example the disproportionate cheering by Legion- naires at some belligerent homily of Stewart's, mr. smith is probably a failure by the highest critical standards. But the whole thing is put across with such verve that it hardly matters. If mr. smith is archetypal Capra, meet john doe (1941) is Capracorn Kabuki, with the earlier film's formal richness solidifying into formula and ritual. Despite Edward Arnold's strong performance as the evil newspaper magnate, his character has all the depth of a Herblock cartoon, with neither the inner conflicts of YOU CAN'T take it with You's Kirby nor a morally ambiguous Claude Rains to front for him. But the Arnold character does at least understand that reaction in America cannot present itself undis- guised; it needs the trappings of populism. Thus the choice of ex-baseball-player Gary Cooper as the plain-talkin' mouthpiece for a fascistic Corporate State. And thus the mass scenes in doe, which combine the Spirit of Woodstock with the Substance of Spiro. At the "John Doe Rally," the camera tracks through row upon row of singing, rain-soaked con- ventioneers, and provides a "set piece" of political spectacle equalling potemkin or triumph of the will. As the convention turns into a riot, a wet newspaper thrown at Cooper streaks the headline "John Doe a Fake" across his face, so timed to climax his humiliation. One wonders if Capra isn't too perfect and deliberate for modern taste. The basis of the deeds-smith-doe trilogy is its modern recasting of the Gospels. (No wonder they have such strong plots.) It is implicit in deeds- "People have been crucified before"- and quite explicit in doe- "the first John Doe . . . two thou- sand years ago." But Barbara Stanwyck's hysterical histrionics intervene, in a last-minute Calvary cavalry charge; neither Capra nor his audience was prepared to carry this hypothetical^ plausible Second Coming that far. As Dwight Macdonald has observed, there is something very American in the idea of an uncrucified Christ. Meet john doe is self-defeating for reasons other than the publicized confusion over its ending; Capra is appealing when extolling vagabondage and ec- centricity, less so when glorifying plebeian aver- ageness in terms akin to a George Wallace rally- all the more ironically since his own film shows the ulterior exploitability of "typical" Americanism. Not until contemporary TV commercials has such con- centrated technical virtuosity served such aggres- sively banal content. In retrospect, Capra's slippage can be dated from doe, his first film in years failing to either make the National Board of Review Ten Best or figure impor- tantly in the Academy Award nominations. There were signs too that audiences were starting to rebel against "messages." The solitary dissent of Alistair Cooke on deeds- that Capra had begun making films "about themes instead of people"- became a chorus. The "little people" in his films were sound- ing more and more like ventriloquist dummies speaking with one voice: the director's. Preston Sturges, unconstrained by having to fit his human "found objects" into a social theory, was stealing Capra's thunder in satirical Americana- sullivan's travels tweaking show-biz social-consciousness à la john doe- while Orson Welles seemed to make Capra a stylistic anachronism. It's a wonderful life (1946) is best described as A Christmas Carol from Bob Crachit's point of view. Capra's first post-World War M production- and the maiden effort of Capra's independent Liber- ty Films- is, surprisingly, not forward-looking but reflective. Perhaps lack of confidence accounts for Capra's taking refuge in a reprise of characteristic 12 NOVEMBER 1972</page><page sequence="6">left: AMERICAN MADNESS. Constance Cummings and Walter Huston. right: IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. MaryTreen and Jimmy Stewart. themes and situations and surrounding himself with familiar faces, both in the cast and behind the camera. Whatever the reason, wonderful life thus be- came Capra's contribution to what Andrew Sarris has called the Forties "cinema of memory." It is his AMBERSONS, his HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY- One man's life and the collective autobiography of a small town (the archetypal American microcosm) in the era spanning the two world wars. Abandoning his customarily linear narrative, Capra makes the entire film an extended flashback. Instead of the usual time-span of weeks or months culminating in a decisive act, the film chronicles decades through the character George Bailey- a Deeds who never got rich, a Smith who never got appointed to the Senate, a Doe who remained obscure- who just got old. Bailey is less a character than a container into which James Stewart pours every nuance of his own being, exposing his whole emotional range in a two-hour tour-de-force. Surpassing even mr. smith, it remains Stewart's own favorite performance, as wonderful life is Capra's favorite of his films. It is also Capra's most Ford-like film, dealing with themes of community and continuity, and taking place in the generation just past. Capra draws upon the common experiences of those years, including the shared movie experience of which his own films were a preëminent part. Consequently, as the decades pass, the style of the film is modulated to match the evolution of Capra's work. The high-school prom that writes finis to the Twenties is done in the style of late silent slapstick comedy with an elaborate sight gag- pranksters part a dance floor to reveal a swimming pool as the dance becomes an aquacade. The coming of the Depres- sion, with Stewart and bride Donna Reed sacrificing their honeymoon money to salvage the building-and- loan, is handled with the click-clack pacing of early Thirties films, specifically american madness. Stewart's collisions with tycoon Lionel Barrymore (erstwhile Grandpa Vanderhof, now in the Edward Arnold part) obviously recall you can't take it with you, mr. smith, and john doe, while World War II is depicted with "Why We Fight"-style documen- tary clips and the actors ingeniously and unobtru- sively integrated via a new blue-screen process. George Bailey's adult life is picked up in 1928 when he assumes charge of the building-and-loan; 1928 was the year Capra joined Columbia and his career, after two false starts, began in earnest. Stewart weds Donna Reed in 1932, the year of Capra's marriage to his wife of forty years. Bailey has four children, as Capra would have but for the death of his little son. Wonderful Life is, then, a personal and professional autobiography, though usually less specific. One can find the wild oscilla- tions of euphoria and despair of Capra's films in his own life: an over-achieving childhood and ado- lescence followed by a long drought of unem- ployability and emotional paralysis, a film career launched by accident leading to temporary success (with Harry Langdon) followed by despair again, success again. Violent shifts of mood give his films the sense of life being lived. In wonderful life, with the audience not yet recovered from the swimming pool scene, Stewart's playfully erotic pursuit of Reed through the bushes is chilled by news of his father's death. (From the triumphant press preview of his biggest hit, you can't take it with you, Capra was called to the hospital where his son had just died.) Stewart, facing ruin, snarls viciously at his family, exposing the streak of paranoia and self-pity always implicit in a Capra hero (Deeds punching a poet; Smith beating up reporters). Stewart here is re- markably like Capra's account of his own actions during the year of enforced inactivity because of a contract dispute with Harry Cohn. It is supposed that Capra's theme is that people are basically good; instead it seems to be that people are good under the right circumstances. Careless critics think Capra sentimentalizes poverty, but real need in his films appears as desperation close to madness (the crazed farmer who tries to shoots Deeds; Stewart's sadism). Perhaps Capra, whose books begins, "I hated being poor, hated the ghetto," has created a portrait of The Man I Might Have Been. The crisis of values has shifted from the million- aire in you can't take it with you to the character who upholds the Capra ethos. The perpetually fall- ing "Home Sweet Home" sign in the earlier film is replaced bya less convivial anthropomorphic prop- the loose bannister knob constantly reminding Stewart of his shabby surroundings. Amid the FILM COMMENT 13</page><page sequence="7">mildred PiERCE-ish acquisitiveness of the middle Forties, Stewart's adherence to the Our Town virtues seems an anachronism. And his planned suicide is not an act of principle like Doe's, but an admission of defeat. When a folk-hero like Stewart contem- plates suicide, it is indirectly as clear an indication of post-war confusion as the best years of our lives- and a mirror, perhaps, of Capra's own self- doubts. If Forties Hollywood was a cinema of memory, it was also a cinema of imagination abundant in fantasy and dream sequences. Sidney Buchman's here comes mr. Jordan was just one of many films depicting Heaven as a super-efficient air-traffic con- trol tower. Mercifully, Capra deleted a similar open- ing scene in the wonderful life script (Scene: Interior. Ben Franklin's Workshop In Heaven) in favor of Christmas-card views of small-town streets, a sound montage of praying voices à la Norman Corwin's radio plays, and animated stars twinkling in conversation. Guardian angel Henry Travers- the original Grandpa Vanderhof on stage- lets Stewart see the world from the outside looking in, as if he had never been born. This harrowing film-within-the-film, a nocturnal parody of the sunlit main narrative, is enacted over a four-acre small-town set deep in highly realistic snow, and is puctuated with anguish- ed close-ups of Stewart's baggy-eyed face. One's ultimate critical estimate of it's a wonder- ful life depends on whether divine intervention is viewed as a deus ex machina cop-out or as a legitimate recourse to the classical tradition of met- aphor. That other Italian, Dante, pioneered the di- dactic guided tour; and what is wonderful life but an inverted Faust in which life is taken, not given? Instead of the editorial virtuosity and "set pieces" of earlier films, Capra gives individual scenes a new emotional density: a Bailey family dinner in which a whole meal is consumed in one take; an erotic telephone scene between Stewart and Reed in which a Capra hero actually evidences sexuality; Stewart's isolation in the frame when his brother's marriage insures that he (Stewart) will stay chained to the building-and-loan- anticipating the themat- ic-spatial unity of the last shot in the searchers. It's a wonderful life certainly has faults. Apart from his rescue by a guardian angel, Stewart's suicidal intentions aren't particularly consistent with his character as established; the scenes with Barry- more (imitating his annual Scrooge performance on radio) are too rhetorical and dully shot. Indeed, the whole Barrymore character is oddly 19th-century. Nevertheless, wonderful life is one of the most personal visions ever realized in commercial cine- ma. Rich in performance, unflinching in its con- frontation of the "permanent things" of human existence, it is probably the film for which Capra will ultimately be remembered. Capra has said he tried for no less. It is tempting to connect Spencer T racy's fall from grace in state of the union (1948) with Capra's sell-out of his figurative and literal Liberty to a major studio, giving an ironic dimension to what Andrew Sarris has called the obligatory scene in Capra: "the confession of folly in the most public manner possi- ble." Tracy in state: "I lost faith in you, faith in myself . . . was afraid I wouldn't be elected. That's why I'm withdrawing . . . because I'm dishonest." Capra in his autobiography: "I fell never to rise to be the same man again either as a person or a talent ... I lost my nerve ... for fear of losing a few bucks." To a remarkable extent, Capra's films caught the mood of America in the Thirties and Forties. When sufficiently little was happening in the world for the masses to be bemused for weeks by the deserved misfortunes of the rich, Capra rebuilt the Depres- sion-bruised male ego with reassurance that, despite unemployment, he was still virile and the master of any situation: "Twenty million dollars and you don't know how to dunk." Deeds and you can't take it with you combined the folk experience of the Depression (bankruptcy, eviction), born equally of the renewed confidence inspired by the New Deal and the need to dispel the lingering malaise. Mr. smith tempered the muckraking of the earlier Thir- ties with the vindication of a flawed democracy that was threatened with extinction abroad. Doe (visually darker than earlier Capra, and not just because of a different cameraman) caught that moment when, in Roosevelt's phrase, Dr. New Deal gave way to Ďr. Win-the-War. State, released by Louis B. Mayer's MGM, had Tracy advocating immediate world government and mass public housing- a poignant reminder of the hopes cherished for the "post-War world" before the Cold War and the long night of McCarthyism froze the New Deal-Fair Deal reform impulse at its root. Internally, the Capra films became more pessi- mistic, though this was not immediately apparent. Only in deeds does the hero win a clear victory by his own efforts. In smith, the end is more absurdist than triumphal, and the popular protests are all beaten down. (Even in these two films, the arbi- trariness of the "happy" endings was underscored when the Russians circulated throughout Europe captured prints of deeds and smith, respectively retitled grip of the dollar and the senator.) In doe the people's movement is completely discredit- ed, and it is unlikely that Cooper's few remaining adherents can rebuild it. In Capra's later films, the hero is often saved by a directorial decree as dicta- torial as it is delirious. The acquisition of awareness, simultaneously so- cial and sexual, is the subject of mr. deeds, mr. smith, and John doe. In state of the union, aware- ness includes the hero's own culpability. After 1 948, Capra made only four more features. Ironically- for a director who had accused his colleagues of learn- ing about life from each other's movies- two of the four were remakes of his own films; auteurism had become autocannibalism. Various explanations, some plausible, have been advanced. Most proba- bly, Capra put all he had and all he was into it's a wonderful life. And, after the confession of state of the union, there was no place left to go. |||||||| 14 NOVEMBER 1972</page></plain_text>
