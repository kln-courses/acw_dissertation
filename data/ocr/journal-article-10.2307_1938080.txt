I found this to be at once the most inspiring and most exasperating section of the book. Many hypotheses are indeed testable by experiment, as the authors claim, but others are infuriatingly vague. This is partly due to the anthropomorphic shorthand of sociobiological writing used throughout the book. Botanists, in particular, will wonder how to approach hy- potheses such as H 15, "As the process of choice continues [over large segments of a plant], decision making tends to become more centralized"; and H27, "Both angiosperm and gymnosperm females evaluate the size of the pollen crop." To a large extent, explanations of vaguely stated concepts can be found in earlier pages, but how to test these hypotheses empirically is left to the reader's imagination. To summarize, Willson and Burley have brought together information from previously unrelated fields to build a new conceptual framework for the study of sexual reproduction in plants. By "anticipating nature," they are sure to provoke fruitful debate and experimentation in an area of increasing interest to evolutionary ecologists. I highly recommend this stimulating and controversial book. ALLISON A.

The evolution of insect mating systems. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. ix + 547 p. $35.00. Insect mating systems span the range from simple to bi- zarre, encompassing close to all the perturbations known in animals. Explanations for the origin and maintenance of these various systems have been equally diverse, often involving significant amounts of hand-waving. In The evolution of insect mating systems, Thornhill and Alcock present the first com- prehensive over-view and integration of the field from a Neo- Darwinian perspective. The book begins with a discussion of evolutionary hypoth- eses and tests, addressing in particular the problems associ- ated with studying behavior from an adaptationist viewpoint. Acknowledging that this viewpoint has been extensively crit- icized in recent years, the authors convincingly argue that the approach is valid if carefully and properly pursued. Included in the discussion is a clear explanation of the methods used to study the evolution of behavior from an adaptationist view- point, the pitfalls to each method, and how to avoid such pitfalls. The authors also address the question of level of operation of selection, concluding that for behavioral attri- butes in particular, selection must always operate on the in- dividual level rather than on the group. This theme is repeated at intervals throughout the book. Given the degree to which the literature on insect mating systems is explicitly and im- plicitly pervaded by references to "the good of the species," such repetition is probably useful. The introductory section of the book concludes with chap- ters on Modes of reproduction and Sexual selection theory. The next eight chapters deal with mating systems, primarily from a male viewpoint. The organization is basically chrono- logical, starting with Timing of mate locating and Motivation to copulate and progressing through Sperm competition and the fertilization of eggs. The last three chapters focus on fe- males, including an analysis of the existence/non-existence of female choice, potential mechanisms of female choice, and a classification of female mating systems, along with an analysis of the circumstances under which each system should occur. The book has a number of unusually strong attributes. First, hypotheses concerning the evolution of mating behavior are clearly stated, and a large volume of reasonably current evi- dence testing these hypotheses is presented. Examples are diverse, coming from all major insect groups. In conceptual areas where more examples are drawn from one group than others, this usually reflects the state of knowledge in the field, rather than a particular bias on the part of the authors. An extensive bibliography is included in the book as well, with listings through part of 1982. Second, the authors deal in more detail than is often the case with the underlying issues of heritability and genetics. For example, a very nice section is included examining how female choice of male mates might still be maintained even after heritable variation in the male attribute in question is exhausted. Further, a chapter is included which specifically deals with intra-species or intra-population variation in mat- ing systems. The classification system presented for male and female mating systems is eminently sensible (as is the authors' atti- tude towards unintelligible terminology). Each mating system is examined in the context of the ecology and physiology of the organism in formulating the classification. Such an ap- proach is useful in understanding the role of mating systems in the overall biology of the organism. Finally, the large number of illustrations makes a significant contribution to the worth of the book. Graphs are unusually and consistently easy to understand. Drawings by Marilyn Hoff Stewart and others are superb, and the numerous pho- tographs help in illustrating the organisms and behaviors un- der discussion. The only drawback in this area is that the connection between the text and graphs is sometimes a little tenuous, as the graphs are used not just to illustrate material from the text, but sometimes to add supplementary infor- mation beyond that mentioned in the text. The only difficulty I encountered with the book was a feeling of unevenness between sections dealing primarily with con- ceptual ideas and those primarily containing examples. This was due to the inevitable simplification of each study down to its basic points, clearly done in order to present a diverse number of examples for each topic in a reasonable amount 1026 REVIEWS</page><page sequence="2">of space.

Schoener (eds.). 1983. Lizard ecology: studies of a model organism. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. x + 501 p. $35.00. No one can dispute that the early development of theoret- ical population and community ecology reflected the natural history of birds and the perspectives of ornithologists. The editors of this symposium volume suggest that lizards threaten to displace birds as paradigmatic organisms in ecological study. The papers published here, which were originally presented at a major symposium in 1980 cosponsored by the American Society of Zoologists and the Ecological Society of America, suggest that in some cases the threat is hollow, but in others it is quite real. The stated purpose of the 1980 symposium was to synthe- size recent advances and summarize progress since a previous gathering of lizard ecologists in 1965. An introduction by Huey, Pianka, and Schoener traces conceptual developments in lizard ecology since the earlier symposium, and includes references to important papers published after the 1980 sym- posium and up to 1982. Chapters are grouped in three the- matic sections, entitled Physiological ecology, Behavioral ecology, and Population and community ecology. The sections are preceded by brief introductory overviews by Dawson, Ruibal, and Schoener, respectively. A concluding chapter by Grant offers an insightful critique of the current strengths and weaknesses of lizard ecology. The book's layout suffers from two minor but annoying flaws. First, although many chapters appear in standard journal format, all lack a concise abstract or summary. Second, I found the collection of separate sets of references for each chapter at the end of the book a less than ideal arrangement. Aside from these points, the volume is well-edited and appears remarkably free of typographic errors. To convince this reviewer that lizards can displace birds as paradigmatic organisms in ecology, their proponents must demonstrate that lizards aren't just cold-blooded flightless birds covered with scales instead of feathers and beset with similar limitations. In other words, lizard ecologists should show that lizards can be used to test important general hy- potheses that are intractable in avian systems. Experimental tractability in the field is a critically important attribute of abundant and relatively sedentary lizards, not shared by birds. Three chapters in this volume present original experimental results or syntheses of previous experiments that make this advantage clear. Separate chapters by Ferguson et al. and Fox emphasize that experiments can unambiguously relate aspects of territoriality to food availability and the fitness components of individuals. Dunham contributes a rare and critically im- portant analysis of the relation between realized niche over- lap, resource abundance, and experimentally demonstrated interspecific competition. Other studies reported here don't exploit special properties of lizards, and ultimately show that lizards, like birds, can be studied with respect to resource utilization or null models, without rectifying the well known ambiguities and weaknesses of inference inherent in these approaches. Some contributions merit special mention because they em- phasize less stylish factors frequently overlooked by ecologists in their search for selective agents and causes of distribution and abundance. Porter and Tracy review their previous work on energetics and heat balance and suggest that broad distri- butional limits of some lizards may be set by physiological requirements of eggs, rather than of adults. Schall steps out- side the conventional framework of competition theory to consider the impact of malarial parasites on lizard popula- tions. Other chapters address important conceptual issues. Ballinger uses variance analysis to decompose observed vari- ation in clutch size into environmental and population com- ponents, an approach with formal similarities to quantitative genetics. Roughgarden et al. elaborate a model for coevolving competitors, which may presage a genuine integration of evo- lutionary biology and community dynamics. Other papers not singled out here include useful reviews and original contri- butions that will interest ecologists and ethologists. Anyone with an interest in vertebrate ecology will find this volume a useful summary of the state of the art in lizard ecology. Within the bounds of this summary, it also seems that some potentially rewarding questions have not been con- sidered. Although many ecologists dogmatically assume that lizards compete for prey, the impact of these abundant pred- ators on prey community structure remains essentially un- known. And while other vertebrates often prey on lizards, the impact of predation on lizard population dynamics has not been studied experimentally. Increased field experimentation with these tractable, intriguing vertebrates promises that their enshrinement as model organisms may eventually be war- ranted.
