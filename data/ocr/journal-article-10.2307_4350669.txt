PRELIMINARY DECLARATIONS The objective of this survey is the same as that of its immediate predecessor:1 to produce an exhaustive chronicle of scholarship in all areas of Homer studies for the period covered. Although absolute bibliographical control remains an impossibility, I have striven to be thorough. About 300 of the entries are not to be found in L'Annee philologique.2 Some few items published before 1978 (and one after 1983) are included to make good omissions in the earlier survey or for the sake of completing citations of multi-volume works. Excluded are unchanged or substantially unchanged reprintings or translations of works first published before 1978.3 As regards annotations, in the interest of saving space I have increased the proportion of bracketed, telegraphically concise comments immediately after citations. For the same reason, indications of book reviews are restricted mainly to fuller discussions by specialists. For their various acts of assistance and kindness, I am most thankful to Robert Edgeworth, J. B. Hainsworth, Thomas Jahn, Joachim Latacz, Rei- naldo B. Perez, John Pisoni, James Redfield, and to the library staffs at the Universities of Michigan and Rochester. I owe a special debt to the Graduate School at Eastern Michigan University for a research fellowship and to its Dean, Dr. Ronald E. Goldenberg, for additional support and encouragement. The contributions of my wife, Jo Ann, continue to be indispensable to my work and to my life in general.

Bristol 1983. WILLCOCK's two-volume edition (2) of the Iliad contains a short introduction, text (essentially that of Leaf and Bayfield), and notes similar in quantity and content to those in Stanford's Odyssey. Though "the substance of some of the explanatory notes has appeared. . .in A Companion to the Iliad [IPH 2.41" (preface), the orientations of the two works are quite distinct and complementary; the reader with Greek will profit from each. The Greekless reader may turn to item 3, in which HOGAN has done for users of Fitzgerald's Iliad what Willcock did for users of Lattimore's; a fifty-five page introduction to Homeric poetry and to critical issues surrounding it makes good a deficiency in available editions of the translation. Colin MacLEOD's commentary on Iliad 24 (7) is a model of clear explication informed by a refined and perspicacious literary sensibility. "I have attempted a commentary because that seemed the best way to bring out how variously Homer's art is manifested and how firmly it is sustained; questions of style and expression, as well as of overall structure, have therefore claimed a great deal of attention. I have introduced more parallels than might be expected from later authors, in order to show how Homer's language, artistry and thought are comparable to theirs" (p. vii). Besides the text and commentary, a substantial introduction has sections on "The Iliad as a Tragic Poem," "Book 24 and the Spirit of the Iliad," "Book 24 in the Structure of the Iliad," "Language and Style," "Metre and Prosody." The result has been called "the best practical introduction to Homeric poetry in general" (Griffin, review). Mondadori has brought out a very attractive six-volume edition of the Odyssey (6) with Italian translation by G. A. Privitera and text and commen- tary (in Italian) by several distinguished Homer scholars. This edition offers the fullest modern commentary on the Odyssey: it gives due attention to</page><page sequence="5">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 397 points of accidence, grammar, syntax, meter, etc., but takes account of the best of twentieth-century formulaic analyses and literary critical studies (in many cases produced by the editors themselves). Its imminent availability in English (from Oxford) will make it a welcome alternative to W. B. Stanford's "Macmillan Red," particularly because it draws on a wide range of more recent scholarship (including ArchHom and LfgrE). The school editions in the Bristol Classical Press series (4,5,8) contain texts, grammatical notes, and vocabulary. 9. Kontomichis, P., trans. Homerou Iliada I-XXIV. Athens 1976.

HOLOKA Item 11 contains an introductory essay on "The Iliad of Homer: Folkloric Tradition and Individual Creation" (in Russian) by V. N. Jarkho (pp. 5-21). The vocabulary of HULL's unrhymed iambic pentameter versions of the Iliad (30) and the Odyssey (12) is that of "the language spoken by educated people": "Sing, goddess, of Achilles' ruinous anger/ which brought ten thousand pains to the Achaeans,/ and cast the souls of many stalwart heroes/ to Hades, and their bodies to the dogs/ and birds of prey." SHEWRING's Odyssey (25) is a plain prose translation-available in paperback-that better captures the sense of a poetic genre than does Rieu's, which one hopes it will supplant. Items 26 and 28 are illustrated free adaptations suitable for grade schools. STONEMAN's anthology (31) contains translations from the Iliad by Hobbes, Newman, Cowper, Hall, Tennyson, Chapman, Denham, Conington, Logue, Fitzgerald, Lowell, Pope, Bridges, Lord Derby, and from the Odyssey by Chapman, Cowper, Hobbes, Pope, Pound, and Elizabeth Barrett Brown- ing. Item 23 has text and apparatus criticus and an introductory essay on fifteenth-century translations of Homer, while item 34 includes an annotated text of the Italian translation of 11. 4 by Vincenzo Monti (1754-1828).

The Byzantine Iliad of item 38 is that of Constantine Hermoniacus, who "was prompted by a despot of Epirus (1323-35) to produce in the language of daily life a new version of the Iliad written in short trochaic lines consisting of only four accentual feet" (Sandys, HCS3, 1.432). ROSSLYN (44) argues that Pope's ignorance of the meaning of antuges led him to change 21.44 from "Fig-Tree" to "Sycamore" in the second edition of his Iliad, while CON- NELLY (47) discusses the pictorial quality of the visual images in his translation. Ugo Foscolo's Esperimento di traduzione delta "Iliade" di Omero (56) appeared in 1807; item 52 observes the variations of Homeric formulas employed there and in translations by V. Monti, G. Pascoli, and S. Quasimodo. Item 57 characterizes the intent and style of some seventy translations, all mediocre. Maretic's translations (41, 51) were first published in 1882 (Od.) and 1883 (Il.); Duric's (41) in 1963 (Od.) and 1965 (Il.). Leopoldo Lugones (42) was the most important Argentine lyric poet of the earlier twentieth century (Nobel laureate 1926); his translations into alexan- drine verse of selections from Homer were published in Estudios helenicos and Nuevos estudios heldnicos (Buenos Aires 1923, 1928). ILlEVSKI (58) informs that M. D. Petru'sevski's translation of the Iliad into Macedonian (Skopje 1982) incorporates "the rhythmic and prosodic features of the Macedonian language into the patterns of the classical verse" (p. 82).

Item 64 provides a general discussion of biography, history of criticism, plot descrip- tions, etc. CAMPS' book (67), though written on the same restrictively small scale as his attractive Introduction to Virgil's Aeneid (Oxford 1969), manages to present summaries of plot and essential information regarding Homeric narrative techniques, the role of the gods, etc. A particular enhancement is the attention given in "The Poetic Medium" (pp. 39-60) to meter, diction, use of epithets and formulas, similes, verbal music and so on, furnishing the Greekless reader with some sense of what Ezra Pound termed "melopoeia." Thirty-eight pages of notes contain much interesting material that deserved presentation in the sixty-four-page text proper. GRIFFIN's Homer (68) proceeds at a rather higher level of generalization: "The warrior is of supreme value to these early societies, because they are constantly vulnerable and depend for their existence on the courage of their fighting men" (p. 43). While giving considerable insight into Homeric subject matter and the poetic quality of its narration, Griffin is more concerned "to explain the thought which underlies the poems... with some indication of its significance for posterity and for us" (preface). More in the vein of the history of criticism is item 74, which offers a concise introduction to two major critical movements in twentieth-century Homer studies-oral theory and neoanalysis-by examin- ing how epic versions of the death of Achilles may be detected in our Iliad. Among more scholarly works, Gregory NAGY's remarkable (and controver- sial) book (66) fuses the presuppositions and methodologies of literary criticism (particularly oral-formulaic theory), linguistics, cultural anthropo- logy, comparative religion, and intellectual history. "This is not a work of Wissenschaft but of vision" (Redfield, foreword). Nagy seeks to recover the specific world view encoded in the language and thought of a poetic tradition originating in the Iliad and informing the corpus of Greek poetry down to Pindar by focusing on particular systems and variations of words, phrases, and concepts (e.g., aition, neikos, aristos, kleos, dais, menis) about which revolve the basic, often interlocking thematic structures of the narrative. The</page><page sequence="9">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 401 technique of selection is free associational: "whereas many researchers begin from many premises and work towards a single goal, Nagy proceeds like ivy up a wall, beginning from one point (Od. 8.75), ramifying, joining up, blanketing all" (Hainsworth, review). By contrast, GRIFFIN's book (69) is a throwback to the critical sensibility and methodology of C. M. Bowra, S. E. Bassett, and E. T. Owen. Exasperated by the emphasis in Homeric studies on "special and technical questions" of the intricacies of formulaic phraseology, the oral provenance of the poems, and Bronze Age history, Griffin ap- proaches the Iliad and the Odyssey chiefly as literary masterpieces. He draws on the hints and insights to be gained from the scholia, from comparison with Near Eastern materials, and from notice of parallels with Germanic and Irish literature. He also maintains that characterization is more psychologically sophisticated in Homer than is often held, and tries to estimate the sort of response Homer's audience may have had to the narrative, especially as regards pathos. TSAGARAKIS (72) stresses the primacy of plot: "The poet is not making hexameters as one is making bricks, he is. . .composing a poem, which requires that certain things be said and done by certain people at a certain point in time and place" (p. 147); he explains the ramifications of this as regards verse structure, thematic structure, battle narrative, and similes. The chapters on Homer in item 73 are "The Heroic Paradox," "Association by Theme in the Iliad," and "Some Anomalies in the Iliad and the Problem of Oral Transmission," the general intent being to show "how much of Homer's poetic art lies in his controlled use of themes, motifs, and kinds of story, and how, by association, modulation, and awareness of symbolic values he constructs his meaning" (p. 93). Two books fall into a different category: item 70 is a survey of Homeric criticism designed "to make available to contemporary readers something of the poems' infinite variety, but also to invite them to measure their responses against the responses of Homer's other readers over the past millennium" (p. 11); chapters are "Homer Romanticized" (esp. Dictys and Dares and Benolt de Sainte-Maure), "Homer Allegorized" (Chapman and Pope [esp. in his notes], and the anti-allegorists Vico, Blackwell, and Wood), "Homer Criti- cized" (from Scaliger to the participants in the Querelle), "Homer Analyzed" (analysts, unitarians, and neoanalysts from F. A. Wolf down to the present), and "Homer Anatomized" (sections on The Historical Homer, The Anthro- pological Homer, The Geographical Homer, The Oral Homer, and The Literary Homer). The extremely well-conceived Wege der Forschung volume edited by LATACZ (65) has five sections: I, "Die Vorbereitung der Oral poetry-Theorie," contains early studies of meter, formula, and "Volksepik" by Hermann, Ellendt, Duntzer, Witte, Murko, and Drerup. II, "Die Theorie- bildung," contains in German translation the first of Milman Parry's Harvard Studies papers, his comparative study of whole formulaic verses, and his review of Arend's book on typical scenes (JPH 1.6, 9, 11). III, "Die Ruckwirkungen der Theorie auf die Homerforschung," includes essays by Lesky, Lord, Kirk, Pope, Hainsworth, and Adam Parry (JPH 1.53, 19, 142, 180, 104, 147), and German translations of others by J. Russo (JPH 1.66) and Michael Nagler ("Oral Poetry and the Question of Originality in Literature," Actes du Vy Congr&amp;s de l'Association Internationale de Litterature Comparee [Belgrade 19691 451-59). IV, "Die Theorie in der aussergrazistischen Forsch- ung," contains M. Curschmann, "Oral Poetry in Mediaeval English, French, and German Literature: Some Notes on Recent Research," Speculum 42 (1967) 36-52. V, "Zwischenbilanz und Ausblick," reprints A. Parry's superb introduction to his father's collected papers (JPH 1.1), a "Blick auf die neuere Forschung" by A. Heubeck (originally in a Greek-German edition of the Odyssey by A. Weiher), an extract in German translation from B. Fenik's Studies in the Odyssey (JPH 2.519), and an original piece by Wolfgang Schadewaldt, "Die epische Tradition," on the question of Homer's place within a tradition of oral composition.

HEUBECK (75) provides a masterly, brief review of main trends in Homeric scholarship, mainly in German- and English-speaking countries, and contends that complexity of characterization and overall narrative structure in Homeric epic makes written composition very likely. Similarly, WILLCOCK (80) reviews what has and what has not been achieved by analysts and unitarians and-more recently-by oral theorists and neoanalysts: "if we can at the same time observe repeated themes and also the creative invention of the poet, we are getting nearer to Homer" (p. 34); he also stresses the modernity of the nontraditional, fully humanized Homeric heroes. In Jacque- line de ROMILLY's elegant history of Greek literature (76), sections on "L'6pop6e et sa formation" and "L'6pop6e et sa perfection" treat issues respectively external: Bronze Age, comparative epic (Parry-Lord), peculiarities of the Dichtersprache, historicity, the Homeric Question; and internal: struc- ture, plot, the gods, "l'ideal humain," world view, and poetic artistry. The new Oxford Legacy volume is well served by GRANSDEN's contribution (77), which discusses distinguishing traits of the poetry, changing trends in criticism, and, notably, the history of translation into English. C. A. TRYPANIS' literary historical treatment (78) of epic has sections on "The Origins of the Greek Poetic Tradition," "The Homeric Epics," "The Poet Homer," "The Iliad and Odyssey," "The Homeric Narrative," "The World of Men and the World of Gods," "The Poetic Excellence of the Homeric Poems," and "The Influence of the Homeric Epics."

Luigia STELLA's book (82) stresses two types of evidence favoring a continuous poetic tradition between Mycenaean times and Homer: many and exact memories of Bronze Age phenomena in Homer; proliferation of Trojan Cycle scenes in eighth-century art not due to influence of the Homeric epics. She also believes that the Troy sacked in epic was Troy VI, that the structural cohesiveness and high poetic quality of the epics militate against Parry's theory of oral improvisation, and (with Kirk et al.) that a monumental poet gave the Iliad its ultimate form at the end of a long tradition. Compare item 85, which searches for the lineaments of Mycenaean epic poetry in the semantic, morphological, and metrical peculiarities of thirteen Homeric words as compared with Linear B material. On the Homeric Question, BROCCIA (83) rehearses its history from d'Aubignac onward and surveys the extensive critical comment attracted by selected "troubled" passages (Il. 6.72-118, 325-41, Od. 1.267-97, 5.1-42) to disclose differences of orientation and opinion among feuding Homeric scholars. Broccia's own preference is for a moratorium on extrinsic criticism in favor of intrinsic criticism informed by reasonable expectations regarding unity and continuity in the epics. SKAFTE JENSEN (86) believes in an oral dictated text of the sixth century (Peisi- stratus); the Greek oral epic tradition was vital right down to that time and even later. She adduces the evidence of African (cf. item 84) and Albanian oral poetry to show that the size and complexity of the Homeric poems would have been within the abilities of an oral singer. After an assessment of such phonological data as double sibilants, assibilation, loss of initial and postcon- sonantal /w-/, and quantitative metathesis, MILLER (87) writes that "all of the relevant forms. . .belong to various stages of S/E Greek (mostly Ionic), and no evidence was found for a. . .'phase' anterior to the (Sub-Mycenaean-) Ionic.... There is... no linguistic evidence for an (Old) Aeolic phase in the tradition" (p. 139). In item 88, he aims to clarify Milman Parry's theory of oral composition by eliminating misconceptions of unenlightened scholars; the new orthodoxy of the title is "hard Parryism" tricked out with some insights from cognitive science and comparative epic. 90.

SOWERS (90) maintains that "the Homeric poems can fruitfully be understood in terms of a model drawn from the handicrafts-particularly weaving-rather than as a verbalization of visual or intellectual experience"; the dissertation analyzes a Dipylon funerary amphora and detects in the Iliad and the Odyssey "two halves of an artifact which in its totality depicts the symmetrical but opposing movements of disintegration and combination" (DAI). According to CLIFFORD (92), "the Odyssey. . .questions the purpose of storytelling, the status, function, and importance of the storyteller, and the influence or seductiveness of stories," while "the narrators of Genesis betray no suspicion of story; their aim is to make themselves transparent to the divine word" (DAI). Anthony EDWARDS (94) offers a convincing reconsid- eration of "the poetic relationship between the Iliad and the Odyssey in light of oral theory," arguing that "the text of our Odyssey preserves allusions by the tradition of the Odyssey to the tradition of the Iliad as part of a general critique of that poem" (DAI). PARKS (95) reveals that the Anglo-Saxon and Homeric perception of "epic narrative as the re-creation and the reenactment of pre-existing story lore. . .manifests itself on the level of narrative in Beowulf and the Homeric epos through multiform actualizations of traditional narrative paradigms" (DAI). 96.

Item 96 is a sketch of the Homeric Question and of the impact on it of Milman Parry's work, which has similarities to Propp's structural analysis of Russian folktales, Morfologija skazki (Leningrad 1928; [2nd] Eng. ed.: Mor- phology of the Folkiale [Austin, TX 1968]), which, like Parry's French theses, became influential only decades later. Item 97 shows that T. B. L. Webster's contention (accepted by Kirk) that certain texts of Hurrian and Ugaritic songs were dictated to scribes (a la Lord's theory of orally dictated Homeric texts) is vitiated by a mistranslation of the word lmd, "apprentice" (not "dictated"), in the Ugaritic Nikkal. 98.

DUKAT (103) reasserts the value of comparison of Homer with Serbocroa- tian guslari and recommends critical attention for oral poems gathered during the nineteenth century. Along those lines, FOLEY (104) discusses "psycho- historical patterns" in Beowulf, the Odyssey, and Serbocroatian epic, with a view to disclosing the contribution of oral epic to the socialization of the individual. In item 105, he examines typical scenes in the themes of feasting and "readying the hero's horse" in Homer and in the work of a Yugoslav guslar studied by Milman Parry. Item 107 includes analysis of the Gilgamesh epic and the Iliad, asserting the need for understanding of the psychological and social aspects of oral composition, while O'NOLAN (108) compares use of traditional devices of oral composition (noun-epithet formulas, etc.) in Homer and in Irish heroic tales. PINSENT (109) argues along Parryist lines that "explanations of [Homer's] poems in terms of literary decisions made by a single poet who controlled his material in detail must be rejected as unhistorical, however congenial and illuminating they may be" (p. 10); the original contribution of "the Poet of the Iliad lay in organization rather than invention or characterization." WILLCOCK (112) retorts that Homer in fact displays consummate creative artistry, achieving "subtle and delicate effects ... within the (at first sight) cramping conditions of formulaic composition" (p. 17). Item 111 continues RUSSO's studies (e.g., JPH 2.61, 77, 83) of mathematical proportions in the distribution of books, passages, and lines in Homer.</page><page sequence="14">406 JAMES P. HOLOKA 113.

Peabody's Winged Word (JPH 2.43), HAVELOCK (113) describes the psychology and artistic techniques and procedures of oral composition. KELLOGG's discussion (114) of traditional (as opposed to high or popular) art focuses on rhythmic and formulaic composition, with examples from Homeric epic. Item 115 underscores Homer's position as an author transitional between oral and written traditions of literature. MOSER (116) argues that the existence of certain seemingly universal narrative themes, for example, "The Sailor Who Went Inland," sheds light on the Homeric Question and the theories of Milman Parry. SCHWABL (118) demonstrates that formulaic phraseology is not simply a convenient system of prefabricated metrical/narrational stuff, but is rather subtly used to anticipate, cross-refer, and reinforce within the poetic structure of the Homeric epics. SEN (119) discriminates between narrative themes belonging to the pattern of the hero's life and those belonging to the narrative proper by analyses of many examples from oral compositions, including the Iliad and Odyssey. TSAGARAKIS (120) warns that it is "methodologically wrong to preface a discussion in Homer with a reference to an inconsistency in a Yugoslav song and to infer from it that the Homeric inconsistency is also due to the same cause. For defects as well as merits have primarily to do with the poet's talent and training, not with oral or literary composition" (p. 23). He then shows that putative inconsistencies in both Yugoslav and Homeric poetry (e.g., Od. 5.85 ff., 15.145 ff.) are in fact psychologically and thematically suited to their poetic contexts. On a more theoretical plane, PERADOTTO (117) argues that "the antagonism between defamiliarization and myth suggests a possible approach to distinguishing convention from artistic intentionality in the Homeric poems" (p. 8), for example, in the inclusion of Book 11 in the Odyssey. 122.

CIST'AKOVA (122) claims that certain fragments of Stesichorus point to a traditional poetry going back to pre-Mycenaean times, while Homer looks toward the new age of the polis; however, HORROCKS (127) speculates on the existence of dactylic poetry before and during the Mycenaean period. In three essays (124-126), John FOLEY provides a detailed rehearsal of the work of Milman Parry and Albert Lord as it relates to Homeric composition and traditional oral poetry in general, focuses on differences in formulaic phraseology between Homeric and Yugoslav poetry on the one hand and Old English on the other (ascribable to differing metrical constraints), and stresses the importance of the principles of tradition- and genre-dependence in establishing a theoretical basis for the comparative method. In item 129, Albert LORD traces several narrative themes (absence and return, encounter with monsters, death of companion, etc.) in the Gilgamesh epic, the Iliad and Odyssey, as well as-in modified forms-Beowulf. In 130, he treats the themes of adolescent heroic initiation and the absence and return of the mature human with familial and communal responsibilities in Sumerian, Homeric, medieval European, and Serbocroatian poetry. RENOIR (131) compares the Odyssey, Beowulf, and the Hildebrandslied to demonstrate the importance of development of a context within which to engage in aesthetic criticism. Item 132 is a review and critique of various definitions of oral formula proposed by a host of scholars, approving particularly Hainsworth's. 133. Bynum, D. E. "Formula, Theme, and Critical Method."

Item 133 includes comparative analysis of proems to Homeric epic and to Serbocroatian oral compositions, demonstrating a "principle of redundancy." FOLEY (134) uses an example of story-pattern evolution in the repertoire of a Serbocroatian singer to explain apparent structural anomalies in Beowulf and the Odyssey (esp. the two councils of gods in Books 1 and 5); in 135, he suggests a five-part set of critical techniques/axioms useful for the study of oral or orally evolved poems; the Odyssey, Old English, and Serbocroatian texts are among examples used to demonstrate proper explication. KAKRIDIS (136) detects a consistently applied series of themes connected with return and rescue drawn from pre-existing poems for inclusion in both the Iliad and the Odyssey. In a comparative analysis of the Odyssey and selected Serbocroatian "return-songs," PARKS (139) analyzes "a particular narrative structure, the guest-host exchange with the 'identification theme' at its center, as this structure appears in various stages of elaboration throughout the poem" (p. 25). POSTLETHWAITE (140) argues against Konishi (607) that numerical precision of structure is not inconsistent with oral composition: "there remains the temptation to equate sophistication with literacy" (p. 280). KULLMANN's (137) is the best brief account of neoanalysis, its essential concerns and principal successes, from Kakridis' work in the 1940s onward; investigation of "altere Prototypen" of various themes in the Homeric poems results in better appreciation of the structure of the epics, is consistent with oral-formulaic theory, and is based on a hope "dass man mit dieser Position den Gegensatz zwischen Unitarien und Analytikern uberbrucken konne" (p. 6). Item 138 is a crisp review of modern Homeric criticism from d'Aubignac down to the aftermath of Parry; LLOYD-JONES finds too much "minute analysis of formulas,. . .excessive preoccupation with material objects,... exaggerated confidence in positive historical conclusions based upon the poems. That work has not been futile, but... .it is time we took advantage of its results in returning to a detailed study of the poems" (p. 29); he cites approvingly items 7, 68, and 69.

By an examination of such typical scenes as departure, dressing, and arming, SCHWABL (148) seeks to prove that their repetition and variation serve structural purposes on a large scale in a manner analogous to the poet's use of traditional formulaic language on a smaller scale: "die motivische Verwen- dung gleichlautender und gleichgestalteter Bauelemente in einem Werk setzt das Wiedererkennen einer ganz bestimmten Gestaltung voraus. Diese mag traditionell sein, doch schliesst dies die Individualitat der besonderen For- mung, die als solche wiedererkannt werden kann, keinesweg aus" (p. 18). BLOCK's careful comparative survey/explication (142) shows that the nature and effects of apostrophes "changed when they were adapted from a predominantly oral to a predominantly written literature" (p. 8); in particular, "while Homer's narrator is straightforward and trustworthy, as he must be if addressing a listening audience, Vergil's narrator, no longer the embodiment of interpretation, becomes another point of view that must be included by the reader in interpretation" (p. 10). Item 145 is an essay in Greek intellectual history, stressing-yet again-the importance of the shift from oral to literate culture. SEGAL (149) discusses that divide by contrasting the social value system of oral tradition, as embodied in Homer, with that of literate culture, as embodied in Greek tragedy, while item 150 cautions against the use of formulaic-density statistics as litmus to test for orality. Item 146, designed "to enlighten the Portuguese student on the Homeric epics" (p. 43), provides a "Who Was Who" guide to thirteen principal contributors of fuel for the engine of the Homeric Question, from d'Aubignac to John Scott. 151.

FOLEY (151) contrasts the artistry of shorter oral poetic forms with the longer works (Homer and Muslim epics in Serbocroatian) that were the basis of Milman Parry's theories, while MURRAY (153) remarks on the deliberate obscuring of his own biography by Homer through the discrepancy between the short songs sung by bards in his poems and the great length of the Iliad and the Odyssey. PUHVEL (154) details etymological and other accordances between Greek and Hittite lexica in the hope that "at least some Homerische Worter Iscil. steuto de dipsadon, Dios hira talanta, eion themona, poti zophon eepoenta, keimelia te probasin tel still dangling in the wake of Manu Leumann can be brought closer to elucidation" (p. 217). The majority of SLATER's essay (156) is devoted to identification of simple and complex lyric narrative not in lyric but in epic poetry, especially as evidenced in the ring composition found in exempla and flashbacks: Il. 7.133-57, 9.447-84,, 533- 600, 11.671-762, 19.95-133, 21.35-52, 23.629-43, 24.601-19, Od. 14.463-503, 19.393-467.

CRESPO (157) argues that anomalies like hiatus and lengthening in arsis have their aetiology in such phenomena as quantitative metathesis and vowel contraction; he tries to discriminate which among the latter are (relatively) recent, which ancient. LENZ (158) scrutinizes the opening lines of Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, and Herodotus for such traits as traditional structure, hymnic patterns, catch phrases, notion of the Muses, etc. In Homer's case, he finds friction between original function of the proem in an oral performance and the potentials of its use within a written tradition. CANTILENA (159) refines Milman Parry's influential revelation (JPH 1.5) of enjambment frequency as means of differentiating oral from literate composition: statistics resulting from comparative examination of II. 9, Od. 12, the Homeric Hymns, the Batrach., and Callimachus' hexameter Hymns show that hard enjambment is even less evident in Homer than Parry's somewhat inexact analysis had shown. TSOPANAKIS' treatise (161) demonstrates that metrical oddities such as "chasmodic long" (non-observance of correption) and "chasmodic short" (non-elision of short vowel) are both features of oral creation and foci of divergent compositional forces, as the poet violates prosodical convention to make connections among formulas necessary for specific poetic and narrative effects.

FOLEY (167) promotes a "tradition dependent" concept of formulaic structure, and describes causes of variation in diction and prosody in Old English, Homeric Greek, and Serbocroatian. The purpose of item 168 "is to reaffirm the vitality of metaphor as a significant poetic device in the language of the epics, particularly the Iliad" and "to illustrate the range and sophistication of figurative language in Homer" (p. 279). NAGY (169) argues that Homeric meter and formulas must be understood through a combination of two perspectives: formula evolves diachronically from themes, but is synchronically controlled by meter. 170.

MATTHEWS (170) shows that the thirty-four instances of apostrophe fall into just six colometric patterns, and asserts that avoidance of hiatus and of spondaic nominative names at line-end accounts for some twenty of the vocative phrases. By a theory of "zones of focus or exposure" within Homeric syntax, VIVANTE (171) seeks to establish that "the noun-epithet phrase conveys the sense of a concrete presence, whereas a noun without epithet (or a mere pronoun) rather reflects some superimposed meaning, connection, subordination, cause and effect" (p. 158). 172.

In 1947, the Archiv fur Griechische Lexikographie, founded at the University of Hamburg three years before, set itself the goal of producing "Speziellexika und Indices zu altgriechischen Autoren, Literaturgruppen und Sachgebieten." The Lexikon desfruhgriechischen Epos (LfgrE) was to canvass Homer, Hesiod, Epic Fragments, the Hymns, and fragments of Vitae Homeri and the Certamen Homeri in twenty-five fascicles of ninety-six pages (= 192 columns) each, appearing at regular, relatively short, intervals. Alpha soundly defeated such expectations, requiring nine fascicles, some 1800 columns, and thirty years of work. The project was put on a new footing and given new management (the Academy of Science at Gottingen), beginning with fascicle 10, the "Einleitung" to which forecasts (p. iii) completion before the end of the millennium, with fewer but larger fascicles at closer intervals. For the sake of completeness, I list all fascicles published by 1983, and for each its "verantwortlicher Redaktor"; fascicles 1 through 9 also indicated general editor(s): B.

A concordance (vols. 1 and 2) supplies the raw data of the (broadly conceived) vocabulary of social standing and of social and political relations; some thirty individual authors, including Homer, Hesiod, lyric poets, the tragedians, Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Plato, and Aristotle, among others, are canvassed. To give an idea of the scale of coverage: the entries for basileus occupy twenty-four double-columned pages, for doulos twelve, for idiotes seven; included are even such rare words as astugeiloneis- thai (only at Aesch. Supp. 286) and zeugision (only at Arist. AthPol 7.4). Listings appear to be accurate and thorough: e.g., all 430 Homeric occur- rences of hetairos (11. 197x, Od. 233x) are noted. The other five volumes of Soziale Typenbegriffe contain no fewer than eighty-eight essays on the semantic/conceptual range of selected terms in ancient Greek, and of Greek-derived terms or equivalents in ancient and medieval Latin, and in the languages of the modern world (including even "exotics" like Slovene, Swahili, Tagalog, and Vietnamese!). 181.

Item 182 includes "Zu I1. 23.1," pp. 86-106; "Oregein," pp. 107-46; "anerriptoun, Od. 13.78," pp. 270-78; "Zur homerischen Flexion von neus," pp. 279-302; "Zu II. 15.339," pp. 303-06, on the name Mekisteus; and "Beobachtungen zur Synizese," pp. 310-11, on Homeric khreeo. KURT's book (183; orig. diss. Zurich) combines etymological dictionary with concordance of the terminology of ships and seafaring; it should be used in conjunction with D. Gray's Seewesen in the ArchHom series (JPH 2.690). Item 184 offers refinement and correction of J. A. Scott's "The Vocative in Homer and Hesiod," AJP 24 (1903) 192-96, regarding Homer's use of o + vocative: it does not connote emotional charge but heightens the apprehension of appeal in the mind of the addressee; purely metrical impulsions to the usage are also identified. Also examined in MAWET's very elaborate semantic-field study (185) are odune, penthos, akhos, kedos, ponos, and all words even remotely related to them. The second part of item 186 addresses the thorny question of the earliest meaning of the adjective. HORROCKS' Cambridge dissertation (188), directed by John Chadwick, contains three chapters seeking to clarify distinctions in syntactic roles of prepositions and preverbs, to set Homeric evidence "against the broader background of other ancient Indo-European languages in general and of the Mycenaean evidence in particular" (p. 2), and to "provide a comprehensive account of the spatial and temporal senses of</page><page sequence="23">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 415 Homeric prepositions" (p. 3). Though less sanguine than Stella (see item 82), NEGRI (189) argues that Mycenaean elements contribute to the dialect mixture of Homer and that "una simile mistione, 6 ovvio, esige, dal versante delle altre istituzioni umane, una situazione di coesione nazionale, d'intensita di rapporti interni e cosi via, che solo al mondo miceneo b possibile ascrivere. In questo senso il mondo miceneo rappresenta la pi'u antica couche culturale di Omero" (p. 53); there are sections on "Lineamenti di preistoria linguistica greca," "La struttura della lingua epica," and "Poesia micenea, poesia omerica e tradizioni 'parallele' " (resume in ASGM 20 [1978-791 2-3). In her survey of the eikos word-family down through the fifth century, SYNODINOU (191) detects five semantic categories: similarity, seemliness/ne- cessity, hypothesis, appearance, and stage of logical certainty; in the process, she makes excursions into socio-political and intellectual history. JANKO (192): "Although the Hymns are both the seed and bole of this work, the reader will discover ramifications in topics as varied as the relative and absolute dates of Homer and Hesiod; the 'Contest of Homer and Hesiod'; . . .poetry as a political weapon in the sixth century; the homogeneity of the Homeric epics; how and why the poets used archaisms and formular modifications; the prehistory of the epic, its relation to vernacular dialects, and the impact of writing on what was in origin an oral tradition: that is to say, the 'Homeric Question' in general" (p. ix). Of item 193, Chadwick writes that "within the limitations of thirty years ago von Kamptz conducted a satisfactory analysis" (review); those limitations include a lack of realization of the consequences of Linear B for such studies. Paolo VIVANTE (194) offers his most extensive revisionist exercise in tilting at the windmill of the "ornamental epithet" in three parts: I, "The Epithets and Poetry," formu- lates an aesthetics of the epithet; II closely examines, with citations of hundreds of examples, "The Concrete Value of the Epithet" as applied to ships, horses, gods, persons, etc.; and III polemically reviews (in his view) defective "Theories of the Epithet" (and of formula and theme), mostly spawned by Parry and Lord. MARTIN's book (195) shows that epic as well as lyric is concerned with the theme of helplessness: "Achilles as an amekhanos hero, and Odysseus, by contrast the man of many devices, polymekhanos, bear this out" (HSCP). 197.

Thomas JAHN's dissertation (197) is an extremely thorough semantic-field study of the lexical constellation comprising etor, thumos, ker, kradie, menos, noos, prapides, phren/phrenes, and psukhe. His goals are "(I) das Gesamtvo- lumen des Wortfelds zu bestimmen, (2) durch Gegenuiberstellung der einzelnen in Frage kommenden Lexeme eine erste Binnenabgrenzung des Wortfelds zu erarbeiten." The result is both an extremely useful review of previous research from the late eighteenth century onward and a most precise tabulation of word occurrence with circumscription of exact semantic and metaphoric ranges. PERRY (199) argues that "explanations of Homeric formulae offered by Milman Parry and his successors are inadequate to explain the observed Homeric usage of narrative verbs" (DAI), and makes fine discriminations between aorist and imperfect indicative. By studying noun-verb rather than noun-epithet formulas, WOODLOCK (200) tries to counteract the tendency of</page><page sequence="24">416 JAMES P. HOLOKA scholars since Parry "to generalize the problem [of defining 'formula'] in such a way that the original objects of interest are in danger of being lost in a mass of essentially unrelated expressions" (DAI). 202.

JACQUINOD (209) discusses the double accusative of the whole and the part. BONFANTE (213) argues that koiranos, restricted to Homer and Boeotian, entered Greek from Illyrian at the time of the Trojan War, while GARCIA RAMON (214) detects archaisms of a</page><page sequence="25">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 417 northwest dialect origin that contrast with Homeric innovations in Hesiod's Kunstsprache. Item 216 is on the Linear B tablets and Homeric usage. MICHELINI (217) examines in particular the force of middle endings in Homeric language. NAGY (218) investigates whether the etymology "*Akhi- laFos" fits the meanings of akhos and laos in the epic tradition and to what extent such a reconstruction has validity with respect to the characterization of Achilles himself. PIGHI (219) makes distinctions among the sorts of zephyrs that appear in Homer, and WATKINS (222) examines the Nestor's Cup inscription from the perspectives of Greek and Indo-European linguistics and comparative metrics. 223.

In item 224, inspection of the various dual endings encountered in Homer and in archaic dialects of Attica and the Peloponnese points to an ultimate locatival origin. EFFENTERRE (225) rejects previous interpretations of the laos word-group and contends that "vielmehr kann man aus dem Gebrauch bei Homer schliessen, dass es sich um eine Bevolkerungsmasse handelt, die zu jeder Art von Gefolgschaft bereit war. Man kann in Zusammenhang damit auf die romische Parallele plebs/populus hinweisen." MENKEN (228) adduces Homeric evidence that the conjunction may introduce a clause stating not the reason for taking the position in the main clause, but the reason for which the main clause was expressed. NAGLER (229) treats the Homeric formula deine theos aude-essa (Od. 10.136, 11.8, 12.150, 449) as a device to mark scenes with similar thematic content, with remarks also on the attributes of the type of the "dread goddess" inherited from the Indo-European and Near Eastern mythological traditions. NEGRI (230) contests the derivation from root *korso- (cf. Lat. curro) proposed by F. Solmsen, and favors derivation from Mycenaean e-pi-ko-wo, kouros (=warrior). 235. Anziferowa, G. M.

In item 236, the Linear B word is explained by reference to the Homeric verb prio. BREUIL (237) maintains Homeric incertitude about the denotation of the two words is due to diachronic semantic changes within the oral tradition. DICKIE (238) counters "the two main theoretical objections to dike's having moral significance" [viz., absence of internalized moral feelings and the exclusively concrete signification of the word] and examines "a number of passages [e.g., II. 16.386-88, Od. 14.83-84] in Homer and Hesiod in which. . .dike should properly be translated by 'justice' or 'righteousness' " (p. 91). According to DUNKEL (239), neither Indic materials nor the Iliad provides evidence that resumptive preverb deletion was an inherited phenome- non. FERRINI (240) maintains that apparent confusion in Homer's use of color terms is disposed of by consideration of those terms within the context</page><page sequence="27">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 419 of formulaic technique of composition. FLOYD (241) considers that "several peculiar Greek third plural perfect and pluperfect forms in /d/" were caused initially by nasal dissimilation and "constitute direct evidence of a transitional stage between /n/ and /s/ in the perfect middle paradigm" (p. 15). FORSSMAN (242) shows that the Homeric verb forms he discusses have the force "to greet" and derive from the root deik. Item 243 identifies a host of idiolectal traits (phonological, metrical, semantic, syntactic, rhetorical) of Achilles' speech, suggesting that the traditional linguistic repertoire of the poet could be deployed with considerable freedom (see also items 341, 329). HAINSWORTH (244) outlines the process by which expressions "ossify" into formulas that thrive, beget derivative expressions and ideas, and pass into "the rust of archaism" finally to be replaced altogether. LAUFFER (248) argues for Semitic or pre-Greek Indo-European origin of the word family he examines; regardless of variation in semantic nuance, the basic irreducible meaning is "inner chamber." Saul LEVIN (249) notes that Homeric oaths with ne men were probably accompanied by a hand gesture. MATTHEWS (250) contends that "we need not seek a meaning for the epithet oloophron in the Odyssey different from the meaning it has in the Iliad. 'Malignant' clearly suits the aspects of Aietes, Minos, and Atlas which were displayed in other early epic poems" (p. 232). Item 252 demonstrates that "Homer employed ia and mia. . .to reflect the contemporary dialect geography of Greece" (p. 24). NOTHDURFT (253) combines semantic-field study with etymology to indicate that peirar/peirata carries the force "Ding, durch das Wirkung hindurchgeht" (p. 40). OPELT (254) reviews in particular the semantics of love/friendship and aggression/enmity, the latter more richly elaborated in both authors examined. Noting a parallel locution in the Grettir Saga 47.20 meaning "nel colmo della notte" (p. 703), that is, the darkest part of the night, PISANI (255) goes on to argue a similar metaphoric import for the Homeric formula by virtue of the derivation of amolgos from molgos (see Pollux 10.187), which in the variant *bolgos (= "sack", "bag") has several Germanic cognates. WYATT (258) lays out "the figures and statistics for the occurrence of the Homerically attested forms in hopes of being able to draw some prosodic and linguistic conclusions" (p. 89); among the latter, that "proti (portn) is a secondary development. . .and. . .proto-Greek inherited only poti" (p. 123). 259.

DARCUS (263, 264, 304, 322) defines psychodynamics by scrutiny of key words as used in each grammatical case. Some conclusions: Homer saw psukhe as "(1) the object of some activity signified by a verb, the subject being a god, another person, [or] the person himself; (2) an active agent within man (at the time of fainting or death) and in Hades" (263, p. 33). Phren/phrenes (similarly noos) is "(1) the location where a person performed certain emotional, volitional, and intellec- tual functions .... (2) An accompaniment or instrument... [with] which a person acted... .(3) The object of some activity signified by a verb with subject generally not the owner of phrenes [or noos] themselves .... (4) Rarely... .an independent active agent" (264, p. 165). "Thumos is a person's most prominent psychic organ .... [It] often appears as an agent which can determine a person's behavior and which, on occasion, he feels impelled to resist... .thumos functions as a location within a person, acts in subordina- tion to him, functions harmoniously with him, or opposes him" (322, pp. 149-50). All four articles go on to reveal similarities and differences in later Greek usage. HOOKER argues in item 267 that in most of the six occurrences of the phrase discussed, "ei introduces a kind of anaphora, taking up a noun already expressed and adding a pathetic exclamation" and has the meaning "so" rather than "if"; in item 268 that entupas, a Homeric hapax at Il. 24.163, "had an active, not a passive, meaning [unlike entupos -in the access of his grief, Priam thrusts himself into the ground as forcefully as a man impressing a seal upon damp clay" (p. 175); in item 270 that "the use of gephura in the sense of 'embankment' is purely poetical and.. .in post- Homeric Greek it has only the meaning 'bridge.' In these circumstances, it becomes quite likely that [Semitic] gb was absorbed in Greek not as describing an item of material culture but as existing in a specific literary context" (p. 397); in item 272 (against West) that aigiokhos = "aegis-bearing", (with Humback) that diipetes = "swiftly hurrying", (against Page) that koru- thaiolos = "shaking the helmet." In item 271, he notes as an apparent exception to Wathelet's analysis (296) that, at Od. 4.87-88, anax "appears to mean little more than 'master' in the English phrase (now obsolescent) 'master and servant.' " INGALLS' statistical comparison (274) of formular densities in a selection of similes and a control passage of narrative "reveals a uniform formular texture in the Iliad" (p. 105), thus enlarging "the roster of evidence suggesting that the similes, too, were composed orally" (p. 106) and that they are, despite evidences of linguistic lateness, authentic. JANKO (277) deduces from the juxtaposition of episkher-o with akte in two of its three occurrences (Il. 18.68-69, 23.125-26) that "the adverb originated by a misunderstanding in the early epic tradition" (p. 21), and in item 278 contends that "in the epic diction poti and proti have been replaced by pros. . .after the neglect of initial digamma began; the older forms originated in the Aeolic phase of the epic" (p. 29). The problem in item 281 "deals with the order in which (SYLLAB) and (ASSIM) must be applied" (p. 224) properly to account for derivations of particular case-forms of basileus and psukhe. Item 282 is a scrutiny of date and usages of substantive and verb "to determine.. . the productivity of the denominatives in comparison with the category of nouns in -eus, in each stage of the language" (p. 304). PETRUSEVSKI (284) argues that wo-ra refers to a chariot part designated by eurai (Pollux 1.146), unattested in Homer or classical Greek, but perhaps the source of Homeric eurax. According to POSTLETHWAITE (285), close comparative analysis (d la Hainsworth) of "the various types of formula modification" shows that the poets of the Hymns worked within an oral tradition similar to Homer's (Il. 1.176-611 and Od. 2.1-434 used as controls). RENEHAN (286) argues that "soma means .not 'living body' and not 'dead body,' but 'body' plain and simple" (p. 278); thus, (pace Snell) the word "never was a legitimate foundation on which to build the thesis that Homeric man had only a very fragmented concept of</page><page sequence="30">422 JAMES P. HOLOKA himself" (p. 280). TAGLIAFERRO (293) seeks to prove that the form een was a "recent" invention: "al rapsodo, che aveva a disposizione la serie een, en, ed een-quest'ultimo avvertito come privo di aumento-non ha fatto difficolta allungare l'e di een, stante la presenza di altri imperfetti a vocale iniziale lunga" (p. 350). Item 296 looks for possible correlations between Homeric usage and Linear B: "I'analyse . . .a montre qu'en ce qui concerne l'emploi de anax et de basileus on se rapproche de la situation attest6e par les tablettes myceniennes quand on remonte dans la tradition formulaire de l'epop6e grecque" (p. 40; see item 271). WILSON (297) has discovered in later authors' use of potential "tis-Reden" a "progressive restriction in scope . . probably due to the development of a private ethic that rejects the appeal to a generalized tis" (p. 15). 298.

Item 299 is a thorough demonstration that sakos is a lexical archaism, with special attention to the formulas sakos heptaboeion, sakos eute purgon and to the word's association with Aias. CHEYNS (302) scrutinizes passages where phrenes and prapides denote a bodily organ from an anatomical perspective. COHEN (303) detects quite distinct concepts indicated by the two words; notably, horkia serves to define relations of mutual obligation operative between parties of equal social status. DORIA's survey (305) of some forty-five examples of the adjective in the Knossos and Pylos tablets leads him to reject any "Aeolic hypothesis" in favor of direct Mycenaean origin. EIDE (306) claims the formula is properly used of Penelope to indicate "the tautness of muscles and sinews caused by a firm grip or a quick movement"-a firm grip because the "key" in Od. 21.6 is "a fairly long and heavy metal bar, which was inserted through a hole in the door so as to thrust aside the bolt inside" (p. 24). FLOYD (307) argues (against G. Nagy [JPH 2.104]) that the Homeric formula has a different meaning from its Indic cognate srdvas. . .dk- sitam. HAMP (309) writes: "we must have here a delocutive compound, perhaps of Indo-European date, resting upon a favorite structure which lent itself to Univerbierung" (p. 91; see also item 343). HOOKER (310) says the alternative names Briareus and Aegaeon at Il. 1.103-04 perhaps arose "from a feeling on the part of the epic poets that, if they did not call attention to some respects in which gods differ from men, the distinction between them would become intolerably blurred" (p. 189). PALLARA (316) claims the Homeric influence on the language of the archaic elegiac poets has been overestimated. PETRUkEVSKI (317) finds many Mycenaean elements in Homer, while Arcado-Cypriot seems descended from the Achaean dialect. QUILLER (318) evaluates "the dual concept 'demiurgos,' which, while meaning a craftsman in Ionia and Athens, denoted a magistrate in areas such as Elis, Locris, Arcadia, etc.... I find Murakawa's theory [of a unified social origin-see "Demi- urgos," Historia 6 (1957) 385-415] too conjectural" (pp. 5,7); he prefers to treat the Homeric and Western Greek denotations as different institutions. The distinction found by RIEDINGER (319) is between aidos as applied to a specifi'c interpersonal relationship (affinities with time) and as applied to the larger social milieu (affinities with nemesis); these may sometimes conflict: "Hector, quand il attend l'attaque d'Achille, est partag6 entre l'aidos envers sa mere (Il. 22.82), et celle qui lui interdit l'humiliation publique (22.108)" (p. 69). THIEME (323) offers an etymological/semantic investigation of the question "ob die fur die synchronische Betrachtung der homerischen Sprache durch ihren Sinn deutlich geschiedenen Prasensstamme mnae-I 'to woo etc.' und mnae-2 'to be mindful' genetisch nicht doch zusammenhangen" (p. 126). Item 324 is on the syntactic and existential relations motivating Homer's distribution and modulation of formulas for dawn. 325. d'Avino, R.

AVINO (325) maintains that "winged words" has a metaphorical religious reference to the equation of sacred words with birds (winged oracles; see esp. pp. 109-11). By analysis of both new and previously mis-evaluated isoglosses and of shared and independent innovations, DUNKEL (326) argues that "the ancestors of [Arcado-Cypriot, Aeolic, and Mycenaean] formed an innovating area which we will call Central Greek" (p. 132, see diagram on p. 142). According to ELLSWORTH (327), "in epic diction. . .agon means 'assembly-</page><page sequence="33">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 425 with-contests', and never designates any other kind of assembly, an unspeci- fied assembly, or assemblies in general" (p. 104-see also A. Bammesberger, "Ag-on und ageir~o," Sprache 28 [1982] 27-30). FRAZER (328): "I count six descriptive passages in Homer [11. 3.162 ff., 4.20 ff., Od. 11.593 ff., 12.85 ff., 15.4 ff., 24.153 ff.] and one in Hesiod [Erga 161 ff.) where etoi has a corrective force" (p. 265), which "give us the impression of the poet speaking and modifying his thought in mid-course. We seem to hear the voice of the oral poet" (p. 271). HEUBECK (331) sketches the evolution of opinion concerning the dialectal milange of Homer, beginning with Bentley's discovery of the digamma. HOGAN (332) shows that, in distinction from the word's denotation in Hesiod, eris refers in Homer to competitive self-assertion in quest of kleos. Regarding Homer's use of alternative metrically equivalent formulas (e.g., boo3pis potnia He-re / thea leukolenos HeIre), JANKO (334) maintains "another important factor in the choice is the memory of the previous choice" (p. 255); unusual concentrations of an option are due to waning in the poet's awareness of monotony or to plain forgetfulness-such are the "faint fingerprints of authenticity" (p. 261). In item 335, JANKO contends "contraction of -ao- as a linguistic index" in the formula examined affords a rare chance "to see how many different modifications of a single formula are interrelated, and to chart their genealogy according to linguistic and modificatory approaches" (p. 382). Item 336 shows that ikhor consis- tently means the serum that flows from wounds or ulcers, and not blood (of gods or humans). LEVIN (338) maintains that "the founders of epic poetry were non-lonians under Ionian patronage. . . [who], in their incomplete commitment to Ionic, expressed on the one side their deference to the Ionian audience, on the other side the poetic advantage of admitting words whose structure was alien to Ionic. The single most revealing example is thea" (p. 243). Item 339 combines semantic-field study with geistesgeschichtlich inquiry into several key passages with erotic themes (Paris and Helen in Il. 3, Zeus and Hera in Il. 4, Ares and Aphrodite in Od. 8) or highlighting social or filial relationships. MESSING (341) disputes the contention of Friedrich and Redfield (243) that Homeric heroes had ideolects: "such a view is. . .inconsistent with the practices of oral poetry and with the classical doctrine of ethos. Their stylometric tests are unconvincing because of inadequate sampling, an unreliable textual tradition, and a defective rationale in applying stylistic criteria" (p. 888). Item 342 shows that "Homeric adjectives in -ops, among which meropes, are not traceable back to the root *okw-, but to the category of anthroponyms in -ops, while the masculine helik-opes. . .reveals a contamination between -op-, suffix of non i.e. origin and -op-, derived from *okW-" (p. 265). NAGY (343), responding to Floyd (307): "the basic difference between the kleos aphthiton of Iliad IX 413 and the sravas.. .aksitam of RV 1.9.7 [is that] Homeric poetry has separated not so much the theme of material wealth from the theme of perpetuity but rather the theme of personal immortalization from the theme of immortalization by way of poetry" (pp. 115-16). RODRIGUEZ ADRADOS' study (344) of dialectal stratigraphy in Greek discusses evidence for an "epic Achaean" dialect of the second millennium; he identifies the chief dialect phases as "I. 1800-1250 B.C.: The Mycenaean dialect and the para-Mycenaean dialects which were the basis of later eastern Greek. 1I. 1250-1000 B.C.: Pre-Forms of Ionic-Attic, Arcado-Cyprian and Aeolic.... III. 1000-700 B.C.: Definition of the three eastern dialectal groups and of their sub-dialects" (p. 15). WATHELET (349) argues that influence of (western) Ionic dialect forms in Homer attests to importance of Euboea (esp. Chalcis) in the eighth century. 350. Barton, C. R. "Greek egera."

Item 352 finds differences between divine and human speech to have historical, stylistic, parodic, and religious aspects. According to CANTARELLA (353), hubris in Homer does not refer to violation of a religious interdiction, but is connected with the notion of time, denoting an abridgement of the honor of another. GARBRAH (355) suggests that "instead of categorising the [long and short dative] forms as 'early' and 'late', we classify them as 'vernacular Ionic' [-oisi/-eisin] and 'poetic alternative to vernacular Ionic' [-ois/-eisl" (p. 308). HAMP (356) notes that gloria is a collective in -ia analogous to Homeric eidar. Item 357 includes discussion of the name-suffix -sthenes and the non-occurrence of the name-prefix aristo- in Homer. KOTOPOULOS provides in item 358 an exhaustive survey of Homeric use of the formula (in the catalogue of ships and in combat scenes in which two brothers are victims of the same adversary) showing the originality of the poet's control of traditional materials. Item 360 is a survey of Greek usage (mainly Herodotus, but also Homer, tragedy, Thucydides, Plato) establishing a distinct difference of nuance (pace Kuhner-Gerth, Schwyzer, and Smyth) between the two subordinating conjunctions in all categories of their usage. SKAFTE JENSEN (362) argues that a Homerid dictating c. 525 played on Athenian connotations of kranaos (a mythical king of Athens was called Kranaos, according to Scholiast D). TEFFETELLER's contextual analysis (363) of Od. 13.332, 18.128, and 21.306 supports the scholiasts' association of the words studied with epos rather than (pace Wackernagel) hepo. By reviewing the frequency of epithets relative to syntax, specifically with regard to case-forms, VIVANTE (364) reveals that "in. . .highlighting wine as object of acts intrinsic to it (to pour, to drink. . .), the epithet has a concrete value; on the other hand, the absence of the epithet results from</page><page sequence="35">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 427 complications of construction or it points to an abstract sense of the noun: wine as a means to an end ('filled with. . .', 'satiated with. . .')"

[Homer, lyric poetry, Aristotle, and medical writers.] CHRISTOL (367) argues that tei dekatei is an old instrumental later construed as a dative of date; an appendix on pemptaioi (Od. 14.257). COSSET (368) demonstrates that the epithets polumetis, ptoliporthos, dourik- lutos, and tlemoin are subtly appropriate to the hero's behavior and abilities as well as to events narrated; context is also a factor in the choice of khalkeon or meilinon to modify spears. In item 369, he seeks to demonstrate that each of</page><page sequence="36">428 JAMES P. HOLOKA several epithets based on metis (viz. polumetis Odusseus; Kronou pais ankulometeo; metieta Zeus) "souligne et renforce le portrait psychologique des personnages"; though not proof that all formulas have literary justifica- tion, this does "constitue une confirmation supplementaire de la souplesse du style formulaire et de la maitrise du poete" (p. 274). DEROY (370) maintains that the Latin prefix is "att6nuative," corresponds to the Mycenaean adjectival prefix we- (reduced to e- in Homeric epedanos, eitheos, and ebaios) and may represent an old borrowing of Latin from Greek. HAUDRY (371) shows that the words artipos (Il. 9.505, Od. 8.310), artiphr-on (Od. 24.261) and artiepes (11. 22.281) all carry a metaphorical charge derived from woodworking. Item 372 shows how the phrase, in its twenty-six Homeric occurrences, "charges the speech it introduces with a decidedly minatory fervency and excitement" (p. 16). Item 375 sheds light on the Homeric idiom kharin idein (I. 11.243) by comparing it with Indo-Iranian and Armenian, where *weid- carries the force "to obtain"; also trekh3 is shown to mean "turn on an axis" in both Armenian and Homer. RUTHERFORD-DYER (381) presents evidence that "oinops is an evocative and meaningful epithet to Homer and his audience, most appropriately translated 'sunset-red'. . .; when used of ships and islands, it evokes the sunset departure of ships bound in night-time navigations by the stars" (pp. 127-28). According to STEPHENS (383), Homeric me plus aorist imperative falls into two categories: 1) "retentions of an earlier syntactic construction" and 2) "a special develop- ment arising from processes peculiar to the epic Dichtersprache" (p. 71).

Ten of the nineteen chapters in item 386 deal with concepts of justice in Homer, who "constitutes the early Hellenic answer to the problem of oral storage: first, it is the society of early maritime Hellenism, not an antique Mycenaean model, which he reports...; second, the stories in the poems ...include a mass of directive information covering the nomos and ethos ...appropriate to the society to which the poems are addressed" (p. 13). CANTARELLA (388) discusses particularly the adjudication of homicide cases, and postulates three phases in the evolution of judicial procedure: 1) imposed decision by the king in Mycenaean times, 2) voluntary conformity with heroic competitive standards of virtue (the norm in Homer), and 3) the more democratic and cooperative morality evidenced in the judgment scene on the shield in lI. 18. Item 389, originally a doctoral dissertation, examines the vocabulary and psychodynamics of repentance in the Homeric epics. Item 396, a volume in J. Vogt's series Forschungen zur antiken Sklaverei, reprints (with additions) WICKERT-MICKNAT's earlier study of prisoners of war and slaves in the Iliad, Studien zur Kriegsgefangenschaft und zur Sklaverei in der griechischen Geschichte, I: Homer (Wiesbaden 1954), together with a new treatise on "unfree" persons in the Odyssey. 397.

"An Application of Moral Development Theory to Homer." Diss. Boston College 1983. Summary in DAI 44 (1984) 482A. By examining formulaic language applied to poleis in Homer, SCULLY (397) reveals "the generic image of the polis. . .in three basic categories: the unique sacred nature of the polis, its defensive system in terms of both its divine and its human derivation, and the people-warriors, rulers, women and children-who inhabit it" (DAI). WHITEHEAD includes the Odyssey in his study (398) of how "the idea of the telos, as well as the poet's view of his role, is transformed under the growing influence of the logos, both in the Classical and Christian worlds" (DAI). STANTON's dissertation (399) con- cludes that "Homeric society was co-operative and moral at Stage 2 of the Kohlberg scale. . ., measurement of moral stage was... .dependent on motiva- tion expressed by a particular character, on context, and on evaluations by the narrator and by other characters" (DA1). 400.

Item 400 considers human pathological behaviors as symbolized in the Homeric gods. In observations prompted by the publication of the fourth edition of Bruno Snell's Die Entdeckung des Geistes (Gottingen 1975), KRAUS (402) reflects that "Die Menschen der Ilias stehen an Wurde und innerem Wert uber den Gottern. Es ist ein anderer Ernst um sie, eben weil sie den Tod vor Augen haben. Keine Erlosung wartet ihrer, keine erhohte Existenz im Jenseits, nur ein Schattendasein, dem Achill das elendste Knechtsleben auf die Erde verzieht (Od. 11, 488 ff.). In diesem kurzen Leben mussen sie sich bewahren, unter den Bedingungen, die die Gotter setzen" (p. 29). ROWE (403) contrasts the relatively unified pantheon in Homer and Hesiod on the one hand, with the diversity of religious worship in actual practice on the other, while DIETRICH (404) cautions against a facile equation of Homeric and Hesiodic myth with actual cult figures of Greek religion. FISCHER (405): "Hesiod knew more about astronomical phenome- na than did Homer and applied his more precise knowledge to practical affairs." FRIEDRICH (406) seeks to demonstrate that "honor and the honor-linked complexes were mainly predicated on keeping women relatively deprived of honor, on competing for women as symbolic of honor, and ritualized conflicts over women that intermittently revitalize the entire system of meanings"; thus, "the system of honor is primarily rooted in sexuality and the relations between the sexes" (p. 302). GIANGRANDE (407) contrasts Homeric humor, which is situational, with the word-play of Alexandrian humor. According to GORDON (408), "dual paternity, human and divine, was not a paradox in the realm of Near Eastern concepts, as in, e.g., Homer 11. 10.144, and the double paternity of the pharaohs." ROBERT (411) notes certain tensions in Homer's narrative arising from the fact that no temples of Zeus existed in Asia Minor. ROMILLY (412) describes the evolution from acceptance of myth as literal truth in the Homeric poems to its acquisition of</page><page sequence="39">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 431 symbolic force in later Greek literature.

Dirlmeier, Die Vogelgestalt homerischer Gotter (SHA W 1967.2), e.g., with regard to II. 7.57-61, 13.62-65, Od. 1.319-20, 3.371-72. Item 416 demonstrates that Homeric precedents may be found for such philosophical or physical notions as the four elements, the primacy of divine reason, the unlimited, etc. FOLEY (417) discloses how the "reverse-sex" similes at Od. 19.108-14 and 23.233-40 (and elsewhere) serve to "clarify the overall structure and meaning of the relations between man and wife" (p. 8): they reinforce our sense of "a mature marriage with well-defined spheres of power and a dynamic tension between two like-minded members of their sex" (p. 21). Item 418 analyzes Homeric and Hesiodic notions of contrasting historical epochs, viz. godlike and heroic vs. merely mortal. Discussion in item 419 proceeds from analysis of the Odyssey, Hesiod, Empedocles, and Aristophanes; see critique in Bertelli PPol 15 (1982) 569-70. According to GRIFFIN (420), "We are able to share [the gods'] viewpoint and to see human life as they see it, in its double aspect of greatness and littleness. And the gods themselves acquire not least from their r8le of watchers their own complex nature: sublime heavenly witnesses</page><page sequence="40">432 JAMES P. HOLOKA and judges, and at the same time all-too-human spectators" (p. 21). Item 423 notes the tendency for humans (though not the poet) to speak of indefinite powers (theos tis, etc.) and suggests illuminating parallels with anthropological theories of mana. Item 424 is on the influence of Homer and Hesiod on Presocratic notions of the four elements. SEGAL (425) compares Homer's and Plato's use of a common tradition of myth: "Plato's journey. . .in its morphology, in its imagery, and even in some of its fundamental aims retains its roots in the experiences of Achilles and Odysseus. Both the epic poet and the philosopher embark upon voyages. . .toward the truth of life's essential and permanent character" (pp. 334-35). WATKINS (429) demonstrates the potential for mutual illumination of Homer and Indo-European, here as regards words for cereals, with attention "to the ethnic, and the poetic, side of what is in part an ethno-botanical, and in part a philological problem" (p. 9). 430.

In item 431, he maintains that the "Volksversammlung" in Homer is not an incipient democratic system, but a mechanism for political decision making and resolution of disputes by aristocrats. DESCAT's semantic-field study (434) finds that "basileus est A anax comme demos A laos. . . .II semble que la representation du pouvoir se presente sous la forme d'un systeme coherent oil le dedoublement des expressions indique un jeu d'interactions reciproques" (p. 238); notably, basileus and demos denote monopolization of public authority by an elite, anax and laos effective dominance within the interpersonal sphere of the oikos. DIETRICH (435) believes Homer occupies a position in the history of Greek religious thought at the boundary between Aegean prehistory and the religion of the polis. LENZ (437) offers reflections on Homeric anthropology, religion, society, and oral artistry. LEVY (438) illustrates that passages implying mortality of gods (e.g., Il. 1.593, 5.388-91, 395-402, 899-901) "represent not an extreme incursion.. . into anthropomorphism but rather a contrivance by which the poet manages to save for his epic the cherished episodes of a tradition in which the gods were indeed mortal" (p. 218; see item 463). POSNER (441) demonstrates that "there is little functioning government in Homer"; we have to do with an "alternative structure of prepolitical institutions and values [e.g., hospitality, reciprocity, honor, gifts, revenge] that occupies the role. . .that the state plays in our society" (p. 28). Item 442 is on the centrality of the bride-price (hedna)- symbolizing in part an alliance of clans-in the Homeric depiction of matrimony. VERNANT (447) compares Od. 12.312-446 (companions of Odysseus eating the cattle of Helios) with Herodotus 3.17-26 (Ethiopians) with a view to determining the Greek classification of foods (cf. item 428). 449.

BERTMAN (449) traces changing notions about justice and the individual's relation to the community in authors beginning with Homer. KIRK (453) exposes the errors of cultural anthropologists who posit greater self- consistency and neatness of organization than is actually evident in societies whose rituals of sacrifice are analyzed. LITTLETON (455) places Greek mythology firmly in Indo-European tradition by discussions of Homer, Herodotus, Aeschylus (in the Eumenides), and Plato. MOSS1 (457) maintains that Ithaca and the city of the Phaeacians exhibit embryonic forms of the classical city-state, unlike Pylos and Sparta, which are non-existent outside the palace walls. By linguistic analysis, NAGY (458) finds thematic precedents for elements in the cremation of Patroclus in certain Indic customs, especially the ritual of the Triple Fire. O'NEAL (459) concludes that "the idealized concept of fair play in the modern world did not exist in Homeric times.... To win was the important object, how was secondary" (p. 13). SCHOULER (460) traces permutations of the notion "depasser le pere" from two lliadic passages-Agamemnon with Diomedes and Sthenelos, and Hektor with Andromache and Astyanax (Il. 4.365, 6.371 ff.)-through Greek literature down to Libanius (and beyond-Kazantzakis). According to SCOTT (461), neither aidas nor nemesis implies moral conscience in Homer; though they could at times dictate co-operative values, each was subordinate to the requirements of arete. 463.

In Mirrors of Mortality: Studies in the Social History of Death. Ed. J. Whaley. London 1981. Pp. 15-39. ANDERSEN (463) argues (against Levy, item 438) that scenes apparently implying the possibility of a god's death in fact do no such thing; moreover, the gods do not point back to "a still more anthropomorphic position" (Levy), but "testify to the. . .poet's modelling of the gods in his poems, according to the needs of his art" (p. 327). DONLAN (464) finds that "circulation of treasure. . . is the necessary instrument of enhancing reputation and of increasing political influence, and both are directly proportional to the</page><page sequence="43">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 435 amount of prestige goods which a man controls" (p. 108); "one motive predominates: to win and to augment fame and influence for oneself and one's oikos" (p. 109)-in part by engaging in various social-symbolic transactions. According to item 465, Il. 5.339-42, while it involves semantic play attesting to considerable linguistic sophistication, does not presuppose the use of writing in composition. KOKOLAKIS (466) shows that passages bearing on the issue of Homeric animism attest some to metaphorical enhancements, others to "primeval animistic superstitions stratified in the surviving epics" (p. 113). KOTOPOULOS (467) contends that the conflict between noble and king seen among Greeks, Trojans, and gods reflects historical anti-monarchical behavior by eighth-century aristocrats. Item 468 traces degeneration of women's status from elevated and privileged in Minoan-Mycenaean times and in Homeric poetry through subsequent stages of degradation beginning with the misogyny of the Hesiodic poems. LESHER (469) argues that the oral character of the Homeric poems did not preclude their addressing philosophical questions: the uses of metis, noos/noein, and gignoskein in the Odyssey "reflect an interest in sense perception, knowledge, and intelligence that was absent in the Iliad" (p. 19). Item 470 is on the considerable but carefully delimited spheres of activity of women (esp. Andromache, Helen, Hecuba, Clytemnestra, Penelope, Helen, and Nausicaa) in Homer. PETERSMANN (471) assesses work in the field and concludes by noting a critical difference between the heroes of Marchen and those of Homer, since in the latter "Gewohnlich jedoch erstreckt sich das Eingreifen der Gotter nur auf ihren Beistand in Kampf und Not, indem sie dem Helden vor allem Mut, Klugheit und Kraft einflossen; nicht ersparen sie ihm dabei personliche Muihsal und Leid. Doch gerade dadurch eroffnen sich fur den homerischen Helden zum grossen Unterschied vom Marchenhelden Wege zu wahrer Humanitat. Ihr hat Homer in seinen Epen erstmals in der Geschichte der abendlandischen Menschheit ein leuchtendes Denkmal gesetzt" (p. 68). QUILLER (472) discusses the dynamics of change from the self-destructive and progressively weaker monarchical system to aristocracy and the emergence of the polis. Item 474 "concentrates on the Dark Age and eighth-century attitudes" toward death, reflected in the language, imagery, and "funerary ideology" of Homer and Hesiod. 475. Abramowicz6wna, Z.

ADKINS (476): "[Achillesl does not realize how his values induced him not to be persuaded [by Nestor in Il. 1, by the ambassadors in II. 9].... Achilles knows that anger is sweeter than honey, but he does not realize why anger is so sweet to one who holds his values. He is living by the same values even.. .in Iliad 24.... He shows no realization that other values would be possible" (p. 321). Adkins reiterates that "the competitive martial excellences of Homer retain their precedence over other [cooperative, civic] values in later Greece. . .for a very long time" (p. 322). Item 479 is on ways in which "the physiology of the gods corresponds to and mirrors that of men" (p. 114), nectar and ambrosia sustaining the agelessness of the gods as earthly foods sustain mortals. DONLAN (480) views calculated generosity in Homer as an element in the social relationships operative in an "immature chiefdom," perhaps reflective of cultural conditions in the ninth century. In item 481, he reaches the conclusion that "the society depicted in Homer. . . is 'real'; and it is more likely that such a social structure existed in space and time [scil. Dark Age Greece] than that it was made up, or that it is an amalgam of institutions concocted from bits and pieces of social background extending over a period of four (or more) centuries" (p. 172). GARLAND's (483) object is "to determine why and to what extent people in Homer feel under an obligation to tend their dead. . . , to abstract and define the prevalent Homeric belief concerning the requirements of the dead and the feelings caused by them among the living" (p. 69). GREENHALGH (484) discriminates as follows: therapon "was a current Geometric Age dependent household servant who at his highest level could be a displaced nobleman who was his master's most able and best loved hetairos and deputy commander-in-chief"; opaon "was a Mycenaean survival. . .meaning a hetairos outside the family and not living as part of the household but owing special duties of loyalty to the king who had established him as a lord on separate estates within his kingdom" (p. 86). KAKRIDIS (486) suggests the term metaken-osis (from metakenoo = "pour from one vessel into another" [LSJ]) to denote instances when characters in the Iliad and the Odyssey possess information that logically should be known only to the poet. PEDRICK (488) advises caution in using Homer as evidence in socio-historical interpretations of the supplication ritual, since the poet subtly manipulates typical scenes for distinct literary effects in each epic: e.g., "In the Odyssey, Zeus' protection for suppliants is used to illuminate the hospitality of various hosts. In the Iliad the most vivid scenes of supplication promote the theme of vengeance" (p. 140). The discussion of supplication, hospitality, and murder and exile in item 490 leads to the judgment that "the</page><page sequence="45">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 437 power of. . . conventions was not absolute and that Homeric society offered ways to bypass the rules it imposed on its members" (p. 40). SCOTT (492) reinforces theories developed by A.W.H. Adkins by showing that, in the society of the Homeric poems, "the world has taken a major step towards community and social organizations" (p. 17). According to VATIN's research (493), poine denotes chastisement and compensation, time goods given in homage or reparation establishing the equality of rights of two parties, thoFe a communal sanction imposed on an individual. WILKERSON (495) contends that belief in controlling force of the gods inhibited development of the notion of persuasion by rhetorical ability in the archaic period. WYATT's very thorough treatment of ate (496) includes sections on "Narrative," "De- scription (Iliad IX)," "Social Aspects (Iliad XIX)," "Psychology," "Physi- ology (Odyssey)," "Parallels and Later Developments," and "Linguistic Form.

Item 498 contends that the distinction between collaterality and linearity is more enlightening than that between patriarchal clan and restricted family: as- sociation based on age and/or (same) sex-hetairia-takes precedence over familial relations. CHEYNS (500) discusses the evolution of the meaning of</page><page sequence="46">438 JAMES P. HOLOKA thumos from mere life-force to a faculty of volition within the hero's psyche. DIETRICH (502) finds divine epiphanies problematic, neither easily classified nor occurring consistently in specific contexts (e.g., prayer, sacrifice, invoca- tion); moreover, we may not read invariable religious meanings into them- they are rather "an extraordinary and largely poetic means of divine intervention" (p. 70). Item 503 is on the evolution of the vocabulary of psychology and ethics in Homer; includes discussion of arete and ate. GERNET (504) scrutinizes the dynamics of clan and family in Homeric society, where certain individuals functioning as parents discharge the two key obligations of vengeance and proper burial; includes discussion of peos, opaon, etes. Item 506 includes some discussion of Homeric seercraft in the section "Mantische Prognosen und das Sicherungsverhalten des Menschen" (pp. 25-27). PINSENT (510) argues that hetairos preserves traces of very ancient military practice. RAUBITSCHEK (511) cites evidence for the "agonistic attitude" and the prestige of athletic excellence in the Homeric epics. ROWE (513) focuses on the central arguments of A. W. H. Adkins, Merit and Responsibility (Oxford 1960), and on the critiques devoted to it. SHARPLES' examination (514) of Il. 11.403-12, 22.98-131, and Od. 9.299- 306, 22.333-39 shows that the Frankel-Snell position regarding the absence of integrated self better suits the tripartite soul of Republic 4; certain Stoic notions of moral conflict as oscillation between opposing judgments have close affinities with Homer's ate and the intra-psychic debates in his characters. In comparing the Iliad with the Odyssey, WEINSANTO (515) finds that "le vocabulaire employ6, les pratiques matrimoniales et la valeur sociale du mariage restent les memes, mais, d'un pobme A I'autre, on d6celer des nuances, des glissements, qui font que, si l'on se marie de la meme fapon... .la representation que l'on se fait du mariage a change" (p. 45).

[Theory of oral composition.] ATCHITY (517) uses the shield as a critical metaphor for analyzing the entire poem: "images of artifacts [e.g. spears, bows, scepters, shields] . . serve as signposts in the vast but coherent landscape that shapes character, action, and symbolism into a clear expression of Homer's instructive theme" (p. xv). He gives special attention to "Helen and Her Galaxy," and to "Hephaistos and the Galaxy of Achilles"; appendices on "Homeric Hierarchi- cal Structures" and "Horses in the Iliad." Item 518 offers a general discussion of the themes of divine knowledge and the human/heroic condition in the Iliad. The 700-page item 521 is a painstaking combination of Analysis and Neoanalysis: eschewing such newfangled notions as the theory of oral composition (Milman Parry is not listed in his bibliography), VAN THIEL explains various inconsistencies as signs of variants and conflation in our text. He posits an Early and a Late (Homeric) Iliad, the latter incorporating material from two shorter works, the Duel (= app. Books 3-4) and the Wall (= app. Books 12-15). Our text is the work of a post-Homeric Redaktor who conflated the Early and the Late Iliad, together with much matter of his own creation. A vast concordance-commentary occupies the bulk of this exercise in the substitution of (utterly unverifiable) text history for literary criticism. Epics discussed by JACKSON (522), besides the Iliad and Odyssey, are the Aeneid, Beowulf, the Chanson de Roland, the Cid, and the Nibelungenlied. MacCARY (523) combines Freudian and post-Freudian psychoanalytic theory to interpret Achilles' personality and certain distinctive plot elements of the Iliad, including the role of mother-figure-goddesses, the special prominence of Patroclus and Hector, etc.: "The plot, imagery, and vocabulary of the Iliad reveal to us the earliest stage in the development of the ego, the ontogeny of the self in the phenomenological struggle of the mirror stage" (p. 233). Item 524 is a massive running commentary on the Iliad (Doloneia excepted); its master principle of interpretation is that the epic is an artistically evolved expression of a consistent heroic code. Thus the social and political dimen- sions of particular actions and words in specific situations are unfolded with greatest detail.

NICOLAI (528) finds a dual outlook in the Iliad, evident in, among other things, the portrayal of its characters: "Der Dichter gestaltet die Charaktere seiner Figuren-uberspitzt gesagt-als ein mixtum compositum, das einerseits uber- menschliche Kriegerqualitaten aufweist (das ist das archaisierende Element) und das anderseits-jedenfalls bei den Hauptfiguren wie Achill, Agamemnon, Hektor-die allzumenschliche Neigung zu gemeinschaftsgefahrdenden Willku- rakten besitzt (das ist das aktualisierende Element)" (p. 101).

OGILVY (541): "The Iliad shows the spiritual evolution of Achilleus with a complementary development of his use of language: as his spiritual perception grows away from the norm of his fellows, his speech, while retaining the common vocabulary, becomes increasingly metaphorical" (DA!). RANDALL (542) analyzes adjectives applied to tears, deer similes, the eagle-hare simile at 17.673-81, images of little children and young animals, and the themes of weariness and wearilessness. MENKES (543) finds that Heracles "is viewed as a man of exemplary ability,. . .which makes him an appropriate model to whom the Trojan War heroes can look" (DA!). Item 544 is "a fullscale study of" expressions like legetai and fertur, attempting "to characterize the specific uses to which they are applied by the major poets of all periods" (DAI). PEDRICK (545): "The entire series [1.12-32, 6.37-65, 10.373-457, 11.122-47, 15.463-69, 16.330-32, 21.34-114, 22.337-55, 24.552-711 plays a role in strength- ening our impression of each character, because several motifs are explo- red... from different perspectives" (DAI). According to WOFFORD (547), "the heroic plot is constituted of those actions of which the characters in the poem are aware; it takes death as its subject. The counterplot is constituted of those events or images which the poet adds to the heroic story in order to explain or illuminate it" (DAI). 549. GonzAlez Blanco, A. "Las asunciones en la Iliada."

Finally, each scene as a whole is closely tailored to its circumstances and context" (p. 89).

DONLAN (555): "the crisis of the leadership-structure in the Iliad may reflect [the fact that. . .position-authority and standing-authority are no longer mutually compatible but have begun to compete in a socially disruptive manner. . . " (p. 65). RUBINO (556) observes that "Achilles. . .ends by depending upon epic poets and their audiences (us) to preserve, protect, and revere his kleos .... Zeus. . .becomes the first poet of the Iliad, for it is he, the god, who creates the plot (muthos) of the poem" (pp. 16-17). RUSSO (557) continues his studies of mathematical proportion in the structure of the Iliad, this time with reflections on the Doloneia and on three cases of insomnia: 2.1 (Zeus), 10.1 (Agamemnon), and 24.677 (Hermes).

BARRETT (566) argues against the case made (especially by Hans Licht) for the homosexuality of Achilles and Patroclus, adducing better analogues from writers (Aristotle, Cicero, C. S. Lewis) "who have. . .recorded their thoughts and experiences in regard to friendship in general and the comrade- ship of soldiers in particular" (p. 91). DUBAN (567) maintains that narratives of the three major duels (Menelaus vs. Paris in Il. 3, Aias vs. Hector in 7, and Achilles vs. Hector in 22) are unconventional and unconstrained by the overall structural pattern of the Iliad. GARLAND (568) tabulates "240 recorded deaths on the battlefields," concluding that cause of death is "the interruption of vital functions caused by the despatch of the thymos. . .indicated by the 'loosening effect' upon the gounata and guia. . . . Homer was not concerned to. . .assign the psyche a vital role in the living body" (p. 51). ROMILLY (569) argues that the abominations committed by Achilles are less horrific than they might have been and have the effect of highlighting Achilles' passion and his victory over it. 571.

DARAKI (572) discriminates between two warrior types, the one savage and "pre-cultural", the other initiated and civilized. INGALLS (573) notes that evidence of linguistic lateness and formular modification supports the arguments of M. M. Willcock (JPH 1.168) for innovation in the mythical paradeigmata: "Homer was not a complete slave to his tradition." RUTHER- FORD (577) seeks "to focus attention on a number of elements in Greek tragedy which are already present in Homer, and especially on. . .the theme of knowledge-knowledge of one's future, knowledge of one's circumstances, knowledge of oneself" (p. 145). 579.

ALDEN (579) finds traces in the Iliad of three versions of the return of Achilles to battle. ERBSE (581) argues that the wrath of Achilles and the fate of Patroclus are aspects of a single theme devised by the Jliasdichter; there was no pre-existing Patrocleia. JACKSON (582) reflects on the interrelations of plot and character as regards Achilles, Agamemnon, Hector, and Sarpe- don. Item 583 is on interaction of mythological tradition and Homeric innovation: "whether an Iliad theme attracted old tales as exempla or an old tale inspired an Iliad episode for which the old tale was used as support, each would be liable over time to infiltration of details from the other" (pp. 163-64). LETOUBLON (584) discloses a consistent archaic age heroic value system in dialogues between heroes prior to single combats. NICOLAI (585) finds a tension between "eine affirmative Wirkungsabsicht" that "spricht vornehmlich die kriegerische Tuchtigkeit des Adels an" and "eine kritische Wirkungsabsicht" (p. 11) that reflects the changed political conditions of Homer and his audience. Item 586 shows that, in Homer, only the singer can confer immortality on the hero. WORONOFF (590): "m6pris6es parfois, plus souvent convoit&amp;es, rarement aimres, les femmes peuvent jouer dans l'univers 6pique un r8le determinant, en raison du prestige de leur famille ou de leur personnalit6" (p. 43).

Item 592 identifies the plague in Il. 1 as equine encephalomyelitis, with the mosquito as vector (n.b. Apollo's stinging [ekhepeukesl arrow, line 51). REDFIELD (593) describes devices-personification, metaphor, and variation of tone-by which the proem conveys that the Iliad "will explore the relations between man, beast, and god; it will be a story of suffering and death, and. . .of the ultimate fate of the dead" (p. 110). In item 594, each scene is "considered as an example of a type-scene, whose standard elements will be identified. The individual features of the scene will be examined and compared with those found in other instances of the type-scene. . . . One may hope to see the genius of the individual poet at work" (p. 3). In item 595, analytical examination of opening passages of Book I leads to reflections about authorship and composition of the whole poem. TSAGARAKIS (596) points out the dimension of religious significance in Athena's intervention: humans require divine assistance if they are to avoid being victimized by uncontrollable forces within themselves or in their environment. LATACZ (597) argues that the solution of certain narrative difficulties in the handling of time and sequential and simultaneous action is one more indication that the poet of the Iliad was a great master working late in the epic tradition. In separate model explications (598), GRIFFIN (pp. 127-35) and HAMMOND (pp. 135-42) scrutinize the opening of the Iliad and reflect on its suitability to the epic as a whole.

KONISHI's paper (607) "proposes to show balanced structures in Iliad 2 and Odyssey 11. . . .

From the comparative study in item 610, KIRK concludes that there was "a single composer deciding to make two distinct scenes on the basis of a general narrative idea.... Book 3, although it is outdone in certain particular respects by book 7, surpasses it as a unity and as a contribution to setting the scene for the action of the Iliad as a whole" (p. 40). VOX (611) observes that "with aphamartoepes... .attention is turned not so much to the inopportune meaning of words. . . , but only toward the unbecoming expres- sive form of words: by mistake it is understood as the lack of rhythm and of uniformly appropriate accents" (p. 192). DUSENBERY (615) speculates on the existence of plastic art in Homer's era as in the weaving of Helen in lines 125-28. According to TSAGARAKIS (617), Priam's (problematic) ignorance of the identity of Greek warriors is feigned: "he wants to give Helen a chance to say something and so to feel comfortable in the presence of her stern critics" (p. 71); the duel of Menelaus and Paris, too, is plausible in the tenth</page><page sequence="55">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 447 year, since "it best belongs in a period of demoralizing weakness and decline" (p. 67).

ANDERSEN (621) carefully reviews all of the actions of Diomedes in the Iliad and contends that Homer shaped his character specifically for his role in the Trojan story, in which he and his family had not (pace the neoanalysts) figured prominently earlier. ARAVANTINOS (622) believes the "letter" of Proitos at lines 167-70 was written in Hittite hieroglyphs on a tablet of wood or clay; there is archaeological evidence for other (if not earlier) correspon- dence between Mycenaean Greece and the Near East.

HOLOKA evaluates the Glaucus-Diomedes episode (it does not merely fill time while Hector returns to the city) and the distinctive elements in the interview of Hector and Andromache. HURST (625) maintains that beginning with Il. 6.130-40 and Herodotus 4.78 ff., one may detect an ambivalence of attitude toward Dionysus throughout Greek literature and culture. Item 627 is on the conflicting male and female psychologies underlying the interview of Hector and Andromache.

STAHL (633) argues that certain Euripidean scenes, such as Admetus' realization of the full import of Alcestis' death, have an analogue in the embassy in Il. 9. THORNTON (635) contends that "in Homer the dual can denote not only two as a number, but also two groups or one item [scil. Phoenix) and a group [scil. Odysseus, Aias, and two heralds)" (p. 2), but KOHNKEN (634) raises objections, especially the lack of corroborating examples, and argues-like, for example, D. Lohmann (JPH 1.158, pp. 227-31)-that "Der Grund fur die Verwendung der Duale aber liegt in der sicher beabsichtigten Parallelitat mit der Gesandtschaft des [II. 1.327 ff.)" (p. 13). On the same problematic duals, XYDAS (636) explains that only two went on foot-Phoenix rode in a chariot, GORDEZIANI (638) that they indicate two groups, not two individuals. Item 639 examines lines 185-94, particularly in light of comments by Diodorus Siculus 5.49.1-4, and Philostratus, Heroicus 11.11 ff. By close examination of Achilles' speech, SCHEIN (640) argues with A. Parry (JPH 1.114) and against M. D. Reeve (JPH 2.390) that "Homer has painted the first and perhaps the most powerful portrait in Western literature of absolute brilliance and excellence trying to come to moral and intellectual terms with a world that is not commensurate with it" (p. 131). BANNERT (641) demonstrates the filiations of Phoenix' speech with those of Odysseus and Aias as well as its links with themes (supplication, gift-offering, wrath) prominent elsewhere in the epic. ANDER- SEN (642) claims that the sense "grant to the request of these Litai that recompense (i.e. Agamemnon's gifts) may be bestowed on thee"-mentioned but rejected by Leaf-is right. SCODEL (643) assesses resemblances in the motifs of anger and supplication in a) the story of Phoenix' departure from his home, b) the Meleager example, and c) the plot of the Iliad at large, while WEST (645) considers implications for Homeric text history of "the extra lines from Phoenix' autobiography preserved for us by Plutarch (aud. poet. 26 F)." TARKOW (644) discusses Achilles' "protective recourse to Odysseus-like verbal subtleties and deceptions in his effort to recapture, and thereby to exact revenge for the honor which Agamemnon has cheated. . ."

Chapter Four takes up the problem of intertextual evocation in narrative by looking at the place of the Doloneia in the Iliad and in relation to. . .the Odyssey and the Epic Cycle" (DAI). DAVIDSON (648) argues that the Dolon myth, adapted in Iliad 10, is pre-Iliadic and derives from non-epic traditions about werewolves. Item 651 explores aspects of ambiguity in the character of Diomedes and the symbols associated with him: "A la fois neotatos et geron, jeune homme et redoutable guerrier il 6volue dans une temps aussi incertain que son espace particulier. Rien chez lui n'est jamais univoque" (p. 49). Van der VALK (652) presents a unitarian brief for the authenticity of Iliad 10 and 20: "Das Buch K hat meines Erachtens eine bestimmte Funktion im Ganzen der Ilias und ist daher vom Iliasdichter mit Absicht an seine Stelle gesetzt worden" (p. 136).

(Il. 11.606) by the chain of events that begins with his being sent by Achilles to inquire about Machaon (whose connections with Achilles are noted) in Book 11 and culminating in his being sent to substitute for Achilles in Book 16. PEDRICK (654) argues that the deviation of Nestor's paradeigma from the "categories established for the typical paradeigma" has a sinister outcome: it "ironically. . .works-on the wrong hero. Patroklos does not pass on the lesson to his friend; instead he attempts his own aristeia" (p. 68). See also items 156, 277, 514, 551, 936, 957, 1010, 1030, 1064. Iliad 12 655.

The similarities between Poseidon's response to the building of the wall and his vengeance on the Phaeacians [Od. 8.564-70, 13.125-87]. . .suggest that the latter is a further variant of the same theme" (p. 48).

PHILLIPS (674) argues that "Homer selects from 'all the stars which crown the heavens' a sequence of constellations [Pleiades, Hyades, Orion]. . .significant for its association with the agricultural year." TAPLIN (675): "I shall try to maintain that the shield of Achilles is much more than just 'a digression about armour' by looking at other ways in which in the Iliad war is set against a larger world view, other elements which confirm and give context to the striking effect created by the shield" (p. 14). SCHMIDT's examination (677)</page><page sequence="61">HOMER STUDIES 1978-1983 453 of the shield passage discloses an early instance of the traditional Greco- Roman notion of the tripartite structure of the world (heaven, earth, sea), derived in part from Near Eastern sources.

Item 699 is a comparative examination of the ransom scene in l1. 24 and in archaic Greek art (e.g., a white-ground lekythos by the Edinburgh Painter), remarkable for psychological subtlety and the ability to convey complex actions in a single image field. PAPAMICHAEL (700) reveals psychological nuances of Hecabe's description of Achilles as a savage (lit. "flesh-eating") in lines 206-8. On the allusion to the judgment at 24.22-30, DAVIES (701) observes: "if the first book of the Iliad showed human quarrels persisting and divine strife easily quelled, the antithesis is largely reversed in the last" (p. 59). KEANEY (702) holds that alitem-on is privative of the root lit-, which better accords with Homeric practice in lines where alpha-privative adjectives occur together and with the requirements of the theme of supplication culminating in Book 24. According to WORONOFF (704), the ransom items selected by Priam (Il. 24.228 ff.) attest that the wealth of Troy comprised not only cattle, horses, valuable metals and the profits of commerce, but also the precious clothing derived from sheep raising and the labor of Troy's women.

SINOS (705): "the hero in epos is himself multidimensional. For his epic existence, he draws on the resources of the entire tradition. He embodies the values of epos, affecting their development and being in turn affected by them.... Patroklos is intimately involved with Achilles in the values of Epic: Patroklos affects Achilles in values and reflects him in cult" (p. 10). CLARKE (707) writes "it is clear from the language, precedents and dramatic development of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus are not Homeric 'friends,' but are lovers from their hearts .... Homoeroticism, if not homosexuality, does indeed exist in the Iliad.. . .Only the name is absent" (pp. 395, 396 n. 38). DEVEREUX (708) deduces that, psychoanalytically speaking, Hector's wearing the armor of Achilles makes him a self-surrogate of the latter and his slaying a symbolic suicide, while LEE (709) contends that Achilles relinquishes the old heroic code based on kleos in his appreciation of the value of personal relationships, while Hector foreshadows the chivalric hero.</page><page sequence="64">456 JAMES P.

SMITH (714) cautions that especially German scholars have been too confident about the historicity of "Aineiadai" as patrons who influenced the composition of Il. 20: "disagreements in the second and first centuries B.C. over the actions and movements of Aineias after he left Troy. ..reflect a. . .conflict over the Roman claim to Aineias; and.. .prophecies for Aineias' future made by Poseidon and Aphrodite should be understood as integral to the poems in which they appear" (p. 18).

On the other hand FELDMAN (734) calls him "the archetype of the provocateur in literature" (p. 16) and compares him with Antinoos, Drances, and Unferth; and FUNKE (735) writes "Thersites ist der Lacherliche par excellence, der sich selbst in keiner Weise erkennt und Gegenstand des Spottes wird, als ihm seine Selbstverkennung handgreiflich zum Bewusstsein gebracht wird" (p. 25). ANDERSEN (736) contends that Thersites in cyclic epic tradition was, like Thoas, a leader of the Aetolians; Homer's depiction is wholly original and owes nothing either to the Aethiopis or the Alcmaeonis.
