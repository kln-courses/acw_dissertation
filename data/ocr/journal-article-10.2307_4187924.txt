<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL Advertising Education A long persistent problem in agency and client organizations, as well as in universities, is one which has been described as "the advertising- marketing marriage." The problem concerns the inefficiency caused by the basic differences in intellectual training and orientation of advertising and marketing persons. An agency man writes that there is a "basic confusion that exists regarding the different natures of advertising and marketing, and that this confusion is penalizing many corporate managements . . .It is important to remember that their functions are quite different, and require different backgrounds, training, disciplines, and techniques." We need to openly address these basic differences in intellectual training and orientation between ad- vertising and marketing persons. We seek a better coordination between advertising and marketing ef forts.- Advertising is, generically, a communication pro- cess. Communication is the elicitation of intended meaning. And meaning is what exists in the mind of a consumer. To state a tautology: successful advert'is- ing is successful communication. Any claim that an advertisement or commercial is successful for any given reason (e.g., sales) in the absence of a true measurement of the elicitation of its intended mean- Ing is not only presumptuous, it's fallacious. Thus, in order for anyone to possess an under- standing of advertising as a profession, i.e., aS something more that its contingent vocational techniology, requires intellectual training and d'is- cipline in those subject matter areas known today as the "social and behavioral sciences,"1 but more accurately described as the humanities. The com- municative efficc of given accyodvertisements and commercials depends, necessarily, upon true know- ledge regarding the consumer-understood psycho- logically as a human bei'ng, as something consider- ably more than a biological organism. Thus, advertising is concerned, first, with true knowledge regarding the nature of human communi- cation and the elicitation of intended meaning. And, if the person happenis to be research orienited, then he has to be knowledgeable in science-not as statistics, not as correlations-but science under- stood as the search for causality relations. Advertis- ing research, in terms of accountability to the client, is a search for causality relations between the mean- ing elicited from snpecific. ads and comme-rcials andr Clearly, although there are many exceptions, mar- keting people do not generally have this kind of intellectual training and discipline. In terms of their formal education, courses in the humanities and sciences beyond those required in general educa- tion programs-do not constitute a sizable part of their academic preparation for work in the business world. On the other hand, many marketers have had extensive exposure, work or training in the voca- tional activities connected with the physical produc- tion of ads and commercials. And if this was the essence of advertising -its vocational knowledge- a hard argument might well be presented for clients to go into the advertising business-piecemeal or otherwise. The mere capability of producing tech- nologically proficient vehicles (called ads and commercials) would automatically qualify anyone as being "an advertising man. " However, viewed as a communication industry, advertising is concerned, first, with having consumers actually elicit the meanings physically represented by these technologically proficient vehicles. And subsequently, the determination of whether such elicited meanings caused specific purchases of the physically symbolized product is one of the major problems of advertising-consumer behavior research. The point is that this view of the essence of advertising-as human communication-requires a background in the humanities and the sciences. And, in contrast, it is noted that the main thrust of the marketing curriculum in today's university is mainly predicated to what is often described as the 4 P's. Advertising people must know basic marketing in- formation for every campaign. However, this fact does not qualify them as being marketers. In the same manner, marketing people are generally ac- quainted with basic advertising information. But, again, this fact does not qualify them as being advertising people. Granting the desirability of better coordination (hence, cooperation) between advertising and marketing persons, a pertinent question is: Are the basic differences in the types of knowledge pos- sessed by advertising and marketing persons recon- cilable on intellectual grounds? On analysis, and assuming the curricula structures within the universities will remain pretty much the same in the future, the answer in most cases would seem to be "no." As long as a majority of marketers sincerely believe that advertising can be explained on the basis of an anthropomorphic psychology, there can exist no scientific basis for any intellectual reconciliation between advertising and marketing. When all the oratory is over, it has to be recognized that any coherent explanation of advertising- understood as something more than its vocational trade skills-must necessarily be based on a psy- 45</page><page sequence="2">chology that is valid for human beings (i.e., con- sumers). Because of this, it simply is not possible for any coherent explanation of advertising to be based on any variant of anthropomorphic psychology. And, if this is the type of psychology embraced by the majority of marketing persons as the basis for their understanding of advertising, then intellectual reconciliation is quite impossible on any scientific ground. Anthropomorphism and science are mutually exclusive belief systems. Thus, unless we are to remake the marketer in our own image (or vice versa)-which would seem ill- advised for many reasons-another route should be sought wherein these differences in intellectual orientations can be accomodated in order to achieve a more harmonious effort. Advertising and marketing form a marriage, but this does not mean that either spouse should submerge their individuality and unique contribution. Advertising is truly an inter- disciplinary enterprise, but "interdisciplinary" does not mean a prostitution of the individual disci- plines involved. We have no easy answers to this rather complex problem. We feel, however, there is considerable merit in at least discussing it-hoping thereby that some positive suggestions might be forthcoming. We feel that much could be gained by achieving a better coordination of advertising and marketing efforts. But a coordination of human effort is not something mechanical; it is not something that can be ac- complished by the issuance of an order. It requires a spirit of cooperation between the parties that are working together. We are searching here for ways to strengthen this spirit. Dan Stewart Contents of Next Issue [ 1 974, 3(3)] 1.
