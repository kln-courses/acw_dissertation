Bohrer Since the Elgin marbles were brought to England, no similar arrival has occurred so calculated to excite the interests of artists and archaeologists, as these Assyrian- Babylonian remains. ... .-Sidney Smirke, 18471 Among the interesting questions which have arisen along with the recently discovered [Assyrian] monuments, it is certainly quite surprising to find those concerning art for its own sake... .-Mus6e de Ninive, L'Illustration, 18472 The sudden archaeological discovery, starting in 1843, of a wealth of artifacts from the ancient Neo-Assyrian Empire brought to the attention of Europeans a form of artistic production that was unique and unexpectedly striking to many contemporary eyes. Roughly comparable arrays of ancient Assyrian artifacts found by both French and English excavators were put on display almost simultaneously in the Louvre and British Museum, starting in 1847. Yet, even as Assyrian art received a (literal) place in the ranks of ancient art, it was problematic and difficult to assimilate into estab- lished artistic and cultural discourse. As we shall see, Assyria presented an unsettling addition to a history of ancient art and cultures whose primary touchstones had been objects from ancient Egypt and the Greco-Roman world. The interplay of Assyrian archaeology with nineteenth- century Western art and visual culture has never been fully assessed. The study of the Western reception of Assyrian art has focused largely on two portions of the phenomenon: a largely positivist narrative of archaeological progress and a narrowly defined "influence" on aspects of European art.3 My goal here will be, to adopt a term of Walter Benjamin, to brush these histories of continual progress, discovery, and innovation "against the grain."4 As we shall see, the varied and contradictory associations impressed on Assyria not only predate the archaeological discoveries themselves but also were decisively shaped by the particular institutional, ideologi- cal, aesthetic, and national arenas within which they circu- lated. Indeed, tracking the different significations of Assyria provides almost a snapshot of structures of power and knowledge active at the time, as well as some of the conflicts and contradictions involved in Western cross-cultural represen- tation. This is a case study, then, in a given cultural moment, of the principle stated byJohannes Fabian that ". .. our ways of making the Other are ways of making ourselves." Further, as it represents an overlap between the concerns of art history and postcolonial studies, I will draw on the resources of both fields.5 My primary focus, then, is not ancient Assyria itself or its excavation, but rather what was made of it within nineteenth- century Europe. I thus approach nineteenth-century Assyrian exoticism as a phenomenon of reception.6 I am concerned not with distinguishing "authentic" versus "inauthentic" representations of Assyrian culture or its artifacts but rather with articulating the (Western) processes through which all such representations take place, from Gustave Courbet's fanciful "Assyrian" beard to Ford Madox Brown's more painstaking re-creation of the interior of an Assyrian palace. Parallel to the dynamic of imperialist power involved in Mesopotamian archaeology itself, the European reception of Assyria presents a series of conflictual power relations. As we shall see, the establishment of Assyria in the cultural and artistic discourse of the West illuminated, often precisely as it challenged, established norms of cultural discourse. To be more specific, I want to show here how the Assyrian discover- ies were involved in a consistent process of identification by means of binarism and bifurcation. The most obvious binary pairing is that in which the West defined itself against its nebulous "Other." At the same time, juxtaposing different works of art and moments of reception ultimately under- mines the binary logic that underwrites the Western con- struct of a timeless "exotic" East. It instead reveals that the exotic subject takes on a variety of forms and roles in the nineteenth century, encompassing a broad array of artistic production. As we shall see, France and England asserted themselves directly against each other in their representations of Assyria in a way that paralleled the nations' rivalry to gain Assyrian antiquities. Further, though they can only be briefly touched on here, other sorts of bifurcated oppositions were also involved. The distinction between judging an object a work of art or an antiquarian artifact was clearly invoked to evaluate Assyria, by partisans of both positions. Even the conventional roles of male and female were a bit unsettled by the case of Assyria. Finally, I must add a note on context. I use the term exoticism with a full sense of its complex history.7 Indeed, I use it for that very reason: to underline the contestable and problematic nature of "non-Western" representation.8 There are pressing reasons, both historical and contemporary, to question the putatively objective accounts that circulate in the West of the world beyond it. A critical analysis of Assyrian exoticism is part of that project. Nonetheless, the overwhelm- ing majority of postcolonial studies, both in art history and elsewhere, are devoted to European representations of lands contemporary to the artist. This study moves instead toward the (less often examined) implications for understanding the involvement of historical subjects in the representation of exoticist difference.9 Martin and Delacroix: The Image of Ancient Assyria in the Early Nineteenth Century What did ancient Assyria represent in France and England during the earlier nineteenth century?

To begin, though, we must locate Assyria, and Mesopotamia, both geographically and temporally.10 Mesopotamia refers to the land between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in what is modern-day Iraq. In antiquity, it was for millennia the site of many and varied cultures, chief among them the Assyrian Empire centered in northern Mesopotamia and the Babylonian kingdom of southern Mesopotamia. The best-known capitals of these two ancient kingdoms were Nineveh and Babylon, respectively. The names of both resounded in Western discourse (and also blended to some extent), largely through accounts circulated by Greco- Roman writers as well as biblical sources.11 The view of Mesopotamia communicated to the West derived from the accounts of peoples central to Western self-definition, the ancient Hebrews and those of classical antiquity. That is, Mesopotamia was seen not on its own terms, but rather via those of its historical antagonists. Through these accounts, largely considered documentary in the earlier nineteenth century, Mesopotamia was taken as a cautionary tale, a site of sloth, sin, violence, and transgression: the West's first great "Other."12 In the nineteenth century, the area was a province at the far eastern edge of the Ottoman Empire, a region of semiautono- mous pashaliks each governed primarily by a local pasha, though officially under the control of the Ottoman ruler in Istanbul. Seen by Western travelers as a remote and unwelcom- ing locale of largely unrelieved desert, Mesopotamia did not figure on the itinerary of the Grand Tour, which preferred the more impressive and accessible monuments of Egypt, Pales- tine, Greece, and the Turkish lands. In a telling turn of illogic, the relatively few nineteenth-century travelogues of the area that existed often used the seemingly "wasted" state of the land and its current inhabitants to emphasize the notable evils ascribed to its ancient population. Mesopotamia's cur- rent state was seen as a lasting trace of the divine punishments said to have rained on the ancient rulers Sardanapalus of Assyria and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.'" What was not there was taken to prove what had been. Here, then, is the first and most obvious binarism involved in the constructed image of Assyria, in which Western achievement is contrasted with Eastern ruin and taken as an index of the morality of the former versus the immorality of the latter. The Western image of Assyria in the early nineteenth century thus subsumed present to past, consistently invoking ancient events supposed to have led to the reputedly wasted state of the region during the nineteenth century. More than any other work of its kind, John Martin's tremendously popular Fall of Nineveh (Fig. 1) attempted to document in detail such moments in the inherited narrative of ancient Assyria. Martin had made his name with another Mesopota- mian subject, Belshazzar's Feast of 1821. Seven years later, in</page><page sequence="3">338 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 The Fall of Nineveh, he returned to the subject, creating a work that exemplifies what Morton Paley has termed "the apocalyp- tic sublime."14 Though perceptions of Assyria and Babylonia were frequently intermingled, and the similarities may have been seen as greater than the differences, Belshazzar's Feast (as Martin seems to have realized) is a subject that took place in Babylon, while The Fall of Nineveh allows us to address specifically the conception of Assyria.'5 A huge painting (measuring 84 by 134 inches), The Fall of Nineveh presented a vast spectacle of destruction, a panorama of violent disorder in an elaborately detailed setting. In it, the capital of the Assyrian Empire is laid waste by invading armies. Martin detailed, to an explicit internal scale, one-hundred- foot walls and a gateway twice that size. At the far right he created the tomb of Ninus, the legendary founder of Nin- eveh. In the middle ground, the armies of the siege set upon soldiers and citizens of Nineveh, who are in various stages of capitulation. In the same area are civilian fighters, described by Martin as "Fathers and husbands defending their children and wives." By contrast, many of the Ninevite soldiers have broken rank and flee in terror before the well-ordered invaders. A sea of vast columns connects foreground and background, a hybrid order combining Egyptian and Indian architectural features. Among the most striking features of The Fall of Nineveh, a key to both its legibility and profitability, was Martin's descrip- tive brochure, which circulated with the work. The brochure describes the architecture as "invented as the most appropri- ate for a city situate [sic] betwixt the two countries [Egypt and India] and necessarily in frequent intercourse with them."'6 As we approach the foreground of the image, looking down omnisciently on a wing of the royal palace, we can make out the figure the descriptive brochure puts at the heart of the drama. At the edge of the steps, gesturing toward the pyre being built for him at left, is Sardanapalus, the legendary final king of Assyria, said to have "exceeded all his predecessors in sloth and luxury." As his leaderless army broke apart, the king, we are told, retired into his palace, in a court in which he caused a vast pile of wood to be raised; and, heaping upon it all his gold and silver, and royal apparel, and at the same time enclosing his eunuches and concubines in an apartment within the pile, he set fire thereto, and so destroyed himself and the rest.17 This quotation in the brochure, from a nineteenth-century reference source, largely distills the facts from ancient ac- counts. But it does not precisely account for Martin's picture, in which the pyre is located not in an apartment within the palace but rather in open space adjoining the city itself. This sort of disjuncture abounds between the image and the texts purported to explain it. Thus, while one portion of the text acknowledges that there is no biblical description of the scene, a quote from the Book of Nahum is used specifi- cally to justify the action of the queen (also unmentioned in ancient accounts). In Martin's conception she "casts a fare- well look of love and regret upon the king" before being led off to safety, in the opposite direction from the king, together with her maids and advisers. Similarly, in another sort of disjuncture, some of the architectural decoration of Nineveh is justified by Herodotus's description of a temple located not in Nineveh but in Babylon.'8 Beyond serving mere factual explanation, Martin's bro- chure testifies to a certain referential obsession, a need to justify. Assembling a bulwark of authoritative sources comes to be more important than demonstrating any internal consis- tency among them. The brochure is choked with a variety of heterogeneous texts, including much of the biblical Book of Nahum, contemporary reference works, various classical cita- tions, and a poetic account of the incident. But they, too, serve as much as pretexts for Martin's inventions as factual validations of the proffered spectacle. Martin's image of ancient Nineveh exemplifies both the particular subject and the judgmental tone that dominated the popular conception of Assyria in the early nineteenth century. The sheer sublime charge of Martin's huge, ani- mated image holds in check, or at least disguises, the jarring discontinuities of the sources from which it is fashioned. In all, the work testifies to a need both to construct and justify an ancient Assyrian "Other." Martin's work was well known in France. Throughout the later 1820s and early 1830s Martin's elaborate prints after his oil paintings circulated widely in France, to critical, popular, and even royal acclaim, receiving a gold medal from Charles X in 1829. His painting The Deluge created a sensation and won a further gold medal at the Salon of 1834.19 But while Martin's image of Assyria was circulated among overlapping French and English audiences, to assess its implications more fully it must be seen in counterpoint to a French work of the same subject, begun the year before Martin's Fall ofNineveh. Eugene Delacroix's The Death ofSardanapalus (Fig. 2) stands today as the most famous representation of Assyria of the nineteenth century.20 The work caused a sensation at the Salon of 1827-28. As with Martin's image, there is further evidence of the work's continuing popularity. Several engrav- ings of the painting exist, as well as a number of copies by both the artist himself and later followers. A further parallel to the cross-channel currency of Martin's image is that Delacroix's work in the 1820s embraced a number of English sources, notably Shakespeare and Byron. Byron's The Tragedy of Sardanapalus, first published in 1821, has often been considered an inspiration for Delacroix's painting.21Thus, while Delacroix's work, like Martin's, suggests a certain common interest in Assyria in France and England, the considerable difference between the two images testifies also to the remarkable degree of invention and variety allowed by the subject. However paradoxical, this "mobility" of subject consistently coexists with the stress on referential exactitude of both Martin and Delacroix.22 Indeed, the treatment by the classically educated Delacroix of the subject corresponds more precisely to the description quoted above from Martin, as the scene is now set inside, within the king's palace, in a locale controlled by his gaze. The smoke of the conflagration already has begun to fill the chamber, and the room is littered with the concubines, servants, animals, and other treasures being destroyed as the king watches. But Delacroix's scene cannot be taken as a closer transcrip-</page><page sequence="4">INVENTING ASSYRIA 339 2 Eugene Delacroix, The Death of Sardanapalus, 1827-28. Paris, Musee du Louvre (photo: Giraudon/Art Resource, New York) tion of a textual source. To the contrary, this work also maps itself on a field of overlapping and discontinuous textual referents. First, Byron's soulful conception of Sardanapalus is not compatible with that of the classical historians. Byron's play does not even include this scene of brilliant immolation. Beyond the divergence between the classical and Byronic conceptions, a third text further problematizes the precise subject. This text is contemporary with Delacroix, and one to which his work clearly was meant to refer. An unattributed paragraph, in quotation marks, it was published in the Salon catalogue accompanying the work's original exhibition. Its description of Sardanapalus and his setting follows approxi- mately the account of Diodorus Siculus (the major classical authority for the incident), but also mentions two other characters, including a Bactrian woman, Aischeh, who is mentioned nowhere else among the established sources of the legend and does not seem clearly identifiable within Delacroix's image. Visually, the same sort of referential calculus is at work here as in Martin's image. Delacroix again creates Assyria through citations from a wide and heterogeneous range of sources, always substantiating the most imaginary and sensational by including elements agreed to be authentic and attested. But whereas Martin explicitly claimed to have invented a single period style used more or less consistently in the setting, Delacroix employs a pastiche of visual references from a variety of ancient and contemporary cultures. In Delacroix's attempt to pass off details of architecture, costume, and implements as Assyrian, convincing cases have been made for his painstaking transposition of archaic Greek, Mogul Indian, Etruscan, and Egyptian sources in various aspects of the painting.23 Delacroix's work, like Martin's, creates a network of refer- ences to authoritative texts and artifacts. But the considerable differences between the two images, renditions of the same subject drawn from common sources of a given historical moment, only serve to further undermine the claim of each to objectivity. Ancient Assyria, then, serves as a mirror that reflects the different preconceptions and desires of the representer as much as it does any objective subject being</page><page sequence="5">340 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 represented. Western artists and audiences, while partaking of a widely accepted network of established references, also differently construe the imagery of a foreign culture in a way related to their own cultural differences. The subject of the fall of Nineveh thus floats on a sea of references without being precisely tied to any one. It is strikingly open to individual manipulation. Delacroix's conception of the subject, with its explicit violence, sexuality, and cruelty, contrasts sharply with the mock-heroic and sentimentalized conception of Martin. Mar- tin's placement of the king bestows on him a certain privilege, as he engages in a grand pointing gesture that elevates him above the height of the crowd. Delacroix's king, by contrast, lies in darkness outside the main focus of the composition. Rather than acting, he watches impassively. Further, there is a remarkable difference between the two images in the treatment of gender relations. Martin presents active, loving, familial relations between the sexes. We have seen this already between king and queen and in the fathers fighting to defend their daughters. Even the king's favorite concubine, who is to follow him to her death, leans her head gently on his bosom. Delacroix's Sardanapalus, of course, who watches calmly as his concubines are abjectly murdered, could not be more different. The differing gender conceptions of Martin and Delacroix reflect not only different social norms but also different imaginations. More than a decade ago, Linda Nochlin de- scribed The Death of Sardanapalus as "a fantasy space" into which the artist's own erotic and sadistic desires could be projected. As she wrote, " [it is not] Western man's power over the Near East that is at issue, but rather, I believe, contempo- rary Frenchmen's power over women ...."24 This was a decisive move away from interpreting the work purely in terms of the objective conditions of its visual and textual sources, locating the work as well in the subjectivity of the Western artist. Looking more closely at the dynamics of gender in Delacroix's work from the standpoint of reception aesthetics, however, it hardly seems that admitting one inter- pretation excludes the other.25 Rather, these two forms of power-Western man's power over the Near East and that of the contemporary Frenchman over women-are related within the work. Delacroix's Sardanapalus thematizes viewing itself. Drawing on the method of reception aesthetics, we can locate the work's "implied viewer" and then construct a relationship between this viewer and the figures in the work. Especially when seen, as Nochlin suggests, specifically within its mascu- line-dominated milieu of reception, the work clearly employs both forms of power relations. The decentered position of the king gives way to the even more privileged view of the women's bodies, and other objects, offered the (presumed male) viewer.26 To extend Nochlin's observation, the viewer's relation to the women, like that of Sardanapalus to the women, can stand for the power of the contemporary French- man over women. At the same time, the relation of this same implied viewer to Sardanapalus, as like genders engaged in the same action of viewing, reflects on just the same level the power of West over East. Even as the viewer is intimately present in the room with Sardanapalus, he is also in a position of superiority to the doomed, effeminate ruler. The viewer is thus in a position to validate the excoriating description of Sardanapalus by an early nineteenth-century critic as "a prince whose name has become synonymous with debauchery and passivity of the most degraded and notorious sort."27 Considering Delacroix and Martin together, we can see that while relations of gender in conceptions of Assyria may vary, this power of West over East is common to both images. The viewer's closeness to Delacroix's Sardanapalus, and even participation with him in the same activity of viewing, is countered by the infamy of the king's name and the fate that awaits him. In Martin's work, while the conception and composition are vastly different from Delacroix, the relation of viewer to subject is comparable. The high, omniscient viewpoint now insulates the viewer from the threat of the action while providing a panoramic view. Even if Sardanapa- lus is identifiable among the crowd, he is only slightly larger than the rest of the doomed multitude in the distant, roiling sea of the battle. The closest figures to the viewer are the "rulers" of the state (unattested by any literary source), gesturing toward the heavens and cursing Sardanapalus for ignoring their counsel. Their rebuke is a metaphor for the Western viewer's own stance toward the scene. More generally, then, the pattern of commonalities and divergences between the two paintings both confirms and complicates the conventional binarist model of exoticism. Each work clearly reinforces the conception of Assyria as a moralizing and cautionary tale, a counterexample to Western "progress": a place picturesque, violent, sensual, and, per- haps most significant, doomed. Each work clearly looks down on its subject, echoing the directed, imperialistic power relation between West and East dominant at the time. At the same time, the palpable differences we have noted mitigate against finding this binary situation completely adequate as an explanation. There is neither a single Assyria nor a single, given West. Instead, as we have seen, the subject metamorpho- ses as it circulates among different cultural nodes within the West. The enormous differences of subject, setting, treat- ment, and even style between Martin and Delacroix testify to the heterogeneity of the Western audience. This in turn has major importance for theorizing nineteenth-century exoti- cism. The features we have examined here in the representation of Assyria seem to confirm ajudgment that has only recently emerged in postcolonial studies. Rather than forming a single dominant monolith, the Western conception of "the East" was multiple, fragmented, and localized. We have found, instead of a closed and coherent system, something closer to what Ali Behdad has recently called Orientalism's "principle of discontinuity," its dispersion of authority through inter- mingled but incomplete networks of reference.28 The author- ity of exoticist reference in such a system is deferred from an individual representation and taken up, unevenly and idiosyn- cratically, by a preexistent repertory of assumptions. A similar feature has already been noted specifically in connection with nineteenth-century exoticist painting. In her study of Antoine-Jean Gros's Plague-Stricken of Jaffa, Darcy Grimaldo Grigsby has observed that "Orientalist discourse represents its own incompleteness."29 It is through just this</page><page sequence="6">INVENTING ASSYRIA 341 incompleteness, this purport to represent what is beyond the validating capability of the Western viewer, that the cultural boundedness of the artistic conception is enunciated. These circumstances are at the heart of the discontinuity of exoticist representation. They are the founding conditions for the exoticist "mobility" we have noted above. Images such as those of Martin and Delacroix, then, are clearly evidence of a widespread interest in Assyria. But juxtaposing them uncovers the slippery, subtle working of the exoticist signifier. It is a process, as we have seen, that begins by appealing to a binary relationship between West and East, even while amending the particular subject matter in differ- ent ways to fit different situations. In short, the representation of Assyria must be investigated with a full sense of its Western context as much as of its individual meaning. In precisely this manner, I want to follow Assyria's representational fortunes in France and England through two successive moments. First, we will consider the response to Assyrian archaeological discoveries in the years around 1850, and second, we will look briefly at some representations of Mesopotamia from the years following the discoveries. As we shall see, these discoveries did nothing to "correct" the imaginative constructions of the earlier artists. Despite new findings based on actual artifacts, Assyria contin- ued to be explicitly infused with the character and expecta- tions of its audience. Further, the debate inspired by its artifacts brought up a new kind of controversy, which emerged from vexing questions about their aesthetic value. Crises of Discovery: The Motivation and Circulation of Early Assyrian Archaeology Following further the European representation of Mesopota- mia necessitates a shift from art to archaeology. This under- lines the interdependence of the two activities and specifies the contemporary political and cultural conditions under which such representation took place. Like the works of art we have just considered, in their treatment of the actual Mesopotamia (and Mesopotamians) France and England asserted both unique identities and common assumptions. Just as we have noted the overlap of audiences and sources drawn on by Martin and Delacroix, so, too, the archaeological rediscovery of the ancient Neo-Assyrian kingdom owes much to the projects for geopolitical dominance of the two coun- tries. The rivalry of France and England was played out, in part, through the amassing of remains.3? Already in the 1820s word was circulating in Europe that the remains of the great Mesopotamian kingdoms had been located. The first sentence of Martin's brochure states, "The mighty cities of Nineveh and Babylon have long since passed away, and, till lately, the traveller hath in vain sought for the spot where their dust reposed."31 The recent development noted in England was part of a chain that led, ironically, to France's making the premier discovery. Three years before Martin's picture, in 1825, a collection of some fifty-odd ancient Babylonian baked clay tablets, bricks, and related objects entered the collection of the British Museum. Assembled by ClaudiusJames Rich, and donated to the museum on his death at age thirty-four, this modest collection was the West's first significant assembly of ancient Mesopotamian artifacts. Together with Rich's several popular and detailed publications on the sites of ancient Babylon and Nineveh, they raised the profile of Mesopotamia in European discourse.32 Rich's presence in Mesopotamia, and the European pub- lic's interest, grew from a distinct, and hardly disinterested, source. Instead, they were a by-product of a strategy to promote colonial interests. Rich had been appointed in 1807 as the British East India Company's first "resident" in Baghdad, in southern Mesopotamia. His primary mission was defensive. The success of Napoleon's Egyptian campaign in the previous years (and Britain's own failed occupation of Alexandria in 1807) raised English fears of further French conquests in the region. Rich was to shore up British interests in Mesopotamia, particularly seeing to the maintenance of overland and river routes to India. Mesopotamia thus had a specific function in the map of English interests. The location of Mesopotamia in Martin's brochure as directly between Egypt and India thus bears particular relevance, situating it directly between these contemporary sites of Western power and contention. As the immediate political threat passed, Rich's interest in the ancient history of Mesopotamia grew. His memoir on Babylon quickly went through four editions and was followed by a second, while a memoir of his visit to northern Mesopota- mia, with a considerable portion devoted to ancient Nineveh, was published posthumously.33 Thus, even in the two decades following his death in 1821, Rich's work continued to bring to attention both textual and artifactual evidence of ancient Mesopotamia. The last works bearing his name were pub- lished in 1839. The circulation of Rich's findings on ancient history and archaeology do not mark a complete break from the overtly political nature of his earlier work, but rather point to the establishment of archaeology as a new arena of contention for the European powers. About 1841 a French consulate was opened in Mesopotamia. As Baghdad had been taken by the British, the French placed their toehold nearly two hundred miles to the north, in the city of Mosul-which proved to be located as strategically for archaeology as for any other purpose. Besides its importance as a center of trade and manufacture (notably, a delicate textile soon dubbed in French mousseline), Mosul boasted a site directly across the Tigris from the enormous mounds that had been (correctly) presumed by Rich to be the remains of ancient Nineveh. In 1842 Paul-Emile Botta was named to the newly created post at Mosul, largely through the backing ofJules Mohl, the driving force behind the Soci6t6 Asiatique, then the leading organization in France devoted to the study of Near Eastern and Asian languages and the collection of related artifacts. Botta began excavations almost immediately, without official permission from the Ottoman government even to dig much less remove any remains34 When little was turned up at the site of Nineveh, Botta moved his entourage to the village of Khorsabad, about fifteen miles to the northeast, and began almost immediately to make spectacular finds. From the start of work on March 20, 1843, as he later put it, "I had the first revelation of a new world of antiquities."35 Botta's letters to Mohl were published and annotated by the</page><page sequence="7">342 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 latter in the SocietY's Journal Asiatique the following year. These documents, which constitute Botta's only written work to receive any large public distribution, give the first descrip- tions of Assyrian art published in the West. They were disseminated widely throughout the French and English press, the first dispatches of a remarkable discovery.36 In Botta's letters, and Mohl's annotations, we find the demands of antiquarian science tied to those of imperialist accumula- tion. First, it is clear that a nationalist motivation was central, and that the recovered artifacts were meant from the start to be sent to France and adorn its national collections. Mohl, for instance, assures the reader in an addendum to Botta's letters that "everything admitting of removal will be sent to France, and there form an Assyrian museum, unique throughout the world. ... [U] ntil the Louvre shall be embellished by a hall of Assyrian Sculptures, Europe cannot profit by the discovery of Khorsabad."37 Mohl neatly takes France for all of Europe, the measure of his nationalistic viewpoint. It was also through his efforts that permission from the Ottoman government was ultimately obtained for the French acquisition of the artifacts. Second, and more pervasive, is the scientific/antiquarian project enunciated in Botta's writings. Botta's letters are primarily dedicated to providing an objective transcription of the carved images and cuneiform texts discovered in the underground chambers of Khorsabad. Botta, trained as a natural scientist by an associate of the naturalist Georges Cuvier, had been previously engaged in the collection of biological and botanical specimens. The positivist, descriptive framework of classificatory science is behind the exhaustive coverage of the letters. Last, however, one finds in Botta's letters something almost unprecedented from Rich's frame of reference: aesthetic judgment. An Assyrian group is said to be superior to the Achaemenid sculpture of Persepolis with "more animation in the figures and greater anatomical science in the design ... these bas-reliefs give favorable evidence of the tastes and skill of those by whom they were executed." Another figurative relief is described as "extremely well sculptured, and the tout ensemble has so Grecian an air, that I [almost] doubted its origin .. .",8 Once uncovered, the huge, elaborately sculpted stones of Assyrian art posed an unexpected visual interest, bearing comparison even with ancient Greek sculpture, the paradigm of classicism. Yet, while the language of aesthetic evaluation is dispersed throughout Botta's report, it always plays a subordinate role in his descriptions. These three modes of evaluation, then-nationalistic, anti- quarian, and aesthetic-attended the introduction of the fruits of Assyrian archaeology to a Western audience. To- gether, they account for virtually all of the published text of Botta's letters. While they establish discursive norms more generally for the Western evaluation of Assyrian antiquities, just as with Martin and Delacroix, they also present terms used by agents of the different countries to conflict and oppose each other. For the same touchstones will be seen to be of equal relevance, although in different proportions and to very different effect, in the communications of the English discoveries that soon followed those of the French. The history of English archaeology in Assyria begins not with an official appointment, but rather with the stealthy trip of Austen Henry Layard, then an unofficial aide to the British ambassador at Constantinople, Stratford Canning.39 In Novem- ber 1845, with a small grant and strict instructions from Canning, Layard made the journey from Constantinople to Mosul, posing as a traveler. Excavating tools were prepared for him in secret, and with a small group he began digging just south of Nineveh in the more remote town of Nimrud, which featured a mound rivaling that of Nineveh. Layard made discoveries as quickly as Botta, finding on the first day of digging major portions of two separate Assyrian palaces. Layard's work was ultimately as productive as Botta's, if not more. Like Botta's, Layard's actions, too, were illegal under Ottoman law, and only later were remedied with retroactive permissions obtained by Canning from the sultanate. He thus attempted to shield his work as much as possible from the pasha of Mosul (whom he described as a cunning adversary). Equally, at least, Layard hid his actions from Botta. However he conceived Ottoman interests in the artifacts, he clearly recognized the power of a French claim to the discoveries and sought to work against it. Layard's later work, Nineveh and Its Remains, triumphantly detailed the many maneuvers and subterfuges involved in his activities.40 In its own way, it is comparable to the travel narratives of Mesopotamia men- tioned above. Though enlivened by much description of contemporary Mesopotamian customs and cultures, it is driven by an interest in what was literally underneath the place itself, which led to conflict with the indigenous inhabit- ants. In the reception of the Assyrian discoveries, precisely the same interpretive touchstones were at work in the English situation as in the French. Canning, for one, provided for Layard the same tone of national chauvinism as did Mohl for Botta. He wrote to the prime minister to justify his sponsor- ship of Layard, "M. Botta's success at Nineveh [sic] has induced me to venture in the same lottery, and my ticket has turned up a prize ... there is much reason to believe that Montague House [the British Museum] will beat the Louvre hollow."41 The antiquarian value of the discoveries was vouched for principally by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson, a leading scholar in the decipherment of Mesopotamian cunei- form since the mid-1830s. It was on Rawlinson's recommenda- tion, together with that of Canning, that the British Museum ultimately agreed to sponsor Layard's excavation.42 Rawlinson had acquired the position of Baghdad resident originally created for Rich. Heir to Rich's political/antiquar- ian position, he also made explicit an inherent nationalistic interest, writing to Layard, for instance, "It pains me griev- ously to see the French monopolize the field, for the fruits of Botta's labors, already achieved and still in progress, are not things to pass away in a day but will constitute a nation's glory in future ages."43 Layard's approach to the Assyrian works, and much of the tone of his publicization of them, was based directly on the theme we have seen broached by Botta, but only occasionally expressed in his writing: the aesthetic evaluation of the Assyrian objects. In a letter about his discoveries, for instance, he wrote "[the Assyrians'] knowledge of the arts is surprising,</page><page sequence="8">INVENTING ASSYRIA 343 and greatly superior to that of any contemporary nation." He went on, describing one of the colossal winged animals that became the very emblem of the Assyrian discoveries (Fig. 3):44 The [colossal winged] lions lastly discovered, for instance, are admirably drawn, and the muscles, bones and veins quite true to nature, and portrayed with great spirit. There is also a great mouvement-as the French well term it-in the attitude of the animal, and "sa pose est parfaite"; excuse the phrase, we have no equivalent. The human head, too, is really grand.45 Whereas Botta relied primarily on the language of the antiquarian, Layard most frequently expressed himself in terms redolent of his youthful training as an art connoisseur. Botta had also noted "mouvement" in the works, but Layard described the works aesthetically at far greater length, and throughout much of his writing, both public and private.46 Notably, only in communication with his sponsors did Layard find reason to suppress this aestheticizing tendency. Writing to Canning just a month after the letter cited above, Layard averred that the sculptures were "undoubtedly infe- rior to the most secondary works of Greece or Rome."47 The necessity for leaving unquestioned the inherited hierarchies of the established artistic canon was enunciated directly to Layard by Rawlinson. I still think the Nineveh marbles are not valuable as works of art. ... Can a mere admirer of the beautiful view them with pleasure? Certainly not, and in this respect they are in the same category with the paintings and sculptures of Egypt and India. ... We have specimens of the very highest art-and anything short of that is, as a work of art ... valueless, for it can neither instruct nor enrapture us. I hope you understand this distinction and when I criticise design and execution, will understand I do so merely because your winged God is not the Apollo Belvedere.48 Throughout both France and England, there was little dispute over the antiquarian value of the Assyrian discoveries or the presumed right of European powers to appropriate these artifacts. But Layard's highlighting of the Assyrian artifact as aesthetic object, his concentration on the mode of aesthetic validation kept strictly subordinate by Botta, con- flicted with the values of his sponsors. Aesthetic versus nonaesthetic, work of art versus antiquarian artifact: this becomes a further binary pairing in which the Western image of Assyria oscillates. Attention to the purely visual appearance of the Assyrian objects, in the aestheticizing framework suggested by Layard, is perceived to upset a tenet of conven- tional artistic taste: the dominance of the works of classical antiquity. This is a crucial moment in the reception of the Assyrian artifacts, the first intimation that transplanting the objects to Europe would not merely confirm historical and nationalist beliefs but also might have the power to interfere with established aesthetic doctrine. Emphasis on aesthetic evaluation, or even extended atten- tion to the visual features of Assyrian works, thus posed a threat that other forms of evaluation did not. In England, the aesthetic approach had clear social implications, carrying the works beyond the narrow circle that initially sponsored 3 Winged man-headed lion, Assyrian, from Nimud, 9th century B.C.E. New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Gift ofJohn D. Rockefeller, Jr., 1932, 32.143.2 Layard's excavations. In a piece excerpted in the antiquarian periodical Athenaeum, for instance, Layard wrote of Botta's discoveries in a way that honors all three touchstones of evaluation while defiantly highlighting the aesthetic appeal of Assyrian art: ... they are immeasurably superior to the stiff and ill- proportioned figures of the monuments of the Pharoahs. They discover a knowledge of the anatomy of the human frame, a remarkable perception of character, and wonder- ful spirit in the outlines and general execution. In fact, the great gulf which separates barbarian from civilized art has been passed.49 Without precisely calling the works equal to Greek art, Layard still clearly sets Assyria above the level of Egypt, to which Rawlinson had confined it. A paragraph notice on Botta appeared soon after in the Penny Magazine, foremost among the cheap, popular, widely circulated magazines then prolifer- ating in England. Notably, the Penny Magazine cites Athenaeum</page><page sequence="9">344 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 as its source and closely follows Layard's language, but it concentrates almost exclusively on his aesthetic evaluation. It refers to "exquisite taste," "remarkable knowledge of anatomy," "great intelligence and harmony of composition" and similar features of the artifacts.50 Thus, especially through Layard's frame of aesthetic reification, the news of the Assyrian discoveries broke out of the smaller, more rarefied circle represented by Athenaeum for the much larger, lower- class readership of the Penny Magazine. The aesthetic challenge of Assyria took further shape as the Assyrian objects began to reach London and Paris in 1847. There they coexisted directly with the same kinds of sources and spoke to the same expectations we have seen earlier in the case of the images of Martin and Delacroix. These European images, as we have seen, were conceived within a network of established textual references to Assyria, as well as a modest basis in material evidence for conceiving an ancient Near Eastern culture. The discoveries of Layard and Botta were well positioned to aid in the material reconstruction of Assyria. Yet while on both nationalistic and antiquarian grounds the discoveries clearly were welcomed, the aesthetic treatment of the artifacts consistently posed challenges. An overview of the aesthetic interpretation of Assyria will illumi- nate the forms of aesthetic discourse at work in the two countries, as well as their social dynamic. The Louvre's Assyrian display, the first ever mounted in the West, opened to the public in the presence of King Louis- Philippe on May 1, 1847. In the lengthy notice of the opening in L'lllustration, the foremost illustrated magazine of the time in France, the question of the aesthetic valuation of Assyria is deemed "quite surprising." This same sentence immediately continues, "but the most important [questions] concern the details of royal usage, of military and domestic life, in a word, of Assyrian customs.""51 The aesthetic is taken up, only to be deferred in favor of a more directly antiquarian mode of evaluation. In the same way, the question of whether Assyria surpassed the achievements of Egyptian art, so vexing an assertion to Rawlinson, is also neatly deferred. The article states that when Assyria is compared to Egyptian, as well as to Greek and Etruscan art, it is apparent that "they have a common origin." All these concerns are affected, and overshadowed, by the presence of the king, and perhaps the particular historical moment of Assyria's entry into the French milieu. Louis- Philippe's government was under severe attack and was to be overthrown in less than a year in the Revolution of 1848. L'lllustration stretched to connect the royalty of contemporary France with what was known of Assyrian kingship. It seized on the same figures we have seen illustrated above by Martin and Delacroix: "Nebuchadnezzar, Sardanapalus or even Ninus himself, since we do not know his identity, the Assyrian monarch now sets foot on the banks of the Seine. A new, more worthy, home has been destined for him, the palace of our kings."52 The focus on kingship reflects not only the reputation of Assyria but also the government's consistent association with the excavation. Yet if the sponsorship provided any brief buttress for the king, the tie was disastrous for Mesopotamian excavation. While excavations had ceased provisionally in 1844, with the revolution the consulate at Mosul itself was suppressed, and the royalist Botta fell into disgrace.53 He was reassigned to lesser positions, first in Jerusalem and later in Tripoli. He died forgotten in 1870, having returned to Europe only two years previously. The trajectory of Botta's career is matched by the history of its official documentation. Botta's work-and that of the artist Eugene Flandin, sent to record his finds-was enshrined lavishly in the huge, magisterial five-volume Monument de Ninive.54 It is arguably the most elaborate publication ever devoted to Mesopotamian archaeology, an ancient Near Eastern successor to the Napoleonic Description de l'Egypte. Begun soon after the initial discoveries, it was the product of extraordinary outlays of time and money by Louis-Philippe's government. Botta and Flandin each received an enormous honorarium of sixty thousand francs. In all, the government spent almost three times as much on the publication itself as on the entire course of excavations it was meant to describe.55 Botta's grand book was the legacy of a very small circle of privileged authorities, whose power was clearly on the wane. While nearly complete (after four years of production) before the revolution, it ultimately appeared in 1849 and 1850, with a press run of only three hundred copies. One of the most telling comments on his book appeared in a publication that had not even existed when Botta began to excavate. Le Tour du Monde was one of the new, cheap illustrated magazines of the Second Empire, devoted to the literature and imagery of travel. In 1863, on Botta's work, it opined: It may be regretted that the results of [Botta's] labors have not been published in a form which promotes awareness of them and spreads his fame. Such volumes in a gigantic format, whose price runs into the thousands of francs, are no doubt monuments worthy of a great nation, but they are hardly accessible and will never break out of a very narrow circle.56 Mohl, Botta's initial sponsor, had protested "the unwieldy format and exorbitant price" of the book even at the time of its publication, but largely on the grounds of its restricting accessibility to the finds among scholars.57 Here the writer is speaking instead on behalf of the newer and far larger audience of a nonspecialist public. Strikingly, the writer pointed to England as a model of such dissemination. "The wisely practical spirit of our neighbors across the English Channel may serve as an example in this regard." Botta, then, was both beneficiary and victim of the extraor- dinary largesse of the July Monarchy. Such a pattern of support had ramifications for the public currency of Assyria itself. This is exemplified by the folio Monument de Ninive, a remarkable "white elephant," as we have seen. But it contin- ues, indeed accelerates, in the image of Assyria in French art after the excavations, as we will examine in the next section. In addition, as we have already begun to see, the contrast with the English coverage of the discoveries could not have been greater. Much unlike the limited circulation of Botta's words and work in France, news of the Assyrian discoveries pervaded England in the years after Layard's discoveries and was made available at all social levels. Textual and visual information on</page><page sequence="10">INVENTING ASSYRIA 345 Assyria appeared throughout the range of publications, from the upper-class Athenaeum to the popular Penny Magazine.58 The same palpable interest contributed to making Layard's Nineveh and Its Remains, an account of his first archaeological campaign and related matters, one of the greatest English best-sellers of the entire nineteenth century. This difference of circulation reflects in part the different arrangement by which Layard, as opposed to Botta, received compensation. He got very little direct support from the British Museum or any other governmental sponsor, but he profited greatly from the sale of his book, which was privately published.59 As the Assyrian artifacts were promulgated in England, they were frequently, made to carry nationalistic and antiquarian value, as in France, as well as religious significance, a develop- ment unique to the English situation. The discussion in both countries, however, nearly always included the inevitably controversial question of the aesthetic value of the works. For instance, an exhaustive review of Layard's book in the upper-class Quarterly Review, which covers all the themes mentioned above, is framed with the aesthetic evaluation of the objects. It begins by singling out "the huge lion and bull" as "by far the most remarkable and characteristic specimens of Assyrian art." These works impressed us with a strange, gigantic majesty, a daringness of conception, which was in no way debased by the barbaric rudeness of the execution, and on the other hand enhanced by its singular symbolic attributes. It is that kind of statue which it takes away one's breath to gaze on.60 Forty-odd pages later the reviewer has regained his breath, and adds that Assyrian works are nonetheless inferior to the "true beauty" and "exquisite anthropomorphism" of the Greeks. Even so, he counts the discoveries as a new chapter in the history of art. The Quarterly Review writer, reacting viscerally to an object that refuses to obey reigning doctrines of sculpture in such matters as scale, finish, subject, and composition, exemplifies a position of ambivalence toward the Assyrian works. The writer is caught in the binary evaluation of the objects, between a tantalizingly aesthetic and a dutifully antiquarian appraisal of the works. Yet this is already a position of far more aesthetic sympathy to Assyria than that of Rawlinson or of others even more closely associated with the British Museum. The immense popularity of the Assyrian works (and the insistence of the museum's parliamentary overseers) kept them on public display, ultimately in new galleries designed especially for them.6' Even so, a number of the museum's own trustees were downright hostile to the works. One trustee deemed them "a parcel of rubbish" belonging "at the bottom of the sea."''62 The testimony of Sir Richard Westmacott, Sr., elaborates on the position. A professor of sculpture at the British Royal Academy since 1827, Westmacott had served for decades as the "sculpture advisor" to the museum's trustees. He was present at official meetings and, as the minutes confirm, held considerable sway in decisions about sculptural display. Asked by a parliamentary commission in 1853 about the artistic worth of the Assyrian discoveries, Westmacott responded with an opinion even more aesthetically denigrat- ing than Rawlinson. Specifically distinguishing them from the Elgin Marbles, which are valuable for "their excellence as works of art," he stated: The Nineveh Marbles are very curious, and it is very desirable to possess them, but I look upon it that the value of the Nineveh Marbles will be the history that their inscriptions, if they ever are translated, will produce; because if we had one-tenth part of what we have of Nineveh art it would be quite enough as specimens of the arts of the Chaldeans, for it is very bad art.... The less people as artists, look at objects of that kind, the better.63 Westmacott's unbridled disapproval, however, was counter- balanced by an enormous outpouring of unqualified aes- thetic approval for the artifacts. This was expressed on the part of the same popular audiences that thronged the British Museum (on the days they were allowed in) and purchased Layard's book in record number (especially the cheaper "popular edition"). As we have seen above with the Penny Magazine, these are the same audiences to whom the discover- ies first penetrated, in large part through the very language of aesthetic valuation. For instance, in the preface to one of the many cheap, anonymous books on the discoveries, the reception of La- yard's finds is described thus: "A city buried for more than twenty centuries offered its remains for comparison with the aspects of modern London or Paris; and the sculptured monuments of a bygone race rose up to offer a contrast with the works of modern art."64 Acceptance of Assyria as a contrast to modern art ultimately goes beyond the terms of contention above. Rather than merely arguing over whether Assyrian art is comparable to the Greek, it now can be put to the same use for which the Greek was invoked in the nineteenth century: as a model for evaluating contemporary work, precisely the kind of looking at Assyria explicitly proscribed by Westmacott. Similarly, one finds significant acknowledgment of Assyria in the central organ of middle-class artistic discourse in England, the Art-Journal. Art-Journal carried a number of pieces on the Assyrian discoveries, such as an elaborately illustrated article in 1850 stating that "the beauty of execution in each of these sculptures so strongly speak of their [the Assyrians'] acquirements also in the arts of peace."65 The accepted aesthetic achievement of the objects now allows for the superimposition of other values onto the Assyrians. For the first time, the process is not defined by external, textual sources. The image of Assyria offered by Art-Journalis not that of the barbarism attributed to it by others, but rather one of cultivation and refinement. The most significant trace of Art-Journal's approval of Assyrian art came three years later, at about the same time the British Museum opened its Nineveh Gallery. The journal associates its own interest not only with Layard's campaign, but also with a central earlier crusader for a change in aesthetic canons. ... it is a singular proof of the increased and increasing interest in all things appertaining to ancient Art, that Mr. Bonomi's Nineveh and Its Palaces, has also achieved a second edition, notwithstanding the deserved popularity of "La- yard's Nineveh." When we remember the fight poor</page><page sequence="11">346 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 Haydon had for the Elgin Marbles, we cannot but congratu- late ourselves on our "progress."66 The fight for the legitimation of the Elgin Marbles, in the early nineteenth century, had lasted nearly two decades. It involved the most authoritative figures of English artistic taste and undermined the dominant sense of classicism embodied, most of all, by Sir Richard Payne Knight.67 Despite their ultimate acceptance, Benjamin Robert Haydon, the indefati- gable promoter of the Elgin works, committed suicide, penniless, in 1846, while Knight's influence rapidly faded after the affair. Art-Journal's parallel between the reception of the Elgin Marbles and that of the Assyrian artifacts posits an inevitable struggle over the acceptance of a heterodox form of artistic production. In light of the continued aesthetic resistance to the works by figures such as Rawlinson, Westmacott, and the British Museum trustees, "our progress" for Art-Journal is not that of society as a whole but of the unique portion of the English art audience occupied by the backers of the aesthetic worth of Assyria, that is, the lower- and middle-class audiences of journals from the Penny Magazine to the illustrated London News and Art-Journal itself. Notably, representatives of both groups can invoke the Elgin Marbles for their competing ideals. In short, England's Assyrian archaeology as a whole had a variety of supporters. While some opinions about the objects were widely shared, the particular question of the aesthetic value of the objects split the public into opposing camps. Assyria's backers ultimately won the conflict in almost every particular. But what is crucial here is not merely the outcome of the situation but the way it forced a widespread debate that juxtaposed Assyria and the demands of art. Only by setting the terms of debate in this way could Assyria win aesthetic validation, as in the extraordinary words of praise for Assyrian artifacts as works of art we have noted above. Here, too, the contrast with France could not be greater. No debate compa- rable to the one in England took place in France. Contrasting opinions about Assyria appeared rarely to confront each other. The French (middle- and lower-class) social groups that might have supported the idea of Assyrian artifacts as works of art were marginalized from the discoveries, and the circulation of Botta's work constrained.68 By the early 1850s, then, France and England had acquired and placed on display roughly comparable collections of Assyrian artifacts. As we have seen, the two countries pre- sented considerably different milieus of reception. Moreover, the subsequent archaeological fortunes of the two countries diverged, much to England's advantage. While the French excavation had been halted in the later 1840s, Layard re- turned to Mesopotamia in 1849 for a remarkable campaign that finally succeeded in unearthing ancient Nineveh itself, within the very mound first examined, and then abandoned, by Botta. In 1853, after the fall of the Second Republic, Mohl finally persuaded the succeeding government of the Second Empire to reopen excavation. Victor Place was sent by the government to continue the work of Botta at Khorsabad. His tenure is most notable for the disastrous loss, through a transport mishap on the Tigris, of a huge cache of Assyrian antiquities entrusted to his care. In what Mohl lamented as "an irreparable loss," Place's campaign inadvertently depos- ited on the river's bottom the contents of more than 120 cases of objects from Khorsabad (excavated by both him and Botta), as well as a large array of objects from Layard's excavation at Nineveh, which Place had been allowed to select for acquisition by the Louvre.69 Subsequent salvage attempts met with only limited success. In France, then, Assyrian archaeology was both beneficiary and victim of its close political ties. The reproduction and circulation of Assyrian artifacts was constrained by the domi- nant structure of archaeological sponsorship, largely directed by the small group of scholarly and political figures authoriz- ing the effort. The essential French monument to Botta's discovery, Monument de Ninive, was both extraordinarily lavish and extraordinarily rare, effectively withheld from audiences beyond those of its narrow patronage group. Further, later excavations were hampered by the turbulent history of governmental sponsorship, as well as embarrassing mishaps. The reception of Assyrian archaeology in England was far more diffuse. Information on the discoveries circulated far and wide in the England, and in a variety of forms. This was aided particularly by the aestheticization of the objects pro- moted by Layard. Though appealing to many, it also provoked from some an opposing response. The objects were conceived within a bifurcated opposition as either aesthetically based works of art or as antiquarian artifacts. This aestheticization was crucial for the wide social circulation of the artifacts, for while antiquarian evaluation required a certain level of education and erudition, the aesthetic approach to the artifacts could be more widely shared throughout the social spectrum. At the same time, the aesthetic offered a frame- work of evaluation more specific and engaged with individual objects than a purely nationalistic (or religious) approach. Constructing and Controlling Assyrian Imagery in the Later Nineteenth Century As we have seen, many of the same assumptions about ancient Assyria were active in France and England in the period before the excavations, even though expressed in different ways. The image of the fall of Nineveh served audiences in both countries as a sort of projection of various cultural identities and fascinations. In the period immediately after the discoveries, the two countries also acted in common, if, again, not in concord. They had clearly rivaled each other in the archaeology of the region (albeit with different degrees of success). The very different structures for archaeological reception in the two countries-circulating the finds to different audiences, through different media, and differing notably on the aesthetic value of the objects-work to further uncouple the representation of Assyria in the two countries. As the fortunes of France and England in Mesopotamian archaeology came to diverge, so did their images of the Assyrian past. Art and archaeology, past and present, conspire to underline a last notable bifurcation that has been at work throughout: France versus England. To assess this contrast, we turn now to a few key representa- tions of Assyria in France and England in the decades after the discoveries. These are not "pure" attempts to emulate the formal qualities of Assyrian art. In both countries, such</page><page sequence="12">INVENTING ASSYRIA 347 decontextualized emulation dates from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, well after Assyria's initial reception.70 By contrast, the range of Assyrian representations in the period closer to its initial display reflects the heteroge- neous and discontinuous moment in which Assyrian antiqui- ties appeared on the European horizon. Even though Lon- don and Paris both displayed considerable collections of relatively similar ancient Assyrian objects, the initial circula- tion of the discoveries fostered a vast, hybrid, and even contradictory array of representations and references.7' Rather than finding the image of Assyria focused on a newly promi- nent visual repertory, we find instead the very contrary, as the variation of representations among different milieus (which we have called representational "mobility") is now consider- ably greater than before. First, there is the question of continuity with the images created by Martin and Delacroix before the discoveries. Neither artist produced anything directly related to the newly visible Assyrian art. Martin died in 1854, one year after the British Museum formally completed its Assyrian galleries. Delacroix lived considerably longer, and even remarked on the extraordinary treatment of animals in Assyrian works.72 Yet he never revised the imagery of The Death of Sardanapalus or otherwise directly used the visual evidence of Assyria. The most telling evidence of Delacroix's relation to actual Assyrian art is a brief notation in his journal from 1858 making clear that it is not Delacroix himself but rather a relative who was "quite struck" with Assyrian art.73 Delacroix's stance toward Assyria exemplifies the nature of its artistic reception in midcentury France and follows the same pattern as the passage from L'Illustration. Assyria is tacitly acknowledged, but it is also withheld from concerted artistic consideration. This process, strictly controlling and even manufacturing Assyria to the requirements of the audience, accounts for the best-known and longest-lived visual reference to Assyria in nineteenth-century France, the "Assyrian" profile. The pose in profile, with a thick beard jutting directly downward from the chin, was claimed perhaps most famously by Gustave Courbet, as in his description of himself at the center of his 1855 Painter's Studio as "myself painting showing the Assyrian profile of my head."74 Many of Courbet's paintings of the 1850s show him from a similar angle (Fig. 4). Contemporary caricatures also delighted in exaggerating this feature.75 Much of Assyrian art consists of profile reliefs, and protruding beards are a common characteristic (Figs. 3, 9, 11). These contemporary allusions, however, made no at- tempt to emulate the specific knotting and shaping of Assyrian beards, and Courbet's facial features are not directly comparable to the stylized Assyrian features.76 Courbet's "Assyrian" profile, that is, does not indicate a deep interest in Assyrian art. It would hardly be identifiable as Assyrian on its own. Rather, Assyria offers an occasion for the artist's self-assertion. Courbet almost flaunts his lack of concern with the specifics of ancient art, in a manner consistent with his subsumption of all past art to his contempo- rary concerns.77 Courbet's "Assyrian" profile is a casual, even whimsical gesture of self-fashioning, barely acknowledging the actuality ii t:.$t F "- ;Z '~:- ~CI I 1 19 j. .- i~ 4 Gustave Courbet, The Meeting, 1854. Montpellier, Mus~e Fabre (photo: Giraudon/Art Resource, New York) of Assyrian art. Yet its offhandedness, its actual neutralization of the particularity of Assyrian art, should be taken seriously as a means of popularizing Assyria. The Assyrian beard achieved a currency of its own in French visual culture, covering over much of the inherited image of ancient Assyria. Thus, Celestin Nanteuil's poster for the 1867 opera Sardana- pale by Henri Becque and Victorin Joncieres (Figs. 5, 6) revisited Delacroix's subject without making the slightest use of the repertory of Assyrian objects now available in the Louvre. The world of Sardanapalus was recreated instead with specifically Egyptian features, such as curved architraves, swelling "lotus" capitals, and even hieroglyphics (in the lower left corner). The cache of pots before the king are, like his costume, of classical form. Most prominent among them is a Greek amphora. The king's conspicuous "Assyrian" beard sanctions this heterogeneous assembly. The coining of a certain facial feature as Assyrian stands, then, as a substitute for Assyrian art itself. Thus, in the theoretical terms discussed above, exoticism does not merely convey information but actually constructs its subject, produc- ing an Assyria that is more assimilable to established norms than the actual works. The "Assyrian" beard is the very emblem of this process of assimilating, denaturing, and ultimately constructing Assyria: a hybrid, second-order visual creation. Finally, counterbalancing an invented Assyrian feature that had achieved considerable currency, the look of actual Assyrian artifacts was strictly controlled, even erased from artistic contexts in which they had clearly been noted. For instance, in one of Edgar Degas's notebooks from around 1860 are detailed drawings of a number of Near Eastern antiquities, including a portion of an Assyrian relief.78 They form part of the context of his painting of Semiramis Construct- ing a City (Fig. 7). It has been plausibly suggested that the painting was partly inspired by an 1860 production of Rossi- ni's opera Semiramide, which utilized elaborately researched costumes and decor based on the Assyrian discoveries.79</page><page sequence="13">348 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 THIiTRE LYRIQUE IMPfRIAL OPARA EN TROIS ACTES &amp; CINQ TABLEAUX.

Semiramis, the legendary builder of Babylon, and her party are dressed in neo-classic belted gowns, while the city surveyed by the queen is designed entirely of Greco-Roman architecture. Only the shaped hair of Semiramis and perhaps the chariot just slightly visible at the right edge bear even a faint resemblance to features that can be found anywhere on Assyrian reliefs.80 7 Edgar Degas, Semiramis Constructing a City, ca. 1860-62. Paris, Mus'e d'Orsay (photo: Giraudon/Art Resource, New York) Like Nanteuil's poster, Degas's work largely (though not quite completely) excludes Mesopotamian sources from a Mesopo- tamian subject. The examples of Courbet and Degas testify to a fragmenta- tion and marginalization of Assyria in the realist mode that dominated French art of the time of the discoveries. The pattern is only slightly different in the proto-Symbolist work of their contemporary Gustave Moreau. A considerable portion of Moreau's library was devoted to "exotic" arts, while the majority of his paintings depict subjects derived from biblical and classical themes.81 This might seem a set of interests more amenable to Assyria than the contemporary ones favored by Courbet and Degas. Further, Moreau's penchant for covering his canvases with sgraffitolike ornamentation is visually compa- rable to the dense ornamentation and use of cuneiform texts in Assyrian artifacts. Moreau devoted part of a sketchbook from the 1860s to Assyrian works at the Louvre, and he clearly knew of the discoveries through printed sources as well.82 Yet none of his finished paintings directly employs Assyrian subjects or mo- tifs. Perhaps the closest is a full-scale study for The Suitors (Fig. 8), in which, at the far right, an Assyrian figure in a commonly employed gesture of salute is lightly sketched in among the otherwise classically garbed figures seeking the hand of Penelope.83 Clearly identifiable by the horned crown over the head, position of the extended arm, and protruding bracelet (cf. Fig. 9), this same figure is absent from the finished work, which is completely classical in conception. In Moreau's work, too, then, Assyria is a very faint visual trace, a source largely excluded. More generally, the seeming solidarity of such different artists as Courbet, Degas, and Moreau in eliding Assyrian references is testimony to the continuing deferral and submersion of Assyria throughout contemporary French art. To look for Assyrian imagery in France is, quite literally, to search for glaring absences as well as almost ghostly presences. The nature of Assyrian representation here is, in part, a legacy of the centralized pattern through which Assyrian artifacts were promulgated in France. As we have seen, Assyria's French publicists were beholden to a small circle, and publications were directed to this privileged group. Furthermore, while the question of the aesthetic value of the artifacts was raised, it was still largely subordinated to histori-</page><page sequence="14">INVENTING ASSYRIA 349 8 Gustave Moreau, Study for The Suitors (Les pritendants), ca. 1862. Paris, Mus6e Gustave Moreau (photo: Bulloz) cal and antiquarian modes of inquiry. Finally, the complexi- ties and misfortunes of French archaeology contribute also to the low standing of the artifacts. In all, it would seem that the effect of the unprecedented initial discovery and later display and circulation of Assyrian art in France was, paradoxically, iiti iN :N: ' t i4' is -)Y .. ..ti 9 Winged deity facing right and saluting, holding a bunch of pomegranates, Assyrian, from Nimrud, 9th century B.C.E. London, British Museum, Western Asiatic Antiquities, 118876 (photo: copyright ? The British Museum) virtually to erase its presence from contemporary artistic representation. The image of ancient Assyria in English art in the decades after the discoveries contrasts enormously with that which we have seen in France. It engages the visual specificity of ancient Assyrian work, rather than largely withholding it, as in the French examples. Paradoxically, the discoveries seem almost to mark an end to the French interest in Assyria, as Dela- croix's reaction might suggest. By contrast, the English treatment of Assyria extends the concerns we have found in the pre-discovery imagery of Assyria in both countries. A perfect example is Ford Madox Brown's Dream ofSardanapalus (Fig. 10)84 Although Sardanapalus is presented in an "Assyr- ian" profile, it is now, unlike in Nanteuil's conception, among the least of a range of Assyrian signifiers within the image. In fact, most of the details of setting and costume in the work come directly and specifically from Assyrian reliefs. Two Assyrian winged animals stand by the sides of the doorway (cf. Fig. 3), while the frieze behind the king is filled with figures derived from Assyrian reliefs, including, most notably, the winged, bird-headed genie to the right of the bull. This figure is an Assyrian apkallu, a variant of the same figure utilized above by Moreau (though reversed and substituting, as common in Assyrian art, the bird head for that of a man).85 Brown, unlike Moreau, presents the image in its entirety, including wings, drapery, and implements (here pine cone and pail). The more functional features of the scene are equally beholden to Assyrian imagery. Sardanapalus reclines on a couch similar in shape and detailing to that on which the king lies in a famous entertainment scene among the Assyrian finds (Fig. 11). His earring and armlet derive from features shown on the reliefs (cf. Fig. 9). Even the crown that tops the armor he has set aside is that specifically reserved for the king.86 Brown's conception, in short, uses a plethora of visual details from Assyrian artifacts to realize what seems to be an authentic Assyrian setting. However, the image is actually no less composite, no less the result of a discontinuous array of</page><page sequence="15">350 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 :" 7/-: ,.-?. . -:~~~.- .... ... -,- ,, +,. &lt;' ii~-I:: Y-l?r' i ........ &gt;I?; ?~*?~'??! ~:Y :! r: ?2 10 Ford Madox Brown, The Dream of Sardanapalus, 1871.

The Assyrian discoveries, that is, do not lead to a truer or more exact conception of Assyria. Rather, they work to transform the range of terms through which ancient Assyria is construed, opening up new fictive possibilities for Assyrian subjects. In Brown's image, along with the greater dependence on the now unimpeachable sources in Assyrian art, we find a tiled, or even parquet floor, a</page><page sequence="16">INVENTING ASSYRIA 351 ??i-z !13;- _7/ '7 ?r 12 Edwin Long, Babylonian Marriage Market, 1875. Surrey, Royal Holloway and Bedford New College (photo: Bridgeman Art Library Int'l Ltd., London/New York) purely nineteenth-century anachronism. Even more, this same shift toward the authority of ancient visual remains sanctions a turn toward a subject now derived specifically from Byron, dropping the precedent of ancient literary sources on which the earlier works of Martin and Delacroix depended. Brown's image depicts a specific moment (the opening of act 4, scene 1) of Byron's Sardanapalus. It reflects the quiet, sensitive tone of the play, far from the spectacular, apocalyptic conceptions of the earlier works. Sardanapalus, in Byron's story, has returned wounded from previously leading his army. His left forearm is bandaged. His Greek slave Myrhha (an invention of the Hellenophile Byron) comforts the king as he lies hallucinating, in a dream that prophesies the end of the Assyrian kingdom. In Brown's Sardanapalus, then, the antiquity of the visual details provides an authoritative anchor in tradition that allows the artist to jettison the (previously indispensable) authority associated with ancient texts. In addition, the considerable attention paid to Assyrian art may well be related to the more positive conception of the king. Art-Journal remarked, as we have seen, that Assyrian art seemed to speak well of the civilized achievement of the Assyrians. In the same way, Brown's work envisions in detail both an Assyrian ambience and a soulful, sensitive leader. Though Sardanapa- lus is still doomed, it is now an occasion for pathos rather than judgmental condescension. Even the viewpoint has changed from the earlier conceptions of Martin and Delacroix, as the viewer is now on the same level as the king, sharing this tender, vulnerable moment. Brown's work pays great attention to the material specifics of Assyrian art. It is the culmination of the historicist tendency toward material validation in the mid-nineteenth-century conception of Assyria. It also marks a change in the very image of Assyria, coinciding with the addition of Assyrian artifactual sources, but also allowing a shift from the more ostensibly authoritative classical and biblical sources of Martin and Delacroix to that of Byron. A final work from slightly later, Edwin Long's then-famous Babylonian Marriage Market (Fig. 12), situates Assyrian imagery within a more diverse audience and reflects further on larger themes of exoticist representation. Long's work not only adheres to the general mode of conception of Martin and Delacroix, it also inherits the thematization of vision and the gendered imaginary that we found in the earlier works. Yet even as it seeks to take up the previous gender dynamic, the changed nature of both subject and audience unsettles its unquestioned binarism of male versus female roles. Long's subject derives from Herodotus. The painting was exhibited at the British Royal Academy with a lengthy quota- tion from a nineteenth-century popularization of the work. The custom ascribed to the Babylonians, which Herodotus deemed their wisest, was that once a year all eligible females were gathered together in their villages for men who wished to marry. The most beautiful among them was presented first, for purchase by the highest bidder, followed by the others, in decreasing order of beauty and selling for decreasing amounts. Finally, the deformed,and ugly were presented, and the money of those who purchased the more beautiful women went to subsidize the takers of the uglier women, so that "the plainest was got rid of to some cynical worthy, who placidly preferred lucre to looks. By transferring to the scale of the ill-favoured the prices paid for the fair, beauty was made to</page><page sequence="17">352 ART BULLETIN JUNE 1998 VOLUME LXXX NUMBER 2 endow ugliness, and the rich man's taste was the poor man's gain." 87 Long's subject is the transformation of woman into cur- rency. The characteristic feature of this system is the hierarchi- cal ranking and measurement of the women/commodities. Long's primary innovation lay in setting the scene in a place devoted solely to such ranking, one without a trace of the functional setting of the village mentioned by Herodotus. Instead, Long set the work in an auction house. Some of the male viewers hold boxes of coins and other valuable objects, while a balance stands in front of the auctioneer's podium. The woven beards, bracelets, earrings, wrapped garments, headwear, and similar features pictured on Assyrian reliefs are transferred to the crowd of male viewers in the picture. The crowd is leavened with some black Africans, a few Italic figures, and a white-bearded, Rembrandtesque Jew. The women, too, notably in their hairstyles, rounded heads, and similarly wrapped garments, are modeled after Assyrian sources. The setting is just as consciously historicized, as most of the wall and floor decorations, the pattern on the curtain, and even the relief on the auctioneer's podium derive from Assyrian reliefs and other decorations.88 The reception of Long's work, painted in 1875, suggests that Assyria by this time has become assimilated by Western viewers. On the details of setting, the Art-Journal stated, "We accept the archaeological details as presented to us, and without any hesitancy, fix our attention on the rare disposi- tion of figures."'89 Long's archaeological details are com- pletely credible to Art-Journal and also quite unremarkable, merely a prologue to the examination of its figures. Yetjust as the look of ancient Assyria becomes commonplace to the English viewer, it highlights larger themes at work throughout the nineteenth-century representation of Assyria. Notably, unlike Brown, but like John Martin before him, Long con- flates Assyria and Babylonia. Even more, the primary subject of the work is the display of women, and of men gazing at them with an eye toward possession. This reiterates the gendered power structure of Delacroix's work. The composi- tion again flatters the viewer at the expense of male figures in the scene. At the far right, a man looks over a fence at the private zone of the women waiting to be displayed. His relation to these women mirrors that of the painting's viewer to the woman being displayed on the stage. In both cases, the male viewer sees the woman from behind and must guess at her appear- ance. The face of the man at right and, even more, his gesture of raised hands (derived from Renaissance painting) testify to his being moved by the sight he sees.90 This man's gesture also flatters the external viewer, who can see from his privileged perspective (and knowledge of the ritual) that this man appears to have fallen in love with one of the least beautiful of the women. Thus, while internal and external viewing are related, the external, contemporary Western viewer is again established as superior to the internal, historical one. Long's work, then, refers to the same themes of the power of men over women and of the contemporary West over the Middle East that were evident in Delacroix's work. Yet the passage of more than forty years from Delacroix's time to Long's, and from France to England, also brought it to a realm where these assumptions were no longer universal. Two comments on Long's work suggest that the work also invited a critique, both of its gender assumptions and of its claim to historical veracity. A reviewer in Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine, among the older and more refined of middle-class periodicals, wrote of the piece: [The woman on display] is evidently the first and finest piece of goods in the collection, and the expression of the crowd of faces all fixed upon her is wonderfully fine and full of variety. The lips parted with that smile of mingled vanity and admiration with which men (out of marriage markets) so often regard the women exposed to their gaze, the gleam of the sensual eye, appear in most of the gazers; but some are pitiful and half tender, with a touch of compassion in them. And if the spectator gazes around him after he has looked at the picture, he will see another picture scarcely less attractive in the curious glances of the living faces that crowd about.91 The woman is a "piece of goods" who offers the spectator a chance to be amused by the varieties of male reactions. This comment would seem to sustain the superiority of external viewer to internal viewer. Yet, the implied unity of actual and painted viewers is now sundered by acknowledging the explicit gendering of spectatorship. The Blackwood's reviewer continues: We should not wonder if the young women, flower of English youth, who gather round with a curiosity not unmixed with personal feelings, found something like a revelation in the picture. One sees them glance at each other with a half smile, half blush, sometimes with subdued awe or indignation. "Is that how they think of us, these men, though they dare not look it?" the girls ask them- selves. The dissimilar composition of audiences, between nine- teenth-century England and that attributed to ancient Meso- potamia, presents a confrontation of genders in the work's actual audience that would be inadmissible in the ideal realm of the audience in the picture. The acts of viewing thematized in the work, that is, are thus again illuminated as specifically masculine, voyeuristic activities. Such a conception of viewing is distinctly unlike the actual viewing context of the work. The work's ideal male viewer is confronted by an actual female viewer, and thus the perfect binarism within the painting of men viewing and women being viewed is confronted and undermined. A premise of the Blackwood's review is that the painting addresses contemporary England at least as much as ancient Babylonia. But the specific manner in which the structure of gender relations calls into question the painting's claim to historical authenticity was directly considered only by John Ruskin. Ruskin's erudite notice of the work was virtually alone in distinguishing between Assyrian and Babylonian artifacts. Although realizing the work's anachronisms he called it "A painting of great merit, and well deserving purchase by the Anthropological Society.""92 But this was not because the work</page><page sequence="18">INVENTING ASSYRIA 353 was deemed to represent the ethnographic custom of a pristine past. As a piece of anthropology, [Long's work] is the natural and very wonderful product of a century occupied in carnal and mechanical science. In the total paralysis of conception-without attempt to disguise the palsy--as to the existence of any higher element in a woman's mind than vanity and spite, or in a man's than avarice and animal passion, it is also a specific piece of the natural history of our own century; but only a partial one, either of it or of the Assyrian.... 93 To the contrary, Ruskin saw the work as embodying the prejudices of the contemporary viewer. Far from purely exhibiting an extrinsic viewpoint or unusual custom, then, Long's work (for both writers) was a contemporary statement, as much about present as past. At the same time, through this way of approaching the image of the ancient world, the conventional dominance of the contemporary masculine, Western viewer is again put in doubt. Thus, the image of Assyria clearly brings together past and present concerns, while also presenting an occasion for both Ruskin and the Blackwood's reviewer to question conventional gender distinc- tions. When looked at over the span of almost fifty years from Delacroix to Long, then, Assyrian archaeology did not simply work to provide more authentic envisioning of preexisting subjects, such as the death of Sardanapalus. To the contrary, art and archaeology functioned as two parts of a larger system of cultural circulation, in a continual process of reinventing ancient Assyria. Although images might have been con- structed in accord with archaeological and antiquarian knowl- edge, they also responded to the varying needs and capabili- ties of artists and audiences. The works of Brown and Long continue the sort of exoticist mobility with which Martin and Delacroix worked. But the combination of invented and "authentic" elements on which mobility depends permits a widening of the conception of Assyria. Brown's use of Assyrian archaeological details allows a turn from dependence on authoritative ancient textual sources to the near-contemporary Byron. As much as the sources for the subject widened, so, too, did audience assumptions, as the play of exoticist representation became more familiar. In the reception of Long's work we even find an explicit critique of the assumptions of power and gender that had dominated the conception of Assyria and the larger exoticist imagination throughout the earlier nineteenth century. While even the traditional conception of Assyria was thus transformed, the juxtaposition of France and England is key to a much more radical and varied range of reception between the two countries. The varying fortunes of Assyria in France and England disrupted the prediscovery situation, in which both countries shared the same mode of conceiving the subject. The works of Courbet, Degas, and Moreau (and even Delacroix's lack of interest in the discoveries) suggest a distinctly different atmosphere in France from that of En- gland, one that forecloses on, governs, and ultimately subordi- nates the aesthetic challenge of ancient Assyrian art. Tracking the archaeological history and aesthetic debate over Assyria, as we have done, illuminates the fundamental differences between the milieus of reception in France and England. Not only their pragmatic archaeological histories, but also their methods of disseminating information differed sharply. The subsequent French submersion of Assyrian imagery we have noted is remarkably concordant with the troubled history of French Mesopotamian archaeology as well as the constrained circulation of the discoveries to the public. By contrast, in England, with its vigorous public debate on Assyria and its art, the lionizing of Layard as discoverer, as well as numerous publications on the works, an audience was fostered that was prepared to respond to the specific, detailed Assyrian images of artists such as Brown and Long. For all the amassing of textual and visual evidence of Assyria, for all the energy expended in the antiquarian project of fixing the Assyrian past, the image of Assyria that arose was thus localized and hybridized as it circulated among Western audiences. Courbet's "Assyrian" beard is no less the fruit of this process of circulation than Brown's painstaking Assyrian decor. Ultimately, then, like many another exoticist subject, Assyria served not only as an object in its own right but also as a distant and distorted mirror in which France and England asserted their respective identities. On these grounds, a most telling observation of the early reception of ancient Assyrian objects is this line from a review of an English production of Byron's Sardanapalus, which used elaborate sets and costumes almost directly copied from Layard's reliefs. "That one performance gave us a better insight into the manners and habits of the Assyrians, than a whole lifetime has enabled us to acquire of the French."94 Frederick N. Bohrer has published widely on the history and theory of exoticism. He is completing a manuscript on the rediscovery and reception of ancient Assyria as well as beginning research on photographic imagery of the Middle East in the nineteenth century [Department of Art, Hood College, Frederick, Md. 21701].

The gardens where Sardanapa- lus revelled are wasted and desolate, the sounds of soft and luxurious music that once floated on the soft Assyrian breezes have yielded to the silence of devastation or decay";James Phillips Fletcher, Notes from Nineveh, and Travels in Mesopotamia, Assyria and Syria, 2 vols.

However, the particular winged lion illustrated here comes directly from Layard's excava- tion at the time and, at the very least, exemplifies the features intended.

Though anomalous among the French popular press, it may also suggest a certain submerged interest in the discoveries among popular constituencies. 69. Mohl, vol. 2, 36.

This tendency can be found in a still obscured portion of European modernist "Primitivism," including works by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Pablo Picasso, and Jacob Epstein.

Francis Barker, Peter Hulme, and Margeret Iversen, Essex Sympo- sia, Literature, Politics, Theory (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1994), 89-114. The range of images in this section might be considered as well to exemplify the "semiotic play" of reception, as described by Norman Bryson, "Art in Context," in Studies in Historical Change, ed. Ralph Cohen (Charlottesville, Va.: University Press of Virginia, 1992), 18-42. This, in turn, tends to corroborate the structural connection of exoticism and reception suggested by Leduc-Adine (as in n. 6). 72.

The sketchbook, dating from 1850 to 1869, is now in the collection of the Mus6e Gustave Moreau, Paris. There is also in the museum a notebook recording notable articles in Le Magasin Pittoresque, including two described by the artist as "bas-relief d6couvert a Ninive-Sculpture assyrienne" (1844) and "poids assyriennes" (1861). I am grateful to Mme Genevieve Lacambre for her continued assistance with this material. 83. This gesture can be found in a variety of Assyrian deity figures conserved in London, Paris, and elsewhere, such as the series from Room H of the Northwest Palace at Nimrud; Gadd, 236. 84. On the work and its context, see Ford Madox Hueffer [Ford Maddox Ford], Ford Madox Brown (London: Longmans, Green, 1986), 262, 272; Rowland Elzea, The Samuel and Mary R. Bancroft Jr &amp; Related Pre-Raphaelite Collections (Wilmington, Del.: Delaware Art Museum, 1978), 30-31. 85. A prototype is London, British Museum, Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities (hereafter BM, WAA) 98060. All of the Assyrian artifacts referred to here were collected by and displayed at the museum by the early 1850s. 86. See, for instance BM, WAA 124533 or 124557. 87. George C. Swayne, The History of Herodotus (Edinburgh: Blackwood, 1870), 36-37, paraphrasing Herodotus, 1.196. On Long's treatment of the subject, see Richard Jenkyns, Dignity and Decadence: Victorian Art and the Classical Inheritance (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1992), 119-24. 88. The curtain design at right is derived from an Assyrian floor threshold, such as BM, WAA 118910. The battle scene at far left is closely derived from BM, WAA 124536. The central frieze is closely derived from BM, WAA 118914, 118916. The disposition of the frieze-its coloration and use of the "sacred tree" motif to take up the wall's edges-suggest the influence of not only the artifacts in the museum but also Layard's reconstruction of an Assyrian throne room. Layard's design is reproduced in Esin Atil, Charles Newton, and Sarah Searight, Voyages and Visions: Nineteenth-Century European Images of the Middle East from the Victoria and Albert Museum (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, 1995), 78-79. 89.
