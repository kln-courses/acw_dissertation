<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.-THE ORIGIN OF THE SUBLIME. THERE is perhaps no feeliing in our nature more strangely com- pounded and more indefinably singular than that which we call the Sense of the Sublime. It is not exactly pleasurable, and yet it certainlly is niot painful. It has many elements in common with fear, many in common with reverence, and not a few in commnon with beauty. Yet it stands apart from all three, in an isolated corner of its own, and it has seldom received any fitting attention at the hands of scientific psychologyists. Most writers have classed it ro-ughly amongst the aesthetic feelings, but hardly, I think, with sufficient reason. Perhaps an analysis of its origin in the hunman mind will lead us to a truer notion of its nature and functions. If we go back to the very first germ from which the feeling of the Sublirne has been developed, we miust seek it lower down in the animal scale than the limits of humanity itself. The desire to produce an efect is one which man shares with maniy of the higher vertebrates. If we watch monkeys at play, we shall notice bow keenly they enjoy the power of startling or surprising their fellows. They love to pull one another's ears unexpectedly, to jump on a sudden from a height, or to make a smaller com- rade squeak aloud with pain. Dogs are equally anxious to obtain notice by jumnping over a stick, or exhibiting their skill in tricks. Many animals evidently delight in the loudness of their own roar or cry, wlhile still more strut proudly about in the tritumph of victory over their rivals. In many ways birds and mammals show us that they understand and appreciate the simpler pleasures of power and display. And as all power is an index of success in the struggle for life, this feeling is clearly conducive to the preservation of inidividuals or races in whom it exists, and consequently is continually strengthened under the selective action of survival of the fittest. When we come to the youniger members of our own species, we find similar feelings more developed, and more highly evolved. Babies in arms will crow with delight at knocking down a tea-cup, or making a loud noise. Schoolboys enjoy no- thing so much as a crash or bang-they are perfectly happy with an ounce of gunpowder or half-a-dozen squibs; and they delight in rolling big stones down hillsides, or driving horses anid cows full-pelt across a meadow. An exhibition of what they can do is their greatest pleasure: and this feeling, againi, is clearly one which contributes greatly to the success in life of those races which possess it. Hence arise two or three important impulses, wlhich pave the way for the sense of Sublimity. One very conspicuous method</page><page sequence="2">The Origin of the Sublime. 325 of proving one's prowess is by the performance of deeds requiring strenogth and skill. Every savage is proud of his warlike achievements, and is urged on by the admiration of his fellows. This adiniration itself has a double origin: it is partly selfisb, depending, upon the fact that a strong and brave man is a shield and buckler to every member of his tribe; and it is partly sym- pathetic, in an incipient degree, depending upon the conscious- iness of self-approval for similar qualities in one's own case. The earliest embryo of the Sublime is doubtless to be sought in this savage appreciation for the brave warrior of one's tribe. The man whose strong arm comes in to save one from the club of one's foe, deserves lasting gratitude and admiration. The hero who leads the attack against tne enemy, and successfully carries away cattle and wives, is an object of respectful awe. The Hector who alone wards off from his Troy a myriad of Myrmidons, demands the obeisance of cowards and women. Probably this is the only form of the Sublime wlhich is reached by the lowest types of humanity. We can hardly imagine the early races, who are still represented by Veddahs and Andam- anese, admiring the vault of heaven or the foaming cataract, the lofty mountain or the angry sea. Yet even in this primitive germ, we see the main traits which mark the feeling of Sublimity in its highest flights. It is a mixture of love anid dread. The savage knows the value to himself and his fellows of the strong warrior, and treats him accordingly with gen-uine respect; but he knows also how danigerous is his anger, and regards him con- sequently with awe and reverence. His feeling is very different from that with which he thiliks of his enemy-there, hatred and fear are unqualified by that respect which is beootten from the hope of aid; but it is also very different from that with which a civilised man thinks of his friend-pure affection, unmixed with fear. Perhaps the nearest enmotion within the railge of our own experience is, that which a child entertains towards his parents. In a crowd of strangers he clings to them as knowin friends, but he never forgets that they are also the dispensers of punishment, and keepers of the whip. There are few societies of mien in which the strong,est has not come in time to occupy the post of chief or king. As this posi- tion strengthens aild hardens down by custom, the feeling of awe and respect deepens. The absolute monarch, with power of life and death over every subject, is a natural object of dread. Yet he is also the leader of the hoot, the dispenser of favours, the divider of the spoil. If implicit obedience to his will is de- manded of all, yet that obedience, when willilngly granted, generally secures benefits for the subject. And as the tribe profits by its discipline and its military organisation, there will</page><page sequence="3">326 The Origin of the Sublirne. naturally grow up in all successful predatory tribes, an intense feeling of loyalty and reverence for the king-a loyalty cul- minating in that of the Fijians, who consider it an honour to become food for their chiefs. The second stage in the evolution of the Sublime is found in the venerationi for the savage king. But when the king dies, he does not utterly pass away.* A new king rises in his place, who was once his subject, and who, dreadinc him during his lifetime, now still more dreads and reverences his surviving ghost or double. The people too, who fear the new king, must still more fear the ghost which the king hiinself is afraid to displease. Yet their feeling is not wholly oiie of terror. The ghosts of enemies are indeed objects of un- mitigated dread; but the king of their own people, though terrible as all ghosts are, nevertheless aids them in the fight, and drives away the evil spirits of the hostile tribe. He can be propitiated with gifts, and he is still the powerful if somewhat uncertain friend of bis former subjects. As in life he was harsh yet invalu- able, so in the spirit-world he is easily offended yet placable to his tribesmen, and their steadfast ally against all enemies, earthly or ghostly. And inasmuch as this feeling, too-by binding together the tribe, and adding a supernatural element of subor- dination to the natural one of kingship-increases its organisa- tion, and strengthens its hands against aggressors, it, like the former ones, is perpetually developed and deepeined through the natural selection of those societies which most display it. The third step in the evolution of the Sublime is the mixed feeling of fear and hope with whiclh savages regard the earliest god, the ghost of their deified chieftain. By this time the sense of Sublimity has reached a very con- siderable distinctness. It is true that it still confines itself to human or quasi-human attributes, and that the infinitely wider Sublimity of nature is as yet all but unperceived. We shall see hereafter how that conception is graclually developed through the anthropomorphic mode of envisaging the inanimate world which springs fron the extension of the ghost-theory. For the present we may confine our attention to the expression of Sub- limity at this, its third, stage. The tales which savages tell, and the songs which they silng around their evening fire, all bear upon the mighty deeds of kings, heroes, and gods-the three being almost indistinguishable in the earliest types. The South Pacific myths which Mr. Gill has collected and published, or the New' Zealand stories narrated by Sir George Grey, show us a conception of the Sublime which never rises above this simple -I had better here acknowledge, once for all, my obligations to Mr. Herbert Spencer's Principles of Sociology, on which I base the whole of my theory, so far as regards the comparative science of religions.</page><page sequence="4">IThe Origin of the Sublime. 327 level. These races have no great architectural piles which might aid themn in extending the feeling to inanimate masses, nor have tlhey progressed to the anthropomiorphic conception of natural forces, which en-ables other stocks to embrace the thunder and the storm, the seething ocean and the driving cloud, within the limits of their sense of Sublimity. Among all the embryonic literature of tribes in the stage of theology here contemplated which has yet been rendered accessible to European readers, I can find scarcely a touch that reveals any-admiration or awe for the might of the external universe. The strength of men, the terrible deeds of gods, the ghosts of men, are held up to the wonder and veneration of every hearer; but not a trace can be found of any reverential feeling for the grandeur and majesty of the mighty world around them.* A little higher up in the scale of development, however, the spiritual agency widens its sphere of operations. Without inquiring into the vexed question of how the ghost or deity comes to be identified with the moving power of inanimate nature, it will be sufficient for our present purpose if we recog- nise the fact that he does come to be so identified. The howling of the wind is the voice of a god; the rumbling of the thunder is his angry roar; the tempest on the oceaii is stirred up by his trident; he dwells in the flaming volcano, and his blast drives aloft the molten lava; he lies under the roots of mountains, and when he turns upon his side an earthquake rends their bases. If the gods were only this, however, they would -be merely an object of unmixed dread and horror; the feeling of Sublimity would never reach any higher development, and hatred or abject fear would take its place. But the gods have also their kindly side as before. It is they who send the rain and the breeze; it is they who grant plentiful harvests and abundant flocks; it is they who are the dispensers and distributors of all good things. The Roman Ceres fills the garners, and Dionysus swells the grapes of Hellas. Some of thern are identified with the greater natural agents whose beneficence is obvious and undoubted. One is the warm sun who shines on the fields and gives the pleasant light of day. Another is the bright and changeful moon who comes to the aid of man in' the darkness of nlight. A third is the clear open sky above, whence fall the quickening showers that nourish the crops. Every day yields abundant proof alike of their might and their good-will. Zeus may indeed collect the angry thunder clouds and blast the mountain-top with his fiery dart; but he oftener smiles benignly o01 his children, with that * Even where a tinge of the Sublime in nature is cast upon the story by a passing expression, we must guard against the possible danger of reading our own ideas into the simnple and positive language of the savage.</page><page sequence="5">328 The Origin of the Sublinme. serene brow which well befits the father of gods and men. Awe for their power mingles strangely with hope of their favour in the minds of their votaries. Mighty and strong and irresistible they are; yet they may be turned aside by prayer and propi- tiated by the savour of perfect lambs and bulls. How enornmous is the amplification which this anthropomor- phic envisagement of nature gives to the sphere of the Sublime we can see at a glance. The savage who has olnly just progressed beyond the first stage of the ghost-theory can hardly stand awe- struck before the majesty of nature. The thunder is doubtless very terrible to him, and the cold wind very unpleasant; while the warmth of the sun and the coolness of the breeze are agree- able and grateful to his senses: but as he does not connect them with any underlying power, they seem to him no more than so much dead fact, without complex emotional implications. As soon, however, as he learns to see in these manifestations the acts of some occult and invisible being, he cannot fail to compa.re their vastness and might with the smallness and weakness of his own powers. His idea may still be a childish and an unworthy one; he may still fancy that these unseem- spirits can be deceived and cajoled by the most transparent trickery; he may still hope to outwit them through craft or to frighten them with threats; but nevertheless he must recognise them as some- tbing vastly greater than mere human kings; he must take the decisive step which definitely marks off the god from the simple ghost. If we examine such a monument of the differentiated tlheolo- gical stag(e as we possess in the Homeric ballads, we shall see how deep a hold the sense of Sublimity has there obtained over the awakening intelligence of men, no longer barbaric, but far on their way to an advanced culture. But we shall also find these four first developments of the feeling-awe towards the hero, towards the king, towards the gods, towards the divine motive power in nature-filling the whole field to the exclusion of all those more complex and elevated factors which enter into the composition of the Sublimne in its highest forms. The wrath of Achilles, the waving plumes of Hector; the strong warriors of yore, amolngst whom Nestor fought; the heroes of elder days, Bellerophon, Tydeus, and the might of Heracles; wide-ruling Agamemnon, Priam, and Memnon, and all the Zeus-nurtured kings; the gods of Olymnpusa, of Hades, and of Ocean; Ares stalking before the hosts of men; Phcebus Apollo, angry in heart; Zeus assailed by the Titans who pile Pelion upon Ossa, or calling to his aid Briareus of the hundred hands;-in all these we see the feeling of awe and reverence for the strong man, the chief, the kinig, the deified hero, and the god whose human</page><page sequence="6">The Origin of the Sublime. 329 origin is forgotten in the dimness of past centuries. But if we look for any sense of admiration towards the great mioving powers of nature, we shall find it only under an anthropomorphic guise. Poseidon the earth-shaker rouses the white billows on the limitless deep: Apollo the far-darter drives his golden car through the divine a~ther: Zeus the loud-thunderer collects the black clouds and darts his angry bolts upon the perjurer's head. Yet amid all this wealth of anthropinistic sublimity-a wealth which perhaps no other literature can equal in its own way-- we miss any feeling for the sublime of nature in repose, any sense of grandeur in sea and sky and mountain, apart from the great shadowy beings who dwelt within them and gave life and motion to their mighty masses. And here again we see how intimate is the connexion between the feeling of the Sublime and the sentiment of suLb- ordination. The Homeric Achean is after his kind a law-loving man. He feels and recognises the necessity for union under a lawful chief. The rule of many is not good; let one aloile be king whom Zeus appoints. The king it is who guards the divine laws, derived from Zeus. It is folly to disobey the word of one who reigns over many islands and all Argos; for a king is much the stronger when he is wroth with a man of low degree. Yet the king's sternness does not disguise the fact of his usefulness both as warrior and as leader. Nor is his power entirely his own; he holds it on sufferance of Zeus,who will not allowhis divine laws to be lightly set aside. The gods themselves, too, are often harsh, yet they are kindly in their softer moods. -Angry Phcebus sends a pestilence, but he may be propitiated with hecatombs, and with a lustration whose sanitary effects must obviously be tlseful in -checking the arrows of the god. Zeus watches over the faith of treaties, and punishes the perjured head. Artemis avenges the loss of chastity. Demeter puits forth the green corn; Athene gives the olive; Dionysus sheds his wine into the vats. With the might of Ares men conquer in battle; by the counsel of Pallas they speak words of wisdom in the Agora. In one way or another every one of these beliefs gives some point of superiority to its votaries, by hedging round with sanctity an ethical observance, by promoting a useful social custom, or by giving confidence in war or debate to the warrior anid the orator. And with every such advance the feeling of Sublimity must grow more and "more definite, more and more structurally innate, in the minds of each new generation amongst the suc- cessful races. of mankind. If we step aside for a moment from our main line of exposi- tion to compare the monarchical Achman ballads with the later democratic Athenian dramia, we shall see how the change of 24</page><page sequence="7">330 The Origin of the Sublime. political circumstances influenced the sense of the Subliime. The Attic tragedians show uis a measured and self-respecting religious feeling, which pays all due honour to the gods. But the reverence of the king has passed away. We do indeed see traces of the legendary monarchical feeling, introduced' as his- torical colouring; but the democratic sympathies of the writers crop out at every turn. Agamemnon treading on the carpet, Ajax mad, Xerxes and Atossa infatuate and defeated, the ragged heroes of Euripides, the ribald irreverence of Aristophanes, are a few indications of the change. The heroes speak in noble and austere language, but it is the language of moral suasion, of deliberate couunsel, of thoughtful resolve. When Ajax lies un- buried, when Philoctetes is cajoled into the power of his enemy, when Antigone is dragged away to slaughter, when Polyxena is torn from her mother's arins, all the sympathies of the audience are with the oppressed against the tyrants. But when we turn to divine matters, the spirit of subordination is once more apparent. Prometheus welters on the snowy rocks of Cauicasus, a rebel against the irresistible mligbt of Zeus; Orestes'is driven madly over the stage by the awful figures of the Eumenides, until he clears himself of blood-guiltiness before the solemn tribunal of Phcebus; Pentheus is torn piecemeal by the Bacchants for daring to interdict the holy orgies of Dionysus. Even if we compare the tragedians among themselves we see somewhat the same differences in the earlier and the later. 2Eschylus the religious conservative is full of awe for gods and heroes, of respect for timne-honoured institutions, of modified veneration for the great monarchs of early legend; but Euripides the philosophical radical loves to exhibit the folly and the passions of kings, and has little reverence even for the great gods themselves. Occasionally, too, in the works of the glorious Athenian period we find tinges of a higher and grander Sublime; as in that marvellous lyrical spectacle, the Persa, where the poet impresses upon his audience a full appreciation of that noble sight, a free people banded together under their own chosen leaders, fighting for liberty and culture against the aggressive hordes of a barbaric despot. "We too have a master," says the free Hellene to the Oriental tyrant, "whom we serve far better than your slaves serve youl, and his name is Law ". Buit we must return from this digression to follow out the development of the Sublime in its regular historical course. There is another element of sublimity which has arisen earlier, perhaps, than those already considered, but which introduces a somiiewhat different original factor, and so has been postponed to the present place. I mean the element of material bigness in human or natural products. To put the differenice briefly we</page><page sequence="8">lihe Origin of the Stblime. 331 may say that the elements we have so far examined depenid for their impression on force; while the present one depends on size. Originally, we saw, the notion of the Sublime took its be- ginniing from the effects which a man could produce, and- especially from the strength or agility of the strongest. Thence it progressed to the power of kings, of ghosts,.of gods, and of natural agents anthropomorphically conceived. In all these cases it is evident that the main idea is one of superior force, exercised in a manner not wholly adverse, or rather partially beneficent,. to the individual, the tribe, and the race of men generally. But how did the sense of Sublimity come to entwine itself around the physically big, viewed in repose ? I think this elenrent of the Sublime is itself ultimately resolvable into the same admiration for superior force, always, of course, in alliance with the subordinative sentiment, governmental or religious. Let us see how. Among the commonest instances of that love for the produc- tion of an effect, which we took as the psychological starting- point of our inquiry, is the erection of a conspicuous mass of matter. Children make sand-heaps- and big sn-ow-balls, or build card-houses and castles of bricks. Savages pile barrows over their dead, raise hugle cairns on mountain tops, and lift massive stones into cromleclis, avenues, and monolithic circles. In all these acts, they can gratify the natural love of effect, the desire to do something which shall produce a striking and noticeable change in the surrounding scene. Especially do piimitive men enjoy the power which they thus possess.of giving a perman- ence to the form which they impress on large masses of matter. But when we- reach the developed kingly stage, we find this impulse taking a fresh start in the direction of vicarious effort. A great king shows his power by the number and strength of his subjects, the implicit obedience of his vast armies, the hundreds of captured cities, the thousands of slaughtered or mutilated foes; but he can also show it by building for himself or his ancestors, palaces, temples, tombs, and colossal statues. Hence we find that almost all great despots erect huge piles of architecture to demonstrate their might, and strike wholesome awe into the breasts of their subjects. Whether we examine the Pyramids, the Sphinx, the Memnon, and the temples of Karnac, or turn to the winged bulls and sculptured courtyards of Ninevelh, we shall notice alike that architecture is devoted to the aggrandisement of the king and the due subordination of the subject. The lesson preached in every bas-relief and every painting is the same: obey the' great king who is the taker of cities and the ruler of peoples. If from the palaces and tombs</page><page sequence="9">332 The Origint of the Sublime. we tuLrn to the temples, we find the religious tie added to the governmental. A huge hall, with row after row of mighty granite columns, and a colossal figure of the tutelary god, strikes deep reverence into the mind of the beholder. In whatever part of the world we look, we see the same story repeated. From the caves and topes of India to the pyramids and temples of Mexico, we see architecture everywhere allied with despotism and the religious subordination. Even in republican com- nunities, like Athens and Rome, the sacred use survives, and the home of Athene on the Acropolis or of Jupiter on the Capitol peers down with lordly disdain upon the lesser roofs of men and citizens. Indeed, it would be interesting, did space permit, to point out how very close and almost invariable is the connexion here hinted. It would be necessary then to show how imperial Rome, with her Domus Aurea, her Colosseum, her Baths, her Triumphal Arches, her Basilicas, followed in the wake of ancient Memphis and Babylon: how, in later times, the Medici adorned Florence, and then Romne: how Louis XIV. had his Versailles, and Napoleon III. his new Paris. We might pass over to the nmosques with which the Mughal dynasty adorned the plain of Delhi, and to the palaces and pagodas of Pekin. And we might glance at our own European Cathedrals, and trace the changed aspect of governmental machinery in the Parliament Houses of Westminster, the Capitol at Washington, or the disproportionate and costly mass of Gothic edifices which the Canadians are rais- ing for ptLblic offices at Ottawa. But such a survey would detain us too long, and the instances thus rapidly cited will serve to suggest to the mind of the reader how large a share, in the development of the political and ecclesiastical restraining system, has been borne by mere i-lechanical vastness in the machinery employed. Now, with the growth of such massive and laborious piles must come the appreciation and admiration for their size and structure. The boy when he has rolled his big snowball, the savage when he has lifted on end his monstrous monolith, the despot when he has heaped his colossal pyramid, each stands by to admire his work, and feels his heart swell with pride at the effect of his personal or vicarious labours. The boy's comrades, the savage's fellows, will join him in a sympathetic appreciation; while the subjects of our primitive despot will see another mark of that god-like power and infinite superiority which is daily iinpressed upon them in ten thousand ways. Whoever looks upon their piles, even to this day, cannot fail to think upon the thousands of workmen, the years of toil, employed in raising those solid blocks of granite, one above another, to so lofty a</page><page sequence="10">The Origin of the Subline. 333 height. And on those who lived amongst them, and saw with their own eyes, year after year, the Great Pyramrid rising slowly towards the sky, some vague feeling of awe for the visible symbol of majesty could not fail to be imnpressed. We can hardly doubt, I think, that the admiration for what is vast in the outer world must be ultimately traced back to the admiration for what is vast in the works of man: just as we have already seen that the forces of inaniniate nature only excited wonder and rever- ence when they came to be figured in terms of human force. Children admire a big building or statue long before they have developed the feeling of admiration for a mountain or a water- fall. It is hardly necessary to add that the skill, the mechanical power, and the organisation, evolved during the gradual growth of such works, themselves form useful aids to the race in the struggle with other races, and ultimately beget that higher civilisation which enables its possessors to compete on terms of immense superiority with every inferior type of humanity. As yet, lhowever, we have not seen how the sublimity of nature-in-repose first comes to be appreciated. In modern times, the most obvious instances of the Sublime which strike us are those of ice-clad mountains, tottering crags, deep ravines, cataracts like Niagara, the broad expanse of ocealn, anid the starry vault of heaven. Yet not one of these seems to produce much effect upon men up to a very high pitch of culture. The Greeks and Ptomans, even, were little impressed by them. The Alps they regarded mainly in the utilitarian light of so much useless ice and snow, placed on the highroad to Gaul and Ger- nmany. Mountains are to themi nothing miore than nlere barriers; their epithets are mostly shadeless, barren, inhospitable, chillyy. The ancient cultivated nations admired much the picturesque in scenery or in nman's handiwork, and the grand in human nature or divine beings: but they cared little for mere vastness in the external world. There is a certain mode of reviewing our own feelings on the subject which, I think, will show us the reason for this difference. Very few people feel any thrill of Sublimity as they look over a very wide and flat plain, a level expanse of sand, or a calrn and unbroken stretch of sea. But if in the midst of the plain a few bold rocks rise tlreateningly on high, their admiration is at once arrested. The position of the rocks inevitably suggests some vague notion that they were put there; and in this sug- gestion we get a point of comparison with human force: while the flat plain seems, so to speak, as though it were naturally there, and does not at all vividly suggest the notion of any human or supernatural agency at work. So, too, with the sea:</page><page sequence="11">334 TWe Origin of tae Subltime. while it remainis calm, we see in it only a beautiful field of soft blue colour; but when a temupest raises its waves, we picture it to ourselves as angry, as violent, bas a living thing; we compare its roar, its sweep, its tremendous energy, with the puniness of our own arms, of our drifting ships, and of our beaten break- waters. Again, in proportion as the mass of a mountain is great, and its sides abrupt, we think more and more of the gigantic power which would be requiired to pile it to such a height. But we do not see the power at work. If, however, we watch a volcano in eruption, the feeling, of Sublimity is enormously increased. In fact, wherever there is an actual display of energy, the sense of Sublimity is most strongly aroused: where the energy is only suggested, the emotion is comparatively vague: and where energy does not enter at all into the idea, Sublimity is not suggested bv the mere bigness of an external object. We require some hint which will assimilate the.object to a human product before we can find in it a germ of the Sublime. Now to all modern minds the notioni of the world as created, as made by God, has been familiar from childhood. The idea of force exerted in -raising every mountain, in planing every crag, in scoopinlg out every ravine, is immediately suggested to our minds together with the objects themselves. I do not say that we all accept the direct theory of creation in its crude form: but even those of us who have substituted the scientific concep- tion of natural causes for the older belief in personal divine intervention, still carry aboout with us predispositions of thought which were contracted under the earlier creed. Indeed, we see the energies involved even more clearly than do those persons who still envisage them in the vague metaphors of religion. When we stand in the riven gorge of Pfaffers or the water-worn ravine of tlhe Niagara, we can realise the endless working, of that slowly encroaching power with far greater vividness than the unscientific thinker can give to his verbal picture of rocks rent asunder by the finger of God. Yet the old school and the new school of mioderns are alike in this, that they see indications of moving energy, natural or superniatuLral, in every conspicuouLs mass of the material universe. The ancient cultivated races, on the other hand, seldom or never inquired how the universe came to be there or assumed its existing form; they accepted it simply as given, or if they made any conjecture on the sub- ject, they concluded that it had been there as it was, from eternity.* We of to-day, whether we see in a mounitain a piece * Such exceptional cases as that of Lucretius-an embryo Laplace or Darwin-will be noticed hereafter. For the present it will be sufficient to observe that such persons had a feeling of the Sublime infinitely raised above the asverage level of their time and race.</page><page sequence="12">The Origin of the Sutblime. 335 of God's own handiwork or a product of enormous eriiptive forces, at any rate think of it as raised: the Greek or the Roman simply thought of it as lying. And if we go back to the origin of this feeling on our part, I believe we must seek it in the Hebrew cosmogony. For when we search for any sense of Sub- limity in the old world at all comparable to that which is common in the new, we find it only in the wonderful prelude of Genesis, the mystical visions of Ezekiel, and the thunderinc periods of Job. The mere savage never asks who made the world. If you put the question to him, he thinks it childish and absurd:-the world was always there of course. Even to the Greek and thle Roman, the gods were a part of the world:-they sprang from it, they moved in it, but they did not make it. The uniiverse was as objective to Zeus as to his worshipper: it lay quite outside the sphere of divinity. The gods wrought on it as inan wrought on it: it was their material, and they gave it sometimes a new shape. But that short declaration, " In the beginning God created tlhe heaven and the earth," colntained the germ of a whole new development for the sense of the Sublime. Even Longinus noticed the wonderful majesty of the primaeval fiat- "Let there be light, and-there was light". Indeed, monotheism in every way offers immense opportunities for the evolution of the Sublime. By substituting for the many opposingr and mutually-limiting gods of the polytheist a single supremne anid infinite God, it concentrates on one point all the veneratioln and love of his worshippers. And whenl tlhis God comes to be con- ceived as the maker and architect of the universe, the sense of his irresistible might becomes overwhelming. Nature is thouglht of as his outer manifestation. The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth His handiwork. They are the work of His fingers: the moon and the stars le has ordained. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof, the world and they that dwell therein. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the host of thein by the breath of H-is mouth. When He speaks out of the whirlwind to Job, man learns his own weakness and folly, by the measure of his maker. " Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest ? " Behemoth and Leviathan testify to His might. The mountains skip before Him like a calf; He rideth upon the heavens, and the earth is His footstool, ,the hill of God is as the hill of Bashan, an high hill as the hill of Bashan. There is more true sublimity in half a dozen Psalms or four chapters of Job than in all the odes of Pindar and all the tragedies of 2Eschylus. But here again, as in every other case, we find an under-</page><page sequence="13">336 The Origin of the Suiblime. current of love and trustfulness, half hidden beneath the sense of reverence. The God who created heaven and earth is emphatically the God of Israel. He has made an everlasting covenant with His chosen people. He is not a man that He should lie, and He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity. But His mercy eindureth forever; He hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted, neither hath He hid His face from him. "The Lord is my shepherd," the poet can sing; "I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside the still waters." "I, even I," says Jehovah, by the mouth of His prophet, " am He that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of man which shall be made as grass, and forgettest the Lord thy maker, that hath stretched forth the heavens, and laid the fouldatiolns of the earth ?" In every line of the Hebrew poetry and every page of the Hebrew chronicles we see this overwhelming conception of the miglht and majesty, the loving care and protection, of the God of Israel. It is nieedless to point out how this feeling, too, was an element of success in the battle of races. The monotheistic creeds have spread irresistibly from Hindustan to California, and have proved by incontestable results their ability to hold their own in conflict with every inferior faith. Nowhere can the heathen oppose a solid front to the acggressive hosts of Christia,nitv and Islam. The modern world, nursed upon the grand utterances of the Hebrew bards, has imbibed the sense of the Sublime almost with its mother's milk-nay, one may even say, before it. For every one of us is now born into the world with a hereditary capacity for that mingled feeling of awe and security which constitutes the essence of the Subliine. The feeling is not entirely pleasurable; it is partly ethical and subordinative. It passes very readily into fear and distress, as in the case of a thunderstorm, a tempest at sea, or a volcanic eruption. Even such a terrific gorge as the Via Mala, or such a cataract as the St. Lawreince rapids, is rather frightenilng than impressive. Cliffs aind crags give us a more agreeable sensation viewed from a slight distance thain when we stand just beneath their threaten- ing mass. But they all yield us a certain sympathetic pleasure as evidelnces of power, natural or divine. The stock reflection of moralists on all such subjects is the puniness of man and the power of his great Creator. I find in a little guide-book to Niagara eight pieces of verse by different hands, every one of which turns as a pivot upon the self-same idea. The religion which for twenty centuries has tauglht us to see everywhere some token of the greatness and goodness of God, is now</page><page sequence="14">The Origin of the Sublime. 337 engrained in our nervous systems, and produces its effects un- consciously in our everyday life. A last question remains. Will the sense of Sublimity decrease as the notion of fixed law supersedes that of capricious divine interposition? There are good reasons for thinking that it will not. The progress of scientific thought has opened before us a field for the exercise of our faculty of S-Lblimity almost as new and extensive as that which was laid open by the monotheistic creed and the doctrine of creation. The microscope has revealed to us the marvellous intricacy of coral and shell and zoophyte: it has shown us the feathery scales on the butterfly's wing, and the countless facets of the insect's eye: it has made visible the minute structure of every animal tissue, and the complicated architecture of every vegetable fibre. In each of these the man of science saw fresh proofs of design and power, which have slowly led the* way towards a new conception of Sublimity. Meanwhile, the telescope enlarged our view frorn the solid firmiament of the Psalmists to the boundless realnms of space which the eye of 'a Newton or a Herschel sees peopled with innuinerable suns, and countless systems of eddying worlds. Geology taught us to look back, not over a few thousand measurable years, but over immeasurable aeons of historic time, stretching back into a vast and unknown past. And now we have learned to picture our earth as a speck of matter floating, in an ocean of space, and our era as a second of time marked on the infinite dial of eternity. Through a boundless void which our miles cannot measure, through an endless period which our centuries cannot gauge, we see the workings of that infinite, absolute, unknowable Entity, which manifests itself eternally in the heavens and the earth and the soul of man. We spell out its operations in the fiery sea from which sun and planet drifted towards their appointed centres; in the slow growth of living forms upon their cooling crust; in the myriads of beautiful beings which people a drop of water; in the noble aspirations and earnest moral yearnings of the human race. Surely our idea of the ultimate Being has not been lowered or degraded by this vast extension of our knowledge and our vision! But perhaps it may be objected that we have here only the awful side of tlhe Sublime and not its comforting or protecting aspect. Perhaps to a certain extent this is true: and indeed, every step in the evolution of the feeling has made the centre round which it gathered more awful because more absolutely and indefinitely powerful. But at the same time, each step has brought with it a limitationi in the capriciousness, the favourit- ism, the uncertain demeanour of the being-man, king, ghost,</page><page sequence="15">338 lthe Origin of the Sablim&amp;e. or god-towards whom the sentiment was principally directed. And in this last substitution of a Power workin(r tlhrouch knowable laws, for a Power working by inscrutable volitions, we get a further advance in the same direction. There is an element of pleasure in the certainty and security of Law. No comet now brings war or pestilence; no portents and prodigies disturb our peace and demand propitiatory sacrifices. We rest on the safe ground of known causes: and when danger threatens we can meet it by our own manful ondeavours, not by slavish submission. Pestilence can be warded off by sanitary care; famine by wise precaution; wa'r by prudent and moral self- restraint. The great Power which underlies the universe will not repent of acts done or wreak capricious vengeance on offenders. We can go on fearlessly upon our path, obedient to the great natural laws without us, and the ethical priniciple which is developing within us; and we need tremble at no bugrbear of superstition, as we pursue our onward and upward course, towards fuller knowledge and purer life. And here we may turn back to notice how the truest concep- tion of the Sublime has always been that of those meni who were most in advance of their age. The poet who knew that the best of omens was to fight for one's fatherland-the prophet who knew that God would have righteousness and not burnt-offerings -these are they who feel the deepest thrill of the Sublime, and speak it out clearest for our hearing to this day. And among the solid matter-of-fact Roman people, the solitary singer whose words still ring in our ears for their sublimity was the one who knew the reasons of things and trampled under foot fears and iniexorable doom and greedy Acheron's din. He it was, who, like some Laplace born out of due season, beheld the atoms drifting through the mighty void, and discerned with his eyes tlle beginning of things. And vaguely as he saw these truths, yet he felt among the blind and ignoranit multitude like one who sitting safe upon some jutting, peak beholds the tempest-driven mariners out at sea tossed by the waves and vainly stretching, their hands to their painted gods. As Lucretius felt the beauty and sublimity of the Graeco-Roman myths not less- but mnore than other men, so may we well suspect that science will give us in the future not a lower but a higher appreciation of the Sublime, throughout that immeasurable universe which she is daily opening miore and more clearly to our dazzled and as- tonished gaze. Yet from beginning to end we see that the sense of Sublimity is everywhere allied with the regulative principle of subordina- tion. The laws of nature rule us now as firmly and inexorably as the savaoe chieftain rules his naked subjects. And by</page><page sequence="16">Intlition and Inference. 339 obeying and coiiforming to those laws we can secure Ourselves life and happiness; while by opposing and transgressing their teaching we have our punishment in death and misery. The true place- of the Subliine in the scheme of our faculties is next to the regulative anid directive ethical feelings: though it forms a connecting link between these anld the cesthetic sense in its proper acceptation.
