Pinder HI Received: 7 April 2006 /Accepted: 29 April 2008 / Published online: 17 May 2008 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008 Abstract Montane conifers of western North America commonly colonize mineral surfaces result- ing from landslides, lahars, mudflows, and rock avalanches. This colonization can include shade- tolerant conifers that may eventually dominate the forest in a pattern termed "direct" succession. Documenting examples of this long-term succes- sional process are useful for identifying alternative successional trajectories and indicating potential controlling mechanisms for subsequent experimental analysis. This study (1) analyzes the 1992 status of the conifer colonization on the coarse-textured surface of a 1650 AD rock avalanche in northern California and (2) measures individual growth and survivorship in permanent plots between 1992 and 2003. Increment cores of large trees indicated initial conifer colonization before 1700 AD with contin- uous subsequent colonization. Mean conifer density in 1992 was 725 (SD = 747) ha"1 with densities increasing with decreasing rock sizes. Densities were not correlated with distances to possible seed sources. Median heights were &lt;1 m, and the mean proportional height growth rate for healthy individuals was 0.0166 year"1. The mortality rate for individuals &gt;0.1-m tall was &lt;0.007 year"1. The conifers were more numerous than shrubs, and there was little apparent evidence of facilitation or inhibition of conifers. The species assemblage is mostly (89%) Abies concolor, Pinus montícola, and Pinus ponderosa individuals dispersed across an elevation range of 1870-2040 m a. s. 1. This is an atypical species mix for these elevations in this location, and this mix is not readily predicted from species properties such as seed mass, seed flight distance, or drought tolerance. Keywords Debris flow • Abies concolor • Conifer succession • Pinus montícola • Pinus ponderosa • Survivorship Introduction The development of montane coniferous forests in western North America is a process of prolonged development punctuated by catastrophic disturbance episodes such as fires (Martin 1982; Gruell 1983; Turner et al. 1997) and various forms of debris flows (Beardsley and Cannon 1930; Frenzen and Franklin 1985; Parker and Bendix 1996).

These disturbances can revert forested areas to newly created mineral surfaces where the rate and composition of subsequent forest development is affected by the physical and chemical characteristics of the exposed surfaces (e.g., Sakai and Ohsawa 1993; del Moral and Ellis 2004), proximity of seed sources (e.g., Halpern and Harmon 1983), and the invasion of herbaceous and shrub species (e.g., del Moral and Rozzell 2005). Especially slow rates of forest development may occur where surfaces are composed of continuous solid surfaces (Eggler 1941) or large, unweathered blocks (Lindsley, 1951). The extent and frequencies of these disturbances create less clear linkages between the biological characteristics of western conifers and their succes- sional relationships than occurs for species of less disturbed eastern forests (Turner 1985). Initial colo- nization of exposed mineral surfaces by montane conifers is common (Beardsley and Cannon 1930; Frenzen and Franklin 1985; Larsen and Bliss 1998; Dale and Adams 2003; Mong and Vetaas 2006), and these initial invaders often include the shade tolerant species that will later become the dominant tree vegetation (Turner 1985). This pattern of early invasion and subsequent dominance is termed direct succession (Whittaker and Levin 1977) or autosuc- cession (Muller-Dombois 1992), and differs from that for mineral surfaces in more diverse mesic forests where initial tree species on debris surfaces are replaced by later, more shade tolerant arrivals (Flaccus 1959; Sakai and Ohsawa 1993). Because the scales and complexities of these disturbances can interact with biotic factors such as proximity to seed sources to produce multiple trajec- tories of forest development (Fastie 1995; McCune and Allen 1985), documenting the process of forest development through either (1) historic reconstruction (e.g., Fastie 1995; Winter et al. 2002), (2) comparing similar sites of differing ages (Dickson and Crocker 1953; Drake and Mueller-Dombois 1993; Clarkson 1997), or (3) continued monitoring (e.g., Clarkson 1997; Dale and Adams 2003; del Moral et al. 2005) becomes important in projecting possible outcomes and suggesting potentially important factors whose effects can be more rigorously examined using experimental approaches. Such studies are especially important where (1) the date of the initiating event can be accurately established and (2) the site is less subject to anthropomorphic disturbance. The objectives of this study were: (1) to document the conifer colonization of a coarse-textured rock fall surface in Lassen Volcanic National Park in northern California; (2) to assess current rates of forest development by moni- toring survivorship and growth over an 11 -year interval; and (3) to examine the patterns of conifer establishment and development for evidence of the importance of common mechanisms of succession such as tolerance, facilitation, and inhibition (Connell and Slatyer 1977; Finegan 1984; Tilman 1985; Pickett et al. 1987). Clarkson (1990) and Walker and del Moral (2003) present reviews of the application of various models (sensu Connell and Slatyer 1977) and mechanisms (sensu Finegan 1984) of succession in the develop- ment of montane plant communities on volcanic terrains similar to that studied here, and Clarkson (1990) has also framed the development of vegetation on mineral surfaces in relation to Tilman' s (1985) resource ratio model of succession as a gradient of declining ratios of solar radiance to nutrient avail- ability. Applying these reviews to direct succession of conifers on mineral surfaces suggests several mechanisms that may be especially important in controlling conifer colonization of the rock-fall surface. These, listed in their possible order of declining importance, include: (1) active tolerance (sensu Pickett et al. 1987) of the physical and chemical environment of the coarse mineral surface; (2) potential facilitation of establishment and growth by nurse plants or nitrogen fixers (Walker and del Moral 2003); (3) tolerance (both active and passive sensu Pickett et al. 1987) of the presence of herba- ceous or shrub vegetation; and (4) potential inhibition of establishment or growth by existing nonconifer vegetation occupying space, preempting resources, or producing allelopathic chemicals. Although the demonstration and quantification of a particular mechanism may require experimentation and manip- ulation (Pickett et al. 1987; Clarkson 1990; Walker and del Moral 2003), ancillary data were collected in this study to suggest the possible importance of these mechanisms. These data included: (1) physical prop- erties of the rock fall surface; (2) conifer species properties related to dispersal, germination, and seedling survivorship; (3) the abundance and £} Springer</page><page sequence="3">Plant Ecol (2008) 199:281-294 283 distribution of shrub vegetation; (4) tree ring analyses of the timing of conifer species invasions; and (5) climate records. Methods Study site The rock-fall surface is located in Lassen Volcanic National Park (hereafter, LVNP; 40°30' N, 121 °30' W) in northern California (Fig. lb; Kane 1980). The park vegetation is primarily conifer forests interspersed with patches of shrubs and meadows (Parker 1991; Pinder et al. 1997). The climate is an upland, dry summer type with winter snows and frequent summer droughts (Parker 1991). The rock fall occurred on the northwest margin of recently formed volcanic domes, termed Chaos Crags (Kane 1980), when part of a dome collapsed in a rock avalanche that formed a 5-km long surface of broken boulders (Heath 1960; Crandall et al. 1974; Eppler etal. 1987). Heath (1960, 1967) identified three regions of the rock-fall surface, termed units I, II, and III (Fig. lc), and postulated their formation by separate avalanches. Subsequent studies (Crandall et al. 1974; Eppler et al. 1987) questioned the number and timings of avalanche events but agreed that unit III (hereafter termed the Jumbles) is the most recent surface and was formed in approximately 1650 AD. It extends for about 2 km with a maximum width of 1 km (Eppler et al. 1987). Its surface composition varies from sharp-edged, angular, dacite blocks &gt;0.5- m in diameter to debris &lt;0.1-m in diameter (Bulmer et al. 2005). There are also numerous, transverse, 10- m high compression ridges (Eppler et al. 1987). Although not as extensive as the disturbances at Mt. St. Helens, the Jumbles has a greater area and a coarser texture than most landslide type events (Table 2.1 in Walker and del Moral 2003). The Jumbles surface has been sparsely colonized (Fig. 2) by a mixture of mostly Abies and Pinus species, scattered shrubs, and occasional herbaceous species (Heath 1960, 1967). Ring counts of large trees suggested conifer establishment before 1700 AD (Heath 1958, 1959). Previous analyses of conifer colonization (Heath 1960, 1967) were designed to compare successional progress on units I, II, and III at Fig. 1 A sequence of maps and aerial photographs depicting: (a) the location of Lassen Peak and other Cascade Range volcanoes mentioned in the text within the northwestern US coastal states of California (CA), Oregon (OR) and Washing- ton (WA); (b) the location of Chaos Crags, the area of the Jumbles contained in the aerial photograph, and other features mentioned in the text within the 430-km2 Lassen Volcanic National Park; and (c) an aerial view of the upper part of the Jumbles showing units I, II, and III (after Eppler et al. 1987) and the location of the transects.

The view is toward the northwest. The left foreground contains a 0.70-m tall A. concolor. Although not apparent in the panchromatic version of this photograph, the tree is composed of several stems, and the largest of these has died so that its height declined from 1992 to 2003. The right foreground contains a fractured dacite block &gt;0.5-m in diameter elevations &lt;1900 m where these units co-occur and consequently did not include the upper half of the Jumbles with elevations up to 2040 m. Because these upper elevations had not been previously sampled, the current study was designed to sample the full elevation range of the Jumbles to ensure that data would be available to support subsequent studies on this well-dated and protected site. Plot establishment and characterization This study continues the documentation of this site begun by Heath (1958, 1959, 1960, 1967) and has been designed using permanent plots to facilitate future long-term analysis (Bakkeret al. 1996; Walker and del Moral 2003). Fifty-three 200-m2, circular, permanent plots were established along three parallel transects (Fig. lc) which began at the highest elevations and extended on a slight diagonal (azimuth = 315°) across the rock fall's 300° flow path. The diagonal avoids potential alignment along the longitudinal ridges and flow paths described by Crandall et al. (1974) and Bulmer et al. (2005). Plots occurred at 100-m intervals along transects separated by 100 m. Locations were determined using Global Position Systems (GPS; El- Rabbany 2002), and elevations were determined using transit and single-based barometric surveys (Davis et al. 1981). Distances from plots to closed-canopy forests were measured using GPS positions and the USGS Quarter Quadrangle for Manzanita Lake South- east. These forests were either at the edges of the rock avalanches or on unit II along its margin with unit III. These unit II forests were in place by 1941 (Fig. 2 in Heath 1967). Variations in plot topographies and surface com- position were summarized using scales of 1 through 5 designed to express increasingly mesic conditions. These scales were assigned from interpretations of photographs taken in 2003 from the plot center at angles of 45, 135, 225, and 315°. Topography was scaled as: 1 = on top of a transverse ridge; 2 = a southeastern aspect; 3 = flat; 4 = a northwestern aspect; and 5 = in a trough. This sequence was adapted from Parker's (1991) Topographic Relative Moisture Index. Surface compositions were scaled as: 1 = blocks &gt;0.5-m in diameter; 3 = blocks 0.2- 0.3 m in diameter; and 5 = stones and pebbles &lt;0.1- m in diameter. Values of 2 and 4 were assigned to intermediate conditions or mixtures. Surface evalua- tions from each photograph were averaged to produce a surface composition index (hereafter, SCI). The compilation of climate data Temperature and precipitation data collected since 1949 at a location 4 km west of the Jumbles (National Climatic Data Center Cooperative Station Number 045311; elevation = 1753 m a. s. 1.) were (1) arranged into years running from October 1 of the previous year to September 30 of the current year to comply with the growing season, (2) combined into fall (October through December), winter (January through March), spring (April through June), and summer (July through September) seasons, and (3) compiled into two intervals. The first interval extended from October 1949 through September 1992 and was used as a measure of general climatic conditions. The second interval extended from Octo- ber 1992 through September 2003 and was used to 4y Springer</page><page sequence="5">Plant Ecol (2008) 199:281-294 285 describe the specific climate conditions during the period when survivorship and growth were measured. Field sampling during 1992 Plots were sampled in 1992 for the presence of the species Abies concolor (Gordon &amp; Glend.) Lindley (botanical nomenclature of sampled species follows Hickman 1993), A. magnifica Andr. Murray, Pinus contorta ssp. murrayana (Grev. &amp; Balf.) Critcchf., P. jeffreyi Grev. &amp; Balf, P. lambertiana Douglas, P. montícola Douglas, P. ponderosa Laws, Pseud- otsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco, and Tsuga mertensiana (Bong) Carriere. Biological character- istics related to possible colonization success are listed in Table 1 for the Abies and Pinus species. Care was exercised in differentiating between sim- ilar species, but identifications for individuals &lt;0.1- m tall still contained uncertainties. Conifer positions were mapped as a bearing and distance from plot center. Heights &lt;7-m tall were measured to the nearest 0.01 m using stadia rods. Heights &gt;7 m were measured to the nearest 0.1 m using a Haga altimeter. Basal area for trees &gt;1.5-m tall was determined from two caliper measurements of diameter at breast height (hereafter, dbh) at 1.37 m above the tree base. Perennial shrubs were identi- fied, mapped, and their average crown diameter used to compute percent cover. Field sampling in 2003 Survivorship and growth of conifers were measured by resampling the plots in 2003. Individuals were: (1) relocated; (2) noted as alive, dead or missing, or showing recent damage or disease; and (3) measured for height. Damage or disease included: (1) death of the apical stem; (2) breakage of the apical stem; (3) chlorosis; and (4) breakage or bending of the trunk. Recruitment was not measured because of uncertain- ties concerning whether a potentially new individual in 2003 may have been a small individual who was overlooked in 1992. The uneven surface terrains at an individual's base and slow growth since 1992 caused errors in height measurements and resulted in some undamaged and disease-free individuals being shorter in 2003 than in 1992. Collection and analysis of increment cores Increment cores were extracted in 1992 or 1993 from trees with stem diameters &gt;80 mm and used to assess Table 1 Biological characteristics of Abies and Pinus species on the Jumbles related to their possible success in colonization Species Seed mass Relative rankings (g) - Drought Snow damage Seed flight Average seed Shade tolerance3 resistance3 distance3 production3 tolerance3 A. concolor 0.042b 2 2 3 2 6 A. magnifica 0.063b 14 ndc 1 5 P. contorta 0.004d 5 nd 5 5 2 P. jeffreyi 0.13d 7 2 2 5 nd P. lambertiana 0.22d 4 1 1 3 3 P. montícola 0.0 17d 3 3 nd 1 4 P. ponderosa 0.038d 6 1 4 4 1 Only those characteristics are presented where (1) there was information for a majority of the species or (2) there were meaningful differences among species.

Statistical analyses All statistical procedures were performed using the SAS Statistical Analysis System (Der and Everitt 2001). Transformations or nonparametric techniques were employed where appropriate. Because this study is limited to observations of an on-going process, the statistical analyses are used to infer potential rela- tionships that may warrant experimental analysis rather than to imply cause and effect. Results Considerable variation occurred among plots in elevations, distances to forest margins, topographies, and surface compositions. Elevations ranged from 1872 to 2040 m a. s. 1. with a median of 1912 m a. s. 1. Distances to forests ranged from 90 to 400 m with a median of 265 m. The transverse ridges caused most plots to have aspects that differed from the Jumble's northwestern slope. The percent of ridge crests, southeastern aspects, flat areas, northwestern aspects, and troughs were 10%, 13%, 27%, 46%, and 4%, respectively. The SCI ranged from 1 to 4.25 with a median of 2.5 and suggested that most blocks were between 0.25 and 0.5 m in diameter. This size is consistent with the 0.40-m diameter block size estimated by Bulmer et al. (2005). Elevation and SCI were negatively correlated (Spearman Rank Correlation; rs = -0.352; P &lt; 0.05; Conover 1999) and indicated a greater proportion of larger blocks near the source of the flow. Bulmer et al. (2005) attributed a similar correlation and attributed it to continuing breakage of blocks during the flow. Distances to forests were not correlated with eleva- tion, SCI, or topography (all rs with P &gt; 0.10). Climate conditions in the intervals 1950-1992 and 1992-2003 Temperatures and precipitations were mostly similar for the 1950-1992 and 1992-2003 intervals (Table 2) with the greatest difference being a 45% decline in mean summer precipitation in the latter interval. Five of the 1 1 summers in the later interval had precip- itations &lt;25 mm. Only 9 of 42 summers in the earlier interval had precipitation &lt;25 mm.

Their small size raised questions con- cerning species identifications and whether the same or a new individual was resampled in 2003. For these reasons, only those individuals &gt;0.1-m tall in 1992 have been included in the following analyses of densities and heights. The mean (¿Standard Deviation, hereafter SD) density of individuals &gt;0.1-m tall was 726 (±747) ha"1. Most (89%) of these were A. concolor, P. montícola, and P. ponderosa (Table 3). Fewer than 35 individuals of A. magnifica, P. jeffreyi, and P. lambertiana and &lt;3 individuals of P. contorta, P. menziesii, and T. mertensiana occurred in the plots. Plot densities were positively correlated with SCI (rs = 0.650; P &lt; 0.01) but not with eleva- tion (rs = -0.080; P &gt; 0.10), distance to forests (rs = 0.166; P &gt; 0.10), or topography (rs = -0.117; P&gt;0.10). Density increased by approxi- mately 400 ha"1 for every unit increase in SCI. The number of conifer species per plot ranged from 2 to 6 with a median of 3 and was correlated with SCI (rs = 0.603; P &lt; 0.01) but not elevation, topography, or the distance to forest. There was little evidence to indicate elevational zonation among A. concolor, P. montícola, and P. ponderosa. Their densities were positively corre- lated with SCI (all rs &gt; 0.45; all P &lt; 0.01) but not with elevation (all P &gt; 0.10), and they occurred with approximately equal frequencies in plots across the range of elevations. Most individuals were small (Table 4) with a mean (±SD) height of 2.00 (±0.90) m for individuals &gt;0.1-m tall. Only 12% of trees were &gt;5-m tall. Although the majority of trees &gt;5-m tall were A. concolor, P. montícola, and P. ponderosa, the median heights for these species were &lt;1.20 m and indicated a large proportion of small individuals. This contrasted with the size distributions for A. magnifica, P. jeffreyi and P. lambertiana whose populations tended to have fewer small individuals and larger mean and median heights. All the P. contorta, P. menziesii, and T. mertensiana were &lt;2-m tall. Basal area was measured for 214 trees that included 58 A. concolor, 9 A. magnifica, 24 P. jeffreyi, 15 P. lambertiana, 73 P. montícola, and Table 3 Total density and densities of abundant species on the Jumbles in 1992 Species Mean Median Standard deviation Minimum Maximum Frequency (%) A. concolor 290 200 309 0 1200 76 P. montícola 238 150 343 0 1850 83 P. ponderosa 120 50 210 0 1150 53 All species 726 550 747 0 2850 87 Densities are expressed as individuals per ha as estimated from fifty-three 200-m2 plots.

Because 12 plots did not have any trees or any trees &gt;1.5-m tall, the minimum basal areas for each species and the total of all species were 0 35 P. ponderosa. The mean (±SD) of plot basal area was 4.8 (±5.7) m2 ha"1 (Table 5), and plot basal area was only correlated with SCI (rs = 0.653; P &lt; 0.01). A total of 339 shrub individuals of 8 species occurred in 40 of 53 plots. These were mostly Holodiscus microphyllus Rydb. (73%) and Purshia tridentada (Pursh) DC (12%) which commonly occur on rocky slopes in LVNP (Nelson 1962). The median number per plot was 4, and the median percent cover was &lt;1% per plot. Shrub distribution across the Jumbles differed from that for conifers with densities and percent covers being positively correlated with elevation (all rs &gt; 0.33; all P &lt; 0.05) but not with SCI. No nitrogen-fixing shrub species occurred in the plots. Survivorship and growth in the interval from 1992 to 2003 Most of the &gt;0.1-m tall individuals survived the interval from 1992 to 2003. Only 7.3% died (Table 6) for an annual mortality rate of 0.0066 year"1 and a median life expectancy of &gt;100 years. The median height for those who died was 0.24 m, and mortality rates were significantly less for taller individuals (Logistic Regression Likelihood Ratio Test; X2 = 13.72; df = 1; P &lt; 0.01; Allison 1999). For each 0.1 m increase in height in 1992, the probability of surviving increased by a factor of 3.3%. Mortality was not related to SCI (x2 = 0.03; df = 1; P &gt; 0.10), elevation (%2 = 2.94; df = 1; P &gt; 0.05), or topogra- phy (x2 = 01.25; df = 5; P &gt; 0.10). The percent mortalities for A. concolor, P. montícola, and P. ponderosa (Table 6) did not differ significantly (X2 = 0.83; df = 2; P &gt; 0.10). The mortality rate for individuals &lt;0.1-m tall, which may be an underesti- mate, was 0.030 year"1 and indicated a mean life expectancy of &gt;20 years. An additional 12.8% of individuals &gt;0.1-m tall in 1992 showed evidence of damage or disease (Table 6). This was mostly death or breakage of the apical stem which occurred in 75% of the damaged or diseased individuals. The prevalence of damage and disease was greater for A. concolor than for P. montícola and P. ponderosa (Logistic Regression Likelihood Ratio Test; #2 = 20.93; df = 2; P &lt; 0.01) and declined with increasing height in all three species (/2 = 8.61; df=l; P &lt; 0.01).

The mean (±SD) proportional height growth rate (i.e., the difference in logarithms of heights in 2003 and 1992 divided by 11 years) for individuals was 0.0134 (±0.0200) year"1 and ranged from -0.0198 to 0.107 year"1. Growth rates &lt;0 year"1 occurred due to the effects of damage and disease to the apical stem and measuring errors introduced by the uneven terrain at the individual's base. The mean (±SD) proportional height growth rates for undamaged and disease-free individuals (Table 6) was 0.0166 (±0.0159) year"1 with a median of 0.0146 year"1 and a range of -0.0362 to 0. 107 year" * . Growth rates &lt;0 year"1 for these individuals occurred due to measuring errors (Table 6). There were no significant differences among the commonly occurring species in mean growth rates (Table 6; F = 0.87; df = 5, 596; P &gt; 0.10), and an individual's growth rate was not related to the SCI (F = 1.07; df = 1, 596; P &gt; 0.10). Regressions of the logarithm of heights in 2003 on the logarithm of heights in 1992 produced regression coefficients from 0.94 for A. concolor to 1.09 for P. Jeffrey i , and these coefficients suggest no pronounced trends of decreasing or increasing growth rates with heights. Changes in forest structure between 1992 and 2003 There was little opportunity for meaningful changes in forest structure between 1992 and 2003. Because mortality rates were low and similar among the abundant species, there was little change in either densities or the relative abundances of species. Because of (1) the slow height growth and (2) the effects of damage and disease, there was little change in mean height. Mean (±SD) heights only increased from 2.00 (±2.72) m to 2.19 (±3.04) m and indicated a growth rate of 0.018 m year"1 for mean tree heights. Because of the dry summers in the 1992- 2003 interval, these rates of change may be above the average for mortality and below the average for height growth. Analyses of increment cores The ring counts for 59 trees ranged from 35 to 276 with a median of 136 (Table 7). These data are limited to those trees with clearly distinguishable rings in cores that passed close enough to the stem center so that the number of missed rings was negligible. The missed rings and the possibility of missing rings in stressed trees (Phipps 1985) suggest that ring counts are underestimates of the ages of trees at the heights of coring. The maximum ring count of 276 is comparable to the maximum of 248 reported by Heath (1958) after adjusting for the 35 years difference in collection dates. Because adjusting the ring counts for the ages at the height of coring is complicated by the slow and variable proportional height growth rates among individuals, the following analyses merely assume similar times among trees to reach coring height. The ring counts suggest nearly continuous estab- lishment of trees during the interval from 50 to 250 years before 1990 (Fig. 3). Nearly every 10-year interval within that span contains at least 1 tree. The lesser numbers of trees per interval in the range &gt;200 ring counts cannot be used to infer smaller establish- ment rates because they may reflect mortality of older trees. Heath (1958) notes the occurrence of dead, damaged, and diseased large trees.

Although standard deviations or other assessments of variability were not reported, these data will be assumed to be accurate because they were based on a sample area of 1860 m2 (one 30.5 x 30.5 m quadrat and two 3.05 by 152.4 m transects; Heath 1967). Comparing these means with those for the 1992 data is complicated by (1) Heath's counting conifers &lt;0.1- m tall and (2) Heath's plots being at elevations &lt;1900 m a. s. 1. where the SCI were often greater. If the 1992 data are modified to include all conifers in the 23 plots at elevations &lt;1900 m a. s. 1., the mean (±SD) density in 1992 becomes 837 (±698) individ- uals ha"1 and the mean (±SD) height becomes 1.80 (±2.83) m. The comparison of 1965 and 1992 data suggest a reduction in density and an increase in mean heights over the 27-years interval. Interpreting the difference in densities between 1965 and 1992 is complicated by the data being collected from different, though overlapping, areas, and the lack of data on mortality and recruitment during the interval. Although densi- ties appear to be less in 1992, the relative abundances of species are similar for the two time periods. Abies concolor, P. montícola, and P. ponderosa account for 87% of the individuals in 1965 and 91% in 1992. This comparison assumes that Heath's taxon of P. Jeffreyi (Heath 1967) is equivalent to the taxon P. ponderosa used here. The differences in mean heights suggest a height growth for average trees of 0.024 m year"1 which, given the variation in heights among individ- uals and potential impacts of climatic differences, is similar to the 0.018 m year"1 observed between 1992 and 2003. Discussion The combination of data from Heath (1958, 1959, 1960, 1967) and the current sampling (Fig. 3) indicate that most of the Jumbles surface has been colonized by conifers more or less continuously over the past 300 years. Heath's (1958, 1959) cores showed A. concolor, A. magnifica, P. contorta, P. lambertiana, P. monticola, and P. ponderosa were represented by trees with &gt;200 rings in 1958. Continuing colonization is indicated by (1) the number of trees with 75-250 rings (Fig. 3) and (2) the large numbers of small trees in 1965 (Heath 1967) and 1992. There is little evidence to suggest a temporal sequence in colonization among conifer species. The current species composition of the Jumbles appears to be an example of direct succession where the early invaders include those species likely to be the long-term dominant vegetation (Whittaker and Levin 1977; Mueller-Dombois 1992; Clarkson 1990). Tolerance of the mineral substrate appears to be the primary mechanism driving conifer succession with little apparent evidence of facilitation or inhibition by other plant forms. Conifers are more numerous than shrubs. Shrubs may occupy some microsites and preclude their use by conifers, but most shrub percent covers were &lt;1%. Although not quantified, herba- ceous species were also too sparsely distributed across the Jumbles to suggest a major role in inhibiting conifers. However, the possibility remains that shrub and herbaceous vegetation may be facil- itating conifer establishment. Because small conifers are surviving for a number of years, evidence of factors such as nurse plants or litter which promoted germination and early survival may no longer be apparent. The 200-m2 plots are sufficient to monitor the survival and growth of individuals &gt;0.1-m tall, but evaluating the factors affecting germination and ^ Springer</page><page sequence="11">Plant Ecol (2008) 199:281-294 291 early survival will require finer scales of physical and temporal measurement. Although proximity to seed sources has been shown to be important controllers of conifer invasion rates (Halpern and Harmon 1983; del Moral 1998, Frenzen et al. 1988; Larsen and Bliss 1998), conifer densities were related to surface compositions and not distances from forest margins. The older trees cored by Heath (1958) were also dispersed across unit III and not just along its margin. These patterns suggest that seeds are, and have been, readily dispersed across the Jumbles, and imply that successful colonization is more dependent on the influence of surface compo- sition on germination and/or early survivorship. Although colonization has occurred, there has been little forest development. Slow growth rates, mortality, damage and disease have limited the rates of increase in the tree heights. These slow rates are not, however, due to the combination of climate and elevation at the Jumbles as is demonstrated by the more rapid colonization and growth that has occurred on a 1915 mudflow located 7 km to the northeast at comparable elevations and aspects (Kroh et al. 2000). The mudflow surface is also dacite blocks and debris, but the surface is mostly smaller debris (Heath 1967; Eppler 1984). After 70 years, mean (±SD) tree densities on the mudflow were 3507 (±1812) ha"1 with mean heights of approximately 1.8 m and 6% of the individuals already being &gt;5-m tall (Kroh et al. 2000). Moreover, forest development on the mudflow may have been delayed by the destruction of surrounding seed sources by blast effects (Bailey 1963; Heath 1967). There is no evidence that the forests around the Jumbles were damaged in the avalanche (Crandall et al. 1974). The rate of forest development on the jumbles is also slower than that for other mineral surfaces in the Cascade Range of North America. Conifers estab- lished forest communities within 33 years on the Kautz Creek mudflow at Mount Rainier, Washington (Fig. la; Frenzen et al. 1988). Pinus ponderosa rapidly invaded and developed dense stands on mudflows at Mount Shasta (Fig. la) within at least 300 years and possibly within 60 years (Beardsley and Cannon 1930; Dickson and Crocker 1953; Sollins et al. 1983). Conifers invaded and achieved 90% canopy cover within about 150 years following the recession of the Coleman Glacier at Mount Baker (Fig. la; Jones and del Moral 2005), and canopy closure occurred within 200 years at the receding Nooksack Glacier also at Mount Baker (Oliver et al. 1985). These faster rates may be attributed to the substrates being described as "soils." When com- pared to forest development rates on other volcanically derived sites, the Jumbles rate is : (1) slower than that for forests on aa lava in Hawaii (Atkinson 1970; Drake and Muller-Dombois 1993; Clarkson 1997); (2) similar to that for Juniperus brevifolia on lava domes in the Azores (Elias and Dias 2004); (3) comparable to those for New Zealand systems with aa lava, avalanche deposits, and andes- ite debris flows (Table 1 in Clarkson 1990); and (4) faster than that for volcanic surfaces in southern Idaho (Eggler 1941). The slow forest development may be the result of both direct effects of stress on conifer establishment, survival, and growth and indirect effects on growth expressed through limitations on soil development. Few plants other than conifers are present to contrib- ute to organic matter development. In particular, the nitrogen fixing-genera Lupinus and Alnus are largely absent from the Jumbles. These and other nitrogen- fixing genera that can contribute to soil development (Halvorson et al. 2005) and substrate mineralization (Gill et al. 2006) are common components of suc- cession on mineral surfaces in the northwestern United States (Halpern and Harmon 1983; Morris and Wood 1989; Dale and Adams 2003; del Moral and Rozzell 2005; Jones and del Moral 2005). A common LVNP legume, Lupinus andersonii, has long been a component of the succession on the 1915 mudflow (Bailey 1963; Fessenden 1984; Kroh et al. 2000) but was not observed on the Jumbles. Its absence is consistent with Raich et al's. (1996) suggestion of less P availability on coarser mineral substrates. Lichens occur on the Jumbles (Crandall et al. 1974), but no assessments of their abundance or role in nitrogen fixation have been made. Although direct succession is implied, the current assemblage of abundant species is an atypical mix for LVNP forests. Parker (1991) classified LVNP forests into three broad types including: (1) a predominantly A. concolor forest with P. ponderosa, and P. lambertiana at elevations &lt;1800 m a. s. 1.; (2) a predominantly A. magnifica forest with P. jeffreyi, P. montícola, and P. contorta at elevations &gt;2000 m a. s. 1.; and (3) a zone where A. concolor transitions to A. magnifica between 1800 and 2000 m a. s. 1. The £} Springer</page><page sequence="12">292 Plant Ecol (2008) 199:281-294 Jumbles lies within Parker's transition zone, but the current abundant species are a mix of those more common at lower elevations, such as A. concolor, and P. ponderosa, and those more common at higher elevations, such as P. montícola . There is little gradation of these species across altitude or with congeners from the other elevations such as A. magnifica, P. jeffreyi and P. lambertiana. This atypical development contrasts with the 1915 mud- flow where the forest is typical for that elevation (Kroh et al. 2000). Similar atypical species associa- tions have been observed on mineral surfaces and attributed to a possible lack of competition among widely spaced individuals (Walker and del Moral 2003). As denser forests develop on the Jumbles, mechanisms may act to segregate P. ponderosa and P. montícola but similar separations of P. ponderosa and P. jeffreyi and A. concolor and A. magnifica are unlikely to arise unless there is increased colonization by P. jeffreyi and A. magnifica. There is little evidence from the seed masses or relative drought tolerances and resistance to snow damage (Table 1) that accounts for the greater success of these abundant species. Greater seed masses may confer advantages in drought tolerance and snow resistance (Turner 1985), but A. concolor, P. montícola and P. ponderosa all have intermediate- sized seeds and most have intermediate rankings for drought (except P. ponderosa) and snow resistance. Greater relative seed flight distance or seed produc- tion for these abundant species might explain their greater abundances, but their rankings are intermedi- ate among the more sparsely occurring species. The lack of clear relationships between species attributes and abundance on the Jumbles is consistent with the conclusions of Walker et al. (2006) that coarsely defined attributes may be poor predictors of success in harsh abiotic environments with limited microsites. If seed inputs from surrounding areas cannot account for this atypical development, then (1) there may be some unrecognized mix of attributes that confers advantages on this surface or (2) the atypical structure may reflect an interaction among species attributes and past stochastic events as argued by McCune and Allen (1985). Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that such events will have been preserved in the historical records. The increasing numbers of individuals per plot with increasing SCI seems at variance with the lack of correlation of plot surface composition with individual properties such as height growth rates and mortalities. This variance between plot and individual measures may be due to the spatial scales of measurement. Surface composition varied among and within photographs, and individuals may be occurring in microsites whose composition differs from the average for the plot. Evaluations of the sites occupied by individual conifers may explain differ- ential success among individuals. The slow rate of forest development complicates any projection of what form of forest may eventually develop. It has taken 300+ years to reach the current state, and any current trajectory is likely to be exposed to major disruptions. Within the next 300- 600 years, natural or anthropomorphic-driven climate changes are probable, changes in surrounding forests and seed sources due to disturbance or senescence are possible, and additional geological events are not impossible (Crandall et al. 1974). The Jumbles may represent a system that is particularly sensitive to these changes, and continuing studies may help illustrate why various forms of old-growth forests have developed on originally similar substrates.
