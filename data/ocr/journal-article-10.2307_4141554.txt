<plain_text><page sequence="1">RElPORT PREHISTORIC SALT PRODUCTION AT EL SALADO, VERACRUZ, MEXICO Robert S. Santley El Salado is a prehispanic salt production site located in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico. Fieldwork at the site was conducted to determine the methods of salt production, the character of the archaeological residues produced, the scale of the industry, and the history of production. El Salado contains two major occupations, the first dating to the Early Formative period and the second to the Late Classic period. During the Early Formative, solar evaporation in pot- tery trays was the primary method of salt production. This method was supplemented by some salt-making that involved boiling brine in tecomates. During the Late Classic, in contrast, boiling salt water became the preferred method of pro- duction. Late Classic brine reduction involved a two-step process. The salt level in the brine was first increased by boiling in collared jars. This brine was later reduced to loaves by boiling in shallow pottery vessels called cazuelas. El Salado es un sitio arqueolkgico utilizado para la producci6n de sal, ubicado dentro de las montailas de Tuxtla en el sur del estado de Veracruz, Mixico. Estudios arqueol6gicos recientes que se realizaron en el sitio tenfan los siguientes objetivos: deter- minar los metodos utilizados prehist6ricamente para la produccidn de sal, identificar los tipos de materiales arqueol6gicos que quedan, y establecer el tamafio y la cronologia de la industria. El Salado tuvo dos ocupaciones mayores. La primera esta fechado al periodo Formativo Temprano y la segunda al periodo Cldsico Tardio. Durante el periodo Formativo Temprano, se utilizaron evaporacidn solar con las charlotas de cerdmica como la forma principal para la producci6n de sal. Tambidn se uso otro mitodo que consista en "la salmuera en tecomates, "pero en escala menor En contraste, en el periodo Cldsico Tardio parece que el metodo preferido de produccidn fue hervir la agua salada. En esta segunda epoca de producci6n, el proceso de reducir la salmuera ocurri6 en dos fases. Primero, aumentaron el nivel de la sal en la salmuera herviendolo en jarras con cuellos. Luego se reduzco la salmuera a un bloque de sal cuando se lo hervia en vasijas bajas que se llaman "cazuelas." alt has always played a major role in human economy. In many areas of the world it is a major dietary supplement used to maintain body fluid pH. Salt's principal nutritional compo- nent, sodium, is obtained by ingesting sodium chlo- ride (Bloch 1963; Duaphinee 1960; Multhauf 1978; Wing and Brown 1979). Human physiological salt requirements vary greatly, depending on tempera- ture, humidity, work levels, and the amount of meat consumed (Kaufmann 1960). In many areas of the world, including Mesoamerica, salt also is often used as a preservative, particularly for meat and during tanning, and frequently it has important rit- ual and medicinal uses (Andrews 1983; Ewald 1985; Mendizabal 1946). Because salt deposits are unevenly distributed, until recent times it was widely traded as well (Andrews 1983; Rathje 1972). In Mesoamerica salt was obtained using two main methods in prehistoric and historic times (Andrews 1983; Ewald 1985; Parsons 1994). The first, termed sal solar, involved solar evaporation to obtain salt. This technique is common in coastal estuaries in which water trapped in shallow pans is allowed to evaporate and the salt scraped up for transport to nearby settlements. A different process is common in inland areas. Here salt is obtained using the sal cocida or cooking method. Brine is acquired from saline spring effluents or wells dug down to the water table, or it is leached from sed- iments rich in salt, and then it is cooked in ceramic vessels to produce salt loaves or granular salt.

Moreover, there is some variation in the specific techniques in sal cocida brine reduction; whereas some pans are totally manmade others are only partially mod- ified natural features. My work at El Salado indi- cates that at least during the Olmec period both methods were used, with the evaporative technique employed using large ceramic trays (see below). Prehispanic salt works are widely distributed in Mexico. In Northern Yucatan, for example, settle- ments on the coast emphasized production using the evaporative technique, due to the presence of estuaries and lagoons that were seasonally dry in the late winter and spring (Andrews 1983). Nod- ules of crystalline salt or soils rich in salt, to be later processed by leaching into cakes or into granular form, were likely the principal raw material col- lected. On the coast of Belize, in contrast, sites sit- uated in and around Punta Ycacos Lagoon emphasized production using the sal cocida method (McKillop 1995, 2002). In landlocked parts of the southern Maya Lowlands boiling also appears to have been the preferred method to obtain salt (Andrews 1983; Dillon 1977; Dillon et al. 1988). Much of this production throughout the lowlands probably did not require labor forces beyond the household level, although larger scale entities con- trolled by elites at centers nearby may have been employed to manage the collection of the product and coordinate the distribution of it over long dis- tances (Andrews 1983; McKillop 2002). Many of these prehistoric salt works date to the Classic period, especially the Late Classic (A.D. 650-1,000), a time when population densities throughout much of the Maya Lowlands had reached an all time high (Culbert and Rice 1990). The Late Classic was also a time when much of the forest had been cleared, the Maya consumed very little meat, and hence the need to eat salt as a dietary additive would had been at its highest (Webster 2002). These correlations suggest that specialized salt production in the Maya Lowlands during the Classic period was primarily demand-driven. In Late Aztec times salt production in the Basin of Mexico was large-scale although perhaps not above the household level of production (Sanders et al. 1979). Salt was also one of the few basic sub- sistence goods traded long distances by Pochteca merchants throughout Mesoamerica (Bittmann and Sullivan 1978). Until the survey of the Basin of Mexico, little was known about the number of salt works, their spatial distribution, or their internal configuration. We now know that many were located on the western shore of Lake Texcoco and on the southern rim of Lake Xaltocan (Sanders et al. 1979). Ecatepec was the largest Late Aztec site in this region and was centrally situated relative to the salt works on the lake shore; for these reasons it was probably intimately involved in the control of salt procurement and exchange. Salt-making sites in the Basin of Mexico con- sist of mounds of variable height littered with large amounts of pottery (Charlton 1969, 1971; Parsons 2001; Sanders et al. 1979). The mounds are piles of soil, likely from a production process involving the leaching of salt from salt-rich earth. Much of the associated pottery is called Texcoco Fabric Marked. Many of these vessels are basins and low- collared globular or cylindrical jars. While origi- nally thought to have been vessels used in making salt, Parsons (2001) recently has suggested that they were packaging made for exchange of the final salt product. This explanation makes sense when Texcoco Fabric Marked occurs at non-salt-mak- ing sites (Smith and Heath-Smith 1994). It does not account, however, for the enormous quantity of pottery at lakeshore sites that presumably had salt- making as their principal function. The reduction of brine into congealed or granular salt using the sal cocida method thus still appears to be the best explanation for the creation of this archaeological record. This brief discussion indicates that there has been a significant amount of work in recent years on ethnographic and archaeological salt production in Mesoamerica. In southern Veracruz, however, very little is ethnographically known about salt pro- duction. In the Tuxtla Mountains, for example, we know that salt was produced shortly after the Span- ish conquest and continued to be manufactured as late as the late twentieth century (Gonzalez de Cosio 1952; Lozano Garcia 1946; Medel y Alvarado 1963; Zarate 1917). Andrews (1983) reported a location called Las Salinas where salt- making took place by boiling. Another reported</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS 201 locality is named Xtlahuehue (Ceja Tonorio 1982, 1998). Both are situated southwest of San Andres and have Classic period archaeological occupa- tions nearby, suggesting that salt making in the Tuxtlas has considerable antiquity. The archaeo- logical remains at these sites regrettably are not well described. I doubt that El Salado is one of these two localities as the modern settlement at the archaeological site has no history of salt-making. In southern Veracruz very little systematic archaeological work has been conducted at salt- making sites, on methods of prehispanic salt pro- duction, the scale of the prehistoric industry, the history of production, and the character of the archaeological assemblages produced at such sites. Fieldwork at El Salado was undertaken to address these issues. In 1984 several lines of evidence sug- gested that site occupants engaged in specialized salt production. First, the site is situated next to a saline spring, the only one discovered by archaeo- logical survey teams in the region. Second, it pro- duced the highest densities of archaeological ceramics then known from the Tuxtla Mountains. Third, much of the pottery recovered in the 1984 samples consisted of coarse ware ceramic jars and basins, many of which had blackened bases. Orig- inally, I had thought that the site dated primarily to the Olmec period (1,400-300 B.C.). We now know that although a Preclassic component is present, El Salado's major occupation is Late Classic (A.D. 650-1,000) in date. Fieldwork Methods El Salado is located 6 km south of the modern town of San Andr6s Tuxtla in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, Mexico. The site was encoun- tered in 1984 as a part of our continuing effort to define the culture history of the Tuxtla Mountains and the role craft specialization played in deter- mining the prehistory of the region (Figure 1) (Arnold et al. 1993; Ortiz and Santley 1998; Pool 1997; Santley et al. 1987, 1989; Santley and Arnold 1996; Santley et al. 1997). To date, three fieldwork tasks have been conducted at El Salado. First, the site was mapped topographically and a series of control points set up for subsequent survey. The sec- ond phase of research involved intensive survey employing systematic random transect sampling and controlled surface collection techniques. Finally, profiles exposed by a modern road bisect- ing the southern part of the site were mapped and collections of artifacts were obtained at intervals along them (Figure 2). This part of the mapping program also included the discovery of several kilns, which were morphologically identical to kilns from Comoapan and Matacapan (Pool 1990; Santley et al. 1989). The survey involved two steps: topographic mapping and surface collecting (Figure 2). Since the contemporary site was divided into a series of agricultural fields, each was considered as a sepa- rate block or zonal stratum, and a line of control points, all referenced to the primary datum, was set up running across each. Sometimes a second line perpendicular to the first was laid out for additional control. Control points were situated 20 m apart, and their position mapped with a transit and stadia rod. These points were used to produce a topo- graphic map of the site at a scale of 1:500. Alto- gether, an area of approximately 8 ha was mapped in this fashion. Surface sampling employed a stratified sys- tematic aligned design, with transects selected ran- domly and oriented to the cardinal directions. The number of 3-m-wide transects crossing the long axis of each modern agricultural field was com- puted, and a 10 percent sample of transects from each was selected randomly for surface collection. Individual collection units were placed every 13 m along each transect, and all cultural materials were collected after vegetation removal. This controlled survey produced 144 surface collections involving nearly 40,000 artifacts (Figure 2). The site area sampled by controlled collection was about 1.1 percent. A series of isopleth maps then was gener- ated using the computer-assisted mapping program, SURFER. A set of uncontrolled general collections using the "grab" method was also obtained from each modern field. These samples produced a large quantity of polychrome pottery and obsidian. Profiles of the archaeological deposits exposed in the road that bisected the southern part of the site were also mapped. After the contemporary vege- tation had been removed, the roadway profiles were cleaned with trowel and brush. The contemporary ground surface was then plotted, and a series of 3- m-wide sections every 20 m along each profile was selected for further study. At each section the cul- tural stratigraphy was drawn, the strata described,</page><page sequence="4">202 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] GULFOFMEoco GULF OF MEXICO NORTHERN MEXICO rU YAL DS BASIN OF MEXICO REGION A'MONTE P10 PACIFIC OCEA SAN MARTIN 0o 0 7RESZAPOTES o 0 TEOPEC TMA CAC4PAN r T CATEMA CO GULF COAST COMOAAN PLAIN RIO TEPANGO /M -MATACANELA V DE CATEMACO MATALAPAN .

This sampling of material from the profiles produced more than 1,500 additional artifacts as well as small quantities of botanical remains, including maize. Site Description El Salado is located on a ridge that runs southeast from the base of an extinct volcanic cone, Cerro Coxole. The north face of the ridge slopes steeply to the river valley below, while the southern face, where most of the site is located, is more gentle (Figure 2). There, recent volcanism has upwarped Tertiary marine sediments rich in kaolin that have a comparatively high salt content (see Pool 1990 and Pool and Santley 1992 for a fuller description of the sedimentary geologic history of the region). These clay sediments underlie all of El Salado and outcrop at various points across the site. A spring leaching salts from these clays effuses on the slope directly to the east of the site. This effusion has pro- duced a stream that flows south, ultimately joining the Rio Tecojote southeast of El Salado. The site is situated atop and on both sides of the ridge. Most of the occupation dates to the Late Classic; however, an Early Formative component is present as well. Sherds and other artifacts occur over a broad area, but are most concentrated in a 6.7 ha area, assuming a site boundary defined by 20 or fewer artifacts per collection (Figure 3). The lower part of the site covers about 3.25 ha and con- tains the highest density of material, with surface frequencies often exceeding 500 sherds per col- lection. The upper part of the site is comparable in size (3.25 ha), but surface ceramic densities are much lower, although pockets of higher-density occupation also occur. The high-density area is dominated by a group of irregularly shaped mounds. This group contains one large mound, 4 m high and 50 m in diameter,</page><page sequence="6">204 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] 750 800 850- 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 ULIMITSN OF SIE ---------- ---------- Id 1100 .. - 1100 S 1050 LOW - 1050 DENSITY (.

The pro- files of the modem road bisecting the site indicates that these mounds were probably not platforms built to support structures. Architectural features such as stairways, house floors, walls, and hearths were not detected in the profiles nor were sub- structures or domestic features such as storage pits and burials. Sherds, however, are literally stacked one atop another in the deposits, indicating that each mound is a large refuse deposit. Assemblages from different parts of the high-density area also vary in composition; some contain substantial num- bers of collared globular jars, while others are dom- inated by large, shallow, flat-bottomed basins called cazuelas. The middens exposed by the roadway bisecting the southern edge of the site are about 1.5 m deep, but modem pitting in several of the mounds to the north indicates that sometimes the depth of the deposit exceeds 3 m. Little information exists concerning the depth of the deposit in the lower- density up slope area, but if the profile of a mod- ern well can be used as a guide, it is at least 1 m deep. Parts of several kilns were also discovered dur- ing the survey. These kilns are located near the northern and eastern periphery of the site. Each is circular in shape and about 1-1.5 m in diameter. The kilns have walls made of adobe bricks and puddled mud, which were heated to the clay's point of vitrification during firing (ca. 1,100 degrees C.). All appear to have had a two-chambered shape. The lower chamber was the fire box in which fuel was placed for firing pottery. Situated atop the fire box was the firing chamber where the pottery was fired. The two chambers were separated by a row of bun- shaped adobes that ran radially inward from the cir-</page><page sequence="7">REPORTS 205 cular outer wall to a central post also built of adobe. Similar kilns are still used today in the Tuxtlas (Arnold 1993), and archaeological work at Mata- capan and Comoapan indicates that they were in use at least as early as the beginning of the Classic period (Arnold et al. 1993; Pool 1990; Santley et al. 1989). Excavations at Matacapan indicate that these kilns were used to make Coarse Orange jars, fine paste bowls and plates, and probably Coarse Reddish Brown basins. I suspect that many of the Coarse Reddish Brown basins found at El Salado was fired in kilns like the ones found at Matcapan and Comoapan. The Coarse Brown found at El Sal- ado, on the other hand, was likely fired on the open surface or in shallow pit "kilns," given the ubiqui- tous presence of firing clouds and other discol- orations on vessel exteriors. Chronology The intensive surface survey produced a total of 39,969 artifacts, the majority of which were ceram- ics (97.7 percent). Artifact densities from all sites intensively surveyed in the Tuxtlas are highly skewed so that the median is the best measure of central tendency. The median frequency at El Sal- ado is 53 artifacts per collection unit, compared to a median of 19 at Matacapan, the largest archaeo- logical site in the Tuxtlas region. Most of the ceramic materials from El Salado were obtained from the lower part of the site. There, the median density is 414 artifacts per unit, with densities as high as 1,500-2,000 artifacts per unit frequently occurring. The median density per unit throughout the remainder of the site is 15, a figure that com- pares favorably to the median at Matacapan. Analysis of the ceramic collections indicates that El Salado contains two occupations: the first dating to the Early Formative (1,400-1,000 B.C.) and the second to the Late Classic (A.D. 650-1,000) (see Santley and Arnold 1996 for a more complete description of the Tuxtlas chronology). Although the preliminary reconnaissance of the site suggested a substantial Formative period presence, only 2.7 percent of collections actually date to the Early Formative. The Early Formative assemblage con- tains the full range of decorated and utility ceram- ics. This pottery occurs throughout the site, but it is most concentrated up slope on the ridge and at its base near the course of the modern spring, sug- gesting the presence of several small pockets of occupation. The Early Formative occupation at El Salado was therefore quite dispersed, much like that at other Formative period sites in the region (Sant- ley et al. 1997). Within the pockets of occupation, however, the median density of Early Formative ceramics is 11 per unit, a figure that is much higher than the median for Early Formative surface sur- vey contexts elsewhere in the Tuxtlas (4 sherds per unit). The most common Early Formative ware at El Salado is Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper, which occurs as globular jars without collars (tecomates) (Figure 4), deep basins, and most often large rec- tangular trays, many fragments of which have deposits of calcium carbonate (the probably by- product of salt-making) on their interior surface. This ware accounts for 41.7 percent of all Early For- mative material. The other common ware is Coarse Brown, which comprises 31.3 percent of the Early Formative ceramic assemblage and whose primary form also is the tecomate (Figure 4). Almost all of the tecomates from El Salado are undecorated, unlike the material from Matacapan and other Early Formative sites in the Tuxtlas, whose exterior shoul- ders are generally covered with rocker-stamping or finger nail/reed punctate decoration. Only 10.3 per- cent of the Early Formative assemblage at El Sal- ado consists of service wares: Differentially Fired Black and White, Kaolin White, Matte White- Slipped, Polished Cream-Slipped, and Coarse Gray. The predominant vessel forms in these wares are plates, vertical wall bowls, and basal break bowls. Although these forms are not very common at El Salado, they are more frequently represented at other Early Formative sites in the Tuxtlas, includ- ing Matacapan. Therefore, unlike other Early For- mative sites in the Tuxtlas region, the assemblage from El Salado is skewed to two wares, with the undecorated tecomate being a common form. Following the Early Formative, El Salado lay virtually abandoned until the Late Classic period (A.D. 650-1,000). Ninety-seven point three percent of all material collected at the site dates to this time period, with most of it likely dating to the late Late Classic (A.D. 800-1,000). As during the Early For- mative period, only a few wares predominate: Coarse Brown, Coarse Reddish Brown, and Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper. Likewise, as during the Early Formative, only a few vessel forms are com-</page><page sequence="8">206 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] Figure 4. Coarse Brown tecomates with quartz temper. monly represented. These include globular jars with necks, shallow, flat bottom, vertical wall bowls with handles (cazuelas), and deep flaring wall basins. Coarse Brown occurs primarily as collared jars, which were decorated by combing, a technique that produces incised parallel lines on the vessel's exte- rior shoulders (rastreado incision) (Figure 5). Coarse Reddish Brown, in contrast, was produced mainly as cazuelas, a form that is used today in the Tuxtlas to reduce soups and stews to a more vis- cous state before human consumption (Figure 6). Shallow basins are the predominant form repre- sented in Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper, ves- sels that are also used today during soup and stew reduction. Decorated service wares are also present in the collections, but they comprise only 3.7 per- cent of the Classic ceramic assemblage. The most common Classic ware at El Salado is Coarse Brown. Overall, Coarse Brown accounts for 61.3 percent of the Classic ceramic assemblage, but it</page><page sequence="9">REPORTS 207 Figure 5. Coarse Brown collared jars. represents 80 percent or more of the material from collections in and around the main mound group. Many of the jars in Coarse Brown have a layer of calcium carbonate on their interior surfaces, while others have blackened bases, indicating that boil- ing water rich in salt was a major use of these ves- sels. The common presence of a carbonate deposit on the interior walls and the blackening of the bases of ceramics from Coarse Reddish Brown and Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper suggest that these wares were used for a similar purpose. Coarse Brown, Coarse Reddish Brown, and Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper are wares that were in common usage throughout the Classic period and hence are not chronologically diagnos- tic of any particular phase. The Classic assemblage, however, does include Tuxtla Polychrome, a ceramic type only produced in the Late Classic. Tuxtla Polychrome was produced using a fine-paste clay rich in kaolinite. Vessel forms include hemi- spherical bowls; plates with flat bases, straight diverging rims, and everted lips; and flat bottomed bowls with vertical walls. Many examples of this ware are covered with a fine white slip and painted. The painted decoration involves a wide variety of designs that are arranged in bands around the exte- rior or both surfaces of the vessel: geometric motifs such as rectangles, U-shaped elements, half cir- cles, hooks, and volutes; various zoomorphic and anthropomorphic motifs; and complicated designs</page><page sequence="10">208 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] Figure 6. Coarse Reddish Brown cazuelas. that resemble hieroglyphs. Generally, three or four colors were used to decorate the vessel. Commonly used paint colors are red, cherry, pink, white, cream, yellow, brown, and black. A Late Classic date is further suggested by the absence of ceramic mate- rials decorated in Teotihuacan style, which are common at Matacapan and other sites in the Tuxt- las only during the late Early and Middle Classic periods (Ortiz and Santley 1998). Those materials include cylindrical tripods vases with incised or hollow cutout supports, candeleros, figurines, braceros, Fine Buff, and large hollow incense burners. Site Structure and Function Site structure refers to patterning in the distribu- tion of archaeological materials. Such patterning is often mutually exclusive: that is, it reflects activ- ities that occurred at different places within a site. There are a variety of methods to investigate pat- terning across a landscape. Some rely on techniques that produce statistics summarizing patterns, while others produce graphical results. This study uti- lized the computer-assisted plotting program, SURFER, to generate isopleth maps showing the distribution of archaeological deposits at El Salado.</page><page sequence="11">REPORTS 209 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1 15 0 , , , , , , , ,, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , 1 15 0 UMITS N OF SITE ---------- ---- W E 1100 ...1100 S 1050 1050 1050 - " ,, FORMATIVE - FORMATIVE PERIOD LOW 000 1000 PERIOD HIGH - 000 DENSITY ZONE DENSITY ZONE 950 - 950 --3 0 0 900 900 --OF SITE 850 ',-850 800 800 MINIMUM CONTOUR - 5 SHERDS PER 3 BY 3 M COLLECTION UNIT - CONTOUR INTERVAL - 10 SHERDS " PER 3 BY 3 M COLLECTION UNIT 7 5 I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I 7 5 0 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050. 1100 1150 Figure 7. Isopleth map of El Salado showing the distribution of Early Formative occupation (scale in meters). When using computer programs of this type, the analyst has many options and interpolation algo- rithms from which to choose. In this study Mini- mum Curvature was the interpolation method chosen because it views arrays of data points as "islands in a sea" and thus draws maps with lines that rarely extend off the plot. All interpolations were computed based on calculations to the near- est 10 collections. Each isopleth map was produced using the same interpolation method and bound- aries, although the plotted "contour" interval was allowed to vary from one map to the next depend- ing on the range in frequency of archaeological materials plotted in each. The isopleth maps show that the archaeological occupation at El Salado can be divided into two dis- tinct zones: a low-density area situated up slope and a high-density area of specialized activity located down slope (Figure 3). The high-density zone, I believe, was produced as the result of specialized salt production. The low-density zone, in contrast, was apparently where the salt makers physically resided and where some salt was produced next to their residences. This spatial segregation charac- terizes both major periods of occupation at El Sal- ado, although there are major differences in the scale and intensity of specialized production through time. The Early Formative component at El Salado is much smaller than its Late Classic counterpart, covering an area no larger than 3.5 ha (Figure 7). The density of Early Formative material also is sig- nificantly less, implying a lower level of salt pro- duction. The higher density zone is situated up slope near the eastern boundary of the site. This zone, I suggest, is where the Early Formative salt</page><page sequence="12">210 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] Figure 8. Salt Pan ware. makers lived. Although the ceramic assemblage in this zone consists of a large number of tecomates, also present are decorated ceramic service wares, water storage jars, a few obsidian flakes, and two Formative figure fragments, four classes of mate- rial common in Early Formative domestic deposits elsewhere in the Tuxtlas. Moreover, the fact that few vessels from this zone had layers of calcium carbonate on their interior walls suggests that this zone was not where most salt was produced. The low-density zone of Early Formative occu- pation, on the other hand, is probably one of the areas of salt production (Figure 7). Although small in quantity, the ceramic assemblage there consists of only coarse ware tecomates and collared stor- age jars. Unlike the ceramics in the higher-density area, these vessels frequently have a layer of cal- cium carbonate on their interior walls, and their bases are often blackened. Following Parsons (2001), this suggests that water from the stream was subjected to a low heat, which hastened the process of evaporation, allowed the calcium carbonate to precipitate out of the solution, and formed the car- bonate layer on the vessel interiors. What would have been left at the end of the boiling process was a hardened loaf or granular product much richer in sodium chloride (common table salt). Also present in the lower density zone is a large amount of Salt Pan Ware, whose date was initially unknown (Fig- ures 8 and 9). These vessels were not very highly fired. Today sherds from Salt Pan Ware can be eas- ily broken by hand, and likely the vessels produced in this ware were also very fragile at the time of their use in the past.

Salt Pan Ware was produced mainly as rectangular trays (Figure 8), but sometimes large hemispherical basins were made in this ware. These large craters are very similar in size and shape to those reported at Salinas de los Nueve Cerros, Guatemala (Dillon 1979). Salt production during the Early Formative may have involved two techniques. The first involved the construction of low dams across the saline stream into which the ceramic trays were set to col- lect water. The water in these trays was then allowed to evaporate and small amounts of crystalline salt were subsequently obtained. Boiling was the sec- ond potential technique. Here water was obtained directly from runoff in the stream, from pools pro- duced by small impoundment dams, or from wells. The presence of collared jars suggests the transport of water from the source to the production area where it was placed in the Salt Pan Ware basins for storage and subsequent evaporation. The brine was finally reduced to a congealed mass of salt by cook- ing it in tecomates and necked jars. This latter tech- nique was never commonly employed during the Early Formative, to judge from the frequency of archaeological remains indicative of its applica- tion. It is also possible that evaporating water in ceramic trays was the first stage in a single process, which involved initial water collection in trays and later transport in necked jars to large basins where it was stored before boiling in tecomates. Compared to the Late Classic, the degree of specialization during the Early Formative was quite nominal, and probably it was very much a part-time activity that took place only during the dry season. The intensity and scale of salt production at El Salado increased greatly during the Late Classic.</page><page sequence="14">212 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1150 ,,I ,,, , 1150 UMITS N OF SITE - - - -------------------- 1100- .1100 S LATE CLASSIC 1050 - LOW DENSITY 1050 ZONE 1000 1000 950 - - 950 900 900 850 - 850 MINIMUM CONTOUR - 1 ARTIFACT PER 3 BY 3 M COLLECTION UNIT CONTOUR INTERVAL - 1 ARTIFACT PER 3 BY 3 M COLLECTION UNIT C750L1 A"" "" -750 50 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 Figure 10. Isopleth map of El Salado showing the distribution of Late Classic domestic artifacts (scale in meters). Virtually all of the material plotted in Figure 3 dates to this period. Again the site can be divided into two zones: an up slope low-density zone where the salt makers dwelled and some salt was physically extracted, and a high-density zone down slope where most specialized salt production occurred. That the salt makers lived up slope is indicated by several lines of evidence. Although the surface col- lections from up slope units yielded fewer ceram- ics, more ceramic wares were represented. In particular, low-density units produced most of the decorated pottery, especially Tuxtlas Polychrome and Polished Fine Gray. At Matacapan decorated pottery of all types typically occurs in domestic middens, along with other kinds of household trash (Santley et al. 1984, 1985a, 1985b). These other classes of material include obsidian prismatic blades, manos and metates, and anthropomorphic figurines. Figure 10 plots the distribution of these materials. As is readily apparent, they are primar- ily confined to the low-density zone. Finally, there is little evidence of salt production up slope, although some salt production definitely took place in the low-density zone, as evinced by the presence of some sherds from basins and jars with a layer of calcium carbonate on their interior walls. Most specialized salt production at El Salado took place down slope during the Late Classic (Fig- ure 3). This is where pottery densities are extraor- dinarily high, greatly eclipsing those from any other surface context in the Tuxtlas, and where many Classic period vessels have blackened bases and a layer of calcium carbonate on their interior walls (Figure 11). Fired earth is also concentrated down slope (Figure 12). This fired earth seems to have been produced by generalized burning and not by kiln deterioration after disuse. This is precisely what I would expect if the fired earth was produced</page><page sequence="15">REPORTS 213 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1 15 0 I I , - r - I , , - I , ,I- -I IrI I I i i , , III I , I I 1 15 0 LIMITS OF SITE 11001100 W E S 1050 - 1050 1000 1- - 1000 0 950 L- ATE CLASSIC - 950 HIGH DENSITY ZONE 900 - - 900 8 5------ --- - _IMITS_ OF SITE o"'. 800 OS-800 MINIMUM CONTOUR - 5 SHERDS PER 3 BY 3 M COLLECTION UNIT - CONTOUR INTERVAL - 5 SHERDS ---". .

The ceramic assemblage from the high-density zone is wholly dominated by three wares: Coarse Brown, Coarse Reddish Brown, and Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper (Figures 13, 14, and 15). These wares are almost always represented in two forms: necked globular jars and shallow basins. Although the spatial distribution of these wares overlaps, Coarse Brown jars and Coarse Reddish Brown/Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper basins exhibit peak frequencies in different parts of the high-density zone. This patterning suggests that salt production involved a staged set of activities requiring different vessel forms, which often took place at different locations within the high-density zone. How was salt physically produced during the Late Classic period? Salt water likely was obtained from small shallow pools that formed behind low impoundment dams built across the stream or from wells. From these procurement locations the salt water was transported to the production area where it was reduced to loaves. The Late Classic produc- tion process did not involve the use of trays, per- haps because they were too fragile or did not efficiently produce a large quantity of product. The initial stage in the salt production process proba- bly involved boiling the salt water in jars to obtain a more saline brine. This brine was later transferred to basins and further reduced by boiling to produce loaves of salt for exchange throughout the region. These basins average 25.3 cm in diameter and have a mean height of 6.1 cm. If loaf size was equal to basin volume, the final hardened product would have been quite large, minimally weighing 3-4 kg. Why do I believe that loaves were the final prod- uct rather than granular salt? My answer to this question is very simple: loaves are easier to trans-</page><page sequence="16">214 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1150 1 J i  , , , , I , i i1150 UMITS N OF SITE ----------- 1 ..

I suspect that Late Classic salt production was a full-time spe- cialization that occurred throughout the year. The great quantity of archaeological materials indica- tive of salt production supports this conclusion; production could have been year round if small roofed open-air structures were built over the brine reduction areas. It is also possible that production was only conducted during the dry season. The ethnographic record from other parts of Mesoamer- ica indicates that dry season salt production is typ- ically the norm because during the rainy season the salt content of soil and brine in streams is reduced; the wet season is also the time when salt produc- ers salt producers frequently engage in subsistence agriculture (Andrews 1983; Good 1995; Parsons 2001; Williams 1999, 2002). The mode of salt production at El Salado prob- ably involved small-scale entities organized as workshop industries. Production at this level typi- cally occurs in contexts where the individual house- hold is the primary unit of manufacture but where production takes place at a special location beyond the normal domestic space it occupied. Although the exact number of households engaged in this process at El Salado cannot be established with certainty, an estimate of around 10 families or less seems reasonable. The large high-density zone at the site might suggest a more complex mode of pro- duction such as a nucleated industry or manufac- tory (Santley et al. 1989). The evidence at hand does not warrant this conclusion, for several reasons. First, although different stages in the salt pro- duction process can take place at different locations within the production zone, the great degree of overlap in the distribution of different vessel forms in the high-density zone more strongly implies generic production by a group of similarly orga-</page><page sequence="17">REPORTS 215 750 800 850 900 950 1000 1050 1100 1150 1150 1, 1ii, i , , , , ,, , , , , , , 1150 uMrrs N __- - - OF SITE/- 1100 - . - 100 LATE 0 CLASSIC ,S LOW 1050 - DENSITY 1050 ZONE 1000 1000 950 - 950 900 900 - "LATE , ------ HIGH ,.850 : (( !

Second, the large amount of refuse deposited in the high- density zone is probably more a function of the method of physical production, sal cocida, rather than scale, though production intensity probably also played a role in the accumulation of material residue. The major activities that involved ceramic vessels during the salt production process, water transport and brine reduction, are ones in which pot- tery breakage rates can be quite high. Jars, for example, may be dropped during transport, and vessels may crack and be rendered unusable after repeated boiling. If this process occurred over sev- eral centuries, an extremely large quantity of pot- tery remains should accrue. Finally, although the segregation of domestic household space from the specialized production space could suggest a more complex production unit beyond the level of the household, such partitioning also is the expected outcome of a process involving the accumulation of residues that would interfere with the normal household domestic routine (Arnold 1993; Killion 1987; Santley and Kneebone 1993). It is probably no coincidence, then, that most of the waste at El Salado was deposited in a production zone located down slope from the residences in which the spe- cialists resided. Why did Late Classic production involve a two-step boiling procedure? I suspect that it was the Tuxteco response to a landscape that was becoming partially denuded in that it minimized the amount of fuel needed to produce a unit of final product. Unfortunately, I know of no ethnographic or ethnohistoric examples of a boiling production process such as the one just described.

The archaeological record begins in Early Formative times (1,400-1,000 B.C.) and lasts until the Spanish Conquest (Santley and Arnold 1996). During the Early Formative most settle- ments were situated in the upper Rio Catemaco valley near Matacapan, whereas during the remain- der of the Formative period (1,000 B.C.-A.D. 100) the bulk of all prehispanic occupation was located farther downstream in the vicinity of El Salado. Population levels throughout the Formative were not large, never amounting to more than 3400 per- sons (Santley and Arnold 1996:228-231). The region was likely split into a number of political entities, and except for the Late Formative, each was probably organized on an egalitarian basis. Evidence for craft specialization during the For- mative period is quite scanty. Besides El Salado, the best evidence of specialized production comes from La Joya, a small suburb of Matacapan involved in the manufacture of obsidian bifaces and small flakes (Santley et al. 1997). Conditions during the Classic period (A.D. 100-1,000) were very different. In contrast to the Formative period, population levels increased sub- stantially, reaching a peak of around 53,000 per- sons in the Middle Classic (A.D. 450-650) (Santley and Arnold 1996:233-236). Matacapan was the major settlement in the region, but there was also a large number of rural sites around it and in the lower Rio Catemaco valley. The state now formed the basis of political integration. During the Early and Middle Classic Matacapan was the dominant political and economic power, whereas during the Late Classic several smaller statelets emerged in the wake of Matacapan's decline. There was also a significant rise in the amount of craft specializa- tion in the region during the Classic period.

Isopleth map of El Salado showing the distribution of Late Classic Coarse Brown with Quartz Temper pot- tery (scale in meters). developed both at Matacapan and at settlements in the countryside, and the pottery manufacturing industry was internally differentiated among house- hold industries, workshops, and manufactories. A number of factors probably played a major role in determining the degree and extent of salt pro- duction at El Salado. The most obvious one is pop- ulation. During the Formative period the population of the Tuxtlas numbered only a few thousand, while during the Classic period it increased eighteen-fold (Santley and Arnold 1996:228-236). The same appears to be the case in the Hueyapan region directly to the south of the Tuxtlas (Killion and Urcid 2001). In the Middle and Late Classic peri- ods the Hueyapan region was in close economic contact with the Tuxtlas; its inhabitants consumed large quantities of Tuxtlas pottery and perhaps salt from El Salado as well. The increases in the scale and intensity of salt production at El Salado there- fore can probably be attributed to this change in regional demand. Second, recent work on the paleoecology of the Tuxtlas indicates two periods of prehistoric agri- cultural exploitation and tropical forest clearance (Byrne and Horn 1989; Goman 1992). The first dates to the Early Formative period. It is charac- terized by some forest clearance and maize agri- culture; however, the sediment cores from Laguna Popal and Laguna Catemaco also contain a large amount of arboreal pollen. This pollen decreases dramatically in the Classic period, as does pollen from species common in secondary growth. These findings indicate significant vegetation modifica- tion and agricultural intensification from Forma- tive to Classic times. Much of this deforestation probably took place on the alluvial plain and adja-</page><page sequence="20">218 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 15, No. 2, 2004] cent slope lands, areas that are intensively cultivated today and probably were in Classic times as well. More intensive agricultural economies generally require the application of greater amounts of labor, which would have increased human salt require- ments. The fact that there was forest clearance raises the question of the region's ability to support the fuel requirements of the salt industry. I believe that this was likely not a major problem in the Late Classic, although wood probably had to be obtained from greater distances compared to Formative times. Even today when population levels are considerably higher than the Classic period maximum, large tracts of rain forest still remain near El Salado. Third, it is likely that agricultural intensification was accompanied by concomitant decreases in the amount of wild game in the prehistoric diet. Salt is typically not needed as a dietary supplement in diets containing a sufficient level of meat. This would have been the case during the Formative when substantial sections of the Tuxtlas were still in forest and other parts were in secondary regrowth, a habitat optimal for species such as the white-tailed deer. Forest clearance and agricultural intensification have the opposite effect, consider- ably reducing the biomass of terrestrial fauna. At Matacapan, the principal Classic period center in the region, terrestrial fauna is marked in its paucity (Santley et al. 1984, 1985a, 1985b, unpublished data). A lack of animal remains characterizes the faunal assemblages from all levels in the socioe- conomic hierarchy, suggesting that meat was gen- erally in short supply. Because the faunal assemblages from the Formative period contain more animal bone, a greater biological need for salt during the Classic period is therefore implied. While the differences in population, agricultural intensification, and level of meat consumption men- tioned above can account for the differing degrees and intensities of salt production at El Salado dur- ing the Formative and Classic periods, unresolved is why there is very little evidence of production at the site during the Early and Middle Classic peri- ods. Interestingly, the Early and Middle Classic were times when Matacapan and the Tuxtlas were in close contact with great Central Mexican metrop- olis of Teotihuacan (Santley et al. 1987). Indeed, it is likely that Matacapan was originally established as a base for foreigners from Teotihuacan. There is strong reason to believe that Teotihuacan was the conveyor of many luxury goods distributed throughout Mesoamerica as well as more basic commodities such as obsidian (Santley and Arnold 2000). Salt from the Basin of Mexico salt works in other regions may have also been conveyed by Teotihuacan caravans. This was most certainly the case during the Postclassic period when the Aztecs dominated long-distance exchange (Bittmann and Sullivan 1978). I suspect that Teotihuacan may have had a similar role in Middle Classic times. Curi- ously, there is also no evidence of salt making at El Salado in Postclassic times. The Postclassic, however, is a time when there is little archaeolog- ical evidence of prehispanic occupation (Santley and Arnold 1996). Hence, there was probably lit- tle need for salt and consequently an insufficient market for the salt makers. I suspect that most of the salt produced at El Sal- ado during the Late Classic period was for con- sumption by the local population of the Tuxtlas, although some may have been exported beyond the region. El Salado was occupied during the early Late Classic (A.D. 650-800), but it is mostly late Late Classic (A.D. 800-1,000) in date. The Late Classic was also a time of population falloff. Pop- ulation in the Tuxtlas peaks in the Middle Classic (A.D. 450--650). The Middle Classic population numbered approximately 53,000; however, by the early Late and late Late Classic it had decreased to 41,000 and 16,000 persons respectively (Santley and Arnold 1996:236-240). Assuming an average daily need for dietary salt of 10 g per capita (Andrews 1983) and a mean loaf weight of 4 kg, Late Classic demand would have amounted to 37,413 and 14,600 loaves per year for each phase respectively. El Salado then would have had to manufacture 183 and 40 loaves per day to meet this demand, more if salt was used as a preservative, and if in conjunction with dyeing and tanning, still more may have been needed. Parsons (2001:5) reports that the minimum need for salt as a dietary supplement varies considerably, often from 12 to 24 g per capita per day based on the factors men- tioned above. If a daily figure of 24 g per person is closer to the real mark, the values estimated above would have to be increased 2.4 times. Could these levels of dietary need have been met by the salt makers at El Salado? I suspect that it could have been met if production was throughout the year and dietary need was around 10 g per capita per day</page><page sequence="21">REPORTS 219 (assuming 10 salt makers and a production output of two loaves per maker per day). El Salado thus would have produced around 7,300 loaves per year, a total that almost meets the late Late Classic demand. On the other hand, my answer to this ques- tion is probably that El Salado could not have met needs if production was a dry season endeavor only and consumption was around 24 g per person per day. Early Late Classic production levels were probably lower given the smaller size of the site. Consequently, El Salado could have satisfied only part of the region's early Late Classic need. Summary and Conclusion Fieldwork at El Salado was conducted to determine the methods of salt production, the character of the archaeological residues produced, the scale of the industry, and the history of production. El Salado contains two major occupations, the first dating to the Early Formative period and the second to the Late Classic period. During the Early Formative, solar evaporation in pottery trays was the primary method of salt production. This method was sup- plemented by some salt-making involving boiling brine in tecomates. During the Late Classic the sal cocida method greatly eclipsed solar evaporation as the method of salt production. Late Classic brine reduction involved a two-step process. Salt content in the brine was first increased by boiling in col- lared jars. This brine was later reduced to loaves by boiling in shallow basins. Salt production dur- ing both periods did not involve local elites. There is no evidence of status differences at the site, although elites who were resident elsewhere may have facilitated the exchange of salt from region to region. The distribution of refuse from El Salado sug- gests that production during the Late Classic was larger scale and more intensive than in the Early Formative. This increase in production likely was mainly a function of the great rise in population that occurred from Formative to Classic times, com- bined with increasing agricultural intensification and the decreasing contribution of meat in the diet as the resident population throughout the region grew larger. During both time periods the site con- tained two zones of occupation: a down slope zone where most of the salt was produced, and an up slope zone where the salt makers lived and some salt was manufactured. Most production was prob- ably organized as a workshop industry, with each producer household maintaining a small workshop located down slope where brine was stored and salt produced. Salt production at El Salado was organized very differently than other crafts in the Tuxtla Moun- tains. Pottery, for example, was produced in house- hold contexts, workshops, and larger-scale manufactories. This ceramics economy-of-scale was oriented to different clienteles, some local, oth- ers regional, and still others extra-regional (Sant- ley et al. 1989). Pottery manufacture is one craft in which there can be great gains in the volume of pro- duction if the manufacturing process occurs in non- domestic contexts and there is spatial staging of the different activities involved in the production process, which contributes to increasingly efficient output. Such scalar benefits do not seem to apply to goods like salt in prehispanic Mesoamerica, even when large quantities of raw material were close at hand (Andrews 1983; Parsons 2001; Sanders et al. 1979). Viewed in Mesoamerican perspective, salt production was organized at the household level or by small groups of families and destined to stay at that level because increasing the number of pro- ducers probably would not greatly increase the effi- ciency of manufacture. Indeed, as Andrews (1983) and Parsons (2001) have pointed out, traditional salt-making techniques in Mesoamerica, many of which had precolumbian origins, were in common use until very recent times when mechanized extraction and processing enabled a cheaper table salt product.
