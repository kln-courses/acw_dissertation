<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN On the Jewish Imagination THERE IS NO IMAGINATION without distrust of imagination. This interdependence is especially obvious when a powerful religion attempts to subsume imaginative activity. The relation between religion and fantasy must be intimate, even complicit, since religion is orbic as well as orphic, wishing to embrace the totality of human life. When we study how a religion seeks to regulate imagination we also perceive the imaginative character of that religion itself. The Hebrew Bible has no word for imagination: yetser, more correctly translated as "inclination" or "impulse," is the term used in such famous passages as Genesis 8:12 ("for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth"). A special word is needed only when the relation between the divine and the human sphere has become uncertain. Then imaginative representa tion supplements, even fills, in for, presence; and though the Bible is already a representation, its force consists precisely in making us receive not only stories in which God is a participant but stories which suggest that there was another epoch, when the Divine Presence was direct.1 That epoch of "open vision" is over by the time of Samuel, yet "prophets" continue to stand in a direct relation to the Word of God. Imagination, according to medieval Jewish philosophy, is the faculty that, when perfect, both receives and communicates this much of the divine influence. The imagination, however, had ambivalent status. Maimonides, fol lowing Aristotle, said that it was limited to sense impressions and their combination. It could not raise itself to truly abstract or immaterial conceptions, i.e. to philosophy; it produced, when it tried this, such fictions and phantasms as the corporeality of God. Yet without imagina tion, no prophecy. The divine influence, after passing through the active intellect and the reason, was received by an imagination which the PROOFTEXTS 5 (1985): 201-20 ? 1985 by Geoffrey H. Hartman</page><page sequence="2">202 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN higher animals shared with man. The ambivalence surrounding imagi nation centered on this contrast between its low position in the hierarchy of faculties and its sublime function in prophecy. Prophecy is therefore defined by Maimonides as "the most perfect development" of the imaginative faculty, and includes vision and dream (which the rabbis called "the unripe fruit of prophecy") as its two principal modes.2 What was to be done with a gift that could go so wrong, yet on which prophecy depends? Maimonides in effect moots the higher function of imagination by legislating prophecy out of existence until the messianic era. Yet imagi nation continued to trouble both philosophy and theology. It might be denounced, but could it be regulated, since it was not (by their own account) distinctively human? When prophetic, it was so not through the intellect which mankind shared, to a degree, with God; and when ordinary, it was something common also to beasts. But for its prophetic potential imagination would not have been an issue. To clarify the nature of imagination was to resolve a question of authority. Who speaks "for" God in an era of uncertain vision? It has been argued that the very formulation of the Mishnaic Code by the rabbis involved a daring transfer of authority: the Mishnah became Scripture, not just an exilic elaboration on Scripture.3 Imagination may always involve a question as to who speaks for God, or what authority such representations have. In the Pentateuch the authority of God is declaratively set down in the First and Second Commandments. The nearest statement, in fact, on imagination is the Second Commandment prohibition against graven images (Exodus 20:4-5), formulated in the context of religions with animal and astral gods. The prohibition did not suppress all figural representation, however. Bezalel is authorized in Exodus 31 (cf. Second Chronicles 2) to "devise skillful works ... in gold, and in silver, and in brass, and in cutting of stone" for the sanctuary in the wilderness.4 Excavations have uncovered the frescoes of the Dura Europos synagogue (3rd century C.E.), unusual for its depictions of even the human form; while the decorative arts flourished in the period of the Second Temple. Yet when such work might induce idol worship Cavodah zarah) it was curtailed; and certainly after the establishment of Christianity the visual arts did not develop as they did in Christian circles. Jewish craftsmanship was invested in ceremonial objects. If iconicity leads to idolatry, then the encouragement of a pictorial and iconic art by Christianity could have imposed a stricter application of the Second Commandment prohibition. The productive side of that prohibition, however, may have chan neled imaginative energies into writing, into graphic rather than graven forms. Whether the anti-iconic commandment stimulated aniconic forms of fantasy remains an open question: we still understand too little about the operation of a specifically verbal imagery.5 There is, in any case, no</page><page sequence="3">On the Jewish Imagination 203 glorification of the "human form divine" in Jewish thought, no sustained mythology that mingles, as in Greek polytheism, divine presences, nature-spirits and mankind, by representing all beings under the species of an aesthetic anchored in the human body. Yet nature as the physical world is not disparaged. While nature imagery in the paytanic tradition remains emblematic (Kallir's "Dew" with its strong rhyme and repetitions is a case in point), the presence in the canon of a moralized Song of Songs inspired a mode blending sacred and secular imagery. For Judah Halevi the Song magnetized?eroticized? other biblical passages and justified, as it were, his use of Arabic poetics. Even if he is celebrating a sacred marriage or the Shekhinah, it is by way of an oriental and opulent, not an ascetic, technique. Moreover, though power rather than beauty is the focus of many Psalms, it is from them that later tradition takes its sense of the sublimity of nature. The anti-iconic rule was formulated in the special context of repre senting the Divine, so that Judaism came to be characterized by a defen sive attitude toward anthropomorphism rather than toward nature. Yet Judaism, before the Haskalah, did keep its distance from natural philos ophy. The exceptions often show a Greek or Islamic influence: Ibn Gabirol's cosmological poetry in Keter malkhut (11th c.e.), or the conceit in the Wisdom of Solomon (circa 100 b.c.e.) taken up by Philo Judaeus, that the High Priest's robe described in Exodus 28 imaged the cosmos (the Greek allows a punning connection between hosmos as ornament and kosmos as world). In Berdyaev's words, the Jews are concerned with history, the Greeks with the cosmos. Consider the angels that link Judaism with folklore and pagan legend. They have no independent existence, and as in the Jacob/Jabbok episode (Genesis 32) are purged of their character as nature-spirits.6 A probable reason is, again, avoidance of idolatry. The Hebrews lived among nations whose gods were totems connected by webs of correspondence with the heavens above and the earth below. So that when the Bible dealt with nature it was either on the basis of regulation (laws on land-use, animals, consumption) or on the basis of a sublime imagery that clearly subordi nated nature to God and reflected the triumph rather than agon of Hebrew monotheism. An unusual moment, such as Deut. 31:28 and 32:1, in which heaven and earth are invoked as witnesses (as at the opening of Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound) is decisive in its very difference. Heaven and earth were eternal, were "gods" for the Greeks as for Near Eastern cults; and if Moses calls on them at this crucial point to confirm the covenant, and witness "against" the people, it is to imply that breaking the covenant may mean that earth and heaven will pass away, that they are eternal only as part of a contractual history beginning with God's promise after the flood. Pagan myth was full of rival deities associated with nature or its</page><page sequence="4">204 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN elements. Folklore, both Christian and Jewish, transformed them into good or evil spirits. Their dwelling place was generally the natural world that in its familiar beauty or unfamiliar and uncanny aspects could become a fatal distraction. One wonders what sort of imaginative com promise is found in the Shulhan carukh which incorporates a strong, apotropaic belief in evil spirits. Starting at dawn, we are instructed to guard against them by cleansing rituals, which extend to the mouth?the accumulation of blessings and laudations in Jewish prayer. Does this not acknowledge the "other side" of God, or that the soul, restored to the body at dawn, may have fallen prey during the night to estranging (impure) influences? Midrash had transmitted a host of legends about the animosity of the angels to Man, legends that may echo the manichean or polytheistic theme of a War in Heaven?the very basis of pagan epics and even of such belated bards as Milton and Blake. "He who makes peace in his heavens, may he in His mercy make peace among us and all Israel" (Kaddish). Though the Bible contains fewer of what Gunkel names "faded myths" than postbiblical literature does, traces of Titans and cosmic deities remain.7 The powerful cliches, contrasting Hebraism and Hellenism after Hegel's philosophy of history takes hold, and which attribute to Judaism a forbidding attitude toward nature, and a severe scruple concerning all forms of animism not framed by an emphasis on Divine mastery, make sense in one respect. Central to Jewish religion, insofar as it has a dogma, is the Shema\ the confession of God's unity. Any contamination of this unity by an idea of reconcilement that seeks to join to God a form of body or any shape from nature (demut guf) is rejected. Here one does glimpse the convergence of a principle of faith and a trait of imagination. It allowed Hegel to emphasize the inherently alien character of the Hebrew God. His unity, according to Hegel, was a non-union, mere empty transcendence, mere antagonism to everything including the creation itself. Hegel's view of Judaism is highly polemical, for he admires a very different kind of unity, the aesthetic balance of body and spirit in Hellenistic art, and the more intimate Christian mystery of the Incarna tion. Yet Hegel's portrait of Abraham may be unsurpassed in the clarity with which it highlights an uncompromising quest: The first act by which Abraham becomes the founding father of a nation is a separation, which severs the bond of communal being and love. . . . The very spirit that carried Abraham from his kin guided him throughout his encounters with foreign peoples for the rest of his life; this was the spirit of keeping himself rigorously antithetical to everything, having raised his thought [das Gedachte] to form a unity dominating an infinite and hostile nature. . . . He was a stranger on earth, a stranger to the soil and to men alike. . . . The whole world Abraham regarded as simply his opposite: if not a nullity, it was sustained by the God who was alien to it.8</page><page sequence="5">On the Jewish Imagination 205 The most searching affirmation of God's unity, or critique of the anthropomorphic imagination, remains that of Maimonides, whose Guide of the Perplexed made us forever conscious of the difficulty of metaphoric expression in religious thought. For any likeness, any comparison of the divine to the human, is bound to introduce an anthropomorphic element. The Bible is full of anthropomorphisms, though it is rarely theriomorphic; and since the God of Judaism continues to act in human history, the Maimonidean scruple heightens the difficulty of any God-talk (theology) that is not focused on the necessity of purifying imagination of meta phorical error. It remains a possibility that, a contrario, this scruple also helped to provoke Jewish mysticism, which in the form of the Zohar began the most dazzling phase of its career toward the end of the 13th century. For if metaphor cannot be avoided, and allegorical interpretation is always called for, then to the via negativa prescribed by Maimonides' method of reading there may be joined a via eminentia aiming at the same goal through hyperbolic modes of exegesis. With the Kabbalah, cosmic fantasy and demonology, though not absent from rabbinic legend or aggadah, broke forth and flourished anew. They are fueled, moreover, by the emphasis on Writing, by a name and letter mysticism that elicits magnificent hypostases. Both the ma'aseh hereshit and the ma'aseh merkavah?according to the Talmud and Maimonides mysteries for initiates only?become the very center of speculative fantasy. A community of spheres of being is envisaged, sus tained by the Torah, the measure of all things: "The Torah it was that created the angels and created all the worlds and through Torah are all sustained."9 The anti-iconic rule may have played in the Jewish imagination a role similar to the anti-theatrical prejudice in Protestant Christianity.10 The Yiddish theater as well as other kinds of Jewish spectacular and pictorial art developed after the Enlightenment. It was not circus or theater but Temple (or Palace) that haunted Jewish memory. The rabbinic imagination continued to evoke a memory-temple and preserve in detail every aspect of ancient ceremonial and ritual law. Non-acceptance of the diaspora, and love of Israel as the Holy Land to which body as well as spirit would eventually return, also kept Jews from letting imagination dwell on other places. There might be a covert or unconscious assimila tion of the art forms and imaginative habits of those nations amid which Jews were to live, but there was also a dissimilation which made these forms something of a camouflage or protective coloring for Westerners whose heart, like Judah Halevi's, remained in the East. How can we sing our songs in a foreign land? That has been the question since the Babylonian exile. The Jewish imagination, like any other, must exert itself and risk profanation, or fall silent and risk atrophy. Even if</page><page sequence="6">206 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN imagination is, by nature, always in exile, the tension in Jewish life between assimilation and dissimilation has been more continuous, because of the dispersion, and more intense, because of the anti-iconic rule. Despite exile, Judaism never became a mystery religion. The Lurianic Kabbalah skirted that possibility, yet even there one feels the persistence of a popular and earthbound element. Moreover, both the rabbinic and the kabbalistic imagination use gematria and similar "keys" mainly to intensify memory's cleaving to the written word, rather than to predict its obsolescence in fulfillment. As Walter Benjamin said of Judaism's conception of hope: it is not future-oriented but paradoxically "hope in the past." That past was nothing but ruins, yet the very shards and broken vessels contained a liberating spark. A permanent bequest of the Kabbalah to the Jewish imagination was its expansion (out of sparse talmudic sources) of the concept of the Shekhinah. This is a female figure related to popular Wisdom, and with an integrating earthly function. Though bride or companion of the kabbalistic sphere of kingship (malkhut), the Shekhinah is no fatal or mysterious lady. Accompanying the religious person as partner or guardian spirit, she is often imagined as combining two presences: the Divine Presence during Man's or God's exile and the wife's (mother's) presence when the wanderer is away from home. For a contemporary feminist critique of the Jewish imagination, the Shekhinah is crucial. Suggested is not only a redemption of but also a redemption through the womanly element. A stratum wells up that seeks to penetrate and expand the covenant. The Kabbalah as a redemption narrative dares to draw even God into the area of the passions. God too may be in exile. There is, how ever, little emphasis on the radical other, or an alien, terrifying and rejecting mystery (the mysterium tremendum).11 Nor on the radical dualism, rather than duplicity, of the world of appearances. Despite gnosis?the methodized suspicion that God is not One, but split in His essence, and that the Creator-God of the Bible may be a mere demiurge or even satanic adversary, weaver of the illusions that seduce us into worldliness?despite traces of such a belief, otherworldliness does not triumph and does not cancel the Torah's worldly subject matter. As a story of redemption Kabbalah draws the "lower crowns" or demonic energies into the upper spheres: it is an attempt at restoration or restitution (tikkun) which respects the nonapocalyptic tenor of Deuter onomy 30:11-14. . . . this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not too hard for thee, neither is it far off. It is not in heaven, that thou shouldst say: "Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it unto us. . . . and make us to hear it, that we may do it?" But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that thou mayest do it.</page><page sequence="7">On the Jewish Imagination 207 The anti-iconic bias, which could have led to mystery, was also modified by a principle of accommodation. Resting chiefly on Genesis 1:27, "And God created man in his own image," it evokes the likeness of man to God: there is a measure of analogy or symmetry between a transcendent creator and his creation. The importance of story and parable in Jewish tradition, and anthropomorphic expressions generally, reinforce this aspect of analogy, but so do the Bible's more intimate details, since God walks with Enoch and talks directly with Adam, Noah and Abraham (not an angel but He himself). He even contradicts Sarah in a surprising moment (Genesis 18:13-16). The principle of accommodation was recognized by the talmudic rabbis who said that in the Bible God adjusts himself to the human intellect: "The Torah speaks in the language of man." The Kabbalah, interested in expanding the analogical imagination, expresses the con trary aspects of divine transcendence and human likeness with an intensity that marks the Jewish imagination as a whole. "The world could not endure the Torah, if she had not garbed herself in garments of this world."12 Given these factors which modify the otherness or unlikeness of God?on the part of historical and secular Jewry, a protective if precarious assimilation, and, on the part of God, a deliberate accommo dation?can we insist that there is a single unified type of imagination that could be identified as Jewish? As we try to define the imagination through Jewish sources an additional problem arises. It characterizes modernity yet it remains linked to the historicizing tendencies mentioned above. Most scholars in the contemporary world stand both inside and outside Jewish tradition: we know the context of other mythic narratives; we know the interaction, later, of Hellenism and Judaism; we continue to explore the reciprocities found in Judeo-Spanish culture before expulsion, and in Judeo-Italian culture from the later 15th century on. To this must be added the efflorescence of Yiddish, sensitive to its surroundings, from the hasidic sages to the Holocaust; the philosophical and fictional productions of German Jewry; the reconstruction of Hebrew as a modern idiom; and the contemporary scene with its bewildering mixture of creative and scholarly writing, in America, in Israel, and increasingly in France. As we explore this interaction between historicizing factors and the imagination?as Jewish religion, in its biblical, rabbinic or extended form, connects with literature, comparisons leap to mind which again cast doubt on essentialist perspectives that propose a uniquely Jewish or Hebraic factor. We know that the mashal, or story-simile, an important vehicle of accommodation that makes the ways of God intelligible, is also a crucial feature of New Testament parables.13 Here, as in the case of the mystical poetry of John of the Cross, inspired by the Song of Songs, or in the</page><page sequence="8">208 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN case of William Blake's Four Zoas with their remarkable re-envisioning of the maaseh merkavah, common sources may have played their part. The clothes-philosophy of the Kabbalah finds a curious elaboration in Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, itself based on German Romantic speculations about the power and necessity of mediating symbols. In a poet like Dante (as close as one can get to the era which saw the rise of the Zohar) the Catholic imagination shapes a writer who unified the analogical sphere of likeness and the anagogical sphere of mystery and unlikeness. How deep do these similarities go, and how indebted are they to shared texts or modes of reading? Rather than losing myself in a methodological account of the diffi culties that beset the project of definition, I would like to propose a number of heuristic theses. Even when obvious they warrant repetition and scrutiny. (1) The Jewish imagination has been dominated by a turn to the written word, and has developed within the orbit of the Hebrew Bible. The Jews are a People of the Book, and their mind is text-dependent, even when it rebels against the text. They keep the word, not only the faith. Yet the Bible is an "encyclopedic form," to use Northrop Frye's useful designation: it is generically impure in that it mixes legends, poetry, legal prescriptions, proverbs (Wisdom literature), historical nar rative. This impurity contrasts with the spirit of Aristotle's Poetics, which establishes separate genres; with the increasing acceptance in the West of those genres; also with a modern tendency toward specialized knowl edge that insulates fields of inquiry from each other. The emphasis on genre, though it has not affected our esteem for the Bible (which is then simply viewed as a sourcebook for all genres), may influence in a negative way the reception of satellite compilations, such as Talmud, Midrash, Kabbalah, as well as chronicles that record the life and death of Jewish communities?the Memorbiicher and Yizker-books. The Jewish Prayer Book also, the Siddur, shows an accreted as well as stratified quality. It contains psalms and verbatim extracts from the Bible, sometimes modified by midrashic interpretation; liturgical poems or piyyutim that skillfully pastiche Bible phrases; Maimonidean philos ophy in the form of the Yigdal; and many composite prayers that plead with God in God's own words. Such interlaced biblical words and for mulas, petitionary or confessional, create a mosaic that treats the parent text synchronically, and whose historical and sequential elaboration? often motivated by forgotten or faded heresies?is hard to reconstruct. To an outsider this "Siddur" or "Order" is more like Chaos; what is reenacted, what functions as the orientation-point or dromenon?the original Temple ceremonies?is less visible here than in Catholic or Protestant worship. The famous story of the four who entered pardes reminds us that the</page><page sequence="9">On the Jewish Imagination 209 Talmud is even more confusing than the Bible. Everyone may enter, but not everyone emerges sound in spirit. There are, of course, genres within this contiguous writing, some of which may still be unrecognized. Just as Milton could depict the Song of Songs, for instance, as a Pastoral and the Book of Job as a "brief epic," just as Bishop Lowth could analyze the psalms as a species of "sublime" verse, so form-criticism is beginning to penetrate the Talmud. We dimly discern formulaic blocks, put together by an oral method of recitation before being fixed as script. In the Gemarah, and the midrashic parts of the Talmud, one often seems to overhear the Table Talk of the rabbis?the Prepared Table (shulhan carukh) was clearly an important occasion, a point of "assembly" that might escape suspicion and could serve political as well as theological purposes. A story recorded in the Haggadah about Rabbi Akiva and others, who conversed all night and almost forgot to recite the morning prayer, points in that direction. The text-dependency of the Jewish imagination means, already in the Bible itself, a respect for variant traditions and so a tension between Book and Order. God is One, but mankind or the Jewish people are not; and even though there must be a decision concerning the Law, the Talmud records divergent and adversary opinions. There is a reluctance, moreover, to speak except in the name of older authorities, as if any interruption of the chain of transmission could prove fatal. (Cf. the opening statement of the Pirke Avot and Halevi's Rabbi who asserts in the Kuzari that "uninterrupted tradition" is equal to the personal expe rience of revelation.) This anxiety about discontinuity is accompanied, especially in the Talmud, by an associative way of going from topic to topic that mixes law and lore and produces astounding feats of memorization. It lacks, however, that hypotactic unity of form or field characteristic of learned treatises in the West, and which Maimonides began to impose in his Mishneh Torah, by distinguishing between Code and Commentary. And though the closing of the biblical canon, as of the Talmud, was important for orthodox practice, in a sense neither of these biblia becomes esoteric because their study is formally en joined. The difference between margin-text (commentary) and main-text (Talmud/Torah) is preserved; yet the margin continues to grow, and the commentary-process was recognized as founded on Sinai, where God, it is said, gave Moses the Oral Law (commentary) as well as the Written (the fixed code of the Torah). In sum, Jewish writing is liberated by the broad encyclopedic form of biblical literature and a commentary process that circumvents such categorical distinctions as "scholarly" and "creative;" yet it is also hemmed in by an exemplary tradition which attributes everything to a divine source?refers it back to the Bible or to the chain of authority. (2) While apologetic works, therefore, like Halevi's Kuzari, can ven</page><page sequence="10">210 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN ture forth in the name of their author, imaginative and speculative works, like the Zohar, remain pseudoepigraphic. A crucial part of the Zohar claims to be an ancient Midrash, and speaks in the person of Simeon ben Yohai, a talmudic sage of the 2nd century c.E. Comparing Dante's Commedia to the Zohar, we see that both transform learning into a highly allusive form of art. Yet in Dante the exegetical frame falls away?is burnt off like mist by the genius of a writer who enters his poem in propria persona, who is as historical as the people he describes. There is no incognito. The Zohar, however, continues to use exegesis as a supremely imaginative device on which, as on the Torah, everything depends. It expands the realm of analogy and explores "spheres" of being as intensively as Dante, yet refuses to shed its pseudoepigraphic cover and become recognizably historical. Even in contemporary Jewish writing the pseudoepigraphic impulse persists. So Edmond Jabes, in his Book of Questions, plays not only on the responsa form of medieval advisories, but on the Jewish tendency to depict everything as a Saying of the Fathers. (The talmudic rabbis gave a hint by inventing Ben BagBag.) Modern Jewish literature arises as an invo luntary or insubordinate midrash: we do not find free-standing works of art but the retold tale, the recycled motif, a sense of time that plays with the illusion of time, and a style composed both of explicit and inner quotations. The imagination can feel tradition as a suffocating burden. Some writers welcome the personifying power of the pseudoepigraphic style; others resent becoming pseudoepigraphic against their will. Hence Berdichevsky's complaint: "Our egos are not our own, our dreams and our thoughts are not our own, our will is not the one implanted in us; everything we were taught long ago, everything has been handed down to us."14 That similar expressions about the burden of tradition are found in other modern literatures should not blind us to the acute nature of that problem in Judaism, where forgetfulness is sinfulness, and where Bible and Talmud have taught us to respect every word of their condensed, unschematic style. Bialik, who called for a Hebrew dictionary whose purpose would go beyond antiquarian collecting, because philology should "bring the language to bud and bloom, to grow in strength; it must be a sort of midwifery," also foresees the necessity of a selection from the past equivalent to the hatimah (canonical closure) that created Bible, Mishnah and Talmud.15 The secular writer is caught between a poetics of quotation imitative of midrash and so remaining in the field of force of these canonical texts, and the need to make room for a supplementary modern scripture?still, perhaps, an "ecriture du desastre" (Maurice Blanchot), yet based on a reanimated and circulating language that seeks to purge itself of inflated or sacred phraseology. A more historical way of putting this is to say that the modern</page><page sequence="11">On the Jewish Imagination 211 Jewish imagination had to pass at once through Renaissance and Enlightenment phases. It had to develop a distincively secular idiom?of thought as well as speech?raiding its own traditions; and so it could not escape (except by contrafactura or parody methods) the very Medievalism it wished to overcome. Agnon's fiction is a well-known example; but even in such Yiddish writers as Bashevis Singer (more indebted to the Russian novella's intimate realism), learning stimulates as well as burdens creative writing. We find veiled convenantal emblems, overt remi niscences of older storytellers, multilingual resonances, and?above all?the use of "keys." Compare the role of the "lost key" in Agnon's A Guest for the Night with the same theme in Singer's "A Friend of Kafka" and "The Key." Kafka himself, whose problem as a writer has to do with composing in an alien tongue, differs from both Agnon and Singer in creating a fictional world that seems deprived of "keys" that could open it to tradition or even to its own meaning. Kafka is important for both Jewish and world literature because his fictions are either anti-parables (we cannot find the key to the bet midrash that would open them to a trained exegetical understanding), or allegorical in Walter Benjamin's sense: without an exit into meaning, into some "keyed" form of understanding. (3) Though Christianity attempted to set the "spirit" against the "letter" by treating the Bible as a transcended Book of Laws, or stories blind to what they prophesied, for Jews this split between letter and spirit did not occur, or else was repaired by inventive exegetical methods which kept the law-portion and the story-portion as a single, inalienable donation. Here was God's plenty indeed. The driest list of names, as of the chiefs of Edom in Genesis, was potentially as crucial for interpretation as the Ten Commandments. Yet what legitimacy, in that case, might there be for the free rather than bound imagination?for what we now call secular art? By its very nature, commentary (or literature masking as commentary) was aware that its nomos lay in the Bible, that it had no autonomy, that it must strive to win the blessing of a patriarchal text. Jewish fantasy, therefore, is always shadowed by profanation. The fear of profanation becomes explicit when Hebrew is revived as a modern idiom; it hovers over most attempts at creative writing from Bialik to Amichai. The view that extends this anxiety to earlier periods?for Classical Judaism's adherence to the received text could hide revisionist aims?suggests that the transformation of Hebrew from a sacred into a secular tongue repeats what is always the case. The Jewish imagination fears not only hillul hashem, profanation in the legal and ritual sense, but a less deliberate abuse: one that accompanies use and is inherent in literature itself as it broadcasts?scatters?the words of Scripture by giving them new or extended referents. The fear of profaning Scripture, of using its words to "uncover</page><page sequence="12">212 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN one's face/' is not confined to modern writers. There are moving stories about the early rabbis' relation to the Bible as a sacred and prophetic document. Homer they punned into rlamor (ass). But the Bible had to be inserted into the daily and often catastrophic life of the community. To legitimate writing, even in the form of commentary, was therefore to view it as an original repetition of Scripture. Pagan myth, Jane Harrison showed, and Thomas Mann recalled in "Freud and the Future," was based on persons merging with an archetypal role or story, so that the individual life became a sacred drama.16 This kind of repetition, dangerously imitative and fulfilling, and closely linked to theater, is almost entirely absent from Judaism. There writing is lived through?worked through?as writing, and does not cancel itself by a mythic or messianic sort of incarnation. We see, in fact, an inversion of that pattern: the repetition performed by Jewish writers leads from World to Torah by the art of quotation already mentioned, or a virtuoso technique of verbal transformation and interpolation that journeys from one "prooftext" to another. There is no name in tradition for that pattern, which is anti-incarnationist or counter-typological. But many sayings typify it: that God looked into the Torah before creating the world, or to quote Jabes: Writing is ... a scrupulously Jewish act, for it consists in taking up a pen in that place where God withdrew Himself from his words; it consists indefi nitely in pursuing a Utopian work in the manner of God who was the Totality of the Text of which nothing subsists.17 From this perspective, all words are tsimtsumim. Or, what may be the same, writing as commentary is the expression of a post-prophetic age, where even the bat-kol is questioned, so that every author stands poten tially under the accusation of being a false messiah or of counterfeiting the Word. The catastrophes suffered by the Jews only intensified the danger of profanation?of blasphemy ("Curse God and die"), or of liquidating the burden of tradition. The severest disaster since the destruction of the Second Temple, the Holocaust, has led some to question the very possibility of avoiding profanation, except by dint of keeping silent. "A bloody dew clings to the flowers of speech," Karl Kraus remarked about the brutality of Nazi expressions. It is not the ineffable but the unspeakable that weighs on Paul Celan, who strangles lyric eloquence, who does not accuse the Bible but rather the language of the murderers, in which he continues to write. Others who have rejected silence, like Elie Wiesel, reanimate an eloquence that has become doubtful, yet is inspired by the hasidic masters or even by Scripture; by Job, for example, who rejects false comfort and cries to God, contending, arguing, calling Him to witness, refusing to cover up.</page><page sequence="13">On the Jewish Imagination 213 (4) Perhaps the remarkable humor of the Jews?Jewish jokes may be the one "genre" their imagination has specifically contributed?also bypasses silence and assuages the anguish of profanation. Jokes, Freud saw, escape the censor; they are often (when Jewish) self-deprecating; they reconcile disparities, as in matchmaker stories that put the best face or legs on everything; yet they skirt blasphemy, since anything can be their target. They are brief, moreover, and so resemble the "sayings" important to Jewish life and its storytellers. (Even when as lengthy as Agnon's "Forevermore" they seem to be brief, twisting and turning ironically.) They can mock the exquisite pilpul of talmudic commentary while celebrating, or reducing to absurdity, the wary ingenuity of the oppressed, as in Freud's Pinsk/Minsk joke. Above all, they share with Midrash its unusual habit of inventing dialogues of the most colloquial sort?dialogues that are intimate even in sacred contexts. Martin Buber's fundamental words, "I" and "Thou," that institute a relation of dialogue between God and man, or man and man, may grow out of this tradition, though its secular source is in German Romanticism and its sublimer source is Job's "Call Thou, and I will answer; Or let me speak, and answer Thou me." For Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav such a dialogue can take place whatever the distance between generations: it is of the very essence of commentary. For one person may raise a question, and the other who is far away in time or space may comment on it or ask a question that answers it. So they converse, but no one knows it save God, who hears, records and brings together all the words of men, ?s it is written: "They who serve the Lord speak to one another, and the Lord hears them and records their words in His book" (Mal, 3:16). There is almost always something pithy and humorous in the midrashic or hasidic anecdote: an unexpected detour, a sly consequence. Compare a comment from Vayikra Rabbah that develops Jacob's dream at Luz of angels ascending and descending, with a story about the Baal Shem Tov. In the midrash God suggests to Jacob that he should ascend the ladder with the angels, but Jacob is wary or fearful?could he sustain being angelic, would he not have to descend again? So, despite God's reassurance, he does not go up; and God tells him that had he believed and gone up, he would never have come down, but now his descendants are destined to be enslaved to the "Four Kingdoms." Jacob asks, Will this endure for ever? and God answers him it will not: ultimately Israel will be redeemed. (So Jacob gains something after all.) About the Baal Shem Tov it is related that he was the only person to ascend to heaven while still alive, and that God offered to let him stay. But he refuses the offer saying: if I stay here, and do not return to earth, I lose my chance of going to Israel. (5) These anecdotes suggest a further characteristic of the Jewish imagination. There is a reticence within its ascendental or messianic</page><page sequence="14">214 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN fervor. This holding back can appear as a lack of faith (so in Jacob's response, perhaps; so in the accusation of the Church against Israel). It can also be a justifiable wariness of false promises or prophets, or more profoundly a knowledge that God is not above "testing" his servants. It may express itself as disinterest in personal salvation: what matters is the covenant, the return of the entire community to Israel. He who gives up heaven for Eretz Yisrael shows an ahavat Tsion (love of Zion) that is surely redemptive. The reticence I mention contrasts vividly with the relation between Word and Promise, or Scripture and Fulfillment, in Christianity. I sug gested that difference when describing the repetitious yet unmystical nature of Jewish thought. To "fill the figure" was the technical expression for the interpretive method of Christian typology: so the words of Christ are said to subsume and complete the "Old" Testament, which contains but shadows and types of a truth now fully disclosed.18 Moreover, the words of Christ are subsumed and completed by Himself, by the Incarnation, which failed to bring time to an end but identified Christ as the Savior and inaugurated the Messianic Age (Annus Domini). Though Judaism is not devoid of speculation about First and Last Things?Gershom Scholem has shown that "normative" Jewish thought coexisted with a powerful current of messianic expectation?there is no doctrine that fixes itself in detailed pictures of heaven or hell, or other worldly time. This restraint cuts two ways, however. The repression of eschatological yearnings may have been greater in Judaism than in Christianity, precisely because the latter allowed them a shared and authorized system of symbols. Scholem uses the catastrophic episode of Sabbatai Zevi to suggest that the acceptance of secular history by rabbinic Judaism was more precarious than previous scholarship had envisaged.19 Yet the anti-iconic rule also strengthened an anti-apocalyptic tendency. In this, a great pictorial artist like Rembrandt is peculiarly Jewish. He may contrast an opulent costume or golden helmet or other highlight with the ordinary, material and domestic, world, yet what is represented remains stable and evokes a world of such highlights and shadows rather than a drive for transfiguration. And, as Erich Auerbach has pointed out, biblical stories like the sacrifice of Isaac create a hermeneutic rather than iconic?pictorially clarified?space.20 Even if, as one recent critic has said, we are all "fulfillment men" (F. Kermode), and even if the insistence in Judaism on the binding of spirit to place (the land of Israel) is as messianic a form of imagination as any other, the Church saw correctly that the patriarchs were always striving "with God and with men," that the promise or blessing was never bestowed fully on the single one. Contact with God, in fact, is so demanding that no individual, not even Moses, can perfect Israel's mis sion. The covenant is with the community as a whole, and every leader</page><page sequence="15">On the Jewish Imagination 215 proves fallible. Indeed, so circumspect is the Bible's attitude toward human authority that Moses is deprived of grave and cult-place. Though "there hath not arisen a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face," "no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto this day" (Deut. 34). We learn, likewise, very little about the great rabbis of the Classical period, except through their sayings and anecdotes. While Christian tradition abounds in the lives of saints and meditations on the life of Jesus, in Judaism no sacred biography exists.21 Philo's Life of Moses is the Hellenic exception. Not until recent years, when the issue of political leadership becomes crucial once more, do Ahad Ha'am, Martin Buber and others begin a modern meditation on Moses, and historical novels by such writers as Sholem Asch and Lion Feuchtwanger become popular. (Even Freud once called his Moses and Monotheism a historical novel.) (6) Yet there is something incongruous in ascribing reticence to the Jewish imagination. Reticence? Are the Prophets reticent, when they give Israel an imaginative foretaste of the worst and the best, the blessing and the curse, so that it might "choose life?" Is Isaiah reticent when he envisions the labor pains of the messianic age as well as the peace to follow: "the wolf and the lamb shall feed together. . . . They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, saith the Lord" (65:25)? Those who speak in the name of the Lord cannot be called reticent, even when His words are felt to be a consuming fire (Jeremiah) or a burden they shun (Jonah). Christian messianism is, after all, explicitly based on Hebrew anticipations. It is here that we reach an impasse; for to define the Jewish imagina tion is seen to involve the religious imagination generally, at least in the monotheistic West. What does it mean to imagine God? Not a god, but God who is One and is clearly more?by the time the Hebrew Bible reaches us?than a victor, tyrant or usurper who has triumphed over other tribal or national gods, now reduced to idols. Comparative religion may restore that perspective; Hegel may indict (as well as admire) the abstractness of the Hebraic conception; the Enlightenment, culminating in Feuerbach's view, may see all such forms as enthusiastic figments and phantasms produced by the human spirit which libels and alienates its own powers, which gives itself over into the hands of priests, of estab lished religion?the fact remains that the Jewish imagination gave us the God of the Bible as the Bible of God. That communicative bond, strengthened by a hermeneutic tradition of over two thousand years, may be the determining feature, rather than a mysterious "reticence." We cannot say that a Jewish imagination existed prior to the Hebrew Bible, where nothing quite as gorgeous or fantastic as the Apocalypse of St. John is found. The Hebrew canon ends with two books of Chronicles (a turbulent history that looks to the</page><page sequence="16">216 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN restoration of the First Temple) not with cosmic cycles of destruction and a vision of the Last Things. In Isaiah the anticipation of redemption focusses on God, on what He will do, and what the community covenanted to Him must do, not on a redeemer figure (the "suffering servant") who remains shadowy. That redemption will issue from the line of Jesse and David is a living tradition, but the imaginative center in Judaism is not the Person. When the Messiah comes, he may come incognito, and time will not end, necessarily. The No given to Christ may have reinforced this anti-apocalyptic strain, but it also confirms the Hebrew Bible's attitude toward human and fallible mediators. Even the "strong hand," therefore, of systematic theology is resisted in Judaism. There is no other hand like that which brought the Jews out of bondage, and wrote what it wrought. Story and testimony prevail; and when, close to our time, the impulse to theological discourse revives, it tries to underwrite rather than codify, to restate the qualities found in the tradition. So Rosenzweig's Star of Redemption wishes to free religious thought from "the tic of a timeless coming-to-knowledge" which has influenced both philosophy and theology. He aims to disturb even the dialectic?always resolved, always progressive?of the German idealist tradition by proposing a type of discourse he names Sprechdenken (speech-thought).22 His praise of Sprechdenken?that it is time-haunted, that it does not know in advance what will appear, that its key-words are given it by others (audience, dialogue partners, tradition), that it is, in sum, temporal rather than totalizing?recalls, surely, the aphoristic and anecdotal mode of Hillel, Yohanan ben Zakkai and other rabbis who met the challenge of being authorities in a post-prophetic age. Feeling the pressure of history on time, they improvised in a way that gave time to time (Rabbi Tarfon). Other types of response are acknowledged by them?faith healing, wonder-working, and even attempts to provoke the Messiah, because these too were of that time. Yet they continue to be interpreters rather than founders. The Fathers did not know, and we do not know, what will come about. According to Rosenzweig, modern philosophy is mistaken on two counts: as a science of history it presumes it can find out exactly what happened, and so entertains the thought that objective knowledge may help to make the past forgettably past; and as a philosophy of (replacing) religion it seeks despite itself a uniquely fulfilling moment in and beyond time. Rosenzweig suggests that for its pet-term eigentlich (verily, really, authentically) we should substitute the inconspicuous word "and." This "and," he writes, "was the first deriving from expe rience; so it must return among the last of truth." The "and" signifies relation and drives us back from thought to experience: "God and world and man." Yet this "and," like the Hebrew "ve," is a connective that links</page><page sequence="17">On the Jewish Imagination 217 episodes paratactically rather than hypotactically, and subverts any last word. Not "end" but "and." Rosenzweig posits, moreover, an "and" that allows a passing over of the book into what he punningly defines as dailiness and total day (All-tag). A redemptive rather than apocalyptic appropriation of time is evoked, a "door" leading out of books into a Nichtmehrbuch (No-longer-book), or the direct seeing of "the likeness of the world in God's face" ("Weltgleichniss im Gottesantlitz"). This program, like that of the Kabbalah, exalts the analogical imagi nation. As such it is potentially transgressive and triggers a strangely figurative language, almost as thick as Heidegger's. The "stepping" of the book toward this border-vision, Rosenzweig writes, is a sin that can only be purged by its ceasing to be a book: "Aufh?ren des Buchs." The word "Aufh?ren" is an undeveloped pun suggesting a passing from the closeted act of writing to an excursive and ecstatic hearing ("auf-h?ren"). Any discussion of the Jewish imagination's relation to time has to mention the Sabbath. Not only because there is so much surrounding mystical lore, so much ritual adornment and safeguarding of that day. But also because the institution of the Sabbath is itself an invention of the highest imaginative order. It exemplifies the way halakhah (law) grows out of or interacts with a more fluid aggadah (lore). Bialik wrote: "Living and energetic halakhah is aggadah in its past and future state, and vice-versa. What are all the 613 commandments of the Torah but the last result, the synthesis upon synthesis of mythic words, of aggadah and immemorial customs. . . ." Halakhah, though a piecemeal historical mosaic, is as concentrated a work as the great medieval cathedrals of Cologne, Milan and Paris. "The children of Israel have their own mag nificent creation, a day holy and sublime, the 'Sabbath Queen'." It is the result, Bialik claims, of a spiritual labor at once pedantic and gigantic, to which generations of individual thinkers have collectively contributed. Every halakhic objection, every fence or limitation, is but a new ornament and picturesque addition to the Sabbath. As the laborious fruit of halakhic discussion, the Sabbath is aggadah through and through.23 There have been other, more speculative studies of such holidays, or of rituals associated with them: by Eliade, Gaster and Reik.24 Such studies involve large assumptions about the mind's relation to itself and prehistory: what originary event is being commemorated, how much history or reality (always catastrophic) we can bear, the role of memory and memory effacement, and what psychic structures have developed, obsessional or life-enhancing. What is certain is that how a people orders its time, how it keeps its calendar, is a way of regulating and directing the imagination. The reasons given in the Bible for remembering the Sabbath are clear enough: they combine an episode in God's own "life" (that he rested from the work of creation on the seventh day) with an episode in Israel's history</page><page sequence="18">218 GEOFFREY H. HARTMAN (the liberation from Egypt). The two converging reasons form a very strong bond. The historical commemoration realistically counterpoints any mystical tendency to brood on the "life" of God, and it suggests that unending labor (or its anxious effect on the mind) is slavery. In short, it authorizes a limited "time out" for imagination. The diviner reason for the Shabbat is also essential: it introduces monotheism into the calendar, it subordinates the week to a creator who is not only unafraid to rest but consecrates that pause. There is almost no trace of a conflict in heaven or that the weekdays may have had a theophoric linkage. The originality of this account, as of the Bible generally, has less to do with its priority in history than with its success in displacing or even effacing mythic names which comparative religion and linguistic research have never quite restored. Revelation includes a radical act of imagination of this kind, so inventive that it gives the impression of being a creation ex nihilo. Department of Comparative Literature Yale University NOTES This essay will appear in A Handbook of Jewish Theology, ed. Arthur A. Cohen and Paul Mendes-Flohr to be published by Charles Scribner's Sons, N.Y., in 1986. 1. Words denoting mental action are notoriously difficult to translate. For each language, or literary corpus, the semantic field may be differently constituted. So mashal and hashav, or words formed on the root d-m-h, may also approximate in the Bible what we mean by imaginative activity. (Buber solves the problem of yetser in his German translation of the Bible by the complex periphrasis "Gebild der Planungen seines Herzens/' that is, "imagery pertaining to the plans in man's heart.") This is the place to indicate that "no open vision" (see below) may mean "infrequent vision"; there is clearly, however, the sense of punctuated time, of a period. Unmediated vision is in doubt. Now there must arise a reflection, positive or negative, on the relation of vision to imagination. Writing about mysticism, Scholem also presupposes a "first stage" world in which divine presence(s) can be experienced without recourse to intermediaries or ecstatic meditation. "There is no room for mysticism as long as the abyss between Man and God has not become a fact of the inner consciousness." See G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, 3rd rev. ed.

The apparent contradiction between Exodus 20:4-5 and such passages as Exodus 25:2-31 or Exodus 31 prompted much commentary. Nahama Leibowitz brings together Don Isaac Abarbanel, Shemot Rabba and Midrash Aggada Teruma in her Studies in the Weekly Sidra (1st Series), "Teruma." 5. Even literary analysis has not contributed much to this question. The unresolved</page><page sequence="19">On the Jewish Imagination 219 issue, always falling back from theory into case-study, is the relation of states of mind? collective or individual?with structures of representation. Hegel's intricate dialectic in The Phenomenology of Mind can suggest the difficulty of cultural typing within a historical schematism. There are, of course, interesting hints bearing on writers that seem to have developed an iconoclastic (or onomatoclastic) technique. Coleridge remarks on Milton's allegory of Sin and Death in Paradise Lost, Book 2: "The grandest efforts of poetry are where the imagination is called forth, not to produce a distinct form, but a strong working of the mind, still offering what is still repelled, and again creating what is again rejected; the result being what the poet wishes to impress, namely, the substitution of the unimag inable for a mere image." (The role of music, in this regard, and its relation to biblical or other liturgical texts, might be of interest here.) See also on Milton's "half-interdicted images," and his conception of verbal action that may lead back to Philo of Alexandria's logos tomaeus, Sanford Budick, The Dividing Muse: Images of Sacred Disjunction in Milton's Poetry (New Haven and London, 1985). 6.
