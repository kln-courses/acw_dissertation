<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHEN TIFFT Drole de Guerre: Renoir, Farce, and the Fall of France FOR A FILM OF FORMIDABLE complexity, Jean Renoir's La Regle du jeu (The Rules of the Game) has been assigned a puzzlingly straightforward historical provenance by one who should know. Renoir conceived the film from the first as a means of expressing, however indirectly, his fury with the Munich appeasement agreement and his anxiety over the state of Europe on the brink of World War II.' Though he did not make that context explicit in the film, Renoir suggests that the representation of his dread unfolded with ineluctable accuracy: When I made La Regle dujeu I knew where I was going. I knew the sickness that preyed upon my contemporaries. That doesn't mean that I knew how to give a clear idea of this sickness in my film. But my instinct guided me. The consciousness of danger furnished me with the situations and the cues, and my comrades felt as I did. How anxious we were! I think the film is good. But it's not so difficult to do good work when the compass of anxiety indicates the true direction.2 But most viewers of The Rules of the Game would have a right to be baffled by his assurance on this point. For Renoir chose to stage his drama of disastrous appeasement in the form of a country-house farce, whose triangular love interests culminate in a night of misrule-the "Fete de la Coliniere"-catalyzed by the usual comic agents of insurrectionary disruption: champagne, music, libido, darkness, theatrical disguise.3 His film, in its widest implications, thus provokes us to conceive of history as farce and of farce as political argument. The Rules of the Game reflects Renoir's understanding of the difficulty of this project. The fes- tivities do propel themselves toward an unexpected catastrophe (the killing of Jurieu) that wrenches the film into a somber mode of address better suited to the mood and concerns of July 1939; and by this gloomy light it is possible to read the preoccupations of the fete retroactively as upper-class investments that are decisively ill-attuned to the disaster to come, and that may invite disaster through the oblivion they foster. But since the state of mind that Renoir criticizes is marked by elements associated with farce-frivolity, solipsism, diversion, play-acting, mechanical patterns of behavior, disruptive passion, and unchecked imagina- tion-his strategy seems to risk being not only misguided but even morally and politically identified with that state of mind. Despite its satiric energies, the farci- REPRESENTATIONS 38 * Spring 1992 ? THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA 131</page><page sequence="2">cal main body of the film seems a diversion from the course of Renoir's political argument, which it apparently rejoins only by succumbing to the tragic ending; in itself, the fete would represent dread over Munich only by failing to represent it. Yet still more perplexing than Renoir's logic in choosing a comic form for The Rules of the Game is the fact that his audience was not insensible to the political argument of this comedy. On the contrary, they reacted immediately to their sense of something urgent and baleful in its design. At its premiere on 7 July 1939, the audience rioted, drowning out the dialogue with their booing and whis- tling, smashing their seats in protest, even attempting to set the theater afire.4 The film was widely attacked in the press; its only support came from a number of film critics who recognized its distinction on cinematic grounds, and from the political Left, which seems to have assumed that it was intended as a denunciation of the decadent upper classes. Right-wing periodicals attacked it with particular violence; the Union sacree, a French clerical fascist group, staged protests at each screening of the film.5 Nor were its enemies limited to zealots from the political fringes. In the highest political circles it was regarded as a threat to the war effort: three months after its debut, and one month after England and France declared war on Germany, the French government banned The Rules of the Game as "demor- alizing." (The occupying Nazi authorities also banned it less than a year later, for reasons of their own.) Contemporary reviews suggest that few viewers had a very clear idea of just what the content of the film's partisan polemics might be; yet instinctively they were convinced of its politically objectionable nature, and seem to have sensed a corresponding obscure aggression in Renoir's perverse derangement of generic norms.6 Renoir invites this reaction, as is apparent in the film's opening gesture. The first image we see-just before an epigraph from Beaumarchais staking the claims of amorous caprice-is the following headnote: This entertainment (in which the action takes place on the eve of the 1939 war) does not aspire to be a study of morals. The characters presented are purely fictitious. (26)7 Even without the parenthetical remark, an ironic implication is patent: we are to assume that this disclaimer is deceitful, or rather that it tells the truth by plainly pretending to the opposite of what it means. Here "entertainment" signifies a representational form that not only conducts social analysis incognito but appar- ently, in order to do so, assumes a strategic posture of bland good humor that we are invited not to count on. In the same gesture, Renoir gives this ruse a spatial inflection that has impli- cations for the relation of farce and history. "Entertainment" translates divertisse- ment, or "diversion"; and according to one connotation of farce exploited in The Rules of the Game, France suffers at this moment of crisis from the diversion of its political energies to dangerously frivolous pursuits, thus inviting-to take this 132 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="3">notion of farce in its temporal dimension-a calamitous, bathetic replaying of the past according to merely mechanical imperatives. Yet I will argue, drawing on Marx's important model for the relation of farce and history, that the film also articulates this relation in a less reductive way: figuring farce as the overloading of space with conflicting motives and actions, it relocates the problems of the displacement of political intentions and the confusion of genres within farce itself, understood as a volatile field of representation marked by interpretive overload. It follows that what is farcical is not merely the comic shape of Renoir's political argument but the entire oblique conjuncture of farce and history. If the action of The Rules of the Game emerges from the delirious fete into the chilling nocturnal clarity of its concluding homicide, and thereby-at least allegorically- into the political realm once again, that is only because it has been driven to do so by the energies of farce. As far as the Munich crisis is concerned, then, we must be prepared to table the film's social satire as a supplementary issue, and to attend instead to its more inchoate forms of political awareness, its more subliminal artic- ulations of historical crisis. These are rerouted into the discourse of farce (in itself a farcical proceeding), and it is in that discourse that we must seek to recover them. Strange Defeat: Staging Farce in History With this detour into the fete, Renoir dislocates the program of social criticism announced in perhaps the most celebrated sequence in the film, the hunt scene. This scene establishes early in the film a satirical perspective whose forth- rightness misleads many viewers into underestimating the farcical subversion to come, partly by dint of a rhetorically regimented spatial order closer in spirit to Eisenstein than to Renoir. The aristocrats, bristling with double-barreled shot- guns, are posted at a row of blinds at one edge of the marquis de la Chesnaye's woods, while at the other end a dozen or more domestic servants dressed in white smocks and armed with sticks form a parallel row. At the signals of La Chesnaye and his Alsatian gamekeeper, Schumacher, the beaters move forward through the trees, rapping the trunks with their sticks and whistling and trilling so as to start the game and drive it before them. When the animals have fled through the woods and reached the edge of the field where the shooting blinds are set, the quail and pheasants take flight and the rabbits race past the blinds, all perfectly positioned for the guests' shooting pleasure; a festival of rapid-fire carnage ensues as birds flutter heavily to the ground and rabbits tumble to their end. Servants and dogs at last collect the killed game in sacks, and the gentry retire to the chateau. The hunt sequence exposes the play of aristocratic pleasure as a form of Drole de Guerre 133</page><page sequence="4">heedless violence, whose institutional character is emphasized in the inexorable spatial structure of the hunt as the servants drive the victims, left to right, to their waiting masters. In thus depicting the aristocrats as mere functionaries in a relentless social mechanism, Renoir departs from his surprisingly nuanced, if headlong, characterization, even during the mad amorous pursuits of the fete, of the often well-meaning and adaptable efforts of La Chesnaye, his wife Christine, and their endearing parasitic friend Octave (even, to a lesser extent, of La Ches- naye's mistress Genevieve, and Christine's love-addled, unrequited suitor Jurieu) to negotiate their positively Parisian tangle of liaisons, conflicted desires, and cross-allegiances. Nonetheless, the film's closing revelations-particularly the shooting of Jurieu and its aftermath-moot such personal discriminations by forcing the perhaps painful conclusion that it may not matter whether, as Octave says, everyone has good reasons, whether individual behavior manages to miti- gate or even to rise above the systemic culpabilities of class and gender. For in the end the social system channels power in a way that will protect the privilege of its masters, whether they are too sensitive actively to wish for so ruthless a disposition or not. When, in an early discussion about the damage that the proliferating rabbits (whose ranks are to be notably thinned by the hunt) are doing to the young trees on La Chesnaye's estate, Schumacher suggests putting up fences around the young trees, the marquis replies curtly, "I don't want any wire-netting, and I don't want any rabbits: the rest is up to you, my friend" (57). It is precisely the function of the social mechanism that La Chesnaye commands to attend to his needs without obliging him to insist on his prerogatives; the same mechanism will ensure that Jurieu, who minutes before has been given painful leave by La Ches- naye to run off with Christine (whose love both men think-wrongly-Jurieu has won), will be conveniently dispatched by a shotgun blast from La Chesnaye's gamekeeper, rolling over "just like a rabbit" as he dies. Thus, if the fete compro- mises the blunt social critique of the hunt scene by showing its inadequacy on the level of personal ethics, it still ends up confirming that critique as a class analysis unveiling the systemic wielding of force beyond personal intention. It is precisely in its mechanistic functioning-even at play, hunting or philandering-that the ruling class protects and vindicates its power.8 But if we are to believe Renoir's comments, the film's work has only begun with the hunt scene: for despite the cogency of the social critique it crystallizes, this image of the violent playing out of aristocratic privilege does not address Renoir's fury over the Munich accord and dread of its consequences. At this his- torical juncture, it is apparently the pacifism of this class, not its power, that the film is meant to decry. How is France's danger or disgrace broached through the imagery of the hunt, in this evidently pivotal scene? For just as Renoir, in making the film, has turned from the gravity of the Munich crisis to a comic form, so he turns at this point within the film from the thematics of aristocratic rapacity in the hunt to the farcical delirium of the fete; if this analogy holds, the hunt would 134 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="5">correspond to the nation's calamitous posture. But what, if not rapacity, are we to object to? The logic of Munich which so disturbed Renoir and many of his compatriots suggests that calamity would lie in an attitude of petrified acquiescence. The Munich agreement (the "Four-Power Pact" of 30 September 1938 by which Ger- many, Italy, France, and the United Kingdom determined to force Czechoslo- vakia to cede to Germany the Sudetenland, a strongly fortified region containing a heavy concentration of ethnic Germans) enabled Hitler in one stroke to remove one of the most important defenses against German expansionism in Eastern Europe and to enlarge his Reich, and it eventually helped him to turn his undi- vided attentions to the invasion of France. The consistency with which the French and the British swallowed Hitler's successive disclaimers, and matched his esca- lating demands with an ever more extravagant flexibility of response, amounted in the end to an almost suicidal form of moral and strategic paralysis.9 A similar paralysis, in the form of obligingly standing pat as dangers mount to exceed one's control, haunts The Rules of the Game. By the same grim logic that protects La Chesnaye from interlopers, even what ought to be its opposite, namely flexibility, effectively amounts at crucial moments to a sort of moral lassitude that ends in disaster. It is La Chesnaye's ability to see another's point of view, and to give way when events seem to demand it-he yields Christine to Jurieu, "since her happi- ness, it would seem, resides in this departure" (148)-which ultimately (if acci- dentally) leads to the catastrophe of Jurieu's death. And one catches, in this conjuncture of well-meaning flexibility and unanticipated retribution, a faint but troubling echo of Hermann Goring's pleased remark to a journalist at Munich, in reference to French Premier Edouard Daladier's surprising failure to offer any resistance to Hitler: "He is so elastic!"'10 Whether Renoir had in mind this partic- ular connection or not, he certainly imagined the film in terms of a supple grace of acquiescence to the status quo that turns out to be tragically and farcically unequal to an unacknowledged but scarcely unforeseeable menace: I had desired ... to show a rich, complex society where-to use a historic phrase-we are dancing on a volcano. My ambition when I made the film was to illustrate this remark: we are dancing on a volcano." The last clause describes pretty well the film's structure, with its festivities soon to be overwhelmed by the eruption of violence. In a political commentary published just after Munich, an outraged Renoir referred to the Munich agreement as a kind of "white-slave trade," not merely an ostrichlike oblivion but a procuring of Czechoslovakia for Hitler.'2 But what was France to gain by betraying its vulnerable ally? Chamberlain's stated aim was to prevent a war; but Daladier may have wished simply to buy time, so that France might enter war on more favorable terms.'3 If war must come, it would be a rep- etition of the Great War, but with a great difference: France had fortified the Drole de Guerre 135</page><page sequence="6">FIGURE 1.

Franco-German border to a positively titanic invulnerability, and their fixed intention was to sit and wait for the Germans to try to attack them there. Such a policy made the pact with Czechoslovakia exceedingly inconvenient: how could one spring to the Czechs' defense by manning the Franco-German border, how- ever resolutely? Here we can locate a field within the French political conscious- ness-or indeed unconscious-in which the spatial imagery of the hunt scene would have reverberated. For if one were to ask a Frenchman in the summer of 1939, dreading the onslaught of another war with Germany, of what he was reminded by the image of a group of armed Frenchmen waiting complacently behind a row of shooting blinds for their game to approach-advancing toward the blinds in a line, according to the demands of a linear automatism, the better to be killed-it is easy to imagine the readiest answer: the Maginot Line (figs. 1 and 2). Since World War I France had constructed this extraordinary extended bas- tion along its borders with Germany and Luxembourg, at a cost of 7 billion francs: a concrete and steel fortress line the likes of which the world had never before seen, the apotheosis of trench warfare, sunk seven stories into the earth, bristling with guns of awesome firepower, replete with elevators and underground rails, air conditioning, even cinemas.'4 Behind such a fortress, France could easily 136 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="7">repulse German attacks along that border without having to fear the staggering casualties suffered by the previous generation. Only in this way could the average Frenchman even begin to contemplate renewed warfare. It is easy to sympathize with this outlook, but much harder to understand why France should have embarked on such exorbitantly fixed defenses while simultaneously pursuing alli- ances in Eastern Europe that would require a wholly different approach to stra- tegic defense against Germany.'5 The Maginot Line encouraged an extremity of caution that seems, at least in retrospect, to have made the Munich accord inevi- table, even apart from Hitler's maneuvering.16 But despite the seemingly impregnable shelter it provided along the Franco- German border, the Maginot Line suffered from one outstanding technical flaw: it stopped short once it reached Belgium, thus leaving the entire northeast fron- tier, some 250 miles from Luxembourg to the sea, undefended. (Why not extend it? Too expensive, and moreover such a project would seem rude to the Belgians, who had no intention of invading France.) Strangely, the French military estab- lishment seems to have been rather casual about the dangers this situation pre- sented-as if the intensity of their preparations on the Maginot Line somehow made up for weaknesses elsewhere.7 It did of course occur to military leaders that the Belgian border presented a point of vulnerability, and so it was planned that a line of French troops would, upon the first hint of a German invasion of '-'~-: ' i*g ' .a. a . a ai : :a t: :; FIGURE 2.

Only the hinge or pivot of this sweeping maneuver, a small stretch of the Belgian border just northwest of the border with Luxembourg, where the Maginot Line ended, would remain relatively unattended; for there France was protected by the hilly Ardennes Forest, which was, military authorities assured their countrymen, impenetrable. In constructing and manipulating notions of military safety, of warfare think- able and unthinkable, of international responsibility and transgression, of histor- ical patterns to be repeated and varied, France may be understood as conducting a series of rhetorical transactions with itself, its neighbors, and its history. These transactions are structurally and tactically on a par with those that a film such as Renoir's enacts in representing a political situation, and one must be ready to apprehend their functional equivalence as well: it is no caprice to see the German invasion of France, less than a year after the debut of The Rules of the Game, as the denouement of a sad and grotesque farce, altogether the match of the film's black comedy. The connection may seem perverse, for the film might be supposed inadequate to its historical moment precisely because of what is popularly under- stood as its farcical nature-meaning, here, its apparent frivolity, irrelevance, and bankruptcy of good sense. But there is a sense in which "farce" is welcome in political discourse, even spoken with emphasis as a proof of hard-headed analytic rectitude: as a term of abuse. "Farce" in this colloquial sense denotes a breakdown of rational behavior, a state of failure and confusion in which unseasonable motives are pursued with a tactical purblindness matched only by a self-defeating automatism of execution. Later I will contest this understanding of farce, but that such a notion is so often invoked to describe a particular kind of historical situa- tion demands our attention. Such a situation is easily recognizable: misguided repetition leads to discomfiture. There may never have been a more lamentable replaying of such a pattern than that which occurred in May of 1940. The prelude to that disaster was another kind of travesty: the drole de guerre, or phony war, following the fall of Poland in September 1939, during which both the French and the Germans dawdled behind their respective lines for eight months. The burlesque quality of the drole de guerre is suggested in part by its resemblance to a term for burlesque itself, drole de drame, to which one review of The Rules of the Game alludes.'8 More intrinsically, it arises from the slightly surreal and bathetic way in which the dr6le de guerre echoes not only the immobility of trench warfare in World War I-now, however, played out with a stubbornly pro- crastinatory bloodlessness-but also the period surrounding Munich, which con- versely felt like war even though technically peace reigned. That state has in fact been called the drole de paix, and it found its "logical conclusion" in the phony war.'9 It is not only hindsight that leads us to find something ghoulish in the 138 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="9">French inactivity during this period, motivated by an obsessive confidence in a system of fortifications that covered less than half of France's eastern border. Contemporary observers were appalled as well. One remarkable figure, the his- torian Marc Bloch-a French Jew who in 1939, in his fifties, enlisted in the army, then entered the Resistance after the fall of France, whence writing in "a white heat of rage" his posthumous condemnation of French policy, Strange Defeat, before being captured and shot by the Gestapo in 1944-denounced the waste of a chance to prepare for the onslaught, pointing out that the invasion of France was rehearsed with utter clarity in the invasion of Poland eight months earlier.20 But instead: "On the 'front,' the men were getting very exasperated, the leader- ship was confusing defensiveness with inertia, and boredom affected every level. Efforts were made to involve the army in work in the fields, a thousand footballs were distributed, 'hot grogs' dispensed, a few rose-bushes planted along the earthworks of the Maginot Line and Maurice Chevalier was engaged by the army theatre."21 Yet such oblivion requires tremendous willpower. In fact the drole de guerre may be read not as inactivity but as a sort of obsessional neurotic symptom, a dogged repetition, by a France undead, of an obsolete fate from the First World War; the horrors of trench warfare would be erased by a replaying in which nothing happened.22 Something did happen, of course; for the Germans did not wish to play the same familiar game. While the French relied on the Maginot Line, the Germans turned to fast-moving tanks and the strategy of Blitzkrieg. The very strength of the Maginot Line guaranteed that the German attack would come through Bel- gium, even if it simultaneously dulled French vigilance about preparing ade- quately for that situation; thus a corollary of this strange negligence was perhaps a half-conscious sense of the practical irrelevance of the Maginot Line, which led the French High Command to settle into a fixed conviction that the Germans would attempt to surge through the plains of central Belgium from Namur to Brussels to Antwerp, well north of Luxembourg. The Germans exploited this automatistic state of mind by making a convincing initial feint in that direction, and then pouring seven Panzer divisions through the Ardennes Forest-the hinge of the French defenses-well to the south, some ten miles from the northern end of the Maginot Line. The fatal French notion that the Ardennes defended itself, as well as the obduracy of their anticipations to the north, resulted in a disastrous lack of preparedness at this crucial point. As is always the case in the dynamics of farce, a certain rigidity of mind-that which Henri Bergson, the foremost theorist of what is essentially farcical comedy, describes as "mechanical inelasticity, just where one would expect to find the wide- awake adaptability and the living pliableness of a human being"-resulted here in a powerfully systematic inconsistency with respect to preeminent patterns of repetition.23 On the one hand, the farcical victim studiously ignores the possibility that events will recur, that past misadventures will continue to dog him; on the Dr6le de Guerre 139</page><page sequence="10">other, he is transfixed in repetition, clinging to behavior that either has never worked or has done so only in crucially different circumstances. On the one hand, the certainty of the French High Command that the Ardennes was immune to invasion repressed the fact that the forest "had actually been a place of battle for two thousand years. Caesar's legions had fought the German tribes there. Between 1554 and 1794 no fewer than ten campaigns had raged through its tor- tuous valleys."24 And on the other hand, the French were immured in an old expectation: that the Germans would follow the same strategy they had devised over four decades earlier and had followed (approximately) in 1914, the Schlieffen Plan. Hence the debacle of farcical repetition and inversion that John Keegan describes: "The theme of [the German plan of attack, called "Sickle Stroke"] was a reversal of Schlieffen's from 1914 . . . [which was based] on the expectation that the French would push into Germany south of the Ardennes, allowing the German armies to outflank them through Belgium. 'Sickle Stroke' was based on the expectation that in 1940 the French, with their British allies, would push into Belgium, allowing the German armies to outflank them through the Ardennes."25 There is something Pavlovian-and almost unbelievable, even to the Germans-about the mechanical alacrity with which this response was called up by the German feint toward Liege, to the northeast, in mimicry of their attack twenty-five years earlier.26 The remarkable strength of this fixation can best be judged by the way in which the High Command discounted the reports of its own aerial reconnaissance. For two days German Panzers rumbled through the Ardennes in columns seventy-five miles long, bumper to bumper, day and night, headlights blazing. This was something the French Air Force noticed. For two days its Gen. d'Astier sent a series of increasingly urgent bulletins to the High Command, warning that this was clearly the principal German offensive. But stupefyingly, the High Command replied to d'Astier's alarums by ordering him to dispatch more planes to the north. On the third day, the German Gen. Halder wrote in his diary, "Enemy Air Force astoundingly cautious."27 Bloch ascribes the French debacle to a ludicrous inadaptability to the changing pace of life: "Since the beginning of the twentieth century the whole idea of distance has changed .... The ruling idea of the Germans in the conduct of this war was speed. We, on the other hand, did our thinking in terms of yes- terday or the day before.... The truth of the matter is that the Germans advanced a great deal faster than they should have done according to the old rules of the game."28 The echo of Renoir in the last sentence is striking. The French evidently do play according to the rules of an old game; and for all the noble rage that pervades Bloch's tone in this book, there is indeed something comical in his image of dainty French retreats overrun within the half-hour by an enemy that simply refused to abide by the old patterns. Bloch cites the essential spatial logic of farce, by which the adversary always pops up in the wrong place- "From beginning to end of the campaign, the Germans showed the same embar- 140 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="11">rassing skill in appearing where they ought not to have appeared"-and even employs Bergson's farcical term in describing the French mentality: "Our minds were too inelastic for us ever to admit the possibility."29 Farcically unswerving in pursuit of its own discomfiture, France studiously ignored those who, well before the eve of destruction, saw exactly what was coming and voiced their alarm. Per- haps the most clarion of these voices belonged to a then-obscure captain, Charles de Gaulle. In 1934 de Gaulle had published a book called Vers l'armee de metier (translated in haste and chagrin seven years later, with an irony of belatedness that may have been unintended, as The Army of the Future). Recounting the long history of invasions through France's weak northeast frontier, de Gaulle rebutted the logic of the Maginot Line with an almost uncanny accuracy: he not only warned that the Germans would strike in the vicinity of Sedan, "the worst flaw in our frail defences," but also saw that the next war would be dominated not by the old principles of entrenchment, heavy fortification, and the conscription of mass armies but by mobility and speed, by tanks and aircraft.30 The stubbornness of the fixation on and of Maginot thinking makes the fall of France appear unconsciously willed, so that the catastrophe seems to waver between the tragic and the farcical. The problem of "automatism" that Bergson defines as a basic condition of the comic could apply just as well to tragic hubris: "The comic is that element by which the person unwittingly betrays himself."31 Whether the fall of France looks farcical or tragic depends partly upon whether we see the military shortsightedness of the French from outside or inside the automatism, whether as a plain tactical blunder, exasperatingly avoidable, or as an inexorable expression of their being that must be valued on its own terms- as, for instance, the consequence of an urgent need to ward off the kind of suf- fering they endured in World War I. Such tragic fatalism marks in effect a rec- onciliation between notions of individual autonomy and integrity and of fate as transcendental mechanism: tragedy permits its hero to express his being as his fate, to humanize and aggrandize his very subjection to mechanism. But farce problematizes rather than sublates the vexed relations of the indi- vidual with the systems that encompass him or her, partly by throwing open to ridicule those who succumb to such systems while yet disrupting any certainty about where the individual ends and the system begins. (In this sense the reason that farce avoids empathetic gestures that situate the spectator with the farcical victim is not because, as Bergson and other theorists of comedy wrongly maintain, comedy is somehow incapable of emotion, depending on "a momentary anaes- thesia of the heart";32 this The Rules of the Game sufficiently demonstrates, if per- haps to the confusion of its first audiences. Rather, farce avoids such gestures for tactical reasons: it is unwilling to cede to the victim a preemptive interpretive privilege.) Just as it is difficult to separate the logic of Gen. Gamelin in disre- garding d'Astier's warnings from that farcical repetition and inversion of Great War tactics to which the Germans shrewdly acceded, and from the Maginot Line Dr6le de Guerre 141</page><page sequence="12">complex that both formed and was formed by the thinking of countless Gamelins, so it is impossible to apprehend the farcical restaging of events from the First World War at all without implicitly positing a larger structure of historical and cultural articulation that casts over its pawns not a fateful grandeur but a suspi- cion of culpability. Perhaps it is always available to us to see tragedy as something like a poignant farce, farce as a bathetic tragedy. The political force of thinking about the fall of France in farcical terms, however, is that it resists naturalizing and celebrating a certain fatalism; it presents fixity and repetition in terms of power and effect, of tactics and accountability rather than of tragic necessity. Stuffing To understand the fall of France in this way is to construe it as a dia- logical event stretching over decades, articulated in the innumerable intimations that sift through French (and to some extent German) culture, forming with their fluctuating valences the almost instinctual public postures that sway the nation to appease or mobilize, to dig in or invade; evoking the premonitions by which fear visualizes its nemesis in the Black Forest or the Sudetenland or the Ardennes, in the form of rallying Nazis or infiltrating Bolsheviks or cynical, reactionary French aristocrats retreating to country chateaux to hunt and dance. The Rules of the Game participates in this discourse by crystallizing, in its unruly way, an appre- hension concerning France's peril that is substantially shared, though differently expressed, by others such as Bloch or de Gaulle. A sense of spatial vulnerability was thick in the air of prewar France, and with whatever prescience or coinci- dence, the overthrowing of the fixed mentality of shooting blinds in The Rules of the Game takes much the same form as the downfall that Bloch caustically describes: "A hurried decision was taken to construct a number of concrete block- houses ... which, since they were designed with only a frontal field of fire, were taken from behind ... [just as] our men had to expend all their efforts on digging a magnificent anti-tank ditch covering Cambrai and Saint-Quentin-which the Germans overran one fine day by the simple expedient of advancing against it from those two places."33 Such was the fate of the vaunted Maginot Line itself: a month after the breakthrough in the Ardennes, the Germans advanced eastward to attack the Line; 400,000 French prisoners were taken from the rear.34 If the false confidence of the Maginot mentality unconsciously apprehends such vulnerability, the specter it fears is that of a simple reversal that maintains the stability of a binary, specular disposition of space: the enemy might overrun one's position, but the relative positions remain clear. But the chronic attacks from behind during the fall of France intimate a more volatile spatial vulnera- bility, which is evoked in de Gaulle's description of the fluid military situation that would play havoc with a Maginot defense and demand instead a highly mobile 142 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="13">army: "Such instability is in the nature of things. There is no geographic obstacle to keep [the Germans and French] apart. The perpetual osmosis that has resulted from this . . . makes any limit to the field of action purely arbitrary.... From whatever point it blows, the wind which sweeps [the frontier] is laden with ulterior motives."35 This account invites comparison with the fete rather than the hunt, and reminds us that in moving to the fete Renoir adopts a more complex notion of farce, with its own spatial logic and its own forms of anxiety. In staging a cri- tique of the Maginot mentality, Renoir does not merely equate farce with that mentality, nor imply that farce can and should be avoided. Such a prescription would underestimate the pervasiveness of farce in history (after all, had the French rejected the stubborn repetition of a rush to central Belgium, and instead successfully bombarded the German Panzers as they defiled through the Ardennes, it would merely have been the Germans who had fallen prey to a farci- cal automatism, in ignoring the lessons of history and the warnings of experts). It would also underestimate farce itself, in which Renoir perceives not a ludicrous failure of the human, as Bergson supposes, but rather the inescapable dilemma of how one can negotiate the overlapping mechanisms of behavior, psychological as well as social, within which action is inscribed. In posing this dilemma, farce labors under not a vacancy but rather a supercharge of meaning, the consequence of its essential condition: an antic overloading of space.36 Renoir moves to such an overloaded space as a sort of rebuttal to the excessive clarity of his own hunt scene, as if the false simplicity of the Maginot mentality were, ironically, mirrored in the satirical perspective that he had adopted to survey it. Once within the chateau, amidst the fete, Renoir enacts several striking parodies of the hunt, insisting each time that we abandon its visual perspective in order to engage in a dizzying mobility that he perceives to be proper to farce. In the most explicit of these gestures, Schumacher appears in a corridor along the rear of a drawing room, where a group of domestics, standing in near darkness at the back, have joined an audience watching skits performed by the gentry. He is jealously in search of both his straying wife, Lisette, and Marceau, the poacher- turned-domestic who is her current seducer; and as Schumacher moves to the right along the corridor, appearing to our laterally tracking vision in a succession of archways, he seems again to be initiating the hunt, "starting" various game- including Christine, who, wounded by her discovery of La Chesnaye's philan- dering with Genevieve (she does not realize that he has just broken off the liaison for her sake), is fleeing him and toying with a guest. In this chase, however, hunters and quarry are confounded-partly because almost everyone is both, and partly because, as in this shot, several parallel and intersecting hunts are underway at once. Following the familiar, flatly lateral, left-to-right movement, we have almost reached a position corresponding to that of the shooting blinds when we catch sight of Schumacher's game, Lisette and Marceau, at the same time he does. The camera proceeds in its momentum, however, and suddenly Dr6le de Guerre 143</page><page sequence="14">frames Jurieu-another hunter, as it turns out-who is marooned in the corner of the drawing room,jealously peering back at Christine across the space we have just traversed. The camera is stuck in the corner with him, its chasseur's survey baffled by the complexity of this spectacle, when suddenly everyone turns and rushes off, again laterally but now from right to left, undoing the movement of the hunt: Marceau, then Schumacher after him and Lisette after him, simulta- neously Christine and her partner, pursued byJurieu-and trailing along in their wake, the belated camera with its posse of bemused spectators, ourselves. For most of the remainder of the film Renoir commits us to an alternative kind of space, the round space of farce, in agile pursuit of spouses and lovers who chase and flee one another through the chateau in a series of fulfillments, betrayals, and displacements. The very name of farce announces its spatial nature: derived from the Latin farcire, "to stuff," farce originated as a species of foreign matter, of vernacular "tropes," crammed into the lulls of the Latin Church liturgy to provide additional understanding and pleasure, just as fowl are farced to enrich their nourishment and savor.37 So, let us say, does Renoir wish to stuff political thought in a time of crisis with the more vernacular mental food of his farce. But farce overburdens the interpretive space it is meant to gloss or relieve by overstuffing space with too many simultaneous actions. Too many lovers to juggle, and only one bed; too many commitments to honor, all coming to fruition in one place at one time; too many antagonists to confront, some of the wrong size. In slapstick violence and frenetic adultery, staple subjects of farce, two par- ties attempt to occupy the same space at the same time. But often in farce sex and violence themselves try to occupy the same space at the same time. Thus, while Christine is quietly closeted with (now) Jurieu, who is trying to arrange a tryst with her, they are interrupted by a succession of lovers and haters (all chasing from left to right across the frame, in yet another reprise of the hunt), as the Schumacher-Lisette-Marceau plot barges in homicidally (Schumacher has now drawn his revolver) on the tenderness of the gentry. So does more of the gentry: suddenly La Chesnaye appears, his peacemaking pursuit of Schumacher having entered the wrong dramatic space-that is, his own-and finding in the same room another plot even less to his liking but more to his interest, he promptly shunts to the new track and enters into a marathon brawl with Jurieu. This antic space is Renoir's element: here he executes the supple long takes for which he is renowned, pirouetting in and around the melee in an effortless series of panning and dollying shots. If Renoir's cinematography thrives here, that is only partly for formal reasons, however; he finds his principal inspiration in the capacity of space to become dangerously charged, fraught with threats that can come from any direction and prey that can disappear anywhere (fig. 3). Many characters in farce have their heads turned, but the unfortunate don't turn their heads often or vigilantly enough: the unpleasant surprise is apt to come from behind. In this vulnerability the fete plays out for Maginot appeasers, in evocative 144 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="15">FIGURE 3. The round space of farce, here overloaded with five different lines of movement and vision. From Renoir, La Regle dujeu. if subliminal form, their repressed dread not merely of invasion but of farcically mobile displacements; here Renoir's "compass of anxiety" spins its needle wildly. It is perhaps the specter of mechanism in farce, more than its putative absurdity, that first leads observers to find it "degrading,"38 but the fiasco of the fall of France, as anticipated in the spatial logic of the fete, reveals a deeper source for this sense of degradation: a secret self-betraying complicity with the mechanisms of history. The shame of egregiously leaving one's flank open to penetration, of allowing oneself to be taken from behind, entails an unconscious desire for the fantasized abjection of inviting the other to breach one's defenses. The mecha- nisms of farce, which seem degrading, are thus indistinguishable from an alter- native subjectivity that announces itself by abasing the ostensible integrity of a self identified with one's defenses. Contempt for farce marks a recoiling from this treacherous complicity, which seems all the more shameful when it is linked with the unfolding of world-historical events-not so much because the latter are triv- ialized by farce as because their aura of immutable fatality only endorses the alien integrity of such self-betraying desires. This threat is compounded by the interpretive overload that farce generates. Farce is most often dismissed because its behavior is assumed, with Bergsonian Drole de Guerre 145</page><page sequence="16">logic, to be tainted by mechanism in a way that makes its motives and ethical implications shallow. Renoir seems to invite such judgments, for example by allowing La Chesnaye to be ridiculed for an interest in mechanical toys and music boxes which seems to express an artificiality of character, and by submerging the complexity of his characters' motives in the breakneck pace of the farce. Yet Renoir repeatedly shows in supposedly shallow characters such as La Chesnaye an alert flexibility of judgment and an awareness of others' viewpoint that are altogether beyond the reach of characters such asJurieu and Schumacher, whose strong feeling too many interpretations hold out as a reproach to La Chesnaye's penchant for the mechanical, whereas such authenticity ultimately becomes indis- tinguishable from the upsurging of Jonsonian humors.39 It is almost always pos- sible in this film to trace apparently mindless behavior back to a delicate play of motivations,40 but farce arranges that delicate or crude, such motives become dif- ficult to read when compounded by those of many characters clamoring for atten- tion. If it is true that the wild activity of farce is incommensurate with intelligible motives, that is because the latter overload each moment, short-circuiting the eth- ical discrimination of spectator and character alike. In forcing upon characters the unwelcome recognition of its own state of crisis, farce imposes a Brechtian "deep comedy of metalanguage," generating with its overlapping mechanisms something like the alienation effect of epic theater.4' Hence farce becomes espe- cially objectionable in time of war. The moral clout-even, if one may put it so, the appeal-of war derives precisely from its claim to clear out all motives but a few. But if at bottom contempt for farce has to do with its disabling of normal notions of discrimination, Renoir senses that political crisis can no better avoid such a disabling, the result of an overloading of conceptual as well as physical space; simply to call out for Lebensraum does not redress the problem. Farce thus elaborates the human fate of being wedded to mechanisms (can't live with them, can't live without them); the systematic ordering of events in farce may be illusory, a near-anthropomorphization of coincidence, but it is an irresist- ible inference from the sheer density of concatenation (thus Bernadette Rey- Flaud makes an automatism of events central to her definition of farce, which she describes as "the mise en scene of this complex mechanism").42 When the mecha- nism of farce is played out in history, with its fateful aura, it seems to exert still greater power over individual discretion than in the case of dramatic or cinematic farce: the forces of history do not so clearly present themselves to be opposed, and the irreversibility of the dimension of time threatens to foreclose options that manipulators of the space of farce rely on to recoup their losses. The psycholog- ical, political, and simply tactical problem of how one is to respond to the return of the past-whether in oneself or in one's surroundings-thus becomes entan- gled in farce with vexing questions of agency: Where are we to locate those com- pulsions to repeat-in ourselves, or in a structure of repetition somehow imposed from "without"? If the latter, by what agency, and how are we to respond to it? 146 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="17">Evidently, in this respect farce carries with it an inchoate theory of history, which needs to be pursued. We have witnessed in the Ardennes debacle troublesome repetitions not only in the benighted French combatants but also in the sequences of events that confronted them. Such ghostly revisitings invite particular atten- tion because they raise the essential problems of any correspondence between farce and history. We can track this problem by following the traces left by one more ghostly repetition bedeviling the invasion of France. The Germans broke the back of the French defenses by capturing, with stunning swiftness, the town of Sedan. It was at Sedan that a forerunner of modern fascism, Napoleon III, had surrendered to the Prussians, after a confrontation of similarly disgraceful brevity, in September 1870-the same Napoleon who figures as the dubious hero of the most important meditation on the conjuncture of farce and history, Karl Marx's marvelous essay, The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte. The Ghost Walks: Marx on the Last Laugh One of Marx's best-known formulations concerning the logic by which history unfolds appears in the first sentence of his account of the revolutionary events in Paris from 1848 to 1851, leading up to the coup d'etat of Louis Bona- parte-events that strangely reiterated, in bathetic form, those of the earlier French Revolution and the rise of Bonaparte's famous uncle: Hegel remarks somewhere that all facts and personages of great importance in world history occur, as it were, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second as farce. Caussidiere for Danton, Louis Blanc for Robespierre, the Montagne of 1848 to 1851 for the Montagne of 1793, the Nephew for the Uncle. And the same caricature occurs in the circumstances attending the second edition of the eighteenth Brumaire!43 The unstartling neglect, on the part of subsequent commentators, of the idea of farce as a category for historical materialism suits the impression most readers seem to share that Marx uses these generic references merely as a lively rhetorical flourish. "Farce" on this reading would be a species of philosophic raspberry, serving simply to ridicule the rise of Louis Napoleon Bonaparte as a travesty of the first, the real Napoleonic era,44 and to deride latter-day repetitions of events from that era as empty mimicry, not so much an historical parallel as the default of history, an affront to the intelligibility by which the past issues in the present. Certainly jeering is not beyond Marx's tonal range in The Eighteenth Brumaire, and at several points in the essay "farce" and kindred terms do seem to carry this sort of mockery. Yet perhaps the language of so powerfully systematic a writer as Marx should be taken more seriously. What would it mean to say that a form of repe- tition in history obeys the principles of farce? For it is not the case that Marx simply tosses out the word farce casually, as if Dr6le de Guerre 147</page><page sequence="18">idiocy or tomfoolery would have done equally well. In actuality, the second Napo- leonic coup shows a propensity for obsessive repetition and situational inversion, for disguise and ill-fated posturing, for mental automatism, even for slapstick- in short, for farce's entire repertoire of dynamic and rhetorical tricks. Marx devotes a great deal of energy and stylistic panache to demonstrating this: The revolution of 1848 knew nothing better to do than to parody, now 1789, now the revolutionary tradition of 1793 to 1795 .... From 1848 to 1851 only the ghost of the old revolution walked about, from Marrast, the republicain en gantsjaunes, who disguised him- self as the old Bailly, down to the adventurer who halcs his commonplace repulsive fea- tures under the iron death mask of Napoleon. An entire people, which had imagined that by means of a revolution it had imparted to itself an accelerated power of motion, suddenly finds itself set back into a defunct epoch and, in order that no doubt as to the relapse may be possible, the old dates arise again, the old chronology, the old names, the old edicts, which had long become a subject of antiquarian erudition, and the old myrmidons of the law, who had seemed long decayed.... The French, so long as they were engaged in revolution, could not get rid of the memory of Napoleon. (104-5) The farcical is here manifested in a clinching combination of ludicrous disguise (such as the lecherous master might use to take the place of the maid's young lover in classical bedroom farce) with automatic repetition where one expects lively volition: in short, these events exhibit what Bergson, in his most famous formulation of the comic situation, describes as "something mechanical encrusted upon the living."45 On one level Marx seems to castigate the actors in the farce of 1848 to 1851 for their blindness and folly in sleepwalking through history, their failure to live in the present and take their own action: "The tradition of all the dead genera- tions weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living.... Precisely in such periods of revolutionary crisis they anxiously conjure up the spirits of the past to their service and borrow from them names, battle-cries and costumes" (103-4). Yet in the dialectics of history, farce takes the form not merely of an avoidable blunder but of an ineluctable movement of recurrence that can transform social relations. Thus Marx describes in the fate of the bourgeois a dynamic of inversion familiar to farce, that of being hoist with one's petard. Having massacred the insurrectionary workers during the infamous "June days," in the name of saving society from anarchy, the bourgeoisie tried to safeguard its values by invoking, in Bonaparte, a leader who contradicted them: "Only theft can still save property; only perjury, religion; bastardy, the family; only disorder, order!" (194). But these contradictions, foisted upon the bourgeoisie by the ricocheting forces of a state of crisis, inevitably backfired against them, as their ingrate savior, Bonaparte, consolidated his own power. Bourgeois fanatics for order are shot down on their balconies by mobs of drunken soldiers, their domestic sanctuaries profaned, their houses bombarded for amusement-in the name of property, of the family, of religion and of order. Finally, the scum of bourgeois 148 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="19">society forms the holy phalanx of order and the hero Krapulinski [Heine's gluttonous mock hero] installs himself in the Tuileries as the "savior of society." (112) For all the acid contempt Marx bestows on the principals in this farce, it is not clear that any decisive debility or inanity has earned them this fate. For Marx implies that potentially burlesque reiterations of history are a normal function of revolution-thus inviting us to reformulate his initial imposing distinction between tragedy and farce as a question of rhetorical contingency: even the fore- runners of Bonaparte, Camille Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, Saint-Just, Napoleon ... performed the task of their time in Roman costume and with Roman phrases.... Unheroic as bourgeois society is, it nevertheless took heroism, sacrifice, terror, civil war and battles of peoples to bring it into being. And in the classically austere traditions of the Roman Republic its gladiators found the ideals and the art forms, the self-deceptions that they needed in order to conceal from themselves the bourgeois limitations of the content of their struggles and to maintain their passion on the high plane of great historical tragedy. (104-5) Marx's evocation of a litany of successive historical repetitions suggests that the tragic first instance that initiates each doublet of world-historical events is consti- tuted retrospectively by the farce of its repetition (ignoring the 1848 revolution, might one not decide that Rome was tragedy and the Bastille farce?). Marx does offer a salient mark of historical authentication: the figures of 1789 to 1795 used the past to perform "the task of their time," rather than losing themselves in a full regression to the past as Marx's contemporaries have done. "Thus the resurrec- tion of the dead in those revolutions served the purpose of glorifying the new struggles, not of parodying the old; of magnifying the given task in imagination, not of fleeing from its solution in reality; of finding once more the spirit of rev- olution, not of making its ghost walk about again" (105). Yet these historical ges- tures remain as much a "self-deception" as those of Bonaparte (who may equally have imagined that he was glorifying new struggles), even if this does not prevent them from sustaining a genuinely "high plane of great historical tragedy." Farce is in the eye of the beholder, not of the actor; tragedy is the reverse, for as soon as Marx removes himself from the perspective of the Roman impostors, they become "unheroic" and limited, however historically significant. Although Marx appears to criticize that anxious conjuring of spirits of a past which "weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living," his remonstrance against this miscarriage issues from an apparently equivalent assertion (like the opening of the essay, a formulation so celebrated that it is usually invoked out of context), which on the contrary is normally taken to describe, quite simply, the constraints that history imposes on human action always and everywhere: "Men make their own history, but they do not make it just as they please; they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past" (103). By itself, the Drole de Guerre 149</page><page sequence="20">sentence might suggest that these circumstances are material, but in this context we would better construe them as elements of a language of social possibilities which we inherit, and which it is pointless to try to evade. Thus defined, the field of farcical action is not so much a temporal structure-the counterposition of an authentic ("tragic") action from the past to an automatistic mimicking of this action in the present-as rather a spatial economy: Louis Bonaparte is occupying a particular discursive position, the "Napoleon" position (a "circumstance" not chosen by himself but given and transmitted from the past), and what is farcical about this is not any default of originality, nor any personal failure of perfor- mance, but simply the lack of fit between this position and the other circum- stances that surround Bonaparte as he acts. Thus, in an illuminating qualification, Marx denies any decisive difference not only in the personal power but even in the essential identity of Napoleon I and Louis Bonaparte, here construed as two permutations of a single discursive entity: "They [the French people in 1848 to 1851 ] have not only a caricature of the old Napoleon, they have the old Napoleon himself, caricatured as he must appear in the middle of the nineteenth century" (105). The bathetic fall pictured here has nothing to do with any intrinsic lack in the nineteenth century, with the loss of some originary authority, propitious for tragedy, that was enjoyed in the Napoleonic era. Napoleon himself, could he have returned from death in 1851, would according to Marx have been promptly con- founded by returns against him of his own notion of grandeur within the social economy of the new era. The endemic reversibility that Marx chronicles in The Eighteenth Brumaire, epitomized by Louis Bonaparte's unpredictability as a political wild card, has seemed to some observers to reduce this historical moment to a state of virtually anarchic absurdity.46 But on the contrary, Marx's account of how Bonaparte rep- resents class interests even in his maverick nonrepresentativeness is beautifully responsive to the systemic thriftiness of farce. Bonaparte's strongest support, Marx argues, comes from the small-holding peasantry: a class whose members, despite their common social and economic conditions and interests, are isolated from one another by their mode of production and left with neither community, class consciousness, nor structures of organization. Unable to represent or even to understand itself as a class, the small-holding peasantry finds its perfect rep- resentative in Louis Bonaparte, who travesties representative government as an executive authority that subordinates society to itself without any valid ideological allegiances (187-88). One might in fact suppose that so full a harmony with one's social contingencies and with the movements of history as is enjoyed by Bona- parte, in the felicity of his perfect constituency, ought to be celebrated rather than despised. Though Bonaparte aggravates Marx, he is the favored child of histor- ical circumstance, not the butt of farce. Farce is thus not to be regarded as the default of history, nor even as a particular form of representing history. Rather, 150 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="21">it articulates the breakdown of any clear distinction between representation and history, in their systemic mutual engagement. By analyzing the way in which these peasants are duped into supporting an outmoded political program merely on the basis of the name "Napoleon," Marx generates a powerful reading of farce as a matter of ill-tuned ideology. A half- century earlier the Napoleonic ideology had brought the small-holding peasant class into being, but in the current state of French society and economy, Marx argues, that ideology is its undoing (189-93).47 Hence, all "idees napoleoniennes" are ideas of the undeveloped smallholding in the freshness of its youth; for the smallholding that has outlived its day they are an absurdity . . . the hallucinations of its death struggle, words that are transformed into phrases, spirits transformed into ghosts. (193) Thus the farcical backfiring of history comes from a mismatch of ideology and material circumstances, from ideological fixations that prevent an elastic response to shifting social circumstances. Yet this kind of mismatch can be the site of inver- sions in more than one direction, and Marx apparently wishes to hold out the possibility of taking advantage of them, of converting today's farce into tomor- row's vindication. The embryonic revolutionary ideology of the proletarian forces that mounted the barricades was also "in most singular contradiction to every- thing that, with the material available, with the degree of education attained by the masses, under the given circumstances and relations, could be immediately realised in practice" (109). In this respect, the abortive proletarian revolution appears as a kind of proleptic parody of the true revolution that Marx expects to appear in the fullness of time. It is only from a theoretical position putatively outside material constraints that one can pretend to counter the farcical operations of the historical mecha- nism simply by denouncing them. In order to take advantage of them in practice, one must put aside that fear of a loss of personal autonomy and authenticity to dehumanizing systems which underlies attitudes of disdain toward farce (even in those who imagine they have given up a nostalgia for these values); equally one must avoid an unwitting, automatistic submission to such machinations. Rather it is necessary to see the semiotic matrix given by history-under whose circum- stances we must make our history not quite as we please-as the field of one's political and textual opportunism.48 One cannot, of course, do so finally or with immunity. The text of history will inevitably hold other inversions in store that would grieve Marx considerably more.49 His own findings would caution that the need to keep one's wits about one in the games that history stages is unending. The need to invoke and then appropriate a notion of historical mechanism emerges most tellingly in the way in which Marx handles the idea of farce as a ghost that walks. In the passages cited above, "ghost" implies an evacuation of Drole de Guerre 151</page><page sequence="22">integral meaning: the true "spirit" of the French Revolution or of the original idees napoleoniennes deserts these mechanical replayings and is but weakly echoed in the latter-day mock-gothic ghosts. Yet this spectral trope haunts Marx's text in other guises that would return to it authentic political power: "On the threshold of the February revolution, the social republic appeared as a phrase, as a prophecy. In the June days of 1848, it was drowned in the blood of the Paris proletariat, but it haunts the subsequent acts of the drama like a ghost" (181).50 Such friendly ghosts serve within Marx's argument not merely as instances of rhetorical table turning but as figures for the redemption of historical mechanism: the strategic inversions by which the movements of history, which seem to trammel one's social action when they are reduced to mere mechanistic patterns, can instead be con- jured and ventriloquized themselves-as mechanisms, even, but now granted a cogency of voice and logic-and thus made to serve higher purposes. For throughout The Eighteenth Brumaire, with increasing insistence, Marx comes to redefine the same bathetic replayings that he formerly mocked as, in the end, effects of a larger mechanism of history, an anthropomorphized logic that system- atically prepares the reversal of all these reversals, within the idiom of the future revolution-even planning the rule of the bourgeoisie, prior to Bonaparte's coup, to suit its own devices: "So the revolution had first created the form in which the rule of the bourgeois class received its broadest, most general and ultimate expression and could therefore also be overthrown, without being able to rise again" (183n.). And Marx's final conjuring of ghosts, in the passage quoted above in which he derides the "absurdity" of the farcical disengagement of ends and means by which the peasantry stubbornly clings to the idees napoleoniennes that have lost their spirit, culminates in a magisterial logic of history that redeems the entire farce of the Bonapartist regime: "But the parody of the empire was nec- essary to free the mass of the French nation from the weight of tradition and to work out in pure form the opposition between the state power and society" (193). The adept in the farcical ways of history sees that no emptiness or gratuity or betise need be wasted; farce's mill grinds slowly-or for that matter quickly-but grinds exceeding small. The progressive historian ought positively to thank Louis Bonaparte for his short-sighted connivance. But not too fervently. If The Eighteenth Brumaire teaches anything, it teaches that the greatest danger in exploiting the machinations of farce is to imagine that you have won the last laugh: At a moment when the bourgeoisie itself played the most complete comedy, but in the most serious manner in the world, without infringing any of the pedantic conditions of French dramatic etiquette, and was itself half deceived, half convinced of the solemnity of its own performance of state, the adventurer, who took the comedy as plain comedy, was bound to win. Only when he has eliminated his solemn opponent, when he himself now takes his imperial role seriously and under the Napoleonic mask imagines he is the real 152 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="23">Napoleon, does he become the victim of his own conception of the world, the serious buffoon who no longer takes world history for comedy but his comedy for world history. (149-59) Marx's anthropomorphic gestures thus entail a fundamental ambivalence: on the one hand, they recognize and welcome the workings, exceeding individual con- trol, of a recondite mechanism of history, such as is commonly held to be the shame of farce; on the other hand, they seem designed to regulate the farcical vagaries of historical enactment (Marx repeatedly speaks of apparently maverick events occurring "in order that . ."), as though to absorb and redeem irreducible difference. But there is no need for a politics of engagement to be squeamish about farce.51 Farce attends to the peculiarities by which recurrent historical forces are realized materially, and so does historical materialism, the science of vagaries; there is no end of vagaries, and also no end to the ways in which they will prove to operate systematically. Perhaps Marx's ventriloquizing of history's logic, in its ostensible transcending of farce, is simply a tactic for confronting this situation. In its ambivalence, The Eighteenth Brumaire cautions us to avoid becoming "the serious buffoon who no longer takes world history for comedy." Renoir's Reframing: Figuring Historical Crisis Marx's qualifications are endlessly subtle, but on the rhetorical high road he shows no qualms in appropriating the farcical mechanisms that he has analyzed to the uses of a progressive model of history. Renoir, on the other hand, finally shows nothing but qualms. The shooting of Jurieu and its aftermath over- turn whatever equanimity, smug or discerning, characters and viewers alike may salvage from farce: in its puncturing of hilarity, in the ruthlessness with which it confirms one's harshest satirical speculations, the closing seems to explode a world without recourse. Through this cataclysm Renoir, working within a rep- resentation of the intersection of history and farce analogous to Marx's, focuses on a question that Marx overglances: How, in this conjuncture, does historical crisis present itself to those whom it menaces? The ominous reverberations of the film's catastrophe, as the fall of 1939 approaches, converge in a dominant reve- lation: crisis is the sudden discovery that the system with which one was con- tending has shifted its limits. Farce insists upon a difficult discipline, only to raise the possibility that it will be superseded: requiring its subjects to negotiate a number of intersecting mech- anisms of behavior (their own and others') while clinging to whatever autonomy they can salvage, it also raises the danger that this system will ultimately break Drole de Guerre 153</page><page sequence="24">down, negating their adroit local triumphs. Even while operating as a closed system, farce releases energies that may prove its undoing. Thus the shooting of Jurieu takes place, on the one hand, outside the game-on the grounds of the chateau rather than inside the fete, where the mutual interference of ramifying plots had served to keep any one of them from running too far out of control- and on the other hand, as the linear outcome of trajectories determined inside the fete. La Chesnaye thinks that he has shut down the game: allowingJurieu to elope with his wife, discharging both Marceau and Schumacher, sending the guests to bed with sedatives; yet the mechanism continues to chug along quietly beyond his control, like an automobile engine that continues to "diesel" after the ignition has been switched off. La Chesnaye's reaction to this systemic shift is the most marked-curiously, for on one level it simply demonstrates how the social mechanism serves his advantage. Yet he is clearly shocked, and by more than natural feeling: shocked to learn that the mechanism of the fete, whose reversi- bilities he had mastered so suavely that he could only recognize and endorse the logic of the game in allowing Jurieu to elope with Christine, has suddenly back- fired to the extent of nullifying his defeat by eliminating his opponent. La Ches- naye is shaken partly by a sense that, to borrow Marx's image, the exorbitancies of the game weigh like a nightmare on the brain of the gamesman: that while he had expertly used mechanisms to express himself, in the end it is a mechanism that is ventriloquizing him and his desires. It is not only that the crisis throws his control open to question: it upsets his entire relation to the system, and thus subverts the subtle sense of contextual agency that is his greatest strength. La Chesnaye experiences something like the self-betrayal of those who leave their flank flagrantly open to penetration, but his betrayal is perhaps more discon- certing, because the "self" that betrays him is now altogether identified with a mechanism of social interactions. His had been the farcically adept defense, the mobile defense: he had scorned fences. But even the defenses of the adept can turn out to fix themselves disastrously, in a falsely settled estimation of where the limits of the game lie. Hence La Chesnaye responds drastically by snapping back into a rigid social role, explaining away the killing, reasserting his proprietary rights and the rule of civility. Having begun the game by telling Octave that, as far as inviting Jurieu to La Coliniere was concerned, he did not wish to put up walls, La Chesnaye ends by retreating into those of his chateau, and inviting the other gentry to come in out of the cold for the sake of their health. With social upheaval long overdue and the invasion of France impending, this last desperate move is clearly doomed. At every turn, the ending of The Rules of the Game announces one's unwel- come implication in ill-starred machinations; thus farce finally extends to the viewer too, despite whatever vindication one may find in La Chesnaye's showing himself to be what we began by thinking him. Renoir's cinematography in the fete sequences-his tireless "reframing," with mobile camera work insistently 154 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="25">FIGURE 4. In the flattened space of spectacle, La Chesnaye renounces the game. From Renoir, La Regle dujeu. entering the space it surveys-had announced this fact aggressively (at one point, Schumacher fires his revolver directly at the camera).52 And such effects persist even in the closing attempts to distance the viewer from the farce and its compro- mises. The sequence in which Jurieu is shot forecloses the ocular reversibility of farce with a vehemence that suggests a need to avenge its affront to spectatorial immunity; but it does so in a way that only implicates our gaze more deeply in the fatal system. Jurieu comes running through the dark, left to right as in the hunt; but he suddenly turns and runs straight toward Schumacher-and toward the camera, for we are situated just behind Schumacher's shoulder, sighting down his barrel as he fires at Jurieu, who tumbles "like a rabbit." The attempt to deepen the lateral composition of the hunt, as it was deepened in the chateau, is now met with a violent refusal by the double "shot" of gun and camera. We thus return to the hunt at last: first time farce, second time tragedy, we might feel. That Renoir wishes to call attention to his own implication becomes clear in a remarkable double voir, so to speak, in the third-to-last shot of the film, which frames the chateau with La Chesnaye at the center of its terrace, facing the camera and the house guests milling on the lawn, and explaining away the "deplorable accident" perpetrated by "my keeper Schumacher" (168; fig. 4). The metonymic substitutions of the fete have arranged that both he and the camera now occupy the same positions as in an earlier, almost identical image in which it Dr6le de Guerre 155</page><page sequence="26">was Octave-played by Renoir-who stood in just this spot on the terrace, and acted out his longing for and despair of his vanished career as a great conductor. What he/Renoir was "conducting" in this theatrical way, in a doomed attempt to attain perfect aesthetic control, is of course the film itself: holding an imaginary baton, he had faced as an imaginary orchestra the chateau, with its farcical vio- lence faintly discernible behind the French windows. Octave is responsible for having organized this farce-from the outset La Chesnaye recognizes Octave's function as a Harlequin or Puck figure presiding over the festivities, calling him "a dangerous poet" (55)-and more directly, he is now responsible for having sent Jurieu, as his surrogate, to death (in Octave's own coat, thus unwittingly mis- leading Schumacher, who had meant to shoot Octave); his culpability rivals that of La Chesnaye. Renoir thus hovers in the remembered form of Octave as a ghostly double of La Chesnaye on the terrace, his earlier posture of failure linked both with La Chesnaye's bad faith and with his own final distanced perspective as filmmaker. The film's final doubts of the bad faith of its own retreat to a satiric perspec- tive result almost inevitably from Renoir's immersion in the bewildering cross- currents of the European political crisis. The abrupt ideological reversals of the 1930s subjected him and other supporters of the Popular Front-like their oppo- nents on the political Right-to an about-face whereby the internationalist paci- fism of the Left in the early years of the decade flipped over into patriotic militarism as the necessity of resisting fascism became clear, while conversely the Right became increasingly dovelike as the successes of its neighbor fascists mul- tiplied. The contradictions of this situation for Renoir had generated ever more uncomfortable (if aesthetically charged) complications in his recent films.53 Despite the urgency of his attitudes toward the Munich agreement and Hitler, Renoir's unfamiliar militancy may have troubled him with an ambivalence the converse of that of Leon Blum, who said of Munich, "I find myself divided between a coward's relief and shame";54 and Renoir found himself unable to decry the risks of equivocation without gradually being drawn himself into a dread of the trepanning coils of the crisis. These culminated only a month after the debut of The Rules of the Game, in the calamitous farce, for a socialist opponent of Munich, of the mutually appeasing German-Soviet nonaggression pact: a sign of the times. Renoir blames himself for his implication in compromising mechanisms through a figure that Octave, in his consciousness of failure, bitterly applies to himself: Octave is a "parasite," and he now can do no better than to remove him- self (to Paris) from this world that he has unintentionally ruined (he departs with another kind of parasite: Marceau, the poacher). The term suits Octave as a per- manent house guest to the haute bourgeoisie, and also as the genius of comedy, who as Stanley Cavell observes is generically obligated to lament his position, a dep- recation that is both self-pitying and discerning, both private and socially repre- 156 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="27">sentative.55 As Cavell recognizes, Octave's self-banishment from this world only emphasizes Renoir's continued presence behind the camera. Parasitism is the condition of the filmmaker's, as well as the comedian's, relation to his object: the perpetually invisible center of the world he films, and does violence to, he attempts to remove himself; but he has nowhere else to go. In condemning him- self, by proxy, as a parasite, Renoir is attempting to bring a halt to the shuttling of metonymic substitutions that vexes the moral clarity of the ending, if only by making that shuttling appear as a personal failing. But in so doing he only enacts the familiar Derridean logic of the pharmakos, by which a strategy of scapegoating marginal elements to purify a system inevitably fails from an internal fatality that binds the scapegoat to the system.56 Renoir's peculiar twist on that logic is his attempt to scapegoat himself: rarely does the purveyor of a system condemn him- self as its parasitic impurity. The gesture is all the more unfeasible for its desper- ation, but it reveals the extremity of Renoir's sense of bad faith. While Renoir seems oppressed by a sense of ruinous implication, The Eigh- teenth Brumaire begins by offering other grounds for a parasite's bad faith: the tragic victim of history, a Danton or Robespierre, does the work of his time even if in borrowed clothing, but the parasite seemingly has no authentic work, merely a guise (by this logic none of Renoir's figures, perhaps least of all himself, appears capable of the tragedy toward which the film seems to yearn). Yet The Rules of the Game prompts us to reconceive what the parasite's historic work might be. It does so (recalling Marx's later formulations on the ghostly purport of Bonapartist farce) by showing every local system or field of action to be imbricated in political mechanisms whose limits are continually shifting, so that the parasite's relation to that field is continually trumped. The ending of the film carries its greatest foreboding in a sense of catastrophes lying just beyond the purview of what one has only just begun to regard as the system. In its representation of behavior, farce both is and is not systematic: it fields an array of systematic positions and dynamics of interaction, but an indeterminate array; it governs who or what occu- pies these positions unpredictably, without any adequation of motive or familiar sense of the historically representative. In moments of crisis, this internal unpre- dictability changes the rules of the game: maverick acts within the system cause it to break down and re-form within other limits and on other terms. With a rupture of this kind, prevailing notions of what is "representative"-as also of what is "parasitic"-are superseded as well. The sudden focusing of power in the hands of a seeming minion of the system like Schumacher-a fleeting and unsupervised but nonetheless momentous redeployment-reminds us that European politics in 1939 was a mechanism poised to produce unpredictable disaster. It held the danger not only that any of the parties might altogether shift its valence (the U.S.S.R. wavering between foe and ally, Czechoslovakia sliding from ally to bribe, England superseding France as unsanctioned representative of Czech interests), but also that pawns and parasites might suddenly wrench the game into a dif- Drole de Guerre 157</page><page sequence="28">ferent and dreadful orbit: the monied interests both in Germany and in France mistakenly assumed that they could manipulate another upstart parasite, Adolf Hitler. But farce thus gains a special potency in this crisis: in such a world, it is after all the parasite-aberrant dictator or hapless victim-who does the dirty work of his time. Acutely conscious of being a parasite and a failure, like Octave, Renoir holds himself to be, in a political sense, the victim of his form. It is as if Renoir's own farcical convolutions surprise his political motives "from behind"; hence the need to foreclose them by confronting the terrace and all its bad faith from a final critical perspective. That this posture should suffer its farcical mimicries and underminings as well seems only to compound the farceur's failure to live up to his historical moment. Yet if a harsher form of political critique, that of the war itself, nonetheless ends up confuting these complexities in its turn-if history has, not the last, but a later laugh-it does so by taking the shape of farce. The crowding of so many parasites into the historical limelight during these times reminds us that farce, even in precipitating its failures, does not lure Renoir from his historical work; however compromisingly, it turns out rather to be the form that work takes. The Rules of the Game is thus as much an emblematic effect of historical crisis as a means of representing it. The Rules of the Game is most timely, then, in the way it presents itself not as the crystallization of a precise account of the historical moment which prompted it but rather as the means of breaking open the prevailing terms of such adequa- tion. Houdini-like, farce readily delivers itself into this double bind-it problem- atizes the relationship between history and representation, and then implicitly claims to represent its historical moment in doing so-but unlike the showman, it makes no claim to escape the dilemma. It thus invites the corresponding critical paradox of an historicist account of a disruption of the relationship between his- tory and representation. This irresolvable dilemma is partly visible in the contrast between appraising farce and enacting it-that is, in the way this contrast tends to dissolve itself. Marx purports to survey farce from beyond its contingencies, but since it is farce-in the sense of a breakdown of clear distinctions between history and representation-that underwrites his historical account, the import of this stance is mainly tactical. Renoir, invoking such a breakdown more directly, enters farce with his camera, and thus assumes the inevitable burden of enact- ment: having to estimate the system in ways that the latter will not fail to exceed by shifting its limits and thus throwing Renoir, with his subjects, into crisis. Through such shifts, farce projects its historical significance forward as an omen, evoking history as an exceeding of the moment, an imminent comeuppance that will be the belated truth of this moment. The subject in crisis suddenly recognizes the conjunction of farce and history, where previously one might have descried only history (as did the sanguine builders of the Maginot Line) or only farce (as does La Chesnaye imagining he has shut down the game). Such a recognition 158 REPRESENTATIONS</page><page sequence="29">strikes both victim and observer as failure, but if farce seems to play out a failure to represent one's historical moment, it does so by exposing the limitations of one's idea of the moment; one's moment and oneself fail together. Only by enacting this double failure can The Rules of the Game accomplish its historical work: to descry the salient dangers of its time in the perpetual revision of material contingencies by unforeseen visitations of the systematic.

Leo Braudy points this out in Jean Renoir: The World of His Films (Garden City, N.Y., 1972), 209. The rightists may not have needed the stimulus of actually seeing the film to plan these demonstrations: Renoir had long been known as a leftist filmmaker, and it seems likely that elements of the Right were prepared to view each new work of his as an outrageous attack on French society. He was for example the principal director of La Vie est a nous, a highly effective campaign film commissioned by the Communist Party for the 1936 elections, and was more generally identified with the Popular Front. But although several of his earlier works embodied more obvious political arguments, Rules was greeted with a new virulence; see for example the review by Georges Cham- peaux in the extreme rightwing weekly Gringoire, 13 July 1939 (brief excerpts from Dr6le de Guerre 159</page><page sequence="30">this review and several others referred to below accompany La Regle dujeu, the screen- play of Renoir's film published in L'Avant-Scene du cinema 52 [1965], 62-64). 6.

His sardonic rhetoric allows one to see how France's dereliction plays into the film's gender dynamics: "It seems to me that our representatives have exaggerated just a trifle [in describing how Czechoslovakia should welcome the Munich agreement]... There's a big difference between an honorable prostitute, who repays honestly with personal favors [or, who risks her skin honestly], and the gentleman who disposes of her, who sends her from Marseille to Montevideo, from Casablanca to the rue Lafer- riere, without asking her leave. This four-power pact has about it a touch of white- slave traffic"; Ecrits, 177-78. The imagery of pimping lends disturbing resonances to the way in which Christine is passed from one genteel but self-serving paramour to another. 13.

Shirer, The Collapse of the Third Republic: An Inquiry into the Fall of France in 1940 (New York, 1969), 184-86. 15. This contradiction emerges quite nakedly in the derisive response of Gen. Maurin, Minister of War, in a debate over military policy in the Chamber of Deputies in 1935, to the suggestion that France shift its attention away from a nearly exclusive emphasis on the Maginot Line and prepare for an offensive course of action before it was too late: "How can anyone believe that we are still thinking in terms of the offensive when we have spent so many billions to establish a fortified frontier! Should we be mad enough to advance beyond this barrier-on I don't know what sort of adventure?"; Shirer, Collapse, 186. Evidently the support of Czechoslovakia would qualify as adven- turism of this kind. 16. In his 1939 study of France during the 1930s, Alexander Werth, Paris correspondent of the Manchester Guardian from 1932 to the fall of France, calls the Maginot Line "the supreme-if secret-excuse for the surrender of Czechoslovakia"; France and Munich: Before and After the Surrender (London, 1939; reprint ed., New York, 1969), x. 17.

Hence "the High Command calculated that it would take the Germans fifteen days to bring up strong enough forces-40 divisions with heavy artillery and 100,000 tons of munitions-to make a serious attempt on the Meuse line from Namur to Sedan"; Shirer, Collapse, 629. In fact, the seven Panzer divisions arrived at the river Meuse within three days and made a more-than-serious attempt on Sedan despite their unaccountable haste in failing to wait for their forty divisions and tons of munitions. 29.

The peculiar ironic cachet of this book, in retrospect- the pathos of its clairvoyance and of its sybilline state of neglect-is intensified by Gaullist lore, which portrays it as the petard on which the French were hoist: as Walter Millis writes in the foreword to The Army of the Future, "This is the now famous little book by a French officer on the principles of which the French did not act-while the Germans did" (7). Paul Reynaud urged de Gaulle's ideas before the Chamber of Dep- uties in March of 1935, but to no avail; the remarks of Gen. Maurin cited above (note 15) formed part of a rebuttal to Reynaud.

Most theorists of farce have defined the genre in part by reference to its supposed lack of meaning and of purpose (save that of merely exciting laughter). See for Dr6le de Guerre 161</page><page sequence="32">example L.J. Potts, Comedy (New York, 1966), 151; and G.B. Shaw, "The Farcical Comedy Outbreak," in Dramatic Opinions and Essays with an Apology, vol. 1 (New York, 1906), 415; authorities from various periods are quoted to the same effect by Jessica Milner Davis, Farce (London, 1978), 1; and Bernadette Rey-Flaud, La Farce, ou la machine a rire: Theorie d'un genre dramatique, 1450-1550 (Geneva, 1984), 1. Only in recent times have some theorists-still in the minority-begun to think of farce as the essential form of comedy or even of drama; see for example Maurice Charney, Comedy High and Low (New York, 1978), xi, 97-105; and Vsevolod Meyerhold, "Farce," Tulane Drama Review 4 (1959): 139-49. But even its supporters do not always contest the assumption that farce is by definition frivolous and devoid of meaning. 37. The earliest of these farsae were glosses; later, they were increasingly relied upon to provide comic relief from the longueurs of ceremony; Davis, Farce, 6-7. In "Marx and Heterogeneity: Thinking the Lumpenproletariat," Representations 31 (Summer 1990), 87-88, Peter Stallybrass comments on the "stuffing" aspect of farce in The Eighteenth Brumaire. 38. The term appears often in theoretical accounts. One can easily see how Bergson's treatment of the idea of mechanism would suggest degradation, but interestingly even Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of the "grotesque realism" of carnival, which inverts the normal valuation both of farce and of degradation, does so largely for the resistance that farcical degradation poses to an in-effect mechanical mode of existence. Carni- valesque inversions, which valorize everything earthly and bodily (especially lower- bodily), thereby "degrade" human experience in the sense that they effect the "strictly topographical" "lowering of all that is high, spiritual, ideal, abstract"-that is, of a nonmaterial, empty simulacrum of the human-to the redeemingly organic, material realm of the social body, to an authenticity of which the systematizing structures of the hegemonic society have emptied its subjects; Rabelais and His World, trans. H6elne Iswolsky (Cambridge, Mass., 1968), 18-21. 39. The shot over which Renoir labored hardest-one he called, in the ORTF interview, "the best shot I've done in my life"-is the ten-second take of La Chesnaye's reaction to the debut of his hugely elaborate mechanical organ: intent on presenting the mar- quis's absorption with artificiality as the source of his refined and conflicted emotions, Renoir insisted on retaking the shot for more than two hours (quoted in Rules, 12). On the complexity of Renoir's characters, see also his comments to Nino Frank, quoted in Gauteur, Renoir, 147. 40. Most professional as well as casual readings of the film that I am acquainted with, for instance, imagine that Christine's amorous attachments are unintelligibly flighty. In fact the motivations are carefully prepared, though fleetingly inscribed: upon seeing Genevieve fling her arms around an unwilling La Chesnaye, Christine recoils in pain and immediately turns to grab the nearest male hand she sees, St. Aubin's; she revises this arbitrary amour when Jurieu presents himself, in an attempt to bring adultery in line with at least the form of romantic love; then, realizing that she cannot put her heart into this conventional role, she retreats to a romantic liaison with Octave that is both more incestuous and desexualized than that with Jurieu. By agreeing to run off with Octave, Christine reveals the emotional preeminence of her marriage, whose default cannot be answered by erotic affairs, but only by the replication of a family structure with Octave, her childhood friend and her father's protege. 41. The phrase is Terry Eagleton's; see Walter Benjamin: or, Towards a Revolutionary Criticism (London, 1981), 160.

All further references to this work will be included parenthetically in the text. The "Eighteenth Brumaire" is the designation, according to the republican calendar introduced during the period of the French Revolution, for 9 November 1799, the date on which Napo- leon I carried out his own coup d'dtat. The other names and political terms are used to invoke the parallels between the first bourgeois revolutionary period and that of 1848 to 1851. 44. A travesty subtly symptomatized by Louis's auto-rechristening: not content to be able to say that Napoleon was his middle name, he took it over as his surname. Conversely, Marx insists upon retaining the abandoned "Bonaparte" and dropping the ersatz "Napoleon," to underscore the imposture. 45. Bergson, "Laughter," 84. 46. Jeffrey Mehlman concludes, from the articulations in Marx's text of a volatile revers- ibility of the elements of a farcical system, that "absolutely anything may come to occupy the positions of the repetitive structure"; Revolution and Repetition: MarxlHugolBalzac (Berkeley, 1977), 20. For Mehlman, Bonaparte's erratic independence of his consti- tuencies underscores the intractability of Marx's analytic object, generating in his text a kind of intellectual slapstick that serves as a burlesque rejoinder to his entire theory of class representation (see esp. 9-34). Terry Eagleton takes Mehlman to task for oper- ating with a reductive understanding of class representation in Marx, and he suggests that, in his formalism, Mehlman himself "merely falls prey to the ideology of Bona- partism"; Eagleton, Benjamin, 168; see also 162-63. 47. The principal "idees napoleoniennes" cited by Marx are the small-holding form of prop- erty itself, strong and unlimited government, heavy taxation, and the preeminence of the Church and the Army. 48. Marx exhibits such a strategy in his very first sentence by conveniently forgetting that the passage "somewhere" in Hegel that announces the repetitions of history actually defines the second instance as a countersign of authenticity, just the opposite of the farcical emptying out that Marx seems to attribute to it (though he does so only pro- visionally-witness his inversion of this idea in remarking the proleptic parody of the future revolution). In Lectures on the Philosophy of History Hegel writes, "A coup d'6tat is sanctioned as it were in the opinion of people if it is repeated. Thus, Napoleon was defeated twice and twice the Bourbons were driven out. Through repetition, what at the beginning seemed to be merely accidental and possible becomes real and estab- lished" (quoted in the editors' note to the first sentence of The Eighteenth Brumaire, p. 643). It is a legitimate, albeit farcical, procedure throughout Marx's thought to stand Hegel on his head; the point is not that the movement of inversion here undoes Marx's argument (as Mehlman might argue) but that Marx appropriates that movement. This maneuver puts Marx in the dubious company of another opportunist of a less prin- cipled kind: "And an individual turned up who gives himself out as the man because he bears the name of Napoleon, as a result of the Code Napoleon, which lays down that la recherche de la paternite est interdite" (inquiry into paternity is prohibited; 188). The Code Napoleon is thus a by-word of farcical victimization-it is Bonaparte's dupes, in this case the small-holding peasantry, who obey it-but Marx nonetheless does not scruple to invoke it tacitly (in the alibi "somewhere") in evading inquiry into the "paternity" of his notion that historical reiteration is farcical. Drole de Guerre 163</page><page sequence="34">49. For instance, The Eighteenth Brumaire has been read as a proleptic account of fascism, and one might find in Stalin, as arguably a descendant of Bonaparte, a lamentable travesty of the independence of state authority from the class that supports it, one much harder-for social and political if not conceptual reasons-for historical mate- rialism to critique with mercurial pen than Bonapartism. 50. Later the ghost reappears in a more allusive, not to say subterranean form, as the proletarian revolution is conceived to be accomplishing its business not despite or after but through the current farcical events: But the revolution is thorough. It is still journeying through purgatory. It does its work methodically.... First it perfected the parliamentary power, in order to be able to overthrow it. Now that it has attained this, it perfects the executive power, reduces it to its purest expression, isolates it, sets it up against itself as the sole target, in order to concentrate all its forces of destruction against it. And when it has done this second half of its preliminary work, Europe will leap from its seat and exultantly exclaim: Well burrowed, old mole! (185) Marx here raises another ghost, Shakespeare's: the final remark is that of Hamlet to his father's ghost, whose subterranean utterances he has just invoked in order to frighten his companions into silence concerning the fact that the ghost does walk. Thus Marx deploys a connotation (transmitted from the past) that ghosts may be con- jured in order to abet a scheme of filial revolt and vengeance (while perhaps wishing to finesse the way in which this scheme falls prey to equivocation). 51. In his critique of Mehlman, Eagleton rightly points to Marx's rigorous exposure of farcical exorbitancies, not as a scandal in his argument but as the fitting effects of historical repetition within inevitable material constraints. Yet finally Eagleton seems uncomfortable with the action of farce, unless he can envision history as rising above its vagrancies in a final comic rejoinder: "If there is always that which escapes, always that difference irreducible to dialectics, it is not only the irredeemably tragic or the insolently anarchistic but the very content of the comic society of the future, the very end-product of dialectics itself"; Benjamin, 169. Here Eagleton invokes what looks like a transcendent form of comedy after all, apparently in allergic reaction to what he goes on to call "the regressive farce" of Bonapartism. Though such comedy, as the felicitous form of dialectics, purportedly preserves the irreducible difference released in farce, it is not clear how it would allow anything "insolently anarchistic" to escape it (except by withering away). Hence it is also unclear that Eagleton's appeal to a "realm of freedom and abundance" (170) avoids the "double-bind" of utopianism that he has described Bakhtinian carnival as having the potential to evade: "Its affirmative images of transcendence rest upon a potentially crippling sublimation of the drives necessary to achieve it in practice" (149). He is certainly aware of this danger: "What is implied by Marx's 'poetry of the future' is not simply an image of utopia but a wholly new political semiotics" (170). But apart from the problem of what Eagleton means by "transcendence ... in practice," the notion of a "ceaseless self-surpassing," a "process of continual self-excess" (169-70) that he invokes to ground the "poetry of the future" seems sufficiently exalted to risk utopian sublimation itself. He remains unwilling to accept such self-excess as farce-as what he finds "insolently anarchistic"-but only as a comedy that conceives excess as a higher ("surpassing") state, a felicity ever deferred. 52.
