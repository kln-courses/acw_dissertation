<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Fallen Love: Eros and Ta’wīl in the   Poetry of Robert Duncan Ross Hair University of East Anglia This article examines Robert Duncan’s erotic poetics in the context of his interest in an  elite “Spirit of Romance” and “Cult of Eros” that he recognizes in Lucius Apuleius, the  Provençal troubadours, Dante and the Fedeli d’amore, as well as in his modernist  forbears, particularly Ezra Pound, who coined the term “the Spirit of Romance.” In  his explication of this tradition, Duncan has drawn on the ideas of the religious scholar  Henry Corbin, particularly his work on the “Visionary Recitals” — the spiritual autobi- ographies and commentaries associated with the thirteenth-century Persian philosopher  Avicenna. Focusing on Corbin’s notion of ta’wīl, a method of textual exegesis that forms  the keystone of his work on Arabic religious esotericism, this article examines the typo- logical affinities that Corbin’s scholarship shares with Duncan’s erotic poetics. Via close  readings of Duncan’s poems “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar,” “The Torso,” and  “Circulations of the Song,” this article argues that Corbin’s work provides a pertinent  corollary to Duncan’s erotic poetics. Kewords: Robert Duncan / Henry Corbin / eros / hermeneutics In “Opening the Dreamway,” his 1983 lecture for the Analytical Society of Western New York, Robert Duncan (1919–1988) remarks that with “Corbin being conveniently dead, you could start enrapturing yourself or what with  detritus from Corbin” (20).1 Duncan is referring to Henry Corbin (1903–1978),  the French scholar of religion who was, Tom Cheetham writes, “at once a Neo- platonic philosopher, a theologian with interests in Immanuel Swedenborg and  Johan George Hamann, Jacob Boehme and Martin Heidegger, and an Orientalist  specializing in Islamic mysticism” (vi). Duncan evokes Corbin in the context of  his friend Norman O. Brown (1913–2002), who, Duncan claims, “gives lectures  on Islam, alarming to the people who are actually in Islam” (20). These lectures,  recently collected and published in The Challenge of Islam: The Prophetic Tradition  (2009), draw extensively on Corbin’s work. Duncan’s use of the word “enrapturing” — from rapt, meaning to be carried  away by force, and sharing the same root as “rape” and “ravish” — reflects how, as  Stephen Fredman notes, Duncan reads Brown’s earlier book, Love’s Body (1966)  </page> <page sequence="2"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 175 as “a poetics of eroticism” concerned primarily with “the symbolic transfer of  energies from sexual to the political to the cosmic and back again” (29). Brown’s  later lectures are “alarming” because they continue to elaborate on this “erotic  poetics” by finding examples in Islam. As Jay Cantor suggests, Brown found in  Islam’s esoteric currents suggestions of “a different way (in Ibn Arabi and Sufism)  of how an erotic body consciousness might be described” that reiterate his ideas  about Eros (x). In particular, Corbin’s ideas concerning the theophanism of the  Shi’ite Sufi Ibn Arabi in Alone with the Alone: Creative Imagination in the Sūfism  of Ibn ‘Arabī (1969) resonate with Brown’s emphasis on an “erotic mysticism that  grounds its symbolism in something instead of seeking transcendence” (Fredman  24). As well as grounding an eros-centred mysticism in tangible forms, Corbin’s  theophanism also complements and furthers a “mystical eroticism that [Brown]  aligns with the gnostic or hermetic tradition in Western culture” (Fredman 24).  Although Brown’s prime figures are William Blake and Jacob Boehme, a signifi- cant and not unrelated branch of this tradition, Arthur Versluis suggests, concerns  a “sophianic mysticism or religious eros,” rooted in courtly love and troubadour  poetry, in which “religious knowledge, chivalric mythology, initiatory wisdom,  asceticism, and love were all condensed” (30). Duncan’s own reading of Corbin, upon whom he had been “enraptur- ing” himself since 1961, dovetails with these assessments of Brown’s enquiries  into Eros. The manifold attributes that Denis De Rougemont identifies with  Eros — “complete desire, luminous Aspiration, the primitive religious soaring  carried to its loftiest pitch, [and] the extreme exigency of purity which is also the  extreme exigency of Unity” — are also instructive forces, or powers, throughout  Duncan’s poetry (61). In all his manifestations — as a primal Orphic cosmic power  (Phanes-Eros), a Platonic ideal (the Beloved), as well as the classical god (son of  Aphrodite, companion of Psyche) and as erotic desire — Eros is, I propose, the  “major mover” of Duncan’s poetry (OF 11). Building on Fredman’s insights regarding Duncan’s erotic “contextual” poet- ics, I want to consider the tacit role Corbin assumes in Duncan’s own ideas about  the “primary eroticism of poetry” (27). To do so, I will focus primarily on how  Duncan has read Corbin’s book, Avicenna and the Visionary Recital (1960), which  Robin Blaser gave him in 1961 (Bertholf 337).2 Duncan uses Corbin’s book in his  engagement with the cult of Eros and its pronounced angelology in a section of  The H. D. Book dating back to March 1961.3 Duncan also evokes Corbin in several  poems included in Bending the Bow (1968) and in Ground Work: Before the War  (1984). Considering these poems in relation to what is perhaps Duncan’s defin- ing “erotic” poem — “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar” from The Opening  of the Field (1960) — I propose that Duncan’s erotic poetics, by invoking what is  essentially a syncretistic tradition of Eros-centred theosophies and Neoplatonic  cosmologies, addresses the question of “fallen love.” This refers to an earthly,  material love, itself reflecting the Divine Love with which individuals (or, their  souls) aspire to reunite. It also denotes what De Rougement in Love in the Western  World (1940) describes as a historical descent of “passionate love”: </page> <page sequence="3"> 176 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 The history of passionate love in all great literature from the thirteenth century down  to our own day is the history of the descent of the courtly myth into “profane” life,  the account of the more and desperate attempts of Eros to take the place of mysti- cal transcendence by means of emotional intensity. But magniloquent or plaintive,  the tropes of its passionate discourse and the hues of its rhetoric can never attain to  more than the glow of a resurgent twilight and the promise of a phantom bliss. (170) As a historical condition and as a cosmic force, “Eros, like Osiris or Lucifer  (if He be the Prince of Light whom the Gnostics believe scattered in sparks  throughout the darkness of what is matter),” Duncan claims, “is a Lord over us  in spirit who is dispersed everywhere to our senses”: “We are drawn to Him, but  we must also gather Him to be” (HD 82). The poet therefore has to retrieve and  re-member this “fallen love” within “the creative work of a union in knowledge  and experience” (HD 82). As I argue, not only does Corbin engage similar themes  of exile and return in various forms of Arabic esotericism, but he also identifies  and promotes a method of textual exegesis — the Arabic concept of ta’wīl — which  is fundamental to their gnosis. Ta’wīl, I argue, provides an implicit corollary to  Duncan’s recuperative poetic that “participates in the erotic energy underlying not  only the experience of love but all life” and “take[s] in and imaginatively inhabit[s]  the entire spectrum between eros and thanatos” (Fredman 177, 166). The Visionary reciTal Avicenna and the Visionary Recital comprises Corbin’s translations of the “Vision- ary Recitals” and the accompanying commentaries attributed to the Persian  philosopher Ibn Sinna (Avicenna) as well as Corbin’s extensive explication of  their complex hermeneutics. These Recitals, such as The Recital of the Bird and  The Recital of Hayy ibn Yaqzan, are spiritual autobiographies or mystical accounts,  which articulate what Christopher Bamford describes as “Avicenna’s Neopla- tonized Aristotelianism” that attempts to “impose the intelligible universe of  Neoplatonism, proceeding by contemplation, upon Aristotle’s more sense-based  world” in order to delineate a “theoretically elaborated cosmos [not as] an abstract  construct but [as] a lived, phenomenal reality” (Voyage xxvi, xlviii). According to Bamford, the Recital expresses “a complicity between ange- lology and cosmology” that “ontologize[s] nature and consciousness as a single  structure, confirming the essentially spiritual nature of humanity and the sote- riological structure of the cosmos” (Voyage xxvii). The Recitals are essentially  anagogic narratives that describe journeys of exile and return. Traveling through  a spiritual and symbolic topography, the narrator of the Recital expresses how the  soul is connected to, and mediated by, a hierarchy of angelic Intelligences that  lead back to the divine One. As Bamford explains, “by means of contemplation  and endowing the cosmos — the world of human experiences — with a spiritual,  angelological (that is, ontological) correspondence” the traveler’s soul returns to  its divine origins (Voyage xxvi). It is at this point that theophany proves crucial to  </page> <page sequence="4"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 177 such an event because “to conceive the universe and intelligible essences” within  the Recital is “complemented by imaginative ability to Visualize concrete figures,  to encounter ‘persons’ ” so that “the soul reveals all the presences that have always  inhabited it without its being aware of them” (AV 8). This “acquisition of con- sciousness,” Corbin suggests, “permits the soul triumphantly to pass beyond the  circles that held it prisoner” (AV 8). “And that,” Corbin proposes, “is the entire  adventure related, as a personal experience, in the Recital of Hayy ibn Yaqzan and  the Recital of the Bird” (AV 8). The spiriT of romance In The H.D. Book, Duncan reiterates Corbin’s emphasis on “personal experience”  in the context of the “cult of angels” that occurs within a transhistorical “Spirit of  Romance” that attributes “absolute value [. . .] to the individual experience that  would imagine the universe in terms of love, desire, devotion, and ecstasy” (520).  Duncan derives the phrase “Spirit of Romance” from Pound’s book of the same  name (first published in 1910), which traces a cult of Eros or Love “from the  Golden Ass of Apuleius and from the Pervigilium Veneris of the second-century a.d.  through to Dante and Guido [Cavalcanti]” (Selected Prose 155). From this Spirit  of Romance a new conception of Love emerges: Romance has appeared, and there may be a new Eros. Not only the primal cosmic  power but also the Platonic ideal, the First Beloved, but also the most human god  that Psyche sought, but also the Eros as evil that Church fathers, Catholic and  heretic, had imagined, but also now the power of a cult that remains as a mode in  poetry. Eros had become a tradition of the poem. (HD 95–96) Duncan sees Pound’s generation as inheritors of this “tradition of the poem,”  which was passed onto them from the Pre-Raphaelites: “Back of H.D., as back  of Pound or of Yeats, was the cult of romance that Rossetti and then Morris had  derived from Dante and his circle, the Fedeli d’amore, and revived in the Victorian  era” (HD 519).4 Just as the modernists received the tradition from their Victorian  predecessors, Duncan sees himself and close contemporaries including Robert  Creeley, inheriting it from their modernist forbears (Selected Prose 155). Indeed,  “Sonnet 3” from Roots and Branches (1964) — Duncan’s reworking of Dante’s  sonnet, “Guido, i’vorrei che tu e Lapo ed io,” addressed to Robin Blaser and Jack  Spicer — promotes an Erotic coterie in its celebration of homosexual fraternity and  its testimony to “a primary poetic vision and experience that will return where it  will in man’s history” (RB 124; HD 97). The Spirit of Romance comprises an “aristocracy of emotion” encompassing  various poetic milieus, including the Provençal troubadours, the Tuscan poets  known as the Fedeli d’amore — the faithful followers of Love who practiced the  dolce stil novo, the “sweet new style” of poetry — and, their most celebrated affiliate,  Dante (SR 90). Unlike the “erotic poetics of the New American poets” that, Fred- man claims, “marks a rebirth of Whitmanian virtues of informality, openness,  </page> <page sequence="5"> 178 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 vulnerability, nakedness, ecstasy, and camaraderie,” the Spirit of Romance is elite  and circumscribed (6). Closed, hermetic forms such as the troubadours’ trobar  clus, and the “visionary interpretation” they required, ensured only a specialized  readership could grasp Love’s divine mysteries (SR 90). Likewise, the Fedeli  d’amore, William Anderson writes, was “open to a few,” those “rare spirits who  were struggling to devise a code of life that retained from chivalry the idea of  nobility, while making it depend on personal virtue instead of inherited wealth  and breeding” also “preserved spiritual aspirations not unlike that of some mendi- cants” (80). But their “insistence on the nobility of the heart rather than nobility  of descent,” Anthony Mortimer notes, “does not involve any democratization of  poetry” because these Tuscan poets saw “themselves as a cultural and spiritual  elite” and “shared the Provençal love of formal complexity” which ensured their  code of love was not profaned by base minds (153, 151). This elite gnosis emphasizes an experiential Love, an “interpretation of the  cosmos by feeling,” which is felt as a spiritual reality via the mediation of a female  figure (SR 94). Recalling how in the Visionary Recital the “figure that announces  itself to the soul personally [. . .] symbolizes with the soul’s most intimate depths,”  Duncan proposes that in the Spirit of Romance, “The Spirit or the sacred in man’s  being appeared in the old order as a woman, an angelic presence or Truth in which  a man took his being, as Dante took his being in Beatrice” (AV 20; HD 516). This  “Truth” in Dante’s Vita Nuova, Roxanna Preda notes, is Love itself, “an anthro- pomorphic, male, para-Christian deity that appears in dreams and visions and  dictates conduct” (47). Corbin describes a similar anthropomorphism in terms of  theophany, noting how “a phenomenology of the stranger-consciousness” mani- fests in “[w]orks of philosophy, spiritual romances in prose, or mystical poems”  as “a fundamental gnostic intuition, which in every relation individualizes the  Holy Spirit into an individual Spirit, who is the celestial paredros of the human  being, its guardian angel, guide and companion, helper and saviour” (AV 27, 21). Duncan also recognizes Eros as “a primal authority, a cosmic need,” and a  “formal demand” which is realized in a law (or lure) of desire and attraction that  “shape[s] all matter to its energies” (HD 82, 71). This perception of Eros as both  a cosmic and a personal phenomenon adumbrates Duncan’s notion of “a poetic  faith in which Eros and Poetry, Romance, Rite and Lore have become One in the  imagination” (HD 98). Fredman draws attention to this aspect of Duncan’s poetry  in the context of what he considers the “self-reflexivity” of Duncan’s erotic poetics  (28). According to Fredman, this self-reflexivity “has much in common with the  cult of love because both pursuits involve an erotic turning inward that increases  the power of the activity by concentrating on its own properties rather than  on the outside world” (28). The broader implications of Duncan’s self-reflexive  erotic poetics are evident in Davidson’s suggestion that, for Duncan, poetry itself  “instantiates a ritual ‘scene of instruction’ that inaugurates the poem and becomes  one of its central subjects”: </page> <page sequence="6"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 179 In its most common form, the scene opens with the poet engaged in reading (or,  in some cases, in writing) a text, whereupon lexical or philological questions about  individual words disturb concentration and permit entry into a deeper level of  comprehension. The poet returns to a “place of first permission” where suppressed  meanings provide access to a larger vision of things. Those meanings include archaic  survivals of cultic and atavistic religions which propose a unity of spirit and form, of  soul and eros. (“Marginality” 279) This kind of self-reflexivity, as I discuss below, is evident in Duncan’s poem  “Poem Beginning with a Line By Pindar” which, out of all the contingent factors  of composition, becomes “a powerful nexus” of the “transcendent reality of Eros  and Psyche and of the revelations flowing out of the myth they belonged to” (FC  17). This poem, therefore, not only demonstrates how poetry instantiates a rite  in which “Eros and Poetry, Romance, Rite and Lore [ . . . ] become One in the  imagination,” but also discloses hermetic meanings, or a gnosis, concerning the  cult of Eros within which “soul and eros” are major, defining powers and players. Ta’wīl Corbin also recognizes reading as the scene of ritual instruction. Indeed, what  Davidson identifies as an instructive reading practice motivating Duncan’s poet- ics is paralleled in the ta’wīl that Corbin understands as a textual exegesis and  “the most characteristic mental operation of all our Spirituals, Neoplatonists,  Ishraqiyun, Sufis, [and] Ismailian theosophists”: Its process is best fitted to reveal to us both the secret of the genesis of our vision- ary recitals (since it also provokes the situation that originates them) and the secret  of deciphering them. The operation properly consists in “bringing back,” recalling,  returning to its origin, not only the text of a book but also the cosmic context in  which the soul is imprisoned. The soul must free this context, and free itself from it,  by transmuting it into symbols. (AV 28) Ta’wīl is implicit throughout Duncan’s work. In “Moving the Moving Image,  Passages 17,” from Bending the Bow, Duncan uses the term “Mi’raj” to describe  the sun’s ascent that becomes commensurate with the ascent of the enraptured  speaker’s heart: “Grand Mi’raj! It is the Sun, the fiery ball / that ascends with  my heart” (BB 60). According to Corbin, “Mi’raj” denotes the gnostic’s anagogic  ascent — their journey of Return: “The ta’wīl of the soul — the exegesis that leads  the soul back to its truth (haqiqat) — transmutes all cosmic realities and relations  and restores them to symbols; each becomes an Event of the soul, which, in its  ascent, its Mi’raj, passes beyond them and makes them interior to itself ” (AV 34). Ascent and interiorization are not, however, antitheses in the gnostic ascent.  “We imagine transcendence on the basis of height,” Pierre Deghaye writes, “but  it exists no less in the depths. On the other hand, depths also exist in interiority.  What is interior is transcendent in relation to what is exterior” (217). Notably,  </page> <page sequence="7"> 180 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 Davidson describes Duncan’s poetry as permitting “entry into a deeper level of  comprehension,” and Duncan draws attention to a similar notion of depth in “The  Sweetness and Greatness of Dante’s Divine Comedy” (1965): If we view the literal as matter of mere fact, as the positivist does, it is mute. But  once we apprehend the literal as a language, once things about us reveal depths and  heights of meaning, we are involved in the sense of Creation ourselves, and in our  human terms, this is Poetry, making, the inner Fiction of Consciousness. (FC 145) Ascent/descent is also evident in the image of the sun Duncan presents in  “Benefice, Passages 23” which, “on the horizon / in the West // (setting) / rises”  (BB 76). Notably, this sun rises “from the OrientWest of us” (BB 76). Corbin’s uses  the term “Orient” to describe the spiritual orientation of ta’wīl: “[B]eneath the  idea of exegesis we glimpse that of an exodus, of a ‘departure from Egypt,’ which is  an exodus from metaphor and the slavery of the letter, from exile and the Occident  of exoteric appearance to the Orient of the original and hidden Idea” (BB 76; AV  29). This “exodus” is achieved through the hermeneutics of ta’wīl, which, Corbin  emphasizes, “is, etymologically and inversely, to cause to return, to lead back, to  restore to one’s origin and to the place where one comes home, consequently to  return to the true and original meaning of a text” (AV 29). What Corbin describes is not without precedent or equivalents. For example,  the emphasis Corbin places on a text’s exoteric and esoteric meanings recalls the  “closed,” hermetic, compositions of trobar clus that, Roger Boase explains, “lends  itself to interpretation on many levels” (78) and, according to Frank M. Chambers,  “demands more than ordinarily acute receptivity on the part of the reader” (96– 97). Indeed, the elite “inner rite” of trobar clus and its “heretical language where  meanings were united in a spiritual double-entendre” parallel the extraordinary  demands of ta’wīl (HD 91). According to Corbin, only the exegete who has “first  acquired a perfect understanding of the ‘data’ which the literal revelation (tanzīl)  provides,” and “who is fully appraised of the modalities according to which the  universes intercorrespond, as well as the meaning of the anamnesis to be found in  all of them” can perform ta’wīl (Temple 39). Although it seems credulous to presume a “true and original meaning of a  text,” Duncan’s poetry expresses its own exodus from the slavery of the letter.  In his program notes for a 1959 reading at San Francisco State College’s Poetry  Center, Duncan posits a transcendent/hidden archetext: A poem is news of an other life. And from childhood I have been seeking the lore of  that other life, with a faith that everything that is realized here is there, and real only  there — thus I call it the real world: that everything we do here, each act, the actual  world, is a sign, an omen of the real, and an enactment of its reality, as actual words  in actual script or print on the actual page are signs of a real spiritual world. (173–174) Language not only describes an “other” reality but is that reality. Exegesis,  therefore, is integral to how that other life, the spiritual reality of Poetry, is real- ized. Thus, as Corbin suggests, “instead of seeking a secret in or under the text,  </page> <page sequence="8"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 181 we must regard the text itself as the secret” (AV 33). In Duncan’s case, this means  that at back of each poem is the intimation of a more encompassing Poetry. To  recall Davidson’s claims regarding Duncan’s “ritual ‘scene of instruction,’ ” each  poem, in its writing or its reading, becomes an occasion for what is essentially  ta’wīl, a method and a rite of intuiting the larger orders concealed within a text. These similarities with ta’wīl are perhaps most striking in Duncan’s intro- duction to Bending the Bow, particularly in his description of the poem as a dark  room “alight with love’s intentions” (BB vii). He writes, “It is striving to come into  existence in these things, or, all striving to come into existence is It — in this realm  of man’s languages a poetry of all poetries, grand collage, I name It, having only  the immediate event of words to speak for It. In the room we, aware or unaware,  are the event of ourselves in It” (BB vii). Duncan also voices these ideas in “The Sweetness and Greatness of Dante’s  Divine Comedy,” claiming that, “the universe and our experience in it is a text that  we must learn to read if we are to come to the truth of it and ourselves” (FC 144).  Corbin makes a similar claim in the context of the gnostic’s soul in the Recital,  which “takes its departure, accomplishes the ta’wīl of its true being, by basing  itself on a text — text of a book or cosmic text — which its effort will carry to a  transmutation, raise to the rank of a real, but inner and psychic, Event” (AV 31).  But whether ta’wīl can really achieve such a return to “real” truth and meaning is  not as important as the stance such exegesis implies. For, as Corbin suggests, the  orientation of ta’wīl refuses to limit “the field of true and meaningful knowledge  to the mere operations of the rational understanding”: Freed from an old impasse, we have learned to register and to make use of the inten- tions implicit in all the acts of consciousness or transconsciousness. To say that the  Imagination (or love, or sympathy, or any other sentiment) induces knowledge, and  knowledge of an ‘object’ which is proper to it, no longer smacks of paradox. (Alone 3) The angel The dialectical relationship of the actual with the spiritual — those depths and  heights of meaning witnessed in the literal — defines the Spirit of Romance and its  emphasis on the figure of the Beloved. “In the tradition of the mystery poem that  Pound traces from Apuleius to Dante the figure of a woman is central,” Duncan  notes: “Isis, then the Venus of the Pervigilium Veneris, the Lady of the trouba- dours and Beatrice” (HD 512). Duncan outlines a similar legacy in his poem “The  Maiden” in The Opening of the Field whose image of a maiden “Bright with spring,”  recalls the verdant imagery used to describe the Lady of the troubadours and the  Fedeli d’amore. Dante’s friend, Guido Cavalcanti and fellow Fedeli d’amore, in his  ballata, “Fresca rosa novella” stresses how the Lady becomes a mediatrix when  he writes: “Angelic form, I say, / Lady, resides in you” (3). In such instances, as  Duncan explains in The H.D. Book, the lover is “united with the divine reality by  a love union with the Angel who is present in the person of the Beloved” (520).  </page> <page sequence="9"> 182 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 In the figure of the Beloved theophany occurs; Love manifests Itself through love,  desire, and beauty. This “Lady is both archetypical and specific,” Duncan sug- gests in an essay acknowledging Creeley’s place in the Spirit of Romance, which  indicates how “poetry arises in the constant working of a tangible substance and  idea at tension” (Selected Prose 155). Corbin’s influence on Duncan’s ideas about this tradition is implicit in Dun- can’s suggestion that “Dante drew from translated Sufi texts as well as from the  songs of Toulouse and Albi where such images of the First Beloved appeared”  (HD 519, 521). While this recalls Pound’s claim in “Cavalcanti” (1934) that  Cavalcanti’s ideas are traceable to “the Arabian background” of Avicenna, “the  concentric spheres of the heavens, Ibn Baja’s itinerary of the soul going to God,  [and] Averroes’ specifications for the degrees of comprehension,” it also reflects  Corbin’s claims regarding the intersection of Arabic theosophy with the Fedeli  d’amore (LE 149, 158). Corbin frequently uses the term “Fedeli d’amore” to describe  the eros-centred theophanies in various Arabic traditions, including the Visionary  Recital, as well as “Ibn ‘Arabi, the incomparable master of mystic theosophy, and  Jalaluddin Rumi, the Iranian troubadour of that religion of love whose flame feeds  on the theophanic feeling for sensuous beauty” (Alone 110): Fedeli d’amore struck us as the best means of translating into a Western language the  names by which our mystics called themselves in Arabic or Persian (‘ashiqun, muhib- bun, arbab al-hawa, etc.) Since it is the name by which Dante and his companions  called themselves, it has the power of suggesting the traits which were common to  both groups and have been analyzed in memorable works. (Alone 110) Corbin, however, is more concerned with identifying “the undeniable typo- logical affinities between them,” the Oriental and the Occidental Fedeli d’amore,  rather than their “actual historical relations” (Alone 100). One key affinity is “the  experience of a cult of love dedicated to a beautiful being is the necessary initia- tion to divine love, from which it is inseparable” and which “is a unique initiation,  which transfigures eros as such, that is, human love for a human creature” (Alone  101). This adumbrates Duncan’s claim, derived from Plato’s Symposium, that “love  is most true when addressed in the name of the First Beloved, the One because of  Whom we love” (HD 488). The implications of such mediated love are sketched  out at length by Corbin in Avicenna and the Visionary Recital: [W]hat the Fedeli d’amore saw was at once the Angel Intelligence-Wisdom and some  particular earthly figure, but this simultaneity was actual and visible only to each one  of them. The organ of such a perception is not the sensible faculties but the active  Imagination; the sensible is not thereby abolished, but transmuted into symbol; cor- relatively, the intelligible can reveal itself to the mental vision of a human soul only  through an Image-symbol, yet without this making it necessary to say that it is merely  a symbol; rather, it has all the eminent value of a symbol. (AV 269) What these faithful followers of love have witnessed is what Guido Cavalcanti  describes as “Beauty’s divinity made manifest” (11). </page> <page sequence="10"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 183 commingling souls For Duncan, however, the Beloved is male. “For,” he claims in “The Torso, Pas- sages 18,” “my Other is not a woman but a man” (BB 65). This is a claim Duncan  returns to in his later poem, “Circulations of the Song: After Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī”  in Ground Work: Before the War: But if you are the lover,  how entirely you are He. How entirely He is here;  He commands me. (GW 167) In contrast to the summer solstice of “Benefice,” “Circulations of the Song,”  with its reference to the star Fomalhaut, takes place in the darkness of winter  solstice that also expresses the poem’s speaker’s own sense of mortality (168). But  from such darkness, “the Lord of Night / stirs with verges of a radiance / that  is in truth dark, / darkening glances of an obscurity / Love seeks in love” (GW  170). “He,” Eros, Duncan writes, “wingd and / dark ascendant,” is intimated in  the “mortal” love the poet expresses for his “companion of the way” (167). Thus,  unlike the intellectual love expressed by Dante or Cavalcanti, the love celebrated  in “Circulations of the Song” is a consummated one.5 The speaker addresses his  Beloved, claiming that “in you I come true” and describes “the confused joyous  rush / of coming to myself in you” (175, 168). But that notion of “coming to myself  in you” breaks down demarcations between self and other in a manner equivalent  to the “synchronism” that, in the Recital, occurs “between the soul’s awakening  to itself and its visualization of its Guide” (AV 20). This syzygy is emphasized in Duncan’s poem through subtle rhyme — “He”  and “me,” for example, and “my” and “eyes” — as well as in the dizzying oscillations  the poem makes between subject and object:    His are the eyes of my seeing you, yours was the mouth of the wish the tongue of my speech sought that may never actually have been  yours (GW 169) The blurring of Lover and Beloved recalls the “commingling” of souls that occurs  in Duncan’s earlier poem “The Torso” and the paradisal path of the Beloved’s  body:     his soul commingling I thought a Being more than vast, His body leading   into Paradise,  his eyes     quickening a fire in me,a trembling    hieroglyph (BB 63) This, the Beloved’s “body leading / into Paradise,” echoes Corbin’s description of  ta’wīl in “Cyclical Time in Mazdaism and Ismailism” (1957): Thus coming into this world has meaning only with a view to leading that which is  metaphoric back to true being, and the external (exoteric, zahir) back to the internal  </page> <page sequence="11"> 184 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 (esoteric, batin), by means, of an exegesis (ta’wīl) which is also an exodus from exis- tence. Here, then, we have a mode of understanding (modus intelligendi) in which a  mode of being (modus essendi) is expressed. Even while one is materially present in  this world, there is a mode of being in Paradise but it goes without saying that this  mode of being, Paradise, can be realized, can exist “in the true sense,” only in a person  who precisely is this Paradise — that is to say, who always personifies this mode of  being. (Cyclical 51–52) Duncan would have been familiar with this, Corbin’s discussion of the thir- teenth-century Persian philosopher Nasir Tusi, in the context of Olson’s poem  “Maximus at the Harbor,” which weaves into its text an angelology derived from  Corbin: “Paradise is a person. Come into the world. / The soul is a magnificent  Angel” (Maximus 240). This informs the poem’s theme of “apophainesthai” — a  Greek term, reminiscent of the Orphic “phanes,” meaning, “that which shows  forth” — and the enrapturing that occurs in the sexually aggressive context of  rape (Butterick 354). In the poem’s feminized landscape, Okeanos mercilessly  “tears” in order “to get love loose” and commits “rape until love sifts” and is shown  forth in Dogtown’s topography (Maximus 240). Thus, Corbin’s truncated phrase,  “Come into the world,” suggests, simultaneously, a past action, an invitation, and  sexual climax. However, in “The Torso” and “Circulations of the Song,” angelology occurs  through sympathy and sexual “commingling” — which, phonetically, suggests  “coming” — rather than violation. The lover finds himself, physically and ontologi- cally, in the Beloved. Thus, Greg Hewett writes, the “trembling hieroglyph” in  “The Torso” suggests “not only an ancient, hermetic connection between the sym- bolic process and the physical, but one that is charged and indefinite — so indefi- nite that it is unclear which of the two bodies or both together are represented by  the hieroglyph” (Hewett 540). In “Circulations of the Song,” however, a third party, Love Himself, is  announced. Recalling his claim in The H.D. Book that “We are drawn to Him,  but we must also gather Him to be,” Duncan writes (82): He too seeks you out.  He too   dreams of coming to this fugitive morning, of finding His “Self ” in a Time so personal   it is lost in our coming into it. (171) In the commingling of Lover/Beloved, a theophany occurs. Love manifests  tangentially, as the repetition of “coming” suggests, in the throes of a “personal”  love. In the “fugitive morning” Duncan presents an equivalent of the Recital’s  narrator who witnesses a “figure [that] represents the heavenly counterpart of the  soul,” manifesting “itself to the soul only at the dawn, the ‘sunrise,’ of the soul’s  perfect individuation, its integration, because only then is its relation to the divine  individualized” (AV 21). Recalling this kind of encountered/encountering gnosis,  Norman Finkelstein suggests that what is witnessed in “Circulations of the Song”  </page> <page sequence="12"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 185 “is both a subjective force of ecstatic inspiration and an objective vehicle for that  inspiration” (Utopian 78). What “begins as a personal revelation is made into a  concrete universal, not to be asserted in abstraction, but to be re-enacted in lived  experience, including the encounter with linguistic form” (79). “poem Beginning wiTh a line By pindar” What Finkelstein identifies in “Circulations of the Song” as “a concrete univer- sal” encountered in “linguistic form” is also expressed in Duncan’s earlier “Poem  Beginning with a Line by Pindar” (c. 1958). According to Davidson, it is “the  central poem for Duncan’s poetics and cosmology” (“Book” 83). Informing this  poetics and cosmology is the legend of Cupid and Psyche which represents a  mythopoeic archetype of the kind of personal encounters — between Lover and  Beloved — that Duncan addresses in “Circulations of the Song” and “The Torso.” “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar,” Davidson suggests, is a “multi- leveled reading of a primary text through its appearance in various other versions”  (San Francisco 142). Duncan derives his primary story from Apuleius’ version  in The Golden Ass, substituting Eros for his Roman equivalent, Cupid (FC 17).  Duncan charts the “fate” and “passion” of the archetypal couple in a transhistori- cal milieu, finding intimations, clues, and rimes of the couple’s passion in the  poetry of Whitman, Williams, and Pound; Goya’s painting Cupid and Psyche;  contemporary American politics; the legends of the American West; Duncan’s  family history; and the omens of his Atlantean dream (OF 66). Very much like  the Pindar ode which instantiates it, “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar”  is itself “an accumulation of metaphor” that finds in “old voices” survivals of an  ancient story, and gnosis, that still directs the heart (OF 69). Indeed, via its accumulation of salient “tropes” and “hues,” “Poem Beginning  with a Line by Pindar” rehearses the decline of “passionate love” that De Rouge- ment charts in Love in the Western World (170). According to Davidson, the poem  presents a meditation on “the origins of love and on the historical forces that  diminish its power,” as well as a dramatization of “the transformation of spirit into  history or the reification of time into causality” (San Francisco 142). But Duncan’s  poem also conveys optimism for the renewal of Love’s diminished powers in the  figure of the children “clockwise and counter-clockwise turning” in a dance of  cosmic renewal (OF 69). Related to this promise of renewal in Duncan’s poem is a familiar trope in  Gnostic, Neoplatonic, and Avicennan cosmologies concerning the soul’s (the  psyche’s) lapse into history. Indeed, Psyche’s plight in “Poem Beginning with a  Line by Pindar” is one that is mirrored in the Avicennan Recital and its “motif  of Return”: This motif of Return presents two implications: in the first place, the feeling of a  kinship with the divinity, with celestial beings, forms of light and beauty, which for  the gnostic are his true family; in the second place, and in consequence, the soul,  </page> <page sequence="13"> 186 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 which thus at last finds itself, experiences itself as exiled, terrified and disoriented by  and among the common norms, which assign to human beings reasons for existence  and goals that are completely strange to its true condition of Stranger. (AV 19) Suffering her own exile in the “Pindar” poem, Psyche’s situation is like the  gnostic’s of the Recital. In both instances, the soul goes from ignorance and for- getfulness to an estranging but motivating consciousness of loss and then desire.  Psyche’s awakening occurs in the “carnal fate that sends the soul wailing / up  from blind innocence, ensnared / by dimness / into the deprivations of desiring  sight” (OF 62). Thus, Psyche’s “exile from Eros,” her “exile from delight,” is also a  Fall from blissful unawareness (being, happily, in the dark) into the painful light  of love: “The great dark reality in which body, soul, and spirit had been one in  unknowing was reft” (HD 86). Like the Sophia (Wisdom) of Christian Gnosti- cism who falls from her heavenly origins into the material world of the demiurge,  exiled there until Christ redeems her, Psyche strives to be reunited with Love.  Indeed, for the Platonist Thomas Taylor, in Apuleius “the very ancient dogma of  the pre-existence of the human soul, its lapse from the intelligible world to the  earth, and its return from thence to its pristine state of felicity, are most accurately  and beautifully adumbrated” (xi). But “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar” is not simply about Psyche’s  “passion, dismay, longing, search,” but is a text that repeats that passion in the  very processes of the poem itself (OF 67). For, the poem is “not only a story that  expresses the soul but a story that awakens the soul to the real persons of its  romance, in which the actual and the spiritual are revealed, one in the other” (FC  31). Reading “Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar” in light of Corbin’s notion  of ta’wīl effectively highlights the way in which the poem’s primary text makes  this revelation apparent. Indeed, Robert Kelly claims that “Poem Beginning with  a Line by Pindar” performs a “ta’wīl of its own first line” (“Ta’wīl” 115). However,  Duncan’s poem predates the English translation of Avicenna and the Visionary  Recital by two years. Nevertheless, to adopt Corbin’s approach to the Fedeli  d’amore, one can identify “typological affinities” between Corbin’s understand- ing of ta’wīl and Duncan’s retrospective reading of his poem. As I discuss below,  Duncan’s most insightful reflections about the conception of his poem occur in  two essays written after The Opening of the Field: “Towards an Open Universe”  (1964) and “The Truth and Life of Myth” (1968). Guy Davenport inadvertently  suggests how Corbin might figure in Duncan’s retrospective accounts of his poem:  “Instigations are deceptive guides into imaginative structures, and the maker of  the structure may be a deceptive guide. The imagination sees with the eyes of the  spirit; the maker, finished his making, must then see what he has done, like the  reader with corporeal eyes” (236). It is possible that Corbin’s model of ta’wīl may  have given Duncan a way to valorize some of that “spirit” as he reflects on his  poem. But, whatever the case, ta’wīl is a rich corollary to this defining poem of  Duncan’s erotic poetics. </page> <page sequence="14"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 187 searching psyche To recall, a key condition in the fin amor of the troubadours and the Fedeli d’amore  is desire. Duncan evokes a similar sentiment when he claims: “the information  flows / that is yearning” (OF 69). This suggests that information is yearned for and  that yearning itself yields information. Duncan reiterates this in a section of his  poem “The Propositions” entitled “The Keeping” in The Opening of the Field: “It is  from longing my making proceeds” (OF 36). This longing that Duncan proposes  is a “magic [that] proceeds from the heart” and a “thirst that defines Beauty,”  suggesting the kind of erotic desire motivating “The Torso” and “Circulations of  the Song” (OF 37):    Finders Keepers we sang   when we were children  or were taught to sing before our histories began and we began    who were beloved  our animal life toward the Beloved, sworn to be Keepers. (OF 68) As the refrain of the children’s rhyme “Finders keepers, losers weepers” suggests,  loss is a prerequisite for loving. We only truly value something when its loss is  tangible. As a “drama of loss and search,” the story of Eros and Psyche emphasizes this  lesson, which Psyche has to learn the hard way (HD 80): Psyche before her sin is a dilettante. To read, to listen, to study, to gaze was all part  of being loved without loving, a pleasure previous to any trial or pain of seeking the  beloved. The light must be tried; Psyche must doubt and seek to know; reading must  become life and writing; and all go wrong. (HD 81) Eros is also implicated in this reading because “the meaning of things seems to  change when we fall in love, as if life were a language we had begun to under- stand” (HD 83). According to Duncan: “In the virtue of words that what were  forces become meanings and seek form. Cosmic powers become presences and  even persons, having body to the imagination. We fall in love with Love” (HD  83). As a cosmic power, Eros is a libidinal force in Duncan’s poetics, underscoring  his conviction that “Writing is first a search in obedience” (OF 12): The poet is not master of reality but its lover; and falling in love, charmed by reality,  returns in the midst of that claim to fulfil [sic] the law of the poem itself. Only in the  poem as he actually makes it will the Poetry that moves him come into existence.  (FC 54) Such a manifestation happens in Duncan’s account of “Poem Beginning with  a Line by Pindar,” which as well as telling the story of Psyche’s love also becomes  the occasion of that story, via a misreading of Pindar’s first Pythian Ode: </page> <page sequence="15"> 188 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 The light foot hears you and the brightness begins god-step at the margins of thought,   quick adulterous tread at the heart. Who is it that goes there?   Where I see your quick face notes of an old music pace the air, torso-reverberation of a Grecian lyre. (OF 62) In these opening lines, as Duncan explains in “The Truth and Life of Myth,”  “cosmic powers” manifest as presences. When, in the inception of “A Poem Beginning with a Line by Pindar,” reading late  at night the third line of the first Pythian Ode in the translation of by Wade-Grey  and Bowra, my mind lost the hold of Pindar’s sense and was faced with certain puns,  so that the words light, foot, hears, you, brightness, begins moved in a world beyond  my reading, these were no longer words alone but also powers in a theogony, having  resonances in Hesiodic and Orphic cosmogonies where the foot that moves in the  dance of the poem appears as the pulse of measures in first things. (FC 17) Duncan’s retrospective account of the poem’s inception indicates how re- reading can “arouse in a contemporary consciousness reverberations of old myth”  pertinent to the story of Eros and Psyche (HD 79): Immediately, sight of Goya’s great canvas, once seen in the Marquis de Cambo’s col- lection in Barcelona, came to me, like a wave, carrying the vision — out of evocation  to add their masterly powers to my own — the living vision, Cupid and Psyche were  there; then, the power of a third master, not a master of poetry or of picture but of  story-telling, the power of Lucius Apuleius was there too. In the grand theurgy of  picture and story, the living genius of these three stood as my masters, and I stood in  the very presence of the story of Cupid and Psyche — but in the power of those first  Words — Light, Foot, Hears, You, Brightness, Begins — He was the primal Eros,  and she, the First Soul. (FC 17) In tracing these powers back to the primary story of the primal Eros and the  first Soul, Duncan performs a kind of ta’wīl. And, like ta’wīl, his reading is also  interceded by an angelic figure and “the intuition of an essence or person in an  Image which partakes neither of universal logic nor of sense perception, and which  is the only means of signifying what is to be signified” (Alone 13). inTerpreTing angels In “Towards an Open Universe,” Duncan explains how “the germ of the poem  quickened” by misreading Pindar: “[I]t was my inability to understand that began  the work or it was the work beginning that proceeded the words I was reading in  such a way that they no longer belonged to Pindar’s Pythian I” (FC 86). Duncan  echoes Harold Bloom’s ideas about the creative contingencies of reading that, he  </page> <page sequence="16"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 189 reasons, is “a belated and all-but-impossible act, and if strong, is always a mis- reading” (3). Duncan frequently compares his own reading to Jacob wrestling the  Angel in the Book of Hosea (12:4). In “The Law I Love is Major Mover” Duncan  evokes Jacob’s wrestling in the context of an “angelic Syntax,” which he develops  further in “The Structure of Rime 1,” proposing that Jacob “wrestled with Sleep like  a man reading a strong sentence” (OF 12). And, in “The Truth and Life of Myth,”  Duncan claims that, “I have come to think of Poetry more and more as a wrestling  with Form to liberate Form” (FC 8). Not only is Duncan’s “Pindar” poem an instance of the poet wrestling with  Pindar’s “strong” sentence, it is also an angelic encounter. In misreading Pindar,  Duncan claims that “a higher reality” intruded: “I had mistaken the light foot  for Hermes the Thief, who might be called The Light Foot, light-fingered, light- tongued” (OF 86). As messenger of gods Hermes assumes an angelic function  which, Karl Kerényi suggests, is reflected in the word “hermeneutics”: Hermes is hermeneus (“interpreter”), a linguistic mediator, and this not merely on  verbal grounds. By nature he is the begetter and bringer of something light-like, a  clarifier, God of exposition and interpretation (of the kind that we are engaged in)  which seeks and in his spirit [. . .] is led forward to the deepest mystery. (145–146) Kerényi recalls “the interpreting angel” of the Recital who manifests in the  “familiar Gnostic figure of the angelic Helper and Guide” (AV 23). Like Hermes,  this “interpreting angel” is the linguistic mediator of a text’s “esoteric” mysteries.  Without this Guide, “the soul cannot restore, return the text to its truth, unless  it too returns to its truth (Haqiqat), which implies for it passing beyond imposed  patencies, emerging from the world of appearances and metaphors, from exile  and the ‘Occident’ ” (AV 31). Like Socrates’ daemon, Hermes intercedes as the  intermediary of a divine, Erotic power. But in leading the poet back to “the tran- scendent reality of Eros and Psyche” (FC 17), this god also reflexively guides the  poet through the poem’s genesis, making Duncan’s poem both the subject and  object of its own recital by dramatizing its compositional processes. Obeying Hermes’s intercession, Duncan becomes master and servant of his  poem, following Hermes’s lead. This recalls how Orphèe in Jean Cocteau’s film,  Orphèe (1950), blindly follows Heurtebise through the Underworld: In Cocteau’s film Orpheus the guardian angel Heurtebise tells Orpheus not to try to  understand but to follow. It is a law in the reading of poetry that is a law too in the  writing. Unless we follow, unless we follow thru the work to be done, there is no  other way of understanding. Participation is all (HD 272). Adumbrating the “gnostic revelations” of “Circulations of the Song,” which  are also mediated by a daemonic Hermes, the poet is led to participate in the  primary ground of Eros (GW 174): We are drawn to Him, but we must also gather Him to be. We cannot, in the early  stages, locate Him; but He finds us out. Seized by His orders, we “fall in love”, in  </page> <page sequence="17"> 190 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 order that He be; and in His duration the powers of Eros are boundless. We are  struck by His presence, and in becoming lovers we become something other than  ourselves, subjects of a daemonic force previous to our humanity [.] (HD 82) Duncan not only reiterates Psyche’s passion but also the condition of every  individual who “falls” in love. A similar fall, for example, occurs in “The Torso”:      I have fallen in love. He    has brought me into heights and depths my heart      would fear without him. (BB 64) Recalling the mediatrix of the Fedeli d’amore, the Beloved in Duncan’s poem  announces that, “you do not yet know but through me” (BB 64). What may seem  like narcissism leads to a more inclusive and encompassing gnosis, as Duncan  indicates in “Circulations of the Song”: “I am falling out into that Nature of Me  / that includes the Cosmos it believes in” (170). Consequently, in the palpable  figure of the Beloved, there is affirmation of Duncan’s belief that, “We ourselves  in our actuality, as the poem in its actuality, its thingness, are facts, factors, in  which It makes Itself real” (BB vii). Falling in love enacts a cosmological event of  “fallen love” — epitomized in the passion of Psyche and Eros — that through the  medium of a Beloved reunites the lover with Love, although that mediator may  not necessarily be a person. For, as Corbin proposes in Spiritual Body and Celestial  Earth, “The earth is [also] an Angel” (3). But whatever form it takes, that Beloved,  as Duncan tells Ekbert Faas, is only recognized by “a searching Psyche” (81): As long as a person is in love with and curious about and searching for the universe,  he is engaged in language. And language has to increase for him to get anywhere in  the universe. The symptom of ceasing to be in language, of ceasing to wander and  talk is a de-reification of the universe and a letting go of everything around you. (83) As Duncan’s poetry repeatedly affirms, it is by being in love that makes  “things about us reveal depths and heights of meaning” and makes us “involved  in the sense of Creation ourselves” (FC 145). For this reason, Duncan considers  Psyche and Eros the “personae of a drama or dream that determines, beyond  individual consciousness, the configurative image of a species” that dramatize  “the inner works of the poetic opus” and “the great myth or work,” that is, “the  fiction of what Man is” (HD 80, 79). As Duncan’s poetry attests, falling in love by  its very nature is itself a Recital of this poetic opus of fallen love that precipitates  a redemptive corollary gnosis. Notes 1. Duncan’s poem “WHOSE [Passages]” in Ground Work II: In the Dark (1987) is dedicated to  Hillman, whose work in depth psychology also owes a considerable debt to Corbin. “I have a passage  in ‘Passages,’ ” Duncan claims in “Opening the Dreamway,” “and that is the place where I thought  I saw the soul” (24). </page> <page sequence="18"> Eros and Ta’wīl in Duncan’s Poetry 191 2. Avicenna and the Visionary Recital is Willard R. Trask’s English translation of the second edition  of Corbin’s book Avicenne et le récit visionnaire that was first published in 1954. 3. This occurs in the ninth chapter of “Nights and Days,” the second book of The H.D. Book, which  Duncan wrote in March 1961. Chicago Review eventually published the chapter in 1979 without  subsequent revisions (HD 648). 4. Using Dante Gabriel Rossetti’s translations of the early Italian poets in his chapter “Lingua Tos- cana,” Swinburne’s translation of Villon in “Moncorbier, alias Villon” and Pater’s translation of “The  Marriage of Cupid and Psyche” from Apuleius’ the Golden Ass, in “The Phantom Dawn,” Pound, in  The Spirit of Romance, also bridges Victorian romanticism and early twentieth-century modernism. 5. As well as Rumi, “Circulations of the Song” also more covertly recalls Cavalcanti’s erotic imag- ery. For example, Duncan’s “An arrow from the shining covert of your gaze / pierced me” (GW 173)  adumbrates Cavalcanti’s, “You pierced my heart by passing through the eyes / And woke the mind  that slumbered unaware” (31).
