<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS JASPER GRIFFIN. Homer on Life and Death. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1980. xvi + 218. $37.50. This is a good book, good because it is humane and restores to Homer the humanity he had steadily lost in recent years to the computer and the microphilologists of formulaic analysis. The call for an "oral poetics" in the wake of the work of Milman Parry and his followers has not only remained unanswered, but has produced an uneasy silence. Understandably so, since no one seems to know exactly what an oral poetics looks and feels like, what rules govern it, or how it differs from ordinary poetics. Moreover, some recent studies have led to a fundamental questioning of the orthodox oral hypothesis-and not merely a nibbling away at its edges. It is not yet clear where these develop- ments will lead, but there now appears to be a thaw, a new openness in Homeric studies. Many scholars now feel freer to discuss the poetry of Homer and to attempt to interpret it, rather than to concentrate their energies on problems of composition and origins. Griffin's thoughtful book may be a sign of this change. He proposes no new methodology or dogmatism and rarely polemicizes; he admits to using "aesthetic methods not essentially or radically new" (xiv). One may object to the term "aesthetic," since it leaves Griffin open to the charge of "mere aesthet- icism," but Griffin has faith in the validity of instinctive responses to the poetry of Homer and demonstrates that an intelligent and sensitive apprecia- tion not only remains possible, but now has become more necessary than ever. In short, then, we have here a refreshingly old-fashioned approach, without gimmicks, which aims to understand Homer the way the Greeks understood him. To this end, Griffin makes frequent use of the Scholia, and it is indeed heartening to note a revival of interest in this rich tradition of Homeric exegesis. Griffin also finds himself in sympathy with the humanistic unitarianism found in some German scholarship, whose prime exemplar would be the admirable Karl Reinhardt. It is altogether appropriate and a term of praise to set Griffin's book in the context of that tradition. Throughout, Griffin keeps his attention firmly focused on the Iliad, which he regards as "the vision . . . essentially, of one man" (xvi). The Odyssey and, to a lesser extent, Near Eastern, Germanic, and Celtic parallels are adduced for the pur- pose of delineating, by contrast and comparison, the contours of that vision. The first two chapters, as well as the fourth, deal with Homer's style, not in the narrow sense of diction, but within a larger perspective, that is, the means by which the poet conveys his conception of the heroic life and death. The primary characteristic of that style is its objectivity. With the reticence praised by Aristotle (Poetics 1460 a 5-7), Homer rarely comments or explains, nor does he explicitly pass judgment on the events of his narrative. Some critics have concluded that such explication and judgment are therefore American Journal of Philology Vol. 103 Pp. 102-114 0002-9475/82/1031-0102 $01.00 ? 1982 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS neither called for nor intended. But this conclusion misapprehends the char- acter of the objective style. The poets allow things to speak for themselves; and they will speak eloquently, if we will but listen. Griffin first examines certain objects and scenes which characterize their owners or participants far more vividly and subtly than any discursive descrip- tion. For example, the frivolity of Paris becomes apparent in his choice of clothing. So too, the scepter of Agamemnon exemplifies the king's predica- ment. The description of its august lineage in Book 2 is followed by the flight of the army produced by Agamemnon's poor judgment. Odysseus finally res- tores order by seizing the ancestral scepter and encouraging the best men with speech, while thrashing the insolent Thersites with the same emblem of royal authority. "This," concludes Griffin, "is how to be a king" (18), and we ourselves can judge Agememnon's failure to live up to the regal scepter he has inherited. Similarly, certain representative scenes or a series of contrasting episodes offer graphic descriptions of the characters in action, catching and crystallizing their essences in dramatic vignettes. The scenes with their respec- tive wives perfectly convey the differences between Hector and Paris. Similarly, the recurring episodes involving rejected pleas for mercy on the battlefield bring out the characters of the gentle Menelaus, the ferocious Agamemnon, and the tragic Achilles. Many of Griffin's examples are, as he admits, not new (compare Lessing's Laocoon), but he has a sensitive eye for the telling or pathetic detail which speaks volumes in a line or a word. Since, moreover, Homer's is a "world of stylized and universally intelligible gestures" (27), eating, lamentation, the taking of oaths, and the rituals of hospitality have a symbolic significance readily accessible to Homer's audience. The Iliad exploits these symbols in a manner different from the Odyssey. For example, in comparing the scenes of shared lamentation, Griffin contrasts the charm of the Odyssey with the tragic depth and pathos of the Iliad. Characterization, discussed in Chapter 2, is similarly suited to the central themes and world view of the respective poems. Griffin takes note of the relative opaqueness and enigmatic quality of the characters in the Odyssey as compared to the Iliad. He connects this indirection to the importance of decep- tion as a dominant theme in the Odyssey, whereas the presumed contradictions in the characters of the Iliad arise from the complexity of its central preoccupa- tion: the nature of the Homeric hero and the "meaning and significance of the heroic life and death." Rejecting the views of those who deny Homer's heroes any consistent and individualized characterization or psychological depth, Griffin argues that the characters are indeed differentiated from one another and that they "can be seen to intend things which they do not explicitly reveal as their intention" (52). The second proposition may provoke controversy in that it suggests that one can, indeed, must, go beyond the simple surface of the text. In fact, any interpretation of the Homeric poems which categorically refuses to do so must remain flat and impoverished. In his fourth chapter, Griffin demonstrates how the objective style man- ages to produce pathos even in depicting the deaths of very minor characters. The short "obituary notices" which accompany those deaths are not to be understood as merely ornamental or as intended to provide a bit of human interest or to relieve the monotony of the battle scenes. Rather, they touch on 103</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY the central nerve of the Iliad with its tragic perception of human life. The motifs employed to evoke pathos in these minor deaths are the same as those used in the deaths of the major figures. Griffin reminds us that the Iliad is a poem about death, or, more precisely, about living and dying. The Homeric vision inevitably focuses on the pivotal moment of the heroic existence: "the change from the brightness of life to a dark and meaningless existence" (143) with the death of the hero. The noble restraint of the Homeric style with its understated, dispassionate objectivity presents without sentimentality, on the one hand, or brutality, on the other, the tragic pathos of that moment. Griffin's third chapter on "Death and the God-Like Hero" and his two final essays on the gods in the Iliad form the best introduction to the subject I know, and a bare summary cannot do it justice. Griffin has grasped a fact of paramount importance: neither the gods nor the heroes can be understood in isolation from one another; they each receive their definition through the other. Both gods and heroes are acutely aware of the differences separating them, and both understand themselves by contemplating the other. Griffin correctly underlines the doubleness which characterizes the hero, who is both god-like and doomed to mortality. The heroes are like the gods not only in their strength and beauty and their concern for honor, but also in the pas- sionate and sometimes arbitrary indulgence of their will. In other words, they resemble the gods in all their ambiguity. The heroes are marked out by the love of the gods, yet given the arbitrariness of the gods, even such divine concern cannot escape ambiguity. Moreover, as Griffin notes, such love does not ensure success; it is often lavished on doomed heroes-but, then, all heroes are ulti- mately doomed. It is mortality which finally and radically separates the heroes from the gods. The hero must constantly and consciously face death and, like the tragic Achilles, finally accept his mortality without flinching. Paradoxi- cally, it is precisely "the pressure of mortality which imposes on men the compulsion to have virtues; the gods, exempt from that pressure, are . . . less 'virtuous' than men" (93). "The hero dies . . . for the glory of song" (102). But here, Griffin emphasizes, the Iliad moves far beyond an unreflective heroism where that reward is left unquestioned. The heroes-above all Achilles of the twin fates-brood over the value and meaning of that glory. Griffin's analysis is indeed impressive, yet two areas demand further exploration. Griffin's discussion omits "men such as are now," we, the poet's audience, whose relations with the gods are neither so intimate nor as terri- fying, and whose admiration for the heroes is mixed with horror and pity. It is only by recognizing the third member of the equation that the place of the hero as a tertium quid, a strange and wonderful Mischwesen between the gods and "mere mortals," becomes patent and the complexity of his nature is revealed. Secondly, while acknowledging that the death the hero must confront is "unsoftened by any posthumous consolation or reward" (94), Griffin, despite his title, does not fully explore the consequences of the Homeric view of death or the problems it raises. To be sure, it clears the world of troublesome ghosts. Yet in dispensing with any substantial afterlife, Homer gives up the possibility of reward or punishment in the hereafter. Because of Homer's authority, his austere conception of the afterlife had enormous implications for Greek ethical thought which never ceased to grapple with them. It is already problematic in the Odyssey, but is perfectly suited to the tragic vision of the Iliad. Within the 104</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS confines of the epic, this uncompromising conception of death serves to exalt the epic itself,which alone has the power to confer immortality, kleos aphthiton. Turning to the gods, Griffin attacks those who refuse to take the Homeric gods seriously or who "minimize the divine" in Homer by consid- ering it to be merely conventional or "literary" or a means of comic relief, or who reduce the gods to expressions of social and psychological forces or pres- sures. His defense avoids the Dionysiac rhetoric of Walter Otto but, while well taken, does not quite get to the bottom of things. To the charge that the Homeric gods lack numen, Griffin responds that the heroes themselves are pious; they pray and sacrifice to the gods. (It would be interesting to ascertain whether some heroes are more pious than others.) "Mystery, power, and effort- lessness" (153) are the marks of divine intervention, and the gods are "by no means always lackihg in dignity and stature" (150), but behave in impressive ways "like a real god" (152), while the characters respond "in what can only be called a religious way" (152). But Griffin's examples of the "shattering effect" of divine intervention occur mainly when the heroes come up against hostile divinities. The more typical reaction to manifestations of the divine in Homer is wonder (thauma, thambos), usually unaccompanied by either fear or ecstasy. To be sure, certain images of the divine in Homer can, in fact, be paralleled by the Biblical God of Abraham, but such superficial similarities mask over- whelming differences. Griffin is absolutely right about the pervasive impor- tance and seriousness of the Homeric gods, but a comprehensive examination must, I believe, begin from more fundamental principles. Griffin draws attention to the fact that the miraculous, monstrous, and uncanny have, for the most part, been excluded from the divine in Homer. So too, the heroes are no longer invulnerable, nor do they have magic powers. "The austere teaching of the Iliad" (166) also rejects apotheosis, even though examples from the past are mentioned. The removal of this possibility within the epic lends a special pathos to the destiny of the heroes. The luminous anthropomorphism, once so admired in Greek myth, has fallen into disrepute and is now often considered shallow and unimaginative. Griffin identifies Kirk's assessment of Greek mythology as part of the "revolt from classicism" (173), which discovers greater depth in "monstrous images." While correct in criticizing Kirk's lack of sympathy toward Greek material, Griffin is somewhat unfair in equating that stance with the structuralist approach. To be sure, the structuralists may be drawn to myths whose surface meaning is obscure, bizarre, and irrational, precisely because their analysis produces more spectac- ular results in demonstrating a deeper logic and coherence. According to Griffin, the focus of Greek mythological thought is the heroes rather than monsters, and this leads to a preoccupation with the question of man's posi- tion in the world rather than the Levi-Straussian antinomy of nature and culture. But here Griffin confuses the manner and the matter of myth, for the question of man's relation to the world inevitably overlaps with the problem of nature and culture. Characteristically, it is not so much the Iliad but rather the Odyssey with its interest in human institutions and civilizations and their contraries which deals with this problem. The action of the Iliad is not, in fact, dominated by the axis of nature and culture. But Griffin might find himself more receptive to those who discuss the poem in terms of a vertical axis of 105</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY gods, men, and beasts, with the heroes occupying a precarious middle ground between the gods and men "such as we are now." Griffin's study saves the best till last. His final chapter attempts to define the attitude of the gods toward men in all its complexity and ambiguity, and to discuss the way that attitude informs the grandly tragic vision of the Iliad. Griffin begins from the observation that the Olympians not only oversee the actions of men for punitive and moral purposes, as do celestial divinities among many peoples, but the Homeric gods often merely observe the doings of mortals "like spectators of a drama or a sporting competition" (182). This distinction between gods who "look after" men and those who simply "look on" is crucial to an understanding of Homeric divinity. The gods sometimes laugh at men and sometimes pity them; their observation of mortals reinforces their sense of their own superiority. "To complete their bliss they need . . . mortal men and their sufferings" (189). Both the love and enmity of the gods for the heroes are the consequences of their close familial ties, but the gods can pity and mourn even their favorites only briefly. Moreover, the gods have the power to impose sufferings capriciously; and, finally, they can turn away from watching men as easily as they pay attention to them. Their not watching, as Griffin notes, "defines the position of mortals still more crush- ingly" (198), but he does not elaborate. It would be interesting to gauge the difference between those episodes in which the pantheon intervenes freely, those in which Zeus alone assumes charge, and those in which even Zeus withdraws his gaze from Troy. The frivolity of Homer's gods, which is so jarring to modern sensibilities and already disturbed the ancients, coexists with their sublimity. The gods cannot possess the heroic ennobling and tragic qualities which men learn from accepting their mortality. The presence of the divine audience thus "both exalts and humbles human action" (201), revealing both its insignificance and its grandeur. Griffin is well aware of the problematic nature of Homer's conception of the gods as dispassionate spectators, a view which, on several occasions, is "on the point of becoming a reproach" (202). Griffin dwells rather on the effects this view makes possible. But if the gods are, as Jaeger claimed "an aristo- cractic society which is immortal" (193), the question must finally be posed as to whether that aristocracy is based on arete. If not, it must ultimately be recognized as a tyranny. There is another question that Griffin does not answer or really ask. If "we are able to share their [the gods'] viewpoint and see human life as they see it" (203), is there any distinction between the perspective of the divine audience and that of the poet? The strength of Griffin's admirable exposition lies in his insistence on Homer's overall vision of the pathos and greatness of the heroic existence combined with a close adherence to the particulars of the Homeric text. On occasion, Griffin appears to stop short of speculating about the consequences of certain aspects of the Homeric world view or to hesitate to probe into its foundations. Nevertheless, this study reminds us why we read Homer and of our own humanity. J. STRAUSS CLAY UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA 106</page></plain_text>
