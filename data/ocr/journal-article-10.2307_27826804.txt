<plain_text><page sequence="1">METAPHORICAL APPEALS IN BIOLOGICAL THOUGHT By LEO KARTMAN San Francisco Field Station,1 San Francisco 18, California IS perhaps a significant phenomenon that literate essays by bi ologists now and then contain metaphorical appeals in which the societal realm of man is equated with the biological world of animals. If Gerard m could say several years ago that "The world is beginning to look askance at Science," it appears just as true to assert that science has for some time looked at the world with a jaundiced eye. Contem porary philosophers suggest that a wave of anti-intellectualism seems to have arisen in recent years and that democratic man worships the tele vision receiver while deprecating the genius which made it possible. On the other hand, there are compelling reasons to believe that biologists and other scientists occasionally worship the intellectual attainments of a Darwin, a Muller, a Pauling, or an Einstein while simultaneously assigning the society of man to those forces which rise and fall eternally in the state of nature. Although there appears to be no general resurgence of the obscurantist ideas represented by what has come to be called "social Darwinism", tendencies in this direction arise now and then. A recent example of these "props of a priori belief" [i] may be found in the very interesting paper by the distinguished zoologist Stunkard [2] who prefaces his re marks with the assertion that information obtained from the study of other animals is applicable to the human species. After quoting Wol cott's [3] statement that "Man, as the highest of animals, can learn by the study of animal life the principles of the most effective living . . .," Stunkard [2] states; "Although the interrelations of human society are more complex than those of lower, or at least simpler, creatures, the fundamental and basic tenets of animal associations, those that are consistently manifest in all groups of animals, may prop erly be considered in respect to the species, Homo sapiens." The equating of societal with natural laws presents nothing new in the field of philosophical analogy, nor can the criticism of it claim originality. These issues have been the subject of numerous papers and of many special studies. In spite of a wealth of factual and objective critique, it is of interest to note that some biologists have yet to incorporate within their purview the cognition that "Man, his works, his world of ideas, his environment, and his society together constitute a totality that has not been consciously comprehended as a thing-in-itself" [4]. And further, as 1 Communicable Disease Center, Public Health Service, U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Atlanta, Georgia. 296</page><page sequence="2">METAPHORICAL APPEALS IN BIOLOGICAL THOUGHT 297 Hofstadter [5] has so brilliantly concluded in his work on social Darwin ism: ". . . that the life of man in society, while it is incidentally a biological fact, has characteristics which are not reducible to biology and must be explained in the dis tinctive terms of a cultural analysis. . . ." Some years ago the writer [6] published a paper in which an attempt was made to defend the principle that "men make their own history." In reviewing the work of many well known biologists, it was discovered that "... in the realm of sociological thought these scientists somehow divest themselves of the scientific method with which they live in the laboratory and cover their eyes with the nineteenth century spectacles of Herbert Spencer." Now, if we consider the theory of evolution specifi cally, what Spencer did was to apply it wholesale to human society with the consequence that ethical valuations were derived thereby. Thus the so-called "survival of the fittest" principle in the animal world became one side of a philosophy which similarly separated men into those who were economically successful or unsuccessful, or that which is good or bad in the moral world. The consequences to social theory of this Spencerian non sequitur was a strengthening of the ideology of Darwinian individualism, the idea of unrestrained competition and the necessary relations of the rich to the poor, the fit to the unfit. Since it was con sidered a truism that the fit needed the services and labor of the unfit in order to continue upon their morally righteous course, this relationship could further be explained by analogy with the biological world where, in the words of Dunham's sarcasm, ". . . we may say that the fit need the unfit, as a parasite needs its host, in order to survive" m. Stunkard [2] has, in a similar vein, compared the parasite's biological surrender of freedom with that surrender of freedom in human history where, in the attempt to attain security, "bondage, regression, and degeneracy" have been the result. Whether or not the animal parasite represents a state of degeneracy through dependency, or dependency through degeneracy, appears to the writer as somewhat anthropomorphic in its essential formulation. A more appealing concept is one of specializa tion or modification when applied to the evolution of parasitism as a biological phenomenon. The idea of degeneracy superimposes a certain element of moral valuation upon an area which should be entirely free of human prejudice. On the other hand, if the concept of degeneracy must be used, it should be used dispassionately (i.e., scientifically). In this sense the scientists ". . .do not mean that the parasite is any worse than the free-living animal in the sight of God or in any absolute way; they have no views on such questions" [8i. All the scientist can mean is that, during the course of evolution, the parasites have become modified and specialized in certain very extreme ways when compared with other</page><page sequence="3">298 AMERICAN SCIENTIST animals. Scientists cannot, as can religionists and certain philosophers, find moral or absolute values in the natural world. The analogy of parasitism with the so-called welfare state in human society reminds one of the complaint by Martin Luther [9] that the large monopolies "oppress and ruin all the small merchants, as the pike the little fish in the water, just as though they were lords over God's crea tures and free from all the laws of faith and love." Although the pike are predators, they stand here in the same moral relationship to the little fish or to the hosts as do the parasites, those ".. . favored few, who are able to cajole or compel others to provide the welfare" [2]. It seems apparent that analogical reasoning from the animal world to that of the sociocosm uo] has failed to consider the uniqueness of human ity. Although it is difficult to agree with Gerard's m postulate of a bi ological basis for ethics, he has certainly struck at a truth when, in com paring man and other animals, he says: "One biological detail, however, the amount of cerebrum, seems to have had inordi nate consequences. A few extra ounces of nerve cells and connections in the cortex have permitted symbolism in language and number and abstract reasoning to a degree so beyond that of other animals that something almost qualitatively new has re sulted." Not only has this new qualitative level been attained, but conscious ness of its own uniqueness has resulted; man is conscious of his con sciousness. Even more than this, man is distinguished from all other living creatures by the fact that his cognition of the external world is at the same time a consciousness of the need to transform that world- We know that animals are capable of a certain amount of learning and that social organization of varying degree is found in the animal world. Yet, in spite of Maeterlink's intriguing vistas of the bee world, we find no evidence of the influence of reason in the animal world. When "Dar winian collectivism" of the nationalist or racist variety captured certain European countries in the iron grip of authoritarianism, this was not a manifestation of instinctive or genetically determined behavior and its defeat was not a product of biological forces. The story of human history has nothing in common with the history of animal life. Only men possess historical awareness, and thus they alone can produce a society which is influenced by the experience of past generations. The description of the inner meaning of human striving, of the sifting and winnowing of ideas and actions by mankind through the ages, has seldom been so deeply expressed as in the words of Whitehead uu in his Lowell Lectures. He says: "The tale is the epic of an episode in the manifestation of reason. It tells how a par ticular direction of reason emerges in a race by the long preparation of antecedent epochs, how after its birth its subject-matter gradually unfolds itself, how it attains its triumphs, how its influence moulds the very springs of action of mankind, and</page><page sequence="4">METAPHORICAL APPEALS IN BIOLOGICAL THOUGHT 299 finally how at its moment of supreme success its limitations disclose themselves and call for a renewed exercise of the creative imagination. The moral of the tale is the power of reason, its decisive influence on the life of humanity.' ' The reaction of some scientists to a philosophy of reason is at once curious and significant. In a sense the attitude is antiphilosophical in the same way that many lay persons are antiscientific. There is an ele ment of hostility in this reaction wherein the thing attacked is the thing subconsciously depended upon by the attacker who acts under the delusion that he is freeing himself of, or avoiding, "high-brow" notions. This sort of orientation is itself a philosophical pattern which enslaves the modern natural scientist through the pressures of what Boring [12] has referred to as ". . . the climate of opinion as it affects thinking," or the Zeitgeist. In some, the reluctance to arrive at a philosophical ap proach and to seek scientific validity within it, and the embarrassment in the confrontation with the necessity of philosophy, is an emotional attitude in which the scientist unwittingly attempts to escape from free dom. He escapes from the problem of making independent value judg ments and entering realms of thought which may not conform to the mores of his group. Thus he remains in bondage to the status quo. It is suggested that the uncritical identification of animal attributes with human social phenomena is a status quo precept which finds expression in statements by scientists as well as by many laymen. It is precisely in the study of the philosophy of science and in the formulation of the general laws of the scientific method that we must look for the clues to much of the a priori reasoning in current "sociological excursions of biologists." Although Lenzen [i3] shows that the "signifi cance of science resides in its value for practice and knowledge of reality," it must be pointed out that the history of biological thought has been to a certain extent the history of analogical reasoning. The identification of biological parasitism with a human social relationship can only be explained by the method of analogy which, in the Middle Ages, was the accepted and uncontested method for the interpretation of natural phenomena. In philosophy, more extreme ideas were enunciated during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the concept of the state of nature. In arguments as to man's original rights to liberty and equality, the state of man was intellectually examined as it would be if political organization or the social relations of government did not exist. Philos ophers such as Locke, Hooker, and Rousseau developed the concept as a criterion of what man in a state of nature would be, and to what extent this sylvan state had been corrupted by civilization. To the modern research worker, who recognizes inductive reasoning as the basic method of approach to scientific problems, analogical reasoning has very little to offer. Although, as Mill [ui concluded, analogy may have some value in allowing the observer a faint view of the obvious,</page><page sequence="5">300 AMERICAN SCIENTIST its validity is low. The opinions of advanced (and perhaps unorthodox) scientific thought corroborate this critique by Mill and point to the "... dangerous oversimplifications which arise from extending theory developed to explain one set of phenomena to another set of far greater complexity" tisj. Thus the character of analogies is imperfection and, as Arber mi has said, "It is, indeed, their very imperfection which sets them in the boundary region of scientific thought. . . ." It seems reasonable to assume that, in purely scientific valuations, scientists are mistaken if they attempt to include more theory than is suggested by the known facts. It is well to remember William of Occam's maxim, known as "Occam's razor," which maintains, in Lord Russell's [17] interpretation, that "if everything in some science can be interpreted without assuming this or that hypothetical entity, there is no ground for assuming it." We would do well to use this clean cutting edge as a principle in logical analysis. Thus in a discussion of the ecology of para sitism, for instance, it cannot be correct to enter into value judgments derived from political theory which is a product of the study of human social relations. Yet, at the same time, it should be clear that, although ethical problems cannot find a fruitful logic in the revelation of animal relationships, that is not to say that science has no connection with ethics. To assume this would be to assert that science deals solely with the technical sphere and is divorced from human culture in the sense of being ethically neutral. Nothing could be farther from the truth, but it cannot be overemphasized that we can only approach this problem at the societal level, or the analysis loses its validity. Not only do men's ethical ideas influence their actions, but the "scientific outlook has its own appropriate intellectual approach to the fundamental problem of deciding which, of the numerous and varied ethical beliefs man has held, is the best" m. Whether or not scientists can achieve a philosophy of human ethics which will contribute to a science of action in the socio-political sphere is completely a human problem. It can only find its facts in human rela tionships and no amount of discovery in the sphere of animal evolution or ecology will add to our workable knowledge of the social relations of man.
