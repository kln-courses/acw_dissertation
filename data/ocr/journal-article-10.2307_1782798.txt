Sketch-map and Illustrations. 3or. net. IT is not easy for one who has never been on the spot to review a book such as that which Mr. Macmillan Brown has produced. It aims at dealing more or less intensively with the problems which arise from the unique and very peculiar features exhibited by the ancient cultural remains of Easter Island, a derelict spot in a vast ocean, which has probably afforded more knotty problems wherewith to puzzle and intrigue ethnologists and archae? ologists than any other area of equally insignificant size. Easter Island, in fact, bristles with conundrums. The author of this new work has entered upon his task whole-heartedly and with much confidence ; and, apparently, wrote the book in the most suitable of inspirational environments?the island itself. The theory upon which he bases his attempted solution of the problems is attractive and plausible, inas? much as, if it could be proved, it would certainly offer a reasonable explanation of the strange phenomena which give to Easter Island its distinctive character. In the main, this theory involves the assumption that the island itself is the remnant of a once extensive archipelago which formerly encircled it and in? cluded islands of considerable size, well timbered, and capable of supporting a very extensive population, under the organization and control of powerful chiefs. Further, it is suggested that Easter Island was the great mausoleum of this highly developed community, to which tens of thousands of skilled and unskilled labourers were drafted to carry on the vast work of building the ahus, or burial platforms, out of carefully dressed stones of huge size and of extremely hard material; and also of sculpturing in situ and transporting from the crater of Rano Raraku the huge monolithic statues which served as memorial effigies. The vastness of this cyclopean work is unquestionable, and the need of a great industrial population to carry it out must be assumed ; and, since the very barren island appears never to have been capable of supporting such a population, the main food supplies must necessarily have been derived from elsewhere, together with sizeable timber and the material for making cordage, etc. These are admitted facts, and the problem of accounting for</page><page sequence="2">526 THE RIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC the evidence of a vast cemeterial industry having once flourished in what is now a completely isolated, sparsely vegetated volcanic islet, would be materially simplified and to all intents and purposes solved if it could be proved that the island was once girdled by a chain of extensive land areas. Apart from the demand for some such assumption, which arises from an attempt to account for the striking megalithic industry of the island, Mr. Mac- millan Brown relies upon the actual former existence of " Davis Land," an extensive area of high lands reported by the buccaneer Edward Davis, captain of the Batchelor's Delight, in 1687. Davis's account has been the subject of much debate, and its trustworthiness has been generally discredited. In the absence of his log (if he kept one) it is difficult to evaluate his statement. The matter was carefully and impartially considered by the late Dr. B. Glanvill Corney (Geogr. Journ., July 1917), who suggested that probably the "small flat Island " and the " range of high land " about 12 leagues further westward, reported by Davis, were Temoe Island (Crescent I.) and the Gambier Group (Manga Reva) respectively, and that the navigator was considerably out in his calculation of position. Mr. Macmillan Brown does not appear to be aware of Dr. Corney's reasoned criticism, unless, in the absence of reference, we are to conclude that it is the latter's suggested identification of Davis Land with Manga Reva which the author describes as "the midsummer mad? ness of criticism and theory " (p. 43). Why this unnecessary outburst ? Dr. Corney's diagnosis of the statement, no doubt, does not fit Mr. Brown's theory, but it does fit the facts as at present known. The author's theory of a submerged archipelago is called into being to support his diagnosis of the culture-phenomena, but it finds little support from tangible facts, and remains, in the absence of substantial data, a nebulous, if plausible, assumption. The insignificant, uninhabited islet Sala-y-Gomez, some 300 miles east of Easter Island, alone remains to suggest the former archipelago to the east; while to the westward there is practically nothing for hundreds of miles. The soundings, as at present known, do not seem to bear out the theory of a recently foundered archipelago in this part of the Pacific. If it ever existed in the position suggested, the subsidence of this extensive area of high lands must have been phenomenally rapid and complete, since it had vanished entirely (except for Sala-y-Gomez) in the space of thirty-five years, and was nowhere to be seen when Roggeveen arrived upon the scene in 1722 ; great depths, moreover, are recorded as prevailing in this region. It is to be hoped that a detailed survey of this part of the Pacific may some day be made, as comprehensive bathymetric data are badly needed and would serve as a real test of the theory of a vast and rapid subsidence in recent times. The book appears to be intended for the general reader rather than for the scientist, and references to the sources of information forming the basis of statements are very rarely given, a very serious detriment to a book of this kind. One may gather that many of the details were supplied by Juan Tepano, a native who acted as the author's guide and who had inherited traditions and folk-lore from his mother. But the memory of the bygone culture is extremely nebulous, and many of the legends are so obviously fanciful and untrustworthy, that too much reliance should not be given to this class of data. In spite of meagre material, Mr. Macmillan Brown has con? trived to build up a picture which to a great extent hangs together and is plausible, if by no means entirely convincing. It is a pity that he has so largely overlooked or ignored the views expressed by other recent writers, since this omission weakens the authoritative status of his own work.</page><page sequence="3">THE RIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC 527 In dealing with the ethnological problem of the " Long-eared " and " Short- eared" elements in the population, the author derives the former from the Marquesan Group and the latter from New Zealand. He has little to say for the Melanesian influence which has recently been strongly advocated both on physical and cultural evidence. Craniological investigations have made evident a pronounced Melanesian element in the mixed ancient population of Easter Island ; and several features in the material and aesthetic arts point strongly to a similar derivation. The elaborate cult of the Frigate-bird is more readily derivable from Melanesia, the great home of this cult, than from Polynesia, and the representations of the Frigate-bird, both in the realistic and semi-anthropomorphic renderings, find striking parallels in the Solomon Islands, and not in Polynesia. Mr. Brown's diagnosis of the figures of the Frigate-bird, emblems of the god Makemake, is hard to follow. Conventional as the figures mostly are, it seems unnecessary to assume that the forked tail must be that of a fish grafted upon the bird design, when a conspicuously forked tail is one of the prominent natural attributes of this bird. The author suggests that the tail is, more specifically, that of a shark, but there is no suggestion in the figures of the characteristically unequal lobes of a shark's tail. But zoology is not, perhaps, the author's strong suit, since he speaks (p. 211) of the "sawlike snout of the swordfish," an obvious confusion of two widely separated types. In his anxiety to prove that the Easter Island culture was almost exclusively Polynesian in origin, his argument at times becomes laboured and unconvincing. In referring to the huge cylindrical blocks of red tufa which crowned the heads of many of the statues, Mr. Brown favours the suggestion that they " had their original model in the hat of some visiting or shipwrecked sailor " ; but this view can hardly be taken seriously, since, even if a resemblance to the suggested prototype can be discerned, the red tufa crowns were already "ancient history" in the days of the early European voyagers who reached the island. There are various inconsistencies in the author's statements. For instance, on p. 24, " The biggest canoe it could produce was . . . incapable of carrying sail . . . and bailing was the never-ceasing necessity of sailing." Again, on p. 69, "it is well known that no canoe large enough to carry sail was ever made or used on the island," a statement which is followed in the next para? graph by another to the effect that it was the forests of the surrounding archipelago which " supplied Easter Island with the . . . long thick timbers needed for building oceanic canoes " ! Grammatical slips are not infrequent. "There is no other sea-bird had the combination " (p. 103), and "There is no such landless area on the face of the earth than this same south-eastern region of the Pacific Ocean" (p. 50), are jarring examples. If one is forced to adopt a critical and somewhat sceptical attitude in attempting to review this book, it is because the volume is beset with con? troversial points which challenge criticism. To the general reader the book should prove attractive. The subject is a fascinating one, the writer's enthusiasm is infectious, the volume is well printed and well illustrated. The author, moreover, makes many excellent and telling points. But it is the work of an enthusiast rather than a scientist. The bias of a particular theory dominates and pervades the whole, and seems to blind the author to discrepant factors which, however, must be taken into account before any final solution of the problem can be arrived at. Mr. Macmillan Brown has shown skill in developing his argument and in presenting a picture of the life- story of the people, and he offers some valuable suggestions which are worthy</page><page sequence="4">528 RADIOACTIVITY AND EARTH HISTORY of serious consideration. If his contribution to this difficult and fascinating topic appears to be one-sided, this in itself may prove advantageous, since it will help to keep alive the discussion of a problem which still awaits solution. The " Riddle of the Pacific " is not yet convincingly answered. Henry Balfour.</page></plain_text>
