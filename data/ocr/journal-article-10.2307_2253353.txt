<plain_text><page sequence="1">3I2 BOOK REVIEWS The God of the Philosophers. By ANTHONY KENNY. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1979. Pp. 135. ?5.50. The first question which must be asked is who 'the God of the philo- sophers' is. Dr. Kenny's reply is that this is the God of the traditional discipline of natural theology. In practice it turns out to be the God of some scholastic theologians and some rationalist philosophers, concerning whose attributes and existence there has been considerable recent dis- cussion by such writers as Geach, Plantinga, Mackie, Swinburne, Kretz- mann, Pike and, in previous publications, Kenny. The difficulty is that this does not constitute an individuating description, for there is no such God, and this illustrates one of the main issues at stake. None of these philosophers agree about what can be said about God. Of course, this is not because they disagree simply in their respective attitudes to him; nor again because they are unsure about what qualities, as a matter of fact, he has. The disagreement is rather about whether anything at all can be said about God, and the answer to that question does not precede, for it is logically dependent upon the answer to the question, 'If so, what?' And that disagreement is in the end a disagreement about whether there is such a God. Dr. Kenny seems implicitly to accept the legitimacy of this distinction in two related ways. On the one hand he defines his enquiry as 'a con- ceptual one concerning the coherence of a group of attributes'. On the other hand he concludes his analysis of the concepts of omniscience and omnipotence by asserting, 'If the argument of the previous chapters has been correct then there is no such being as the God of traditional natural theology: the concept of God propounded by scholastic theologians and rationalist philosophers is an incoherent one' (p. 121). One consequence which he draws from this is that none of the traditional arguments for the existence of such a God can work although he also insists that he is not convinced by 'the arguments of Hume and Kant to show that there cannot be a proof even of a God conceived in the manner of Mill' (p. 122). This remark, offered in passing, is significant as one symptom of a diffi- culty which I do find with the book as a whole. Hume did not in the Dialogues or elsewhere argue that there cannot be a proof of the existence of the type of limited anthropomorphic God sketched out by Mill at the end of his essay Theism. Quite to the contrary, in the Dialogues, he was quite prepared, for the sake of argument at least, to allow a certain cogency to the argument by analogy precisely because such a pattern of argument has strength only insofar as it does point to an anthropomorphic deity-a deity whom Hume regarded as innocuous because inadequate for the demands of religious belief. It may well be more than coincidence that in the midst of an almost dazzling series of references to the scholastics Kenny should slip up on this point, for he regards the question which he confronts-the coherence of the group of attributes traditionally ascribed to God-as quite detach- able from the question of the religious adequacy of the implied conception</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 3I3 of 'the God of the philosophers' so-defined. Hume did not, and my sympathies are with Hume at this point. The central arguments of the book focus upon the concepts of omni- science and omnipotence. Kenny's conclusions are, from the point of view of the tradition which he is examining, largely negative. He argues that omniscience is incompatible with immutability, and that, whether the philosophical theist is a determinist or an indeterminist, further diffi- culties over the concept of omniscience will arise. In the former case we can give an account of infallible knowledge of further human action but will find it 'impossibly difficult to show how he (the God of the philo- sophers) is not the author of sin'. In the latter case the position is reversed and human beings can be held responsible for their own sins but only at the expense of an account of 'infallible knowledge of future free actions'. (His two chapters on Foreknowledge, Determinism and Indeterminism, are arguably the best in the book.) On the concept of omnipotence things are a little less bleak in so far as Kenny allows coherence to the notion of omnipotence defined as the possession of all logically possible powers which it is logically possible for a being with the attributes of God to possess' (p. 98). In chapter VIII, basing his argument on a paper by Dummett on reverse causation he argues that that 'bringing about the past is logically possible' but if this is regarded as anything other than an exceptional event, then we run the risk of finding ourselves without clear distinction between past, present and future. On the question of whether God' s omnipotence, if it is to be reconciled with his goodness, entails that he must have created the best of all possible worlds. Kenny's view is that it depends upon what you mean by 'goodness'. This chapter was particularly suggestive of further lines of enquiry, but I think that his conclusion that 'we may leave the theological problem to wait on the progress of moral philosophy', misrepresents the nature of the issues at stake. It is not at all clear that waiting on the pro- gress of moral philosophy might not turn out to be like waiting on Godot, and that would reflect certain important elements of the nature of 'the theological problem'. The arguments used to support the central conclusions of the book are interesting contributions to an on-going series of discussions and as such they will each promote responses from those working in this field. I shall select one argument for detailed comment. In the fourth chapter on 'Omniscience, Eternity and Time', Kenny adapts an argument from Prior to criticize Swinburne's account of how an immutable being might be thought to know the time and date. Swinburne's view is that what A knows on Friday when he knows that 'Today is Friday', is the same as what B knows on Saturday when he knows that 'Yesterday was Friday'. The unchangingness of an immutable being is not compromised by the fact that he knows what A and B know, for such a being knows that 'a certain day can be picked out in many and various ways according to our location in Time', and he is quite capable of picking it out. Now I think that there are difficulties with this suggestion, but I do not think that Kenny succeeds in discrediting it. His argument is that</page><page sequence="3">314 BOOK REVIEWS ' "Today is Friday" on Friday does not express the same knowledge as "Yesterday was Friday" on Saturday'. His argument, derived from Prior, is that 'what I am glad about when I am glad that today is Friday is not at all necessarily the same thing as what I am glad about when I am glad yesterday was Friday' (p. 46). There is initially the problem that the point which Prior makes upon which Kenny bases his argument, is intended to discredit the view that a timeless being could know what A and B know, because what they know is a 'timeless relation between dates': Swinburne, on the other hand is discussing whether a temporal, but immutable being could know what A and B know. This makes the problems which Swin- burne faces rather different from those which Prior is raising. More significantly for the purposes of this review, in his argument Kenny overlooks the distinction between the object of A's pleasure, and what A knows. What makes A glad is that today is Friday: what A knows is 'Today is Friday'. That he knows 'Today is Friday' is, in the case Kenny describes, sometimes a condition of his being glad that today is Friday (e.g., because he also knows that Friday is pay day), but what he is glad about is not the same as what he knows. That this is so is clear from the fact that we may well know 'Today is Friday' without being glad about it and thus know what A knows but not share his enthusiasm for that fact. An alternative way of putting this point is to ask whether today-being- Friday is regarded as the object of A's gladness or the cause of A's glad- ness. If it is the latter then it is not all puzzling that a piece of information should cause one reaction at T1 and a different reaction at T2, for much may intervene, including additional information, between T1 and T2 to alter the causal relation, e.g., that I have a betting slip for 'The God of the Philosophers' to win the 3.30 might make me glad at 3.45, and sad at 3.50, if by the latter time I correct my mistaken view about which horse 'The God of the Philosophers' actually was. If on the other hand we regard today-being-Friday as the object, in an intentional sense, of A's gladness then it is clearly distinct from what A knows, for B knows the latter too. In the final chapter of the book Kenny concludes that despite the uncertainty about whether God exists, be it the God of traditional natural theology, or the more limited God of Mill's Theism, 'There is no reason why someone who is in doubt about the existence of God should not pray for help and guidance on this topic as in other matters' (p. 129). If this is to be accepted as more than trivially true (i.e., in the sense in which we might say 'There is no reason why someone should not wear a funny hat on May i st') then a great deal more must be said about what such a person thinks they are doing, and the circumstances which would lead them to act in this way. Dr. Kenny, I suspect, would not see these questions as falling within the philosophy of religion, although he could reasonably ask those of us who think that these are important philosophical questions, to show why.
