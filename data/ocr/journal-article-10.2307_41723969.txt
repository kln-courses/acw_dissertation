<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS BIOETHICS A BULLY? "Ethics Man" misses mark: most bioethicists are not thugs Although Sokol never explicitly says that bioethicists (clinical ethics consultants) are bullies, his anthropomorphism of bioethics insinuates this.1 It would be a tragedy for readers to believe that Sokol accurately portrays the entire field. Clinical ethics straddles theoretical inquiry and practical application, but theoretical inquiry is not responsible for "bullying" clinicians. Sokol portrays clinical ethicists as malevolent academics- masters of intellectual sleight of hand who use magical words and abstract concepts to amaze and befuddle clinicians.

This model is described in "Core competencies"- the definitive guide for consultants.2 ASBH eschews any model where the consultant is the primary moral decision maker to avoid the sort of bullying Sokol describes. Some clinicians may now be cynical about "bullying bioethicists." But they should realise that Sokol's perspective is missing key relevant data and misrepresents the work of most clinical ethicists.
