<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> MIGUEL HERRERO DE JA ́ UREGUI Emar Tode: Recognizing the Crucial Day in Early Greek Poetry The expression “(on) this day” has an extremely pregnant meaning in different contexts of early Greek poetry. It is used in rituals and in solemn utterances, but it is much more than an emphatic way of saying “today.” It shows that the speaker is recognizing that a decisive, irreversible moment is approaching. Such knowledge of the appointed destiny is only accessible to the gods or to mortals inspired by them, which often makes the authoritative utterance “this day” a performative speech-act that brings immediate accomplishment. The study of the instances of this expression, both with  μαρ and  μ ρα, in epic, religious poetry, and tragedy, also sheds light on the different Greek notions of what a decisive day was. 1. POETICS OF ‘‘THIS DAY’’ Poetry is full of special days, particularly days worthy of an epic or religious song, such as Viddudan in South Slavic Epic, Saint Crispin Day in Henry V, the Midian Day in the Bible, or D-Day in our own times. In archaic Greek poetry, any mention of a specific day tends to underline its unique relevance. For example, “on the day when” serves as an emphatic way of expressing simple “when:” we find  ματι τ  ,  τε very often in Homer as a precise temporal indication that recalls in the performative present a distant (past) and relevant event, which happened on a particular special day 1. Also tragedy, given its generic tendency to focus on This paper originated in a presentation in the Center for Hellenic Studies in April 2010. I am grateful to GregoryNagy and the Junior and Senior Fellows, specially AndromacheKaranika, RichardMartin, Melissa Mueller, Ivana Petrovic, and Josh Reynolds, and also to Marco Antonio Santamarı ́a, Renaud Gagne ́, and the anonymous readers and editors of Classical Antiquity, for their useful comments. 1.

There is certainly much scholarship on issues of epic narratology and tragic time-unity, and yet how the characters perceive the arrival of this crucial day has seemed self-evident and has therefore been neglected. In fact, so normal does this kind of language sound to our ears that commentators of Greek epic and tragedy usually dispatch the deictic expression “this day” ( μαρ τ δε,  μ ρα  δε) as a standard time-setting phrase as it appears in classical prose, i.e. as a variant or emphatic form of the adverb “today” (σ μερον).2 The study of the Greek notion of “crucial moment,” instead, has focused on the concept of καιρ ς, which has a shifting sense in archaic poetry but crystallizes as the term for the due occasion in later literature 3. However, in early Greek poetry the deictic phrase “this day,” be it with the archaic word  μαρ or the common  μ ρα, serves a more significant purpose than mere time-setting as expressed by σ μερον. And at the same time, while there are no cases of “this kairos 4,” “this day” can be very appropriately uttered in specific circumstances. As I will try to show, the expression marks the recognition by the speaker of the imminent arrival of a decisive moment which radically changes his life. In part this is due to the dense meaning of the word  μαρ /  μ ρα, which goes far beyond a temporal reference or the atmospheric opposite of night. Hermann Fra ̈nkel showed in his classic article of 1946 that it also implies in many cases the situation brought by a specific day, an irreversible perennial status. So too, the epithet  φ μεροι which in archaic poetry is often used to refer to mortals, does not mean “short-lived, of one day,” but “of changing, variable situation 5.” Instead, gods are independent of what each day brings. In an absolute certainty as if they had already come. A similar marking of the special past day in literary prose is in Plat. Phaed. 57a: “I was with Socrates on that day, when he drank the poison” ( κε νη  τ    μ ρα     τ  φ ρμακον !πιεν). 2. The word σ μερον / τ μερον itself comes from an ancient deictic, cf. LfrE s.v. The precise forms of deixis for the present day in classical prose depend on the author’s taste: Dinarchus (Dem. 22, 107; Aristog. 3) and Lycurgus (Leocr. 2) use   τ μερον  μ ρα. Aeschines (Timarch. 93; Falsa leg. 4, 167, Ctes.7, 182) and Lysias (24.1) prefer  δε    μ ρα; Demosthenes uses both as equivalent (Phil. 1.40, 3.28, Rhod. lib. 10, falsa leg. 329: μ χρι τ ς τ μερον  μ ρας; Androt. 59: μ χρι τ σδε τ ς  μ ρας). Plato uses several expressions (Leg. 683c:   νupsilonperispomeneν παροupsilonperispomeneσα  μ ρα; Prot. 309b: τ   νupsilonperispomeneν  μ ρα ; Theaet. 202d: νupsilonperispomeneν τ  δε τ    μ ρα ) and blurs the differences between different deictic pronouns: Lach. 181c (%π  τ σδε τ ς  μ ρας,  πειδ&amp; %νεγνωρ σαμεν %λλ λους) refers to the past, while Charm. 176c (%π  ταυτησ+ τ ς  μ ρας) and Symp. 177c (ε-ς ταυτην+ τ&amp;ν  μ ραν) refer to the present. He probably reflects the beginning of a linguistic process culminating in Hellenistic Greek (cf. Ruijgh 2006: 155). However, some instances in prose writers do reflect the values of the deictic expression in poetry, as we shall see in Part 6. 3. See the monograph by Tre ́de ́ 1992 with abundant earlier bibliography. 4. The only case in poetry might be Aesch. Sept. 65, rejected by editors as an inferior reading. Also in classical prose it is very seldom used with the deictic  δε (only in Hdt. 8.79, Demosth. Epit. 31.3, Andoc. In Alc. 3.4), except in medical texts where it is a cataphoric referring to previously mentioned “critical days.” The absence of deixis ad oculos for “this kairos” may suggest that the perception of the due occasion is less physical than intellectual and does not require immediacy. 5. Fra ̈nkel 1946 (1955: 1–39 for a similar German version), in spite of the objections by Dickie 1976, is widely accepted; Onians 1951: 410–15 also analyzes many passages where  μαρ </page> <page sequence="3"> herrero: Emar Tode 37 Homer there are famous formulaic clusters like  λεupsilonacuteθερον  μαρ, ν στιμον  μαρ, δοupsilonperispomeneλιον  μαρ, expressing both the subjective experience of an all-important day by an individual and the objective events determining his destiny 6. In such cases the content of what happens is at least as important as temporality, and  μαρ becomes almost a synonym of other words for destiny, like α0σα or μο1ρα, just as  λεupsilonacuteθερον  μαρ becomes a synonym for  λευθερ α. Later epic, lyric, and tragedy will enthusiastically follow and expand this Homeric path. Apart from the complex semantics of  μαρ, there is another reason why the expression “this day” goes beyond mere rhetorical emphasis: the deictic  δε indicates a close proximity to the speaker 7. The “daylight” dimension of  μαρ favors deixis ad oculos, and whoever uses  δε to modify “day” is saying that he sees the immediate presence of a crucial moment 8. However, it implies not only a subjective perception of the speaker, but also the objective certainty that a key moment has arrived, both for the addressee(s) in the literary frame and for the audience which is drawn into his temporal framework and is shown that the day is decisive for the whole narration. The study of deixis in ancient texts has demonstrated that it often has a performative value which renders real the action spoken of: from the earliest known Greek inscription—Nestor’s cup—to hundreds of charms and curses, the deictic pronoun  δε gives added immediacy to the words in question.9 The same happens in temporal deixis, which aims to show the accomplishment of the action in the present moment: the texts we shall examine show that a usual way to solemnize ritual speech-acts which are immediately fulfilled is saying 1“(on) this day 0.” It may be sometimes replaced, or reinforced, by other deictic expressions like σ μερον or νupsilonperispomeneν. But as we shall see, pointing expressly at the actual presence of the “day” seems often to make  μαρ τ δε (or  μ ρα  δε) not only more emphatic, but also more effective. is functionally equivalent to other words for destiny; Accame 1961 suggests that  μαρ and χρ νος are progressively experienced in a more objective way as notions of time from a purely subjective perception in the Iliad. 6. Santiago 1962 has shown that those epithets of  μαρ which express a durative situation (δοupsilonperispomeneλιον,  λεupsilonacuteθερον) are later creations than those which imply a punctual moment (α2σιμον, μ ρσιμον, κακ ν, 3λ θριον). The former are innovations which load the sense of the word with a subjective experience. 7. The classical formulation that  δε implies proximity to the speaker (1st person), in opposition to οupsilonasperperispomeneτος (2nd person) and  κε1νος (3rd person), is still valid (Ruijgh 2006: 155–57; Bakker 2010: 153–57). This distinction, maintained in Homer and tragedy, is occasionaly blurred in later texts (cf. n.2). 8. Cf., e.g., Od. 3.233, 5.220, 8.466; Soph. OT 1183, Ant. 1328–32, Eur. Suppl. 731, Cycl. 437, discussed below. It is noticeable that the few instances of “this night” in epic and tragedy have a time-setting function that is generally devoid of the connotations of irreversible destiny which we find in “this day” (cf. nn.15 and 68). 9. Cf. Faraone 1996: 95–97 and the collection of studies edited by Felson 2004. The discovery of the perlocutionary value of deixis as a speech-act goes back to J. L. Austin’s posthumous work (1962). 10. On temporal deixis, cf. D’Alessio 2004; Bakker 2005, 2009, and 2010: “(on) this day” fits into Bakker’s concept of “intonation units” of speech studied by pragmatics. </page> <page sequence="4"> 38 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 It is not surprising that the expression “this day” is rare in archaic poetry and that only in Homer and in tragedy do we find it regularly, along with a few appearances in poetry performed in ritual contexts. The obvious reason for this scarcity of examples is that it designates the very day on which the speaker is talking, which is only possible in dialogues or on ritual occasions. The fact that the cases of such expression are not numerous offers the possibility, hitherto unexplored, of a close examination of the instances, which provides a window into its implications for the speakers and addressees of the poetic dialogue, as well as for the audience of the poem. We will see the cases of “this day” in heroic, oracular, and ritual poetry, as well as in tragedy, and some of the echoes that such poetic usages had in fifth-century prose writers. The examples of the expression offered by Homer, Pindar, the Orphic tablets from Pelinna, Hesiod, and Athenian tragedians will show that its utterance may have several implications in many different contexts around one common element, which will be analyzed at the end of the paper: the arrival of a crucial day bringing a radical change from one fundamental pole to the opposite (e.g., life and death) can only be perceived and pointed at by those who are able, for a variety of reasons, to know destiny. 2. HOMER: MORTAL WISH AND DIVINE WILL It may be superfluous to say that starting the examination with Homer does not mean that I believe that he gives access to the “original” or “primitive” value of the expression.11 As I will try to show, the meaning and connotations of the deictic expression “this day” in other Greek poetic genres like oracles and religious texts are already assumed in Homer, and the particular Homeric interpretation of the decisive day must be understood as differentiated from other possible values. Correspondingly, the discovery of the meanings which the poetic formula “this day” has in Homer will help us to understand with more precision and depth some of its appearances in later texts—which may reflect earlier traditions with which Homer was already familiar. As I said, particular days are mentioned in epic because they are special and decisive. Yet it is noteworthy that in Homer we find many epithets for “day,” with the exception of the standard Greek expression for “the decisive day”—namely, κupsilonacuteριον  μαρ or κυρ η  μ ρη 12. There are no cases of καιρ ς 11. I use “Homer” conventionally throughout the paper, without prejudging, since it is not necessary for my present purposes, what kind of authorship of the Iliad and the Odyssey may underlie this name. I tend to agree with those scholars (G. Nagy, R. P. Martin, J. Burgess, some neo-analysts) who think that the Homeric tradition competed with other contemporary rhapsodic traditions. 12. That Homer and Hesiod do not use the term κupsilonacuteριον seems all the more paradoxical given its probable relation to the word for “hero” in Vedic and Avestic, sura (cf. Chantraine 1980 s.v.). In Herodotus (e.g., 5.50.1) and tragedy (e.g., Eur. Or. 48, 1035; Alc. 106, 158–59, quoted below) we find the meanings “the crucial day” and “the appointed day” well established for κupsilonacuteριον (LSJ s.v.). As in the case of καιρ ς (cf. next note), perhaps its absence in the first preserved poets does not mean that the term appeared later, but that they chose to ignore it. </page> <page sequence="5"> herrero: Emar Tode 39 either 13, It looks as if by avoiding generalizing terms such as these, which imply a certain perspective, epic aimed to leave the discovery of the crucial day to its own heroes, who point to it with a deictic pronoun showing its immediacy. Only the characters could utter the deictic formula “this day,” not the primary narrator who is always referring to a past time 14. This is of course also compatible with the audience noticing a performative sense of “this day” in reference to the particular day of the rhapsodic recitation, whenever it takes place, since the rhapsode may impersonate through mimesis the hero speaking.15 In Homer there are only nine instances: six with  μαρ and three with  μ ρη. Let us analyze these cases in the order which, in my opinion, best reveals the full range of possible meanings. The first instance is a duel which shows well the distinction between  ματι τ  δε and the non-emphatic word for “today,” σ μερον. The Trojan Sokos comes before Odysseus and says:16 5 6Οδυσεupsilonperispomene πολupsilonacuteαινε δ λων 8τ9 :δ; π νοιο σ μερον &lt; δοιο1σιν  πεupsilonacute=εαι &gt;Ιππασ δη σι τοι@δ9 Aνδρε κατακτε νας κα+ τεupsilonacuteχε9 %ποupsilonacuteρας,   κεν  μ   upsilonasperπ  δουρ+ τυπε+ς %π  θυμ ν 3λ σση ς.

Il. 11.428–46 “Honoured Odysseus, insatiable of guile and endeavour, today you will have two sons of Hippasos to vaunt over 13. The adjective κα ριος has the spatial sense of “vital part in the body” (Il. 4.185, 8.84, 8.326; cf. Tre ́de ́ 1992: 25–31). But cf. n.17 on κατακα ριον. 14. The phrase  μαρ τ δε is opposed to  μαρ κε1νο, which refers to an important past moment, for the characters or for the narrator (cf. Il. 2.37, 2.482, 4.543, 18.324, 21.517; no cases in the Odyssey); cf. de Jong 1988: 235–36, and n.24. Both deictic pronouns are opposed to ποτε, a distant indeterminate moment. 15. Cf. Bakker 2009: 125–26. If Taplin 1992: 22–31 is right in supposing a three-day performance for the Iliad, the mention of “this day” would have a clear performative value in passages like 13.828 or 15.251 (see below). The three cases of “this night” (Il. 9.78, 22.202, and specially Od. 11.373) also may be considered from the perspective of a nocturnal recitation. This force of temporal deixis to re-actualize each time an infinitely repeatable performance context will be even more evident in ritual poetry and drama. 16. All Homeric translations are from Richmond Lattimore, with some changes of my own. </page> <page sequence="6"> 40 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 for having killed two such men as we and stripping our armour or else, stricken underneath my spear, you might lose your own life.” He spoke, and stabbed Odysseus’ shield in its perfect circle. All the way through the glittering shield went the heavy spearhead and crashed its way through the intricately wrought corselet, and all the skin was torn away from his ribs, yet Pallas Athene would not let the point penetrate the man’s vitals. Odysseus realized that the fatal end had not yet come to him17 and drew back and spoke a word to Sokos: “Ah, wretch surely now steep destruction is advancing upon you. It is true, you have stopped my fighting against the Trojans, but I here declare that dark death and slaughter will come upon you this day, and that beaten down under my spear you will give glory to me and your life to Hades of the horses.” He spoke, and Sokos turning from him was striding in flight. . . . In his sentence with σ μερον, Sokos is not proclaiming a forthcoming vic- tory for himself, but admitting the possibility of the opposite outcome of the duel 18. The position of weakness denoted by the word σ μερον is clear in a similar scene, where Aeneas confronting Achilles says that “one of our mothers will cry for her son today” (Il. 20.210–11), a feeble vow patently unaccomplished 19. Sokos’ own lack of conviction proves right. He dies under the spear of Odysseus, who says, with full certitude of his victory, that he will prevail  ματι τ  δε. Such certitude has divine support: Athena causes Sokos’ spear to deviate, so it does not reach Odysseus’ guts, and he realizes that his τ λος has not yet come. And Sokos flees (in vain) upon hearing Odysseus’ 17. Line 11.439 has occasioned much discussion since antiquity about the variant τ λος (Aristarchus) or β λος (Zenodotus). While the former implies a temporal sense, the latter has a spatial meaning (“the spear had not hit a vital spot”). The most recent scholarship (cf. Hainsworth ad loc.; Van der Valk 1964: II, 11) tends to prefer the latter because κα ριος means a vital point in the other three Homeric instances (n.13). However, τ λος is definitely supported by the parallel with Il. 19.108 commented on below. Pace Tre ́de ́ 1992: 29–30, it can be subject of  λθεν (cf. some lines later 451: φθ  σε τ λος (Zenodotus again β λος) θαν τοιο κιχ μενον; cf. also 2.122, 3.291). It is probable, therefore, that κατακα ριον (a unique form perhaps meant to be differentiated from κα ριος) has a temporal meaning closer to “decisive moment:” cf. Tre ́de ́ 1992: 143 on καιρο+ τ λειοι. Furthermore, the verb γν  suggests an intellectual comprehension of the “moment” rather than a physical noticing of the degree of gravity of the injury, in contrast to 2δεν in the parallel scene of Il. 4.151 (Menelaus is apt for seeing, but Odysseus is able to understand the appropriate day, cf. Od. 20.122 discussed below). 18. In all other Homeric contexts (except those examined here: 11.429, 19.104, 20.211) σ μερον means “for today,” explicitly acknowledging that afterwards (upsilonasperacuteστερον) things might be different: Il. 7.30, 7.291, 8.142, 20.127 (always in the same position at the beginning of the line: σ μερονU upsilonasperacuteστερον αupsilonlenisperispomeneτε . . . );Od. 17.186, 17.252, 18.377. The only case of σ μερον in tragedy is also unassertive (n.67). 19. As if conscious of that weakness, Aeneas feels the need to justify his σ μερον and continues line 20.211 with οupsilonlenis γ ρ φημ9  π εσσ  γε νηπυτ οισιν (“for I don’t speak with foolish words”). He is countering Achilles’ calling him ν πιος (20.198) for attempting to resist him and chooses his words carefully (also in 20.200, 20.244). On ν πιος in relation to the recognition of the day, cf. nn.37–38. </page> <page sequence="7"> herrero: Emar Tode 41 words, as if the latter’s utterance were as effectively lethal as the spear that will immediately follow 20. The same distinction between  ματι τ  δε and σ μερον is underlined by Agamemnon, when he illustrates his own blindness in quarreling with Achilles through a mythical paradigm, Zeus’ mistake when he thought Heracles was going to be born:  τοι   γ9 εupsilonlenisχ μενος μετ φη π ντεσσι θεο1σιU κ κλυτ  μευ π ντ ς τε θεο+ π`σα  τε θ αιναι, Kφρ9 ε2πω τ με θυμ ς  ν+ στ θεσσιν %ν@γει. σ μερον Aνδρα φ ωσδε μογοστ κος Ε-λε θυια  κφανε1, ]ς π ντεσσι περικτι νεσσιν %ν =ει, τ ν %νδρ ν γενε ς οb θ9 αbματος  =  μεupsilonperispomene ε-σ . τ ν δ; δολοφρον ουσα προσηupsilonacuteδα π τνια cΗρηU ψευστ σεις, οupsilonlenisδ9 αupsilonlenisperispomeneτε τ λος μupsilonacuteθω   πιθ σεις. ε- δ9 Aγε νupsilonperispomeneν μοι Kμοσσον 6Ολupsilonacuteμπιε καρτερ ν  ρκον,   μ;ν τ ν π ντεσσι περικτι νεσσιν %ν =ειν  ς κεν  π9  ματι τ  δε π ση  μετJ ποσσ+ γυναικ ς τ ν %νδρ ν οd σ ς  = αbματ ς ε-σι γεν θλης. Il. 19.101–11 Zeus spoke forth and made a vow before all the immortals “Hear me, all you gods and all you goddesses: hear me while I speak forth what the heart within my breast urges. Today Eileithya of women’s child-pains shall bring forth a man to the light who, among the men sprung of the generations of my blood, shall be lord over those dwelling about him.” Then in guileful intention lady Hera said to him: “You will be a liar, not put fulfilment on what you have spoken. Come, then, lord of Olympus, and swear before me a strong oath that he shall be lord over all those dwelling about him who on this day shall fall between the feet of a woman, the man who is born of the blood of your generation.” Once Zeus has uttered the great oath, Hera will cause Eurystheus to be born first. Again, the contrast with σ μερον becomes clear: the other subtle changes introduced by Hera in the formulation of birth may be explained to include a far descendent in the promise, not only a son, but the difference between  π9  ματι τ  δε and σ μερον relies in the fact that the oath implies the certainty of accomplishment (τ λος): only the former expresses such inevitability and brings τ λος when uttered. 20. Homer’s audience may have kept in mind the parallel scene of the duel between Tlepolemos and Sarpedon in Il. 5.633–55 (cf. Fenik 1968: 66–69, 101–105). Sarpedon’s response to a previous boast of his rival is identical in many lines to our scene: it omits temporal references to “this day,” but his  νθ δε φημι (5.652), also uttered by Odysseus, is much more assertive than Tlepolemos’ ο2ομαι (5.644). Sarpedon, like Odysseus, wins the duel. </page> <page sequence="8"> 42 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 If in this instance the ritual force of the expression is revealed in an oath, a third example shows  ματι τ  δε uttered in a solemn prayer in the Odyssey. Odysseus asks Zeus to show his favor with an omen from outside and another from inside (20.100–101). Zeus throws a thunderbolt, upon hearing which, an old woman says:   Vα μupsilonacuteλην στ σασα !πος φ το, σ μα AνακτιU “Ζεupsilonperispomene π τερ,  ς τε θεο1σι κα+ %νθρ@ποισιν %ν σσεις,   μεγ λ9  βρ ντησας %π9 οupsilonlenisρανοupsilonperispomene %στερ εντος, οupsilonlenisδ  ποθι ν φος  στ U τ ρας νupsilonacute τεω  τ δε φα νεις. κρ νον νupsilonperispomeneν κα+  μο+ δειλ   !πος,  ττι κεν ε2πωU μνηστ ρες πupsilonacuteματον τε κα+ upsilonasperacuteστατον  ματι τ  δε  ν μεγ ροισ 9 6Οδυσ ος fλο ατο δα1τ9  ρατειν ν, οd δ  μοι καμ τω  θυμαλγ ϊ γοupsilonacuteνατ9 !λυσαν Aλφιτα τευχοupsilonacuteση U νupsilonperispomeneν upsilonasperacuteστατα δειπν σειαν.” gς Aρ9 !φη, χα1ρεν δ; κλεηδ νι δ1ος 6Οδυσσεupsilongraveς Ζην ς τε βροντ  U φ το γJρ τε σασθαι %λε τας. Od. 20.112–22 She stopped the mill and spoke aloud, a sign for her master: “Father Zeus, you who are lord of the gods and people, now you have thundered loud from the starry sky, although there is no cloud. You show this forth, a portent for someone. Grant now also for wretched me the prayer that I make you. On this day let the suitors take, for the last and latest time, their desirable feasting in the halls of Odysseus. For it is they who have broken my knees with heart-sore labor as I grind the meal for them. Let this now be their final feasting.” So she spoke, and great Odysseus welcomed the ominous speech, and the thunder of Zeus. He thought he would punish the sinners. The thunder had been an omen (τ ρας) from outside, and the words from the woman are an omen (κληδ@ν) from inside the house, just as Odysseus had asked from Zeus 21. The old woman uses the same deictic τ δε for the thunder as for the “day,” as if praying for both entities to have the same real value of immediacy. And in fact, as Odysseus immediately recognizes, this will indeed be the last (πupsilonacuteματ ν / upsilonasperacuteστατον / upsilonasperacuteστατα) day for the suitors. As in the former examples 21. In Od. 20.100 and 21.105 the utterance of the woman is called φ μη.

Il. 13.232–34 Earth-shaker Poseidon answered to him: “Idomeneus, never may that man any more return home from Troy-land, but here may he become the sport of dogs, whoever on this day of his own will shrink from fight.” This seems the typical harangue in which Idomeneus has just said (13.228–30) that Thoas is an expert. A vowwishing death on those who flee needs the strongest language to make the curse credible. However, the poet expressly recalls that it is not Thoas, but Poseidon, who is using this expression. As its solemnity suggests, it is no empty or wishful cursing: from the lips of a god, it is an actual, real threat, since the power of the speaker to fulfill it is beyond doubt 23. In our fifth instance the speaker is the Trojan Agenor, motivated by Apollo. The god, worrying that Troy would fall “that day, against destiny” (Il. 21.517 upsilonasperπ ρμορον  ματι κε νω ) under the fury of Achilles, gives courage to Agenor (21.547) to stand against Achilles and confront him. Agenor cries out:   δ  που μ λ9 !ολπας  ν+ φρεσ+ φα διμ9 Α6 χιλλεupsilonperispomene  ματι τ  δε π λιν π ρσειν Τρ@ων %γερ@χων νηπupsilonacuteτι9U   τ9 !τι πολλJ τετεupsilonacute=εται Aλγε9  π9 αupsilonlenisτ  . Il. 21.583–85 “You must have hoped within your heart, o shining Achilleus, on this day to storm the city of the proud Trojans. You fool! there is much hard suffering to be done for its winning.” Agenor is reporting Achilles’ supposed thoughts, and calls him νηπupsilonacuteτιος for mistaking the day on which Troy should fall. Inversely, what Agenor is saying with full conviction and prophetic certainty, inspired as he is by Apollo, is that this is not the appointed day on which the city will succumb, and that it will still 22. I thank the Classical Antiquity editor, Alex Purves, for bringing this important point to my attention. Spatial and temporal notions are blended in the idea of “reaching the end,” as in Il. 11.439 (cf. n.17, and n.76 for a parallel instance in tragedy). 23. A significant parallel is Theseus asking Poseidon to fulfill his curse against Hippolytus “so that he does not escape this day” (Eur. Hipp. 889–90, analyzed in Part 5). For the use of “this day” in harangues to soldiers before the battle, cf. Part 6. </page> <page sequence="10"> 44 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 resist for a long time and be the cause of great grief for the Achaeans. The effect is closely parallel to a passage in Book 2 where the poet himself speaks about Agamemnon just as Agenor does to Achilles, changing the deictic to show the shift of temporal perspective:24 φ  γJρ   γ9 αQρ σειν Πρι μου π λιν  ματι κε νω , ν πιος, οupsilonlenisδ; τJ   δη h Vα Ζεupsilongraveς μ δετο !ργαU Il. 2.37–38 For he thought that on that day he would take Priam’s city, fool, who knew nothing of all the things Zeus planned to accomplish. It is easy to see what these five cases of the deictic expression  ματι τ  δε have in common. Not only does it always underline the importance of a cru- cial event that inaugurates an irreversible state: birth, death, the fall of Troy. It also incorporates an element of divine guarantee which gives complete cer- tainty that what is being predicted will actually happen. The difference with σ μερον, used by Sokos and Zeus in his informal statement, is telling: it is not just a matter of emphasis. It is a matter of certainty, of divine support being lent to the speaker’s words. Thus in these Homeric examples the utterance of a sentence with  ματι τ  δε needs to be regarded within the celebrated category of performative speech-act: it carries such conviction and such divine strength that it brings fulfillment by itself. This formula is appropriate in vows, oaths, and prophecies, which are fulfilled through divine guarantee. It is highly prob- able that Homer’s audience (just as characters like Sokos hearing Odysseus, or Odysseus listening to the old woman) was meant to notice these oracular over- tones and recognized the value of the expression as a performative speech-act with inexorable effect. The sixth and last instance of  ματι τ  δε in Homer deserves particular attention, since it appears on the lips of Hector, who is characterized throughout the poem as particularly obsessed by 2“the day 5.” As he slowly emerges from his swoon after being hit by Ajax with a rock, he confesses to Apollo: 24. Cf. Bakker 2010: 154–57 on ( )κε1νος vs.  δε. The first one denotes what is “remote, not materially present in the speech situation.” For Homer the day is “very present mentally, but physically absent,” so that “the deixis takes place embedded inside the text, beyond the primary communication between the narrator and the reader,” to use Bakker’s expression (159). For Agamemnon, if the poet had granted him the word here in a hypothetical direct speech, it would be “this day.” But Homer only puts the words  ματι τ  δε in the lips of those who are right and know it: the speaker is the poet who is right (like Agenor), not Agamemnon who is wrong (like Achilles). 25. Cf. Taplin 1992: 153–61. Hector has been told that on this day Zeus will give him glory (11. 209), and proclaims it in 15.719 (“a day worth all the rest / to take the ships:” νupsilonperispomeneν  μ1ν π ντων Ζεupsilongraveς A=ιον  μαρ !δωκε / ν ας fλε1ν). That also motivates him for his words about “this day” in 13.828, which nevertheless go beyond Zeus’ promises (cf. below). At the same time he knows prophetically (6.448) that one day Troy will fall and that Achilles will die (22.359). </page> <page sequence="11"> herrero: Emar Tode 45 κα+ δ&amp; !γωγ9  φ μην ν κυας κα+ δ μ9 Α6 Iδαο  ματι τ  δ9 Kψεσθαι,26  πε+ φ λον Aϊον  τορ. Il. 15.251–52 “Truly, I thought that on this day I would see the corpses and the house of Hades, once I had breathed the inward life from me.” Hector is reporting what could now be called a near-death experience 27. His fainting made him think that he was dying, and he even thought he was already seeing the House of Hades. We would say today that he thought “his hour had come.” To characterize this imagined encounter with death, he uses four elements: the corpses, the House of Hades, breathing out his life, and  ματι τ  δε. As we shall see, such use of the formula to indicate the irreversible moment of death is found in some “really funerary” contexts (the Pelinna gold tablets, and the deaths of Alcestis and Oedipus in tragedy), and it may well be that Homer uses this ritual formula to strengthen the image of Hector’s quasi-death. However, Hector’s wordsmay be also related to the speechwhich immediately preceded his fainting, in which—at the end of Book 13—he had challengedAjax to a duel which, purposefully delayed by the poet throughout many lines, culminated in Hector’s being struck and swooning. Hector had said:28 ε- γJρ  γFν οupsilonasperacuteτω γε Δι ς π ϊς α-γι χοιο ε2ην  ματα π ντα, τ κοι δ  με π τνια cΗρη, τιο μην δ9 jς τ ετ9 Α6 θηνα η κα+ Α6 π λλων, jς νupsilonperispomeneν  μ ρη  δε κακ ν φ ρει Α6 ργε οισι π`σι μ λ9,  ν δ; σupsilongrave το1σι πεφ σεαι, α2 κε ταλ σση ς. . . . Il. 13.825–29 “If I could only be called son to Zeus of the aegis all the days of my life, and the lady Hera my mother and I be honoured as Apollo and Athene are honoured, so surely as this is a day that brings evil to the Argives, all, and you will be killed with the rest of them, if you have daring. . . .” Hector expresses through a famous adynaton his hope that “this day now” will bring evil to all the Achaeans, and also to Ajax “if he has daring:” it is a con- 26. Though the variant Kψεσθαι was rejected by Aristarchus in favor of b=εσθαι, Janko’s comments (1994: 253 ad loc.) show that Kψεσθαι makes better sense: Hector sees Apollo instead of what he expected. Cf. Eur. Iph. Aul. 1611 and Alc. 141 (quoted below) with βλ πειν (“see” in the sense of “live”) in the moment of death marked with “this day.” 27. On this passage, cf. Neal 2006: 82–85, 140–41. Hector’s death is preceded by a number of swoons of increasing intensity. 28. The lines between Hector’s speech and the duel (13.833–14.401) have been thought by Fenik 1968: 156 to be a later insertion which splits an originally unified episode, but Janko 1994: 212 shows that the poet achieves suspense by delaying the duel. Cf. Taplin 1992: 9 for the close links between distant passages. </page> <page sequence="12"> 46 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 ditional wish, partly similar to Sokos’ in 11.430. Zeus had never promised him total victory or Ajax’s death. The reaction of those who listen to his words also shows that in this case the words are perceived as loaded only with the weight of human will, not of divine power: the Trojans will shout enthusias- tically, but so will the Achaeans in response (13.834–35). The outcome of the battle will by no means be so decisive as the complete ruin of the Achaeans, and Ajax will not die at Hector’s hands. It is a wishful human prediction, only partially accomplished, not a divine prophecy. Thus the word  μ ρη occurs in a deictic expression equivalent to σ μερον, and it is used on the lips of a warrior who fails to fulfill his vow—like Sokos and Aeneas. The fact that a few moments later (the intervening lines describe events on Olympus, not on the battlefield) Hector uses  ματι τ  δε to acknowledge that Ajax almost killed him, seems to draw a contrast between such formula as a winning speech-act and  μ ρη  δε as an expression appropriate for an uncertain wish, exactly the same opposition that we found between  ματι τ  δε and σ μερον in 11.430–44 or 119.103–10. Now already in archaic times  μαρ was an ancient word used only in epic or epic-influenced poetry, while the cognate word  μ ρη, rare and relatively modern in epic, was the usual term for “day 29.” It would be possible to argue that in this line the choice of  μ ρη is simply justified by metrical necessity and that Hector has just been carried away by enthusiasm in line 829 and, taking Zeus’ promises beyond their limits, he is exceptionally uttering “this day” and being wrong. But given that it is the only appearance in the Iliad 30, we may rather think that Homer is drawing a purposeful contrast between  μαρ and  μ ρη. Such an opposition is not only articulated by the difference in the vow’s fulfillment or lack thereof, but the lines uttered by Hector also seem to oppose his present real  μ ρη and the  ματα π ντα, the standard epic formula which inevitably recalls the un-ephemeral nature of the everlasting gods 31. Hector acknowledges that he is not a god and uses the word  μαρ for that life which he is sure he will never attain. For the same reason, he as a mortal puts all his hopes and all his limited will power in “this  μ ρη.” This can be compared to the case of “this night” in Nestor’s lips when inviting the Achaeans to think what to do next day (9.78): “this night will break our army, or else will preserve it” (νupsilongrave= δ9  δ9 :; διαρρα σει στρατ ν :; 29. Cf. Debrunner 1946: 40–42 showing the later entrance of  μ ρη into Homeric poetry. 30. Most scholars think that the almost identical passage of 8.538–41 (cf. Kirk ad loc. 1990: 339) is a later addition taken from Book 13. Taplin 1992: 145–46 finds it suitable for this three-day performance theory as marking the end of the first day, and perhaps that is the reason for the doublet: 13.825–29 would recall Hector’s wish on the next day. The only variation is in line 8.538: instead of being the son of Hera, Hector would like to be immortal and ageless (ε2ην %θ νατος κα+ %γ ρως  ματα π ντα), the standard expression of divine immortality (Od. 5.136, 7.257, 23.336). In this passage  μ ρη  δε loses its primary meaning, since it means “tomorrow,” an isolated case which proves its derivative character. 31. Cf. Treu 1965 on Greek expressions of eternity (17–24 for  ματα π ντα). On divine time as opposed to mortal time, cf. Vidal-Naquet 1960, Detienne and Sissa 2000, Purves 2006: 194–95. </page> <page sequence="13"> herrero: Emar Tode 47 σα@σει).32 The importance of the present critical moment is underlined, albeit from a purely human perspective, without any certainty about the outcome, which can turn one way or the contrary. The phrases  μ ρη  δε and νupsilongrave=  δε are used in these cases as time-setters like σ μερον, which, however emphatic they may be, lack the self-accomplishment implied by divine support that we always find in the cases of  ματι τ  δε. This passage shows, therefore, the hint of a conceptual distinction between  μ ρη and  μαρ as designations of human and divine days, appropriately put in the mouth of Hector, the hero most haunted by worry about which will be the decisive day. If such a distinction was intended in the Iliad, however, it was lost in the rest of Greek literature, where there is no apparent semantic difference between the terms:33 the word  μαρ remained a more elevated expression of the same concept than  μ ρη, although it still belonged to the special language that evokes archaic and heroic poetry, whence it may have kept a more hieratic and sacral ring in some contexts 34. The last case of Homeric “this day” is at the end of theOdyssey, when Laertes rejoices in seeing his son and grandson together: Λα ρτης δ9  χ ρη κα+ μupsilonperispomeneθον !ειπεU “τ ς νupsilonacute μοι  μ ρη  δε, θεο+ φ λοι;   μ λα χα ρωU υQ ς θ9 υQων ς τ9 %ρετ ς π ρι δ ριν !χουσι.” τ ν δ; παρισταμ νη προσ φη γλαυκ πις Α6 θ νηU Od. 24.513–16 Laertes also rejoiced and spoke a word: “What day is this for me, dear gods? I am very happy! My son and my son’s son are vying with one another in courage.” Then flashing-eyed Athena came near him and said. . . . Laertes uses the expression to utter a prayer to which Athena responds positively calling him φ λτατε and giving him strength to kill enemies, so it can easily fit into the pattern of a prayer answered by a god. The content of this prayer, however, is unique, as so many other things in Odyssey 24. It is a question, not an assertion. 32. Neither are the other two Homeric cases of “this night” assertive about something that will happen, but merely time-setting: Il. 22.202, Od. 11.373. 33. Already in the Odyssey there are three cases of  μ ραι substituting for  ματα in formulas: 11.294 (“months and days”), 14.93 (“nights and days”), 14.293 (“months and days”). However, Od. 24.514 (discussed below) and  φημ ρια φρον οντες in Od. 21.85 suggest that  μ ρη is also a human day in the Odyssey (cf. also Od. 4.223, with Fra ̈nkel 1955: 30–31). Instead, Hesiod makes a point of the interchangeability of both words (Op. 765, 769 discussed below). In tragedy the poetic  μαρ is less frequent than the common  μ ρη, but their meaning is the same, as we shall see in the examination of the deictic passages. 34. We find the expression  ματα π ντα in some early Achaian inscriptions to give everlasting authority to the law: IG V, 2, 5; IX 1, 484, 5. Ruijgh 1957: 120–21 agrees that this is a “formule sacre ́e” and argues that it is proof of a very old Achaian substrate in Homeric language. In later inscriptions  ματα is still kept as a mark of sacrality: e.g., Inscr. Smyrn. 728 (cf. Sokolowski LSA n.84 [p. 186]; SEG 14, 1957, p. 752). </page> <page sequence="14"> 48 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 Laertes seems unable to qualify this exceptional day (as if he had no adequate epithet from the formulaic stock) and asks what it might be. The personal pronoun μοι, the choice of  μ ρη instead of  μαρ and the uncertain formulation seem to underline the human dimension of this day for Laertes. Rather than the day of death, birth, or victory, it is a day of unexpected happiness after long suffering 35. Perhaps in Laertes’ uncertainty when faced with “this day,” just as in Hector’s worry about his own, we can see a hint of the different views regarding what a crucial day is in a man’s life. Laertes’ question seems to open a window to other, less epic conceptions of the decisive day, which, as we shall see in Part 6, have more space in later literature. All these passages show that in Homer what “this day” brings is known only by the gods, who are able to discern the nature of all days ( ματα π ντα) and therefore (generally) act in accordance with destiny 36. When mortals have knowledge of this divine will, they recognize what will happen on that specific day and are able to proclaim it with an assertive deictic. Thus Odysseus realizes that Athena protects him against Sokos and that Zeus answers his prayer through a κληδ@ν, and recognizes what the day will bring. However, it is not easy to know the true nature of the  μαρ, and that is the key to the prudent σ μερον that Sokos or Aeneas utter, when they are not sure of their victory, making it a merely human wish. These characters seem conscious of their ignorance of the true divine will about the day. Such is most probably Hector’s and Laertes’ motivation when uttering the unique words  μ ρη  δε, which situate their pointing at “this day” in a human perspective where no speech-act with divine support is intended. He who fails to be clear-sighted or at least prudent and mistakes the divine will concerning this day is, on the other hand, ν πιος: forgetting his former prudence, Hector becomes ν πιος when he takes Zeus’ promises too far and thinks that he will attain total victory 37, and Achilles or Agamemnon are called ν πιοι because they thought they would take Troy “on that day,” i.e. because 35. Od. 18.136–37 underlines this subjective perception of the day, in combination with divine will: “such is the mind (το1ος γJρ ν ος) of mortal men, as each day (οlον  π9  μαρ) the father of men and gods decides;” cf. also Archilochus 131 West: “the heart of men becomes such as the day Zeus brings upon them.” This seems to prelude Solon’s account in Herodotus (1.32) of the variability of the human days (n.95). 36. Just as Athena cares that τ λος κατακα ριον does not come to Odysseus (Il. 11.439), Apollo cares that Achilles does not take Troy upsilonasperπ ρμορον on that day (Il. 21.517). Zeus is the ultimate sovereign over days: cf. e.g., Od. 18.137 (previous note) or Il. 15.719 (Zeus gives the Trojans “a day worth all the rest”). The dead also may share with the gods the knowledge of human days from their own timeless perspective (n.82). Of course there are a few famous instances when the gods’ wishes are impotent against an opposite destiny (e.g., Il. 16.431–61). In our passages, however, divine will agrees with the preappointed destiny, so we do not need to enter into the important difference between both levels of determining human fate (cf. Janko 1994: 4–7). 37. In Il. 18.293–310 Hector calls Polydamas ν πιος for suggesting to go back to the city, but he is being the real ν πιος, as the poet reminds us. In 22.102 he will regret not having listened to Polydamas “on this accursed night” (i.e. last night: νupsilonacuteχθ9 upsilonasperacuteπο τ νδ9 3λο ν). Cf. Taplin 1992: 159–60 and Edmunds 1990: 17, 82, 91 on ν πιος as someone unable to count the days. </page> <page sequence="15"> herrero: Emar Tode 49 they did not know Zeus’ designs but thought they did.38 Homer even makes Agamemnon justify himself by depicting an anthropomorphic Zeus who is fooled by Hera and mistakes the day of Heracles’ birth as if he was a human ν πιος king. However, as the instances of Odysseus show, knowledge of the gods’ designs does not depend only on human ability, but on divine goodwill. In fact, in Book 2, it is Zeus himself who deceives Agamemnon with a dream that anybody would have interpreted as a divine sign. Homer, then, seems conscious of the speech-act value of the formula ( π’)  ματι τ  δε, but does not depict any clear mechanism of being sure of when one can utter it with complete certainty: even oaths and dreams can be deceitful. To be clear-sighted depends more on one’s gifted nature and on divine predilections than on anything one can do. That is why Agamemnon is blind to the  μαρ and Odysseus, instead, is able to see it. Later epic will imitate Homer’s deictic formulas 39. But tragedy will be the genre above all that will best exploit and carry further these Homeric conceptions: as we shall see, tragic heroes can do nothing to be sure that they can recognize in time the crucial day when it arrives, since it all depends on the gods’ will in accordance with fate. We must first examine, however, other poetic traditions which, unlike Homer, do reflect on their deixis for “day” a conviction that there are ways of ensuring an adequate recognition of the day by attaining divine support, either through ritual performance or through following oracular wisdom. 3. RITUAL POETRY: PRESENT DAY AND MYTHICAL DAY As we have seen, the Homeric poems appear to take as an assumed fact the value of ( π’)  ματι τ  δε as a speech-act uttered by an authoritative voice, usually inspired by a divinity for the fulfillment of a solemn action like an oath, a vow, a curse, a prophecy. There is no reason to think that such connotation of the deictic formula was an invention of Homer. On the contrary, we should expect to find it in the kind of poetry whose utterance brings immediate accomplishment, i.e. ritual poetry. The best examples are provided by lyric poetry to be sung on religious occasions. Much has been said on the complex temporal deixis of Greek lyric and its ability to recall with a simple νupsilonperispomeneν the world of myth in the present time, a blending of mythical and ritual time which can be infinitely re-performed: the cletic hymn to Aphrodite in Sappho’s fr. 1 culminating in !λθε μοι κα+ νupsilonperispomeneν 38. Agamemnon is characterized throughout myth by his inability to recognize the  μαρ (e.g., his death in Argos) and thus as a great ν πιος (Od. 11.441). Other texts characterize the ν πιος as thinking only of ephemeral things (Od. 21.85, Pind. fr. 157 S-M, cf. Fra ̈nkel 1955: 30), which is consistent with the Homeric contraposition of  μ ρη and  μαρ. 39. Apollonius (2.797; 3.538; 3.901) and Quintus of Smyrna (1.186; 1.219; 3.98; 3.249; 4.103; 5.141; 8.470; 14.300) use  μαρ τ δε as an imitation of Homeric language: although it may be used for several decisive situations, like a battle, it is clearly specialized in the day of death and the day of birth, which bring the most clearly irreversible changes in human life. </page> <page sequence="16"> 50 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 is paradigmatic 40. The Eliadean idea of a mythical illud tempus reactualized in ritual proves helpful to analyze these texts 41. At the same time deictic spatial- temporal expressions (e.g., Pindar O. 3.34, κα  νυν  ς ταupsilonacuteταν fορτ ν) situate the performance of the song in a permanent present that allows perpetual reenacting. However, in the extant corpus of archaic lyric “this day” appears only in the first line of the so-called Paean 15 of Pindar, in reality a prosodion sung at Poseidon’s festival in Aegina 42.

On other occasions νupsilonperispomeneν aims precisely to distance the present from the mythical past, e.g., Ibycus fr. 1.10–15: “I do not want to sing now (νupsilonperispomeneν) Paris or Cassandra, nor the anonymous day of the fall of high-gated Troy (uλ@σιμον 8μαρ %ν@νυμον).” This passage shows the epic resonance of the “day” theme, which may explain its scarcity in lyric poetry, where the less solemn deictic νupsilonperispomeneν is preferred. Cf. Danielewicz 1990: 11 on choral lyric passages with νupsilonperispomeneν. 41. Eliade 1957: 68–115. Eliadean theories have been subject to much controversy and revision, but the ritual actualization of illud tempus is generally accepted as a useful analytic tool, even more so in Greek texts which Eliade explicitly did not like to take as examples, since they were not “primitive enough” for him. Cf., e.g., Felson 1999: 15–16 for Pythian 4; Patterson 2005 for Alcman’s Partheneion. Today the reactualization of mythical time in many rites is often taken for granted without explicit reference to Eliade (e.g., Parker 2011: 200). 42. Cf. Rutherford 2001: 412 and D’Alessio 2004: 292–94 for comparison with other lyric passages where temporal deixis with σ μερον has a similar function (Pind. Ol. 6.28, Pyth. 4.2: cf. Felson 1999: 15–16; Sapph. fr. 140.97–98 Voigt). </page> <page sequence="17"> herrero: Emar Tode 51 different generations inhabiting the same place,43 temporal deixis links the partic- ipants of all performances of the song (or rite) whenever and wherever it takes place. Such ritual principle has worked all through antiquity—Athenian Neo- platonists celebrated Plato’s birthday singing the hexametrical line “on this day the gods gave Plato to men” ( ματι τ  δε Πλ τωνα θεο+ δ σαν %νθρ@ποισιν)44 —and it has lived in Christian liturgy down to our times 45. In a completely different context, there is yet another precious case of  ματι τ  δε in early hexametric ritual poetry. Two gold tablets, dated in the fourth century bce, were found in tombs in Pelinna (Thessaly) with dactylic lines and ritual allusions referring to the soul’s journey to Hades. They are doubtless— although exactly how is very much debated—related to other similar tablets found in Magna Graecia and Crete. Scholars generally agree that these written texts, containing a large number of hexameters, are the last literary phase of a much earlier oral tradition of  πω δα  46. They all depict scenes of the moment of death as a descent to the underworld, and contain instructions and formulas which will help the soul to attain immortality.

E.g., Gregory of Nazianzus’ Pascual Hymn, with anaphoric σ μερον (Carmina de se ipso, 37.1328–29 PG). In modern Christian liturgy there are many such expressions, many of them reenactments of biblical sentences: “this is the day the Lord has made”; “today our Savior is born “; nunc dimittis, Domine. Faraone 1995: 12–14 shows a very similar use of temporal deixis in magical charms. 46. On the “Orphic” gold tablets, cf.

Every single word of these tablets has been widely debated, except the formula Aματι τ  δε in the first line, precisely because it is apparently clear as a reinforce- ment of the twice repeated νupsilonperispomeneν 48. Yet these last two words of the dactylic line in such an emphatic position, outside the hexameter 49, are not likely to be just an empty repetition for which the tablet has little space, but surely have a precise sense relevant for the salvation of the initiate. The ritual importance that the expression was shown to have in Homer may explain its presence in the Pelinna tablets. A first dimension introduced by the temporal deixis here is the immediate accomplishment of the action: death and birth are mentioned in the aorist, with the same certainty as the ritual actions which the initiate is reminded that he has undertaken 50. Scholars have rightly supposed that the tablets refer to a ritual performance which has taken place, apparently related to the funeral context. The speaker asserts with absolute conviction that both death and birth have been equally accomplished. The ritual enactment in which the death moment may have been imitated was supported by the performative value of a speech-act. The ritual level, however, overlaps with the mythical level: the deceased is directly addressed by the speaker, who may be the ritual initiator or/and the conductor of the funeral, but at the same time a character in the underworld such as those who appear in other leaves welcoming the deceased (the guardians of Hades? Persephone?) 51. In this way, the human time of the present day, the day of the real death and of the ritual performance, is linked to the time of the mythical 48. Only the following pay some attention to Aματι τ  δε: Segal 1990: 114 notes that the beginning has an urgent tone contrasting with the peaceful atmosphere transmitted by the last lines; Graf 1993: 248: “the deictic pronoun refers to the moment the verse is spoken and points to a clearly definable ritual situation;” Faraone 1995: 13–14 n.42 relates it to magical charms. We may note that in several lines of the obscure tablet C from Thurii (Orph. Fragm. 492) 8μαρ (10) and compounds like f=`μαρ (7) and fπτ μαρ (6) have been proposed as plausible readings. 49. Although Giangrande 1991 argues that the line should be read as an original dactylic heptameter, it seems more plausible to think with Graf and Johnston 2007: 138 that τρισ λβιε was inserted in the original hexameter instead of μ καρ for some particular ritual reason (the falling into milk is repeated three times). 50. Cf. Bakker 2005: 119, 146–47; 2010: 162–63, showing that aorists in epic do not refer to a past event, but to an immediate event (the augment would have a deictic function). Applying this idea to the tablet, the ritual actions in the following lines would have the same immediacy as the νupsilonperispomeneν of the first line (you have just died, born, jumped, fallen). It is not a reference to a past ritual, but rather a performative aorist (cf. Faraone 1995: 14 n.42; differently Segal 1990: 414). The ritual symbola in the leaves with the verb in the aorist (as in the Eleusinian ones, cf. Clem. Alex. Protr. 2.15.3, 2.21.2) bring back the ritual action to the immediate present through their utterance. 51. Cf. Oedipus being addressed from Hades in the moment of his death (Soph. OC 1626–28, quoted infra). Riedweg 2011 reconstructs the structure of the poem (a katabasis of the soul) from which these hexameters would come. If initiation was a trial or an imitation of death, as Plutarch suggests (fr. 178 Sandbach with the phonetic / conceptual association τελετ  / τελευτ ), “this day” was that of initiation as much as the day of death. </page> <page sequence="19"> herrero: Emar Tode 53 afterlife: the new birth takes place in the timeless world of the dead and the gods. At the soteriological and funerary level, as Pindar’s “sweet day” did in a festival context, the Pelinna leaves make also this  μαρ one of the  ματα π ντα which characterize the immortality and eternity of the gods, to which now the dead initiate has been born 52. On the other hand, the first line of the tablets underlines the simultaneity of birth and death, saying that the day of death will be the day of birth to a new and true life: this is a riddle only for the initiated, just as the ritual allusions of the following lines. The solemn temporal deictic Aματι τ  δε appears here in a more ambiguous and dense sense than in the Homeric instances: the same expression which Homer uses to underline the moment of death (in the passages quoted above: Sokos, Hector, the coward in Poseidon’s malediction, the suitors) or birth (Heracles) is used here to mark the simultaneous happening of both things. One never finds in ordinary epic this kind of apparently contradictory statement, which belongs rather, as we shall see, to the realm of oracular poetry that only the select few can understand.53 The terminology is very similar to epic, but the senses differ widely. The  μαρ that seals human mortality in Homer will now make immortal the soul of the initiates. The tablets guarantee τιμ  and Kλβος through initiation, not through epic heroism or Hesiodic wisdom. While in the epics only some select few heroes— Menelaus, Helen, or Iphigenia—enjoy in the afterlife the blessed life of the gods, this is promised now to anybody who undergoes initiation. Although there are doubtless many post-Homeric beliefs in the tablets, it would be easy, but perhaps ungrounded, to conclude that the Pelinna leaves imitate Homer formally and innovate entirely on the sense of old epic formulas. Instead, if we adopt the idea that at least some hexameters in the leaves derive from earlier poetry concerned with heroic immortalization 54, a possible consequence would be that Homer and 52. The idea of paradise for the blessed souls in Pindar’s Olympian 2, often compared with the gold leaves and with Orphic conceptions, is “equal nights and equal days” (60–61). It is an image close to the life of the gods, who live  ματα π ντα without changes (%θ νατος κα+ %γ ρως). Cf. Grethlein 2010: 29–31. Plato transposes this ritual image to initiation into philosophy at Rep. 521 c. 53. The same juxtaposition of life and death is found in the Olbia Orphic bone tablets (Orph. Fragm. 463: β ος / θ νατος / β ος). Tragedy often exploits these kinds of paradoxes, sometimes concentrating them on “this day:” e.g., the enigmatic prophecy of Teiresias in Soph. OT 438, “this day gives you birth and kills you;” Eur. Med. 1245–50, IA 1612 (discussed below); cf. also Eur. frr. 638, 833 K. The same paradox is exploited for literary purposes in Anth. Graec. 7.638.3, for two brothers who are saved and die on the same day ( π9  ματι τ  δε: cf. Bowersock 1964). 54. Scholarship today tends to consider that the tablets reflect a later written stage of earlier oral poetry not derived from nor generally dependent on Homer: cf. Martin 2007, Faraone 2010, Herrero de Ja ́uregui 2011, Obbink 2011. The soul of the initiate is called “hero” (Orph. Fragm. 477.2: μεμνημ νος  ρως), who goes in “glory” (Orph. Fragm. 474.16: κλεινο ), and who “will reign over the other heroes” (Orph. Fragm. 476.11: κα+ τ τ9 !πειτ9 A[λλοισι μεθ9]  ρ@εσσιν %ν =ει[ς]): to be anax in the afterlife conveyed a blessed heroization in certain epic poetry. By contrast, later prose discourses about a happy afterlife use democratic images like proedria: Dem. 60.34, [Plut.] Consol. ad. Apoll. 120B, [Plat.] Axioch. 75 (373d). </page> <page sequence="20"> 54 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 his audience, when using the expression  ματι τ  δε, were probably conscious of its possible use to depict visions of immortality for at least some chosen heroes. Against this background, Homer’s choice to pointedly use “this day” in situations of death of a hero takes on a more precise relevance, since he avoids any reference to a better afterlife when depicting the death contexts examined above: his choice of a formula with funeral connotations would therefore be an expression of indifference to that tradition of immortalization “on this day 55.” The radical and irreversible change brought by the  μαρ may be, therefore, from mortal life to annihilation, but also to immortality among the gods. In tragedy, as we shall see, the majority of instances follow the Homeric example, but there are a few that seem to imply knowledge of this alternative tradition. 4. ORACLES AND HESIOD: PREDICTABLE DAYS Another type of religious poetry concerned with the deictic recognition of a day, which finds a Homeric echo in Agenor’s negative prophecy about the fall of Troy not taking place this day, is oracular poetry 56. “(On) this day” is likely to have been a common stock formula of oracular poetry, used whenever a seer would spot the present day as the precise moment to act. There are, however, no instances in oracles preserved from archaic and classical times.57 This absence is not surprising, since oracles from established sanctuaries, consulted in advance through a complicated process, refer to an imprecise and ambiguous future rather than to the immediate present and let the addressee discover by himself when that day would come (e.g., Hdt. 1.85.2:  ν  ματι %ν λβω ). Croesus’ famous consultation of several oracles about what he would be doing “on that precise day,” being a literary Herodotean anecdote rather than a historical fact, plays on that inability of established oracles to prophesize on the present day 58. However, 55. Other examples of this Homeric secular use of formulas and images elsewhere linked to a happy afterlife are Od. 11.483–91 in the Nekyia (in opposition to conceptions like that expressed in Orph. Fragm. 476.11, cf. previous note), or Priam’s trip to the Achaean camp to take Hector’s corpse, depicted as a katabasis (Herrero de Ja ́uregui 2011a). 56. As some scholars have shown, oracular poetry may have influenced epic, including some of the aforementioned passages: Moore 1921 discusses prophetic passages in epic, some of them with  μαρ: Il. 4.164; 6.448; 8.475; Od. 5.29ff. Cf. also Nieto Iba ́n ̃ez 1988, Ferna ́ndez Delgado 1991. Of course Homeric language must also have loomed large over oracular poetry, be it from official sanctuaries (cf. McLeod 1961 on the formular coincidences of Delphic poetry with Homer and Hesiod) or from less localized oracular poetic traditions like those of Musaeus or Bakis. 57. As we might expect, we find  ματι τ  δε in later oracular poetry: Max. Astrol. 6.171. The apocalyptic prophecies of Jews and Christians revived in the Sibylline Oracles the old deictic formulae with  μαρ to designate the Last Day, the dies ille (teste David cum Sibylla):  μαρ ( )κε1νο, 2.190, 3.55, 3.186, 3.206, 3.380, 3.675, 3.714, 3.779, 5.243, 5.248, 5.351, 8.151, 11.46, 11.240, 13.73, 14.277;  ματι τ  δε, 2.339, 5.56, 5.300. Cf. Lightfoot 2007: 481, 501–502. 58. Hdt. 1.46–49. On Croesus’ consultation, cf. Kindt 2006 with earlier bibliography. Preserved questions from Dodona often say “now and in the future” (e.g., SEG 15.402: αupsilonlenisτ κα κα+ -ς τ ν upsilonasperacuteστερον χρ νον, cf. Eidinow 2007: 110–11). Such formulations aim to ensure one’s life against </page> <page sequence="21"> herrero: Emar Tode 55 it is well known that the oracular recognition of favorable or unfavorable days “on the spot” was asked for in some important occasions 59. Whatever the actual practice, this was a fundamental element of myth, and as we shall see in tragedy (probably drawing on epic) a seer is often depicted as signaling “this day” as the day appointed by the gods. On the other hand, as a sort of handbook for predicting what specific days may bring, the last part of Hesiod’s Works and Days reveals the special nature of particular days in the human calendar so that men know which actions they should carry out or avoid on each one 60. In fact, a deictic expression, “these are the days” (αbδε  μ ραι ε-σ ), opens and closes this section (Op. 769, 822). This is not deixis ad oculos as that of the Homeric characters, but cata- and anaphoric, i.e. the means by which the poet points to the text itself. Also differently from Homer, days are in the plural number: here we do not find a single decisive day on which a definitive event takes place, but a cyclical succession of special days fixed in a predictable calendar. As in Homer, days come from Zeus and determine human destiny, but now they can be recognized with precision by the wise man through astronomical knowledge. Fully consistent with this conception, Hesiod seems to stress the point that  μαρ and  μ ρη (a deity born from Night in Theog. 124) are absolutely interchangeable: Op. 765 ( ματα δ9  κ Δι θεν) and 769 (αbδε γJρ  μ ραι ε-σ+ Δι ς παρα) are so close that the emphasis on equivalence seems to express the poet’s position vis a` vis a controversial subject, perhaps deliberately opposing a distinction such as that drawn in the Iliad: for Hesiod, the astronomical days perceived by mortals are the same as the ones ordered by the gods. After having described each type of day, he closes the poem with these lines: αbδε μ;ν  μ ραι ε-σ+ν  πιχθον οις μ γ9 KνειαρU αQ δ9 Aλλαι μετ δουποι, %κ ριοι, οupsilonlenisacute τι φ ρουσαι.

Op. 822–28 These days are a great boon for those on the earth. But the others are random, doomless, they bring nothing. One man praises one day, another another; but few know. the uncertain variations of human days: such “common religion” reflects worries that find a place in literary sources (Hdt. 1.32, discussed below). 59. Cf. Thuc. 7.50.4: the seers advise Nicias not to move his army because of a lunar eclipse. Cf. also Xenoph. Cyr. 3.3.34, quoted below. 60. Although Fra ̈nkel 1955: 18–19 among others considered Hesiod’s Days pure “superstition,” and despite ancient and modern suspicions on the authenticity of this section, this attempt to organize into a cyclic system the important days so that the man who knows them may attain happiness is consistent and organically linked to the rest of the work: cf. Lardinois 1998. </page> <page sequence="22"> 56 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 One time one day is a mother-in-law, another time a mother. Happy and blessed is he who knows all these things and does his work without giving offense to the immortals, distinguishing the birds and avoiding trespasses. trans. G. Most Few are able to recognize what each day brings, but in this recognition lies the secret of human happiness: it is only possible to be Kλβιος, not through initiation as in the Pelinna tablets, but through the knowledge transmitted by a wise man like Hesiod, who knows the divine ordination of the days, predictable and regular. On the other hand, this cyclic conception of human days is opposed to the heroic conception of one decisive day that changes everything. As we shall see in Part 6, the idea of a plurality of special days instead of a single definitive day will have great success in its general terms, though it will be also criticized (Heraclitus fr. 57 and 106 DK) or modified: Herodotus’ Solon says that there are many different days in human life, many of which can be crucial and bring radical changes, but he denies that they can be predicted or controlled. However, the Hesiodic idea of mastering some more or less scientific technique for knowing in advance the special nature of some human days will never cease to be present in the Greek tradition, and not only in astrological literature. More importantly, spotting the “critical day” of an illness is a fundamental principle of Hippocratic medicine: it is not strange that the only parallels for the expression αbδε αQ  μ ραι of the Works and Days are found in medical texts, referring ana- and cataphorically to the critical days that can be predicted in the treatment of illnesses 61. The notion of critical days where health or illness is decided is clearly parallel to the climactic days of tragedy that we shall presently examine.62 But the idea that they can be categorized and predicted by human wisdom, because they respond to some fixed principles, is the principle underlying Hesiod’s Days. 5. TRAGEDY: THE DAY OF LIFE OR/AND DEATH All these poetic traditions have their echoes in (and are reshaped by) fifth- century Athenian tragedy, the genre par excellence of the climactic day. Beginning one’s treatment of tragedy with Aristotle’s Poetics is now out of fashion, but this is one of the few issues where his judgment is still shared by modern scholarship and supported by the preserved evidence: when he said that everything should happen on the scope of one turn of the sun (1449b13), he was acknowledging 61. E.g., Hippocr. De ae ̈re aquis et locis 11, 5; Galen In Hippocratis de victu acutorum commentaria iv (Ku ̈hn 15, 821, 11). The important presence of the word καιρ ς, often in the plural, in the corpus of medical literature is related to the same belief in critical days (cf. Tre ́de ́ 1992: 46–47, 181–82). 62. Cf. Kosak 2004: 87–88 for some parallels between medical writings and tragedy (specially Orestes) around the critical days which decide death or salvation. On the relation between tragedy and Hippocratic medicine, cf. also Jouanna 1987 and Guardasole 2000. </page> <page sequence="23"> herrero: Emar Tode 57 a topos of tragedy on which much modern literature has also dwelt, the one- day duration of the events in each tragic piece.63 The dramatic concentration on a single day is of course much more than a formal feature: the two elements which Aristotle points out (1452a 15–35) as main components of the tragic action, i.e. peripeteia (the changing of the events into their contrary) and anagnorisis (changing from ignorance to knowledge), take place on a specific day which is seldom chosen at random. Another Aristotelian rule, that the events, although surprising if possible, must not seem to happen by pure chance but by some pre- ordination (1452a1–10), is fully consistent with the ideas of unavoidable destiny and divine determination of human affairs which we have seen associated with the mentions of Homeric  μαρ. The prototypical plot of many tragedies (e.g., Trachiniae) is precisely determined by an oracle that must find fulfillment at some point, and the characters, more or less slowly, recognize that the present day—the day of the performance—is that announced by the oracle. This is not the place to dwell again on the complexities of tragic time 64. I will restrict myself to tracing the contexts and usages of the deictic expression “this day” in order to observe how tragedy inherits and expands the poetic traditions we have examined. This section collects all tragic passages with the poetic  μαρ or the current  μ ρα modified by the deictic pronoun τ δε /  δε. There are 52 cases in preserved tragedies: three in Aeschylus (Ag. 320, 1301; Sept. 21); thirteen in Sophocles (Aj. 753, 756, 778, 1362; OT 438, 1157, 1282, 1285; Trach. 740; El. 106, 674, 783; OC 1612); and the rest in Euripides (Alc. 20, 27, 105, 232, 513; Med. 340, 375, 1231, 1248;Heraclid. 788;Hipp. 22, 726, 889–90;Andr. 803;Hec. 44; Suppl. 731; Ion 420, 1354; Hel. 879, 1420; Phoen. 1263, 1579, 1583; Or. 39, 48, 422, 440, 858, 948, 1035; IA 1599, 1612; Rhes. 464; Phaethon 117, Phrixus (a) 1, and fr. P10.25 Mu ̈ller of Philoctetes; and one in the satyric play Cycl. 437). The word  μαρ appears in one third of instances, more often in lyrical passages than in dialogical ones, but without any perceptible semantic difference from  μ ρα: both appear in all the contexts that we shall examine. Although limiting our list to “this day” means leaving out some synonymous expressions (e.g., “the present light,” “the present time,” etc.) which might sometimes be functionally equivalent,65 the 63. The topic of “on one day” ( ν  μ ρα  μι` ) is stressed above all in Sophocles’ Electra: 1363, 1149; Soph. Ajax 131; Eur. Or. 656. Cf. the comments by Mastronarde 1994 on Eur. Phoen. 1689, and Tarrant 1976 on Sen. Ag. 626. The matter of the unity of time in a single day (which is sometimes spotted as “this day” by characters, but is expressed through a wider range of expressions) has been studied by Jakob 1982, Kerkhecker 1989, and Schwindt 1994; Henrichs 1995: 71–72 and 2009: 102–103 offers some of the passages of this section, as examples that in tragedy “tomorrow is always late.” Comments to specific passages relevant for our topic will be mentioned in the footnotes. 64. Cf. de Romilly 1968, Heuner 2001. Sophocles in particular pays special attention to time (cf. de Jong 2007, with bibliography in 275 n.2), and also to the diverse perceptions of the day, as we shall see (e.g., nn.75, 87). 65. Some examples in Schwindt’s Motivindex (1994: 188–200). Aeschylus particularly likes poetic synonyms for “day:” Ag. 766, κupsilonacuteριον μ λη  φ ος; Eu. 544, κupsilonacuteριον μ νει τ λος; Suppl. 732, χρ νω  τοι κυρ ω  τ9  ν  μ ρα .

A reference to “this day” serves primarily to underline the time-setting of the action, to localize the moment of the peripeteia in which a tragic char- acter finds himself. It is typical to find the expression in prologues or initial speeches: in Euripides’ Orestes pκτον τ δ9  μαρ (39, 422) explains the temporal setting of the tragedy six days after Clytemnestra’s murder; in the first version of Phrixos Athamas starts the piece saying, “if this were the first day of my sorrows” (fr. 818c Kannicht: ε- μ;ν τ δ9  μαρ πρ τον  ν κακουμ νω ), im- plying that he has been suffering for a long time; Euripides’ Phaethon starts with a herald announcing that the king has ordered that the wedding of his son Phaethon will take place “on this day” (117 τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα ).66 However, in tragedy this mythical day coincides with the day of the performance be- fore the audience. The aforementioned blending of the mythical and ritual day functions here for dramatic purposes. Not only for the characters, but also for the spectators, the action is taking place on the present day, when it is be- ing represented. When in Ajax (1362–63) Agamemnon warns Odysseus that by burying his former enemy “you will make us appear as cowards on this day (τ  δε θ μ ρα )” and Odysseus answers “on the contrary, we will be just men for all the Greeks,” they refer both to their mythical contemporaries and to the Greeks of classical times, including also all the generations in between. “This day” is that of the burial of Ajax in illo tempore, and also that of the tragic performance. Besides, as we have seen, the deictic expression “this day” in poetry had a marked ritual performative sense which is also present when uttered by tragic characters. It cannot be mere chance that the unmarked adverb σ μερον, which could perfectly fulfill a basic time-setting function, is almost completely absent from classical tragedy 67. In the tragic genre, as in previous poetic traditions, the “day” ( μαρ and  μ ρα) is heavily loaded with the notion of destiny. The deictic expression, therefore, adds more than just emphasis, as it is shown by the comparison with the instances of “this night,” whose function is instead and Euripides’ Ion. Cf. instead n.78 for a contrast in Oedipus at Colonus between καθ9  μ ραν τ&amp;ν νupsilonperispomeneν (3) and τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα  (1612). 66. In two cases, the expression refers to a past or future crucial day that is given subjective reality in the present through the proximal deictic (Ruijgh 2006: 152–55): in Soph. OT 1157 the shepherd uses it for the day in the past which he revives (3λ σθαι δ9 xφελον τ  δ9  μ ρα ) and Oedipus’ answer to the shepherd (1158 ε-ς τ δ9  =εις) makes the threat of dying actual; in Eur. Rhes. 465 (ε- γJρ  γF τ δε γ9  μαρ ε-σ δοιμι) it expresses an uncertain wish for the future (cf. n.71 infra). 67. There are no cases of σ μερον in Aeschylus or Sophocles; in Euripides the word is found only in a conjecture to fr. 698 Kannicht (δε1 γ ρ με δ =αι πτωχ ν [ε0ναι τ μερον]) and Rhesus 683 (θαν ι γJρ σ μερον δρ σας κακ ς), a death-prophecy addressed by the chorus to Odysseus which is not accomplished: cf. n.85. </page> <page sequence="25"> herrero: Emar Tode 59 mere time-setting 68. Not only do we sometimes find tragic characters using “this day” in ritual contexts such as prayers, oaths, curses, decrees, and oracles, in consistence with the traditional usages previously examined; 69 its ritual value as a performative speech-act also looms over the whole tragic performance, even when it is not uttered in specifically ritual circumstances. It emphasizes the certain accomplishment of the dramatic action, so that when a character says it, not only the direct addressees, but also the audience, can be sure that the utterance is absolutely true (except in the few cases, as we shall see, of tragic deception, where a character is intentionally misled) 70. In the overwhelming majority of instances “this day” appears in depictions of a climactic situation of life or death which resolves in one sense or other the tragic peripeteia. The terms of the turning (μεταβολ ), as Aristotle said (1452b 22), are always supreme, irreversible, and bipolar: life and happiness on the one side (A), sorrow, ruin and death on the other side (B). We can distinguish four different types of combination of the two poles: A or B, from A to B, from B to A, A and B. Let us examine the cases of “this day” in this order: life or death Sometimes, in order to attain dramatic suspense, there is real uncertainty about which way the day will go: it may bring life or death. Thus in Euripides’ Orestes the decisive day on which the two matricides will be judged is the day of condemnation and death or of absolution and life for them, and it is over- emphasized not only with the deictic, but with the adjective κupsilonacuteριος: (48: κυρ α δ9  δ9  μ ρα; 440 τ  δ9  μ ραι; 1035 τ δ9  μαρ  μ1ν κupsilonacuteριον). Also in Ajax the seer Calchas insists that “this day” (753, with overabundant deixis: κατ9  μαρ τοupsilonlenisμφαν;ς τ  νupsilonperispomeneν τ δε; 756, 778 τ  δε θ μ ρα ) is decisive, either to save Ajax or to bring his death, since Athena’s wrath will only last for the present day 71. In Orestes the day turns out to be happy, after many events, while in Ajax it is fateful. 68. Soph. Ant. 16, Aj. 21, 209, 141; El. 644; Eur. El. 90, Rhes. 146, 600, 727. In most cases (except of course in Rhesus) “this night” is said during the day referring to the previous night, which shows that it is informative, rather than performative. 69. Decrees in Eur. Or. 858, 948; Phaet. 117 (fr. 774 K); curse: Eur. Hipp. 889–90; vow: Eur. Philoct. P10; oracular utterances: Soph. Aj. 756; OT 438; Eur. IA 1599, Hel. 879. The three cases in Aristophanic comedy where “this day” is uttered are precisely “serious” moments which resemble the climactic days of tragedy: Pax 435 (a prayer to the gods: σπ νδοντες εupsilonlenisχ μεσθα τ&amp;ν νupsilonperispomeneν  μ ραν), Av. 1072 (a public decree: τ  δε μ ντοι θ μ ρα  μ λιστ9  παναγορεupsilonacuteεται), Thesm. 76 (a life-or-death judgment: τ  δε θ μ ρα  κριθ σεται ε2τ9 !στ9 !τι ζ ν ε2τ9 %π λωλ9 Εupsilonlenisριπ δης). Comedy generally prefers οupsilonasperperispomeneτος instead of  δε, more common in tragedy. 70. Heuner 2006 on dramatic words as speech acts which always produce effect. For cases of tragic decepcion, cf. Soph. Electra 674, 783, or fr. 1111 Mu ̈ller of Euripides’ Philoctetes, discussed below. The aforementioned Homeric passages of Agamemnon misled by Zeus or Achilles by Apollo about taking Troy on this day are related to this deception by the gods (also, though in a different level, the anthropomorphic Zeus misled by Hera). 71.

Kosak 2004: 187–88. </page> <page sequence="26"> 60 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 from life to death (or vice versa) Besides these cases of suspense, however, the phrase “this day” refers to what has just happened, as it is recognized and described immediately afterwards by some characters. In a few cases the decisive day changes the destiny of an individual for the better (similarly to the Homeric  λεupsilonacuteθερον and ν στιμον  μαρ). Such a “day of happiness” appears in Heraclidae 788: “this day has made you happy ( δε σ 9  μ ρα δι@λβισεν):72 I will free you because of your news!” Similarly, in Ion 1354 Ion sings “oh happy day” when he recognizes his father (5 μακαρ α μοι φασμ των  δ9  μ ρα).73 And such would also be the day longed for in the only appearance of this expression in satyr-drama, Cyclops 437: “if I could see this day” (ε- γJρ τ νδ9 2δοιμεν  μ ραν), i.e., the day of liberation from the Cyclops. However, as can be naturally expected, in the gloomy world of tragedy the turning point for the heroes is in most cases from a happy life to extreme suffering. In a paradigmatic passage ofOedipus Rex, a messenger says of Oedipus and Iocaste (1282–85): “the old happiness of their ancestral fortune was once justly earned happiness (Kλβος δικα ως). But now on this day (τ  δε θ μ ρα ) lamentation, ruin, death, shame, and every earthly ill that anyone could name are all theirs.” Oedipus’ terrible fate is particularly emphasized in different tragedies as being dramatically accomplished on a particular crucial day. In Euripides’ Phoenissae Antigone says (1579–83): “the god who fulfills these sorrows has brought them all together on this day ( ν Aματι τ  δε) for our house;” and the chorus repeats: “this day (τ δ9  μαρ) is the beginning of many troubles to the house of Oedipus 74.” The present day as the point when fortune becomes disgrace is so common in tragedy that it is almost a topos to find the iambic cluster τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα  associated with statements or announcements of immediate death: in Trachiniae 740 Hyllus tells Deianira that she has killed Heracles “on this day;”75 in Phoenissae 1263 Jocasta is warned by a messenger how much she will suffer if both her sons 72. Such is Diggle’s convincing conjecture (1994: 54, accepted by Allan 2001 ad loc.) instead of the manuscript †δι λασενy. He gives as parallels Ph. 1689, Hec. 285, where the day is also linked with olbos. 73. A similar expression appears in Ion 562: YΙων.  μ ρα θ9   νupsilonperispomeneν παροupsilonperispomeneσα. zο. μακ ρι ν γ9 !θηκ  με. 74. Oedipus is the paradigmatic figure for whom one single day changes all, as shown also in Euripides’ Oedipus (fr. 549 Kannicht): %λλ9  μαρ &lt;pν&gt; τοι μεταβολJς !χει. Cf. n.79 on Oedipus’ day. 75. Trachiniae is a prominent example that equivalent expressions may function similarly to the “on this day” formula: the action that unfolds on the human level has been predicted by an oracle from Zeus at Dodona, and Deianira announces that it will take place “in this time” (166 τ  δε τ   χρ νω ; 173–74 χρ νου τοupsilonperispomene νupsilonperispomeneν παρ ντος) and later Heracles recognizes that the oracle has been fulfilled “in the present time” (1169 χρ νω  τ   ζ ντι κα+ παρ ντι νupsilonperispomeneν). Fulfillment and recognition of a divine decree are constantly found in conjunction with “this day” expressions. Cf. Schwindt 1994: 51–54. </page> <page sequence="27"> herrero: Emar Tode 61 die “on this day”; when in Orestes the assembly of Argives condemns Orestes and Electra, they solemnly decree that they die “on this day” (858, 948); in Andromache 803 a nurse laments how “on this day” one ill comes after another; and in Medea 1231 the chorus acknowledges: “the god brought on this day many sorrows.” There will still be one more sorrow before the day finishes, for a few lines later Medea tells herself: λ β9, pρπε πρ ς βαλβ1δα λυπηρJν β ου, κα+ μ&amp; κακισθ ις μηδ9 %ναμνησθ ις τ κνων, jς φ λταθ9, jς !τικτες, %λλJ τ νδε γε λαθοupsilonperispomene βραχε1αν  μ ραν πα δων σ θεν κAπειτα θρ νειU κα+ γJρ ε- κτενε1ς σφ9,  μως φ λοι γ9 !φυσανU δυστυχ&amp;ς δ9  γF γυν . Eur. Medea, 1245–50 “Take it, step up your life’s painful starting-line. Do not weaken, do not remember your children, how you love them, how you gave them birth. Forget just for this short day your own children, and then you will bewail them: for even if you kill them, they were loved by you. Unfortunate woman I am!” Medea stops being mother on this short but irreversible day, which determines her children’s death and her own life hereafter: her motherly love and birth of her children are prominently mentioned just before their murder. This is due not just to Euripides’ taste for rhetorical plays, but also to the fact that on this day an abrupt transition between extreme poles take place: Medea stops being a loving mother, and on killing her children she starts a new life of mourning. The painful day is equated through metaphor to a βαλβ+ς λυπηρ 76. As in the previous cases, the utterance “on this day” shows the recognition of the immediate arrival of death. The insistence on “this day” is particularly relevant in the tragic depictions of death as a process. In Alcestis we are constantly reminded that the action is set on the supreme day when she will die, with and without the reinforcing adjective kyrion. Apollo says in the prologue: “She is now on the point of death, for it is on this day that she is fated to die and leave life” (20–21 ψυχορραγοupsilonperispomeneσανU τ  δε γ ρ σφ9  ν  μ ρα  / θανε1ν π πρωται κα+ μεταστ ναι β ου); “Death is about to take her down to the house of Hades. He has arrived punctually, watching for this day when she must die” (27 φρουρ ν τ δ9  μαρ {  θανε1ν αupsilonlenisτ&amp;ν χρε@ν). 76. As Mastronarde 2002: 362 points out, the βαλβ δεςwere grooves in the stone starting blocks of the ancient stadium, and were usually starting points and occasionally goals. Like the “day,” it marks both accomplishment of the past stage and the start of a radically new one, and it receives the epithet that characterizes the new one (compare δοupsilonperispomeneλιον  μαρ). The poetic metaphor is built over the conceptual one, in cognitive terminology (Lakoff and Turner 1989). </page> <page sequence="28"> 62 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 In 105–107 the semi-choruses maintain the following dialogue: “A: And yet this is the fated day . . . (τ δε κupsilonacuteριον  μαρ) B: What is this you say?77 A: . . . when she must go beneath the earth.” Leaving aside other similar expressions (147 πεπρωμ νη γJρ  μ ρα βι ζεται, 158–59  μ ραν τ&amp;ν κυρ αν  κουσαν) uttered by the servant who, to describe the process of Alcestis’ agony, says that she is “living and dying” (141 ζ σαν κα+ θανοupsilonperispomeneσαν), we find again the deictic formula in the choir’s admonition to Admetus (232): “you will see your wife dead on this day” ( ν Aματι τ  δε); and then, when greeting Heracles, Admetus says (513): “I am going to bury a deceased on this day” ( ν τ  δ9  μ ρα ). The death of Alcestis has been constantly marked by the mention of “this day” throughout the first part of the play. With a less pessimistic tone, one of the most carefully described death processes in tragedy is in Sophocles’ Oedipus at Colonus, when the old king announces to his daughters his departure from life in order to become a venerated hero in the underworld. He begins with these words: “no longer on this day do you have a father” (1612 οupsilonlenisκ !στ9 !θ9 upsilonasperμ1ν τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα  πατ ρ). The tone of funerary formula of Oedipus’ words is clear: he is dying as he says it 78. As in the Alcestis, the expression “on this day” in such funerary contexts reminds us of Hector’s false death in the Iliad and of the Pelinna tablets. However, the Sophoclean heroized Oedipus does not envisage a gloomy destiny in Hades like the Homeric heroes (or like Alcestis), nor a happy afterlife coming together with death like the soul of the leaves. Oedipus’ status will be that of a protective hero, and at least he will no longer suffer the pains of his present life. The same funerary formula can be found along very different expectations, for it is used to mark the irreversible transition to a radically new state, be it worse, better, or just different. life and death Finally, in some cases life or death are not mutually exclusive possibilities, and instead of playing with the pathos of the transition from one to another, or the suspense of either one or the other, the tragedians prefer to exploit the contiguity of life and death on the decisive day to achieve paradox and sur- prise. In these cases the expression has an obviously enigmatic tone, which only those who understand oracles can interpret. Thus in Oedipus Rex the seer Teiresias utters the sententious line (438): “this day will give you birth and will destroy you” ( δ9  μ ρα φupsilonacuteσει σε κα+ διαφθερε1) which Oedipus fails to 77. The answer of the B semi-chorus is metrically problematic and the text is probably slightly corrupt (†τ  τ δ9 αupsilonlenisδ`ις;†). Cf. Parker 2007: 77–78 (who sends the reader to the introduction p. xiii for the concept for the appointed day, but treats it nowhere). The deictic τ δε in the answer of semi-chorus B may precisely refer to the previous τ δε κupsilonacuteριον  μαρ. 78. Hutchinson 1999: 59–60 shows that this phrase marks the perfective aspect of accomplished time with which the piece concludes, in opposition to the initial καθ9  μ ραν τ&amp;ν νupsilonperispomeneν (3) which describes Oedipus’ ceaseless wandering, i.e. the imperfective aspect. </page> <page sequence="29"> herrero: Emar Tode 63 understand.79 Life and death are not here exclusive options but they happen (metaphorically) together—although the order life-death gives a pessimistic tone to the paradox. By contrast, in a (post-Euripidean) utterance a divinely inspired messenger at the end of the Iphigenia in Aulis (1610–12) speaks of “this day” when mentioning the possibility of dying and living simultaneously: “the things of the gods are unexpected for mortals: and those whom they love, they keep safe; for this day has seen your daughter dead and living” ( μαρ γJρ τ δε / θανοupsilonperispomeneσαν ε0δε κα+ βλ πουσαν πα1δα σ ν).80 This double-edged decisive day, supported by the will of the gods, radically departs from the other tragic cases. The order dying-living, contrary to the fateful paradox heard by Oedipus in OT 438 or to the gloomy description of Alcestis’ agony in Alc. 141, gives a markedly optimistic tone to the sentence with the usually sinister  μαρ τ δε. This transitional day is for Iphigenia the beginning of the life with the gods. This is of a piece with the enigmatic and purposefully paradoxical expressions of immortality found in the Pelinna gold tablets. speakers and listeners As in epic, the solemn utterance “(on) this day” presupposes authority on the part of the speaker, who is full of confidence about knowing what is happening or will happen. However, this authoritative knowledge is problematized in tragedy. In Agamemnon 279–354 Clytemnestra tells the skeptical chorus that Troy has been taken on the previous night and concludes with a self-confident “on this day the Achaeans have Troy” (320 Τρο αν Α6 χαιο+ τ  δ9 !χουσ 9  ν  μ ρα ), based on the fire she has seen, which is carefully contrasted in the next line (ο0μαι) with her supposition of how Greeks and Trojans are feeling after the fall of the city. Her words partially persuade the chorus, which nonetheless remains not completely convinced, since the news is just based on flames and woman’s words—both shaky proofs.81 The difference between divine and human speakers and listeners, between the knowledge of the audience and the knowledge of the characters, is a key element in many of these passages. The gods (and god-inspired speakers like seers) utter the phrase “this day” with exact knowledge of what it carries, and the audience un- 79. In response Oedipus complains that the seer always speaks in obscure riddles (438 jς π ντ9 Aγαν α-νικτJ κ%σαφ  λ γεις). Cf. Kamerbeek 1965: 36–37. This line is probably echoed in Phoen. 1689 |ν  μ ρ μ9 xλβισ 9, |ν δ9 %π@λεσεν. While Sophocles’ line refers probably to the present day when Oedipus is learning the truth, Euripides’ line seems to point to the day in which he was given to the shepherd. In Oedipus’ tale there is an overlapping of two decisive days: Oedipus recognizes on this day that the crucial day was long ago. Also the shepherd revives the past day by saying “this day” (OT 1157, cf. n.66) 80. These lines (which violate Porson’s law, as an anonymous reader kindly points out), and the entire messenger’s speech, are generally suspected to be a later addition to the play, perhaps by actors. A later authorship is perhaps the cause of the difference from the other tragic instances. 81. Cf. Aesch. Ag. 475–87. Clytemnestra had begun her speech adducing Hephaestus (281, a metonymy for fire rather than the god reified) and ended it (316) putting her husband as source. </page> <page sequence="30"> 64 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 derstands it as such. Among the aforementioned passages, for instance, Apollo in Alcestis, the seer Calchas in Ajax, or Teiresias in Oedipus Rex say “this day” with absolute certainty about what it brings. In other passages the same assurance is also associated with divine knowledge: in Euripides’Helen (879) the seer Theano says prophetically that on this day (τ  δ9  ν  ματι) a discussion between the gods is being held. In Iphigenia in Aulis (1599) Calchas urges the departure of the Greek ships just after the sacrifice of the deer, since they must leave “on this day” ( μ ρα  τ  δε). In the climactic moment of Hippolytus (889–90) Theseus asks Poseidon to fulfill one of his three curses against Hippolytus, so that “he does not escape this day” ( μ ραν δ; μ&amp; φupsilonacuteγοι τ νδε): the audience know as well as Theseus himself that the curse will certainly be accomplished. Also in Agamemnon (1301) Cassandra, urged to flee by the chorus, says with the clear-mindedness of the seer, “this day has come: I will gain little by fleeing” ( κει τ δ9  μαρU σμικρJ κερδαν  φυγ  ). As the audience must have understood, these two all-resounding words are much more than an emphatic expression for “today”: they recognize the immediate coming of an unavoidable destiny. They are, therefore, particularly appropriate on the lips of someone who knows the will of the gods and anticipates what they intend for this day. Also from the timeless perspective of the dead, like from that of the gods, the days of mortals, past or future, are all the same and can be viewed in the same way: dying Oedipus in OC 1612 is, as we saw, much more clear-minded about his own destiny than when he lived, since dying people, due to their proximity to the next world, were thought to be able to prophesy with great accuracy 82. Likewise, a ghost coming from Hades like Polydorus in Hecuba can have no doubt about what will happen “on this day,” namely the pre- determined death of his sister:   πεπρωμ νη δ9 Aγει / θανε1ν %δελφ&amp;ν τ  δ9  μ&amp;ν  ν  ματι (44–45). The audience knows that these words have the force of divine knowledge and can only be true, but tragedy plays on the fact that the characters have not heard (or understood) this divinely inspired speech-act. At the beginning of Hippolytus the goddess Aphrodite herself says she “will punish Hippolytus on this day” (22:  ν τ  δ9  μ ρα ). However, only much later in the same play (726) does Phaedra acknowledge that by dying “on this day” (τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα ) she pleases Aphrodite. After the events the crucial day and the divine will behind it are easily recognizable, as the chorus of Euripides’ Suppliants says: “now I believe in the gods, after seeing this unexpected day” (731–32 νupsilonperispomeneν τ νδ9 Aελπτον  μ ραν -δοupsilonperispomeneσ 9  γF θεοupsilongraveς νομ ζω). Only when mortals “see what happens” do they get to know their destiny, as the chorus famously says at the conclusion of Ajax (1417–20). Therefore, unless enlightened by the gods, they are always at the risk of mistaking the crucial day or recognizing it too late. When Teiresias 82. e.g., dying Hector in the Iliad predicted Achilles’ death as Zeus predicts Patroclus’, with an expression,  ματι τ  ,  τε. . ., used everywhere else for past events (cf. n.1). A later Platonizing explanation is found in Plut. Def. Orac. 432C. </page> <page sequence="31"> herrero: Emar Tode 65 in OT 438 utters the enigmatic paradox of the day that gives birth and destroys, Oedipus, once famous for his insight with riddles, is now unable to decipher it and persists in error. Likewise, the audience can expect that when Medea asks to stay “this one day” (Med. 340 μ αν με με1ναι τ νδ9 !ασον  μ ραν), this will bring deadly consequences. But Creon does not fully acknowledge the implication of her words, although he suspects he might be making a mistake, and grants permission to her 83. Some lines later (373–75), after Creon has left, she explains what she has in mind: “he allowed me to stay for this day, in which I will kill my three enemies” (τ νδ9  φ κεν  μ ραν / με1να  μ’,  ν    τρε1ς τ ν  μ ν  χθρ ν νεκροupsilongraveς / θ σω). The public knows everything, sharing the omniscient perspective of the gods, but Creon will only learn too late, although he had heard, but not listened to, the fateful words. This double level of understanding of the expression “this day” is the probable explanation of the much-discussed lines of Euripides’ Helen, where Helen and Theoclymenus hold the following dialogue (1420–23): H: This day ( δ9  μ ρα) will show my gratitude to you. Th: The state of the dead is nothingness; toil for them is vain. H: There is something of what I say both there and here (!στιν τι κ%κε1 κ%νθ δ9 {ν  γF λ γω). Th: You will not find in me a husband at all inferior to Menelaus. Although Helen is referring ironically to what is really going to happen on this day (her escaping from Egypt with Menelaus), Theoclymenus takes the deictic expression—understandably enough after the funerary connotations that we have seen—first as a reminder ofMenelaus’ death whose fake funeral is planned for that day, and then as the announcement of their wedding. He clumsily tries to comfort Helen, who in fact has other plans, as is shown in her ambiguous answer in 1422. Tragic irony is achieved because of the multiple possibilities of the expression “this day” uttered by Helen, which must have been clear for a large part of the audience: deadly in many contexts, it can be a day of life and freedom if such is the divine will, which Helen knows and Theoclymenus does not.84 Precisely because of the danger of mistaking the crucial day, mortals should be cautious when speaking about it. The following utterance from the lips of Eteocles at the beginning of Aeschylus’ Septem shows prudent mortal uncertainty about when divine will might change: “until this day the god has protected us” 83. Eur. Med. 350 κα+ νupsilonperispomeneν oρ  μ;ν  =αμαρτ νων. There might be a phonetic word-play with  μ ρα and uμαρτ νω, as in Eur. Hipp. 21–22 } δ9 ε-ς !μ9  μ ρτηκε τιμωρ σομαι / &gt;Ιππ λυτον  ν τ  δ9  μ ρα . Perhaps the same word-play could be seen in Il. 13.824, where just before the aforementioned speech on  μ ρη  δε Hector calls Ajax uμαρτοεπ ς. On uμαρτ νειν τοupsilonperispomene καιροupsilonperispomene as “missing the convenient day,” cf. Tre ́de ́ 1992: 39, 195. 84. This supports Allan’s position (2008: 314) that these two verses are not a late interpolation, as previous critics thought, and explains the ambiguity of Helen’s expression: “what I have said” (i.e. “on this day,” cf. a similar case in n.77) may refer both to the next world and to this world. </page> <page sequence="32"> 66 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 (21 κα+ νupsilonperispomeneν μ;ν  ς τ δ9  μαρ εupsilonlenisperispomene V πει θε ς). In Ion (420) Xouthos wishes “this day” to be propitious for receiving the oracles of the god: βοupsilonacuteλομαι δ9  ν  μ ρα  / τ  δ’ (α-σ α γ ρ) θεοupsilonperispomene λαβε1ν μαντεupsilonacuteματα. Similarly the chorus in Rhesus hopes that the Thracian leader has been sent by Zeus to kill Achilles and Ajax, and can only wish (in vain) “that I might see this day (465 ε- γJρ  γF τ δε γ9  μαρ ε-σ δοιμι) on which you would take vengeance on them. 85” The prudence of these proclamations seems akin to the conditional utterances of Sokos or Hector in the Iliad, where they could only limit their prediction for the day to mere wishing. Instead, in Euripides’ Philoctetes, though preserved only in a prose para- phrase, there seems to be a scene of tragic deception with a playful twist around setting a condition in a vow for “this day,” whichmakes it lose its absolute strength. Philoctetes threatens Odysseus when he arrives in disguise: “it is not possible if you happen to be Greek that you do not die on this day (οupsilonlenis δυνατ ν, ε2περ cΕλλην ~ν τυγχ νεις, τ  μ&amp; %πολωλ ναι σε  ν τ  δε τ    μ ρα ).”86 Odysseus, however, persuades him that he is an enemy of the Greeks, and Philoctetes does not fulfill his threat. Although the condition was true, he is misled: his adynaton proves to be true and his vow about this day wrong. This example shows that in tragedy, differently from epic where Homer avoided any  ματι τ  δε which was not true, not only there is room for a blind ignorance (Oedipus) or misunderstanding (Creon, Theoclymenus) of the crucial day, but also for a mistaken assertion about its nature by fallible humans not inspired by the gods. The most elaborate example of the great opportunities for tragic irony offered by the fact that human characters may understand or utter “this day” erroneously in their mortal ignorance is Sophocles’ Electra, where the characters hold diverging interpretations of its meaning:87 Electra, who had started swearing not to stop lamenting as long as she “sees this day” (106 λεupsilonacuteσσω δ; τ δ9  μαρ),88 upon hearing of Orestes’ death, says she “is destroyed on this day” (674 Kλωλα τ  δ9  ν  μ ρα ). But this same day is greeted by Clytemnestra as the inverse transition from constant fear of death to a life at peace: “since on this 85. This weak hope of Rhesus 465 and the unaccomplished death-wish with σ μερον of 683 (cf. n.67), both uttered by the Trojan chorus, are similar (perhaps purposefully) to the weak and unaccomplished utterances by the Trojan heroes in the Iliad studied above—mere human hopes not strong enough to be speech-acts, as the audience knows. The whole passage (445–65) dwells on the irony of Rhesus mistaking the day. 86. This sentence is transmitted by Dio’s extract (59.5–8) of Euripides’ Philoctetes, and as Mu ̈ller 2000: 185, 365–66 argues convincingly, it was very probably in the original text (it is line 25 of his fr. P10, the second episode). 87. Linforth 1963 takes Electra’s obsession with her day as his starting point for his study of the play. Cf. also Hutchinson 1999: 52–58. As De Jong 2007: 275 says, Sophocles is particularly concerned with temporal issues. 88. Only in this case does τ δ9  μαρ not have the sense of “crucial day” (at least in Electra’s mind), but is rather comparable to the καθ9  μ ραν τ&amp;ν νupsilonperispomeneν of OC 3 which suggests a long series of identical days: just as in OC (cf. n.78), the initial utterance of “this day” in imperfective aspect is contrasted later in the play by other utterances in perfective aspect. </page> <page sequence="33"> herrero: Emar Tode 67 day I am rid of terror . . . I shall pass my days in peace” (78:  μ ρα  γJρ τ  δ9 %π λλαγμαι φ βου . . .  μερεupsilonacuteσομεν). However, both Electra and Clytemnestra are wrong in their assertions. More prudently, Chrysothemis expresses the hope that this day (919   δ; νupsilonperispomeneν . . .  μ ρα) will bring a change of fortune. In this play, only the audience knows the truth about “this day,” being in the privileged position of those who know the end of the story (i.e. the position of the gods), while the characters dwell in darkness. To sum up: the deictic  δε with  μαρ or  μ ρα (and sometimes other similar expressions) marks the moment of anagnorisis of the crucial day on which destiny is fulfilled. Such recognition of the present day in tragedy is, as the genre demands, evenmore important than in epic: not only is it muchmore frequent, but also, while in Homer “this day” was primarily found in the dative, as the time when some crucial event happened, in tragedy “this day” is often found in the nominative, as subject of the verb, as the agent that determines destiny. There are many echoes of the ritual usages of the expression “this day” in decrees, vows, oracles, and funerals, and there are even a couple of instances where, as in the Pelinna tablets, “this day” announces the entrance into the divine realm. However, as in Homer, there is no possibility, unless one is given privileged insight by the gods into the preappointed destiny, of controlling or previewing the crucial day through ritual or wisdom. The gods know / decide when it must come, too often bringing death and sorrow, and sometimes salvation (or even both). On most occasions the tragic hero will only recognize the decisive day when it has already come. 6. COMPETING CONCEPTIONS OF THE DAY(S) The poetic and ritual value of the deictic expression “this day” was by no means a fossil from archaic epic preserved only in tragedy. It is repeatedly found in public decrees which emphasize the sacrality and irrevocability of decisions taken by the polis. An Athenian of the fifth century bce says that the Plataeans will be considered Athenians “from this day” (%π  τ σδε τ ς  μ ρας).89 A fourth- century bce inscribed decree quoted by Aeschines said that the “representantives of the allies have given oaths to Philippus’ ambassadors on this day” (%ποδοupsilonperispomeneναι δ; τοupsilongraveς  ρκους  ν τ  δε τ    μ ρα ). Plato depicts the guardian of Socrates’ prison speaking that same official solemn language: “The Eleven imprison Socrates and decree that he must die on this day (τ  δε τ    μ ρα ).”90 So too, historians sometimes put the words  δε    μ ρα in the mouths of their characters for the sake of lending the epic and tragic resonances of an irre- 89. [Demosth.] = Apollodorus Neaer. 104. Although Canevaro 2010 has argued for the inauthenticity of this decree, even if it is a later interpolation the wording imitates public decrees of the fourth century (in page 352 he offers three examples). 90. Aesch. Ctes. 74; Plat. Phaed. 59e; a parody of this official language in Aristoph. Av. 1072, quoted in n.69. </page> <page sequence="34"> 68 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 versible all-changing day, as when Thucydides tells that the Spartan ambassador Melesippos, expelled from Athens, said these ominous words: “this day will be the beginning of great evils for the Greeks ( δε    μ ρα το1ς cΕλλησι μεγ λων κακ ν Aρ=ει).”91 Thucydides also reports a harangue of the Spartan Brasidas to the allied soldiers proclaiming that “on this day if you are brave you will receive freedom and the title of friends of Sparta, or you will be slaves of the Athenians 92.” The tragic option between two extreme irreversible poles lends great intensity to the military harangue, a genre always suitable to proclaim that le jour de gloire est arrive ́. Also Xenophon depicts in the Hellenica the Theban Leontiades telling Phoibidas: “on this day you can do great deeds for your own country 93.” In the Anabasis (1.5.16) Cyrus speaks dramatically to the Greeks: “Clearchus and Prox- enus and the other Greeks who are here, you don’t know what you are doing: for if you fight against each other, you must know that on this day you will destroy me and yourselves not long after me.” Cyrus appears also as a heroic and oracular character in the Cyropaedia (3.3.37), when on the day of the decisive battle, after having sacrificed early in the morning, he tells his men that the gods announce to the seers and to himself victory and salvation, and says, “keep in mind that this day will show what each of you is worth.” The similarity of these examples with the epic and tragic passages examined above is self-evident and demands little explanation. They show that the poetic conception of the decisive day that determines destiny ever after was much present in the collective imagination in classical times. However, it was by no means the only possible conception of the days of human life. In the Cyropaedia, in fact, Xenophon puts the following statement in the mouth of Cyrus, this time characterized as a wise man, and Tigranes: τοupsilonperispomeneτ9 οupsilonlenisperispomeneν, !φη, λ γεις jς κα+ o σ ς πατ&amp;ρ  ν τ  δε τ   μι`   μ ρα   = Aφρονος σ@φρων γεγ νηται; Π νυ μ;ν οupsilonlenisperispomeneν, !φη.

However, Aristophanes, like Thucydides (but perhaps also Melesippos himself), may be using a conventional poetic resource to mark the decisive point. Cf. Xen. Hell. 2.2.23 νομ ζοντες  κε νην τ&amp;ν  μ ραν τ   &gt;Ελλ δι Aρχειν τ ς  λευθερ ας. 92. Thuc. 5.9.9.6. Cf. Hdt. 6.109, with a similar use of νupsilonperispomeneν, repeated four times to depict a crucial time, the deliberation before the battle of Marathon (cf. Tre ́de ́ 1992: 200). 93. Xenoph. Hell. 5.2.26; cf. in Hell. 7.2.20 a similar expression with τ μερον. Instead, the rest of appearances of τ μερον in Xenophon have a weaker, unassertive sense: Anab. 1.9.26, 3.1.15, 4.6.8–9; Cyr. 7.1.10. </page> <page sequence="35"> herrero: Emar Tode 69 “Do you mean to say, then,” Cyrus answered, “that on this single day your father has become prudent when he was imprudent before?” “Yes, I do,” he said. “Then you are saying that prudence is an affection of the soul, as sorrow is, and not an acquisition. For I do not suppose that a man could instantly pass from being imprudent to being prudent, if indeed the one who is to be prudent must first have become wise. The distinction between π θημα and μ θημα situates the virtue of prudence in a separate sphere from the particular experience, pathein, which is the keystone of knowledge in tragedy and mystic initiation.94 Tigranes thinks that prudence belongs to this realm and that this day has brought a radical change. For Cyrus, instead, true inner changes come progressively out of learning, not out of a one-day external experience, no matter how strong it may have been. There is a similar discussion in the final part of Sophocles’ Electra—a play which, as we have seen, was particularly concerned with the understanding of the crucial day—between Electra and the pedagogue which shows that in this play tragic characters may not only understand differently (and mistakenly) what “this day” brings, but may also differ in their consideration of what a crucial day is: ΗΛ. χα1ρ9U 2σθι δ9 jς μ λιστ σ 9 %νθρ@πων  γF  χθηρα κ%φ λησ 9  ν  μ ρα  μι` .

As for the intervening causes, many nights and an equal number of days come round and round, which will reveal them to you clearly, Electra. Two opposingWeltanschauungen are at stake, focused on the centrality of one day. On the one hand, Electra’s simple conception that one single day concentrates two extreme poles (hate / love) and changes her inner self from one to another is typical of tragic heroes, who radicalize the epic thoughts about decisive days, and despise the conception of a long sequence of anonymous days: as Ajax says, “what joy is there in day following day (παρ9  μαρ  μ ρα), now advancing towards us, 94. Do ̈rrie 1956 argues persuasively that this passage is influenced by Gorgias’ ideas of pathos as irrational knowledge. Cf. Aesch. Ag. 177, 250 for the famous tragic identification of pathein and mathein. Aristotle. fr. 15 Rose said that initiates should not learn but experience and change their mind (τοupsilongraveς τελουμ νους οupsilonlenis μαθε1ν τι δε1 %λλJ παθε1ν κα+ διατεθ ναι): a gold tablet from Thurii (Orph. Fragm. 487.3) greets the deceased emphatically underlining that what matters is the experience of a single unique moment: “you have experienced the experience you never had experienced before” (χα1ρε παθFν τ  π θημα τ  δ9 οupsilonlenisacuteπω πρ σθ9  πεπ νθεις). </page> <page sequence="36"> 70 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 now drawing us back from the verge of death?” (Aj. 475–76). On the other hand, Electra’s pedagogue has a more down-to-earth opinion, close to Hesiod’s cyclical calendar: rather than one decisive day, in the course of human life there are many equal days (and nights, a pairing which minimizes the uniqueness of the day and underlines that all days are inserted in an ongoing temporal sequence). The pedagogue’s position seems akin, although not identical, to the common- sense viewpoint famously reflected in Solon’s calculations before Croesus, re- counted (with a greater or lesser degree of fiction) by Herodotus, about the 26,250 days in a life-span of 70 years, which conclude with the following statement: “one day brings things not similar at all to other days, so that, O Croesus, man is com- pletely subject to fortune” (  fτ ρη αupsilonlenisτ ων τ   fτ ρη   μ ρη  τ  παρ παν οupsilonlenisδ;ν  μοιον προσ γει πρ γμα.Οupsilonasperacuteτω 5ν, 5 Κρο1σε, π`ν  στι Aνθρωπος συμφορ ).95 This statement shares with tragedy the idea that a single day may change every- thing, and yet is very distant both from the Homeric notion of a unique irreversible day and from the Hesiodic calendar which assumes that one can predict the nature of the special days that come back in a cyclical way. Hesiod’s line of thought was, in its turn, famously criticized from a completely different angle by Heraclitus: the Ephesian said that Hesiod, when saying that there are good and bad days, “ignored the fact that the nature of every day is one” (%γνοοupsilonperispomeneντι φupsilonacuteσιν  μ ρας uπ σης μ αν οupsilonlenisperispomeneσαν).96 The same Hesiod who exhorted one to know the nature of the days is now explicitly accused of not knowing it. Heraclitus’ criticism, obscure as it is, denies also the idea of some days being more important than others, but not because each of them is different, as Solon would say, but because they are all the same. As in many other dimensions, in regard to the day(s) the traditional religious notions expressed by ancient poets were being undermined by critical thinkers of classical times. However, we should avoid baldly opposing “religious” visions where one or several days have special status with “philosophical” undermining of such ideas. For Solon (and Herodotus), what happened to men on each day depended 95. Hdt. 1.32: cf. Henrichs 2009: 100–101; Eidinow 2007: 10–13. Sophocles also gives voice to this notion in OC 617–19 μυρ ας o μυρ ος χρ νος τεκνοupsilonperispomeneται νupsilonacuteκτας  μ ρας τ9 -@ν. A similar idea of every day bringing a different fortune, although turned into hedonism instead of detachment, may be detected in Anacreon fr. 11.47: τ  σ μερον μ λει μοιU / τ  δ9 αupsilonlenisacuteριον τ ς ο0δεν; cf. also Theognis 159–60. 96. Fr. 106 DK, transmitted by Plutarch (Camill. 19) who expressly connects it to Hesiod’s distinction of good and bad days. Also Seneca translated Heraclitus’ sentence (Ep. 12.7.3): unus dies par omni est. The fragment has been related to fr. 57 DK: “Hesiod was the teacher of most, he who did not know Day and Night: for they are one ( μ ρην κα+ εupsilonlenisφρ νην οupsilonlenisκ  γ νωσκενU !στι γJρ pν).” He seems to refer to Theog. 124, where Day and Night are different deities, probably thinking of the nychthemeron of 24 hours (Kahn 1981: 108–10). I do not agree with the extended idea (Kirk 1962: 157–61) that fr. 106 is really a misunderstanding of fr. 57. Though Kahn 1981: 110 sees it unlikely that Heraclitus “turned to the conceptually less interesting contrast between lucky and unlucky days,” we are seeing that what the days bring was a matter of serious debate (cf. n.60 for a similar prejudice against Hesiod’s Days). Plutarch was surely right when interpreting Heraclitus in connexion to Op. 765–66. </page> <page sequence="37"> herrero: Emar Tode 71 ultimately on the divine designs, as Croesus’ tale shows. On the other hand, it was mentioned earlier how Hippocratic medicine gave new scientific grounds to the idea of critical days. There was much place for overlappings and intermediate possibilities. A famous passage from Plato’s Crito—a dialogue whose dramatic setting, like that of the Phaedo, is a crucial day for which “tomorrow” will be too late—contains a line from Homer reinterpreted as a journey, either to death or to immortality (44a): Socrates: I must die on the day after the ship comes in, must I not? Crito: So those say who have charge of these matters. S. Well, I think the ship will not come in today, but tomorrow. And my reason for this is a dream which I had a little while ago in the course of this night. And perhaps you let me sleep just at the right time. C. What was the dream? S. I dreamed that a beautiful, fair woman, clothed in white raiment, came to me and called me and said, “Socrates, ‘on the third day you would come to fertile Phthia ( ματ  κεν τριτ τω  Φθ ην  ρ βωλον bκοιο, cf. Il. 9.363).’” C. A strange dream, Socrates. S. No, a clear one, at any rate, I think, Crito. C. Too clear, apparently. But Socrates, listen. . . . The apparent clarity of the Homeric line—that Socrates will die on the third day— supposes the traditional notion that the  μαρ brings death with it. This is probably the way Crito takes it, although his later offer to take Socrates to Thessaly (where Achilles’ Phthia was situated) seems to indicate that the Homeric allusion has not been wholly lost on him. However, commentators have not failed to see that Socrates seems to take the line as an announcement that he is returning to his native fatherland, like Achilles, i.e. as an omen that his immortal soul will go back to her divine origin (playing with the etymology of Phthia, in connection with death). What for Crito is exile is for Socrates return from exile. It has been said that here Plato is influenced by Pythagorean interpretations of Homer, which may well have been the case.97 In any case, the expression “on this day” that we found in the Pelinna leaves is clearly close to Socrates’ hope in the Crito that the day of death will bring life with it.98 It is also a similar conception to that we found expressed at the end of Iphigenia in Aulis. Although very distant from the Homeric idea of what death and immortality mean, these texts seem to share 97. Detienne: 1962: 47–51. On this passage, cf. Kramer 1988; Harte 1999: 143–44; Stokes 2005: 32–35. 98. Although the evidence for localizing a particular emphasis on this sense of emar tode in Thessaly is scant, it is worth noticing that the two tablets with this formula were found in Pelinna; Alcestis, the tragedy which most emphasized the funerary connotations of “this day,” is set in Thessaly. Cic. De Div. 1.59 recounts the dream of Socrates and then that of Eudemus with the same message about the fatherland of the soul, which takes place in Pherae, Thessaly (where other tablets have been found, Orph. Fragm. 477, 493a and b). </page> <page sequence="38"> 72 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 with the heroic Weltanschauung the notion of one crucial irreversible day that determines the destiny of a man. Socrates’ idea, in this respect, seems closer to the world of epic and tragedy than to the visions represented by Solon (all days are different) or Heraclitus (all days are the same). 7. RECOGNIZING THE DAY The passages from Sophocles, Herodotus, Heraclitus, and Plato show that all these different conceptions of human life, in which ideas of destiny, of the divine, and of the cosmos were intermingled, were actively discussed through- out fifth-century Greece, and that referring to the day(s) of human life was not a mere literary topos, but often implied a marked ideological and reli- gious position. Although opposed by some, the different poetic traditions that we have examined relied heavily on the idea that some special days deter- mine the destiny of mortals, and shaped such conception in different ways: Homer and tragedy used the crucial days as looming over heroes who wait for them without any possibility of predicting them, while religious poetry aimed to control the special days through their ritual celebration. Therefore, while in the former poetic genres the general tone is somber and linked to death with few exceptions, in ritual it may be a “sweet day” that links the human with the divine. In any case, it is always a day that brings a radical change in respect to the previous situation, a change that affects the objective level of what happens and the subjective experience of how a mortal feels, thinks, and is. On the crucial day, therefore, opposed poles are present: life and death, hate and love, glory and ruin, happiness and sorrow. Epic poets and tragedians, or historians who imitate them, may depict a transition be- tween the poles, a radical alternative between one or the other, or even the simultaneous presence of both, achieving a paradoxical juxtaposition of op- posites which marks the day as unique. In all cases, the crucial day brings through the accomplishment of some action the end of a previous state and the beginning of another: it is effective achievement (τ λος) that marks the day as decisive. The absolute accomplishment of the events on the crucial day is due to its direct link with the divine. Gods, as is well known, are timeless because they live, deathless and ageless, through all days ( ματα π ντα). Once they are installed on Olympus, there are no irreversible moments for them. Instead, they have the power over the crucial days for mortals, or at least they know which days are preappointed by fate for them. All the poetic forms of envisioning these crucial days, be it Homer, Hesiod, or tragedy, share the perception that the days that determine human destiny come from the gods. In the examined passages, gods are prominent as those who directly bring the crucial day, or announce it, or inspire in mortals the perception of its arrival. The emphatic utterance “this day” solemnly marks the accomplishment of what is being said in accordance with the approving </page> <page sequence="39"> herrero: Emar Tode 73 will of the gods. Furthermore, in ritual contexts there may be a link between the timeless realm of the gods and human time on a special day which introduces mortals to a new dimension. Access to the divine perception of the appointed time is, therefore, the key element in recognizing the arrival of the crucial day. While other recognitions of due occasions like spotting the kairosmay dependmore on human intelligence and insight, “this day” is uttered with full conviction precisely when it is supported by divine inspiration. The texts we have examined sustain a sort of elitist discourse that distinguishes those who understand the nature of the days from the ignorant. Solon and Heraclitus, each in his own way, would also call ignorant those who do not see the impossibility of recognizing any crucial days, either because they are all different or because they are all the same. Poets, instead, differentiate between those who, enlightened by the gods, recognize the decisive days and those who do not: Hesiod explains the predictable cycle of the “Days from Zeus” and ends up saying, “Happy and blessed is he who knows all these things / and does his work without giving offense to the immortals.” Religious poets, on the other hand, claimed divine inspiration to recognize the crucial day in time in different ways, be it through an oracle that promises fulfilment, or through an initiation that prepares for the decisive moment of death, whenever it arrives: ritual is, like Hesiod’s calendar, an instrument to control the crucial days by establishing a link to the divine, by uniting in the performance the time of myth (past and/or future) with the present time. For Homer, instead, ability to discern the decisive day depends wholly on the arbitrary will of the gods, who enlighten some mortals like Odysseus and blind others like Agamemnon. Tragedy will radicalize the epic discourse and make a sharp distinction between characters who know the crucial day through divine inspiration and those who only end up recognizing it when it is too late. The dangers of not recognizing the crucial day or mistaking its final outcome are much present in the minds of the poets, of their characters, and of the audience. Deception by other mortals or even by the gods is so real a possibility that Agamemnon even depicts an anthropomorphic Zeus as suffering deception from Hera in Iliad 14. To avoid imprudent speech-acts which would not be fulfilled, the speakers generally avoid using “this day” as standard expression when they have no divine inspiration: if they are not sure about the inevitability of their assertion, they generally modify the time-setting expression. Perhaps in Homer there is a lexical distinction between the divine and irrevocable  μαρ and the human  μ ρη, similar to that between the assertive  ματι τ  δε and the enunciative σ μερον. In later literature, rather than marking through terminology the difference between the speech-act inspired by the gods and human wishes, authors use other resources such as conditional forms or options between two extremes that leave a certain room for uncertainty. The deictic expression of a day is, therefore, much more than an emphatic way of saying “today:” it aims to point at the imminent presence of a decisive </page> <page sequence="40"> 74 classical antiquity Volume 32/No. 1 /April 2013 moment in the life of an individual, and it shows how this moment is experienced most directly, i.e. by the speakers who recognize it. Unlike when the narrator of distant events explains the nature of the day through an epithet like δοupsilonperispomeneλιον or  λεupsilonacuteθερον ( μαρ), “this day” needs no explanatory epithet, since the speaker knows instantly that a decisive event is going to take place and radically alter the previous state of affairs. The immediate context (an oath, a harangue, a vow, funerary ritual, etc.) makes clear what this decisive change is: death, happiness, or even entry into the gods’ timeless immortality. A speaker who says “this day” has full conscience of the divine power to determine human affairs, and of the immediate and ineluctable arrival of a crucial change ordained by them (or just by fate): such consciousness makes the utterance so authoritative that often it brings immediate accomplishment (τ λος) as a true performative speech-act. Poets, therefore, did not use the poetic expression  μαρ τ δε /  μ ρα  δε randomly or in a banal sense. We must think that the Greek audience which heard it in a poetic context was conscious of all these implications, and thus may have appreciated with great precision the specific sense and nuances it was taking in each particular utterance.
