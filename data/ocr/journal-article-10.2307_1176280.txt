<plain_text><page sequence="1">Realism, Deweyan Pragmatism, and Educational Research JIM GARRISON In a recent exchange, Cleo H. Cherryholmes (1992) opposed Ror- tyan pragmatism to the "scientific realism" of Ernest R. House (1991, 1992). In my article, I hope to find a middle ground be- tween Cherryholmes and House that might be more attractive to many in the field of education. My article emphasizes some of the most important aspects of Dewey's philosophy, including his social behaviorist theory of meaning, his naturalistic metaphysics, philosophy of nature, social constructivism, and transactional realism. For some reason, most educational theorists, researchers, and practitioners have almost entirely ignored these crucial Deweyan themes, often with disastrous consequences. I will con- clude by trying to show how all of these themes converge into Dewey's defense of democracy as not only the best form of govern- ment but also the best way for the community of educators to con- duct and consume educational research. Educational Researcher, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 5-14 y article is situated within the recent debate be- tween Ernest R. House (1991, 1992) and Cleo H. Cherryholmes (1992) as to which philosophical paradigm of scientific inquiry, "scientific realism" (House) or Rortyan pragmatism (Cherryholmes), would better serve to inform educational theory and research. We have not yet reached the aftermath of the paradigm wars predicted by N. L. Gage (1989), and the entrance of new combatants into the fray might well alter the happy outcome he prophesied. One reason for writing this article is to further confound prophecy by suggesting yet a third paradigm that lies be- tween House and Cherryholmes. Although this alternative is old, it remains ill understood. I am thinking about the realism of John Dewey's pragmatism. Understandably, few educational researchers have the time to make a careful and systematic study of Dewey's philosophy, so they are often left with a false impression. Cherryholmes, following W. V. O. Quine (1981), helps clear things up by noting that a "behavioristic semantics" and "the doctrine of man as truth-maker" are "more or less at the center of the web of pragmatic beliefs" (Cherryholmes, 1992, pp. 16-17). Many in the field of education have not recognized that Dewey held a constructivist view of knowl- edge, and almost no one seems aware that he held a behav- iorist theory of meaning. Dewey developed his doctrine of humankind as truth maker into a theory of research, and his behavioristic semantics into a theory of communication. I will conclude by showing how Dewey called on democratic political theory to connect realism and research practices to the larger discourse practices of the whole community. My article seeks to recover the past of educational philosophy into a present that anticipates an unexpected future for educational research. Failing that, then perhaps we can get beyond the legacy of John Dewey in the field of education by listening carefully to his own words. Rortyan Pragmatism and "Scientific Realism" House (1992) notes the following points of agreement be- tween Cherryholmes and himself: the rejection of positivism/empiricism, non-foundationalism, the use of stories and metaphors in science, and the ex- istence of a world prior to and independent of our minds, though our minds are a part of it. Pragmatists want to create desirable communities, be concerned about values and politics, and spend more time asking questions about ways of life. I agree. (p. 18) House then goes on to enumerate some significant dif- ferences between scientific realists and pragmatists. The latter, he writes, * do not know when they are closer to or farther away from knowing reality, or how realists would know this either; * abandon the idea of knowing whether anything is real and refrain from asking questions about the nature of reality; * focus on consequent phenomena rather than ante- cedents; "* have no conception of causation; "* choose explanation, theories, and decision by desires; "* maintain that inquiry should aim at making beliefs and desires coherent; * want to replace the desire for objectivity in scientific research with a desire for community solidarity. (House, 1992, p. 18) Because it is a kind of realism, Deweyan pragmatism finds the first, second, fourth, and last items untenable, although for reasons very different from those offered by the scien- tific realist. Regarding the next to last item, Dewey was not content with coherence as the final aim of inquiry, although he certainly thought it a desirable theoretical trait: Who wouldn't? I do not think Cherryholmes (1992) said that theory choice is by desire alone, but only that it played a larger role in theory selection, and inquiry, than positivists will acknowledge. Postpositivism rejects the theory-value dualism, for rather Deweyan reasons. We desire things that we value. The third item is the sine qua non of any pragmatism, Dewey's included.

JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 5</page><page sequence="2">formulated pragmatism as follows: "Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearing, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the ob- ject" (p. 258). All that pragmatism can be is located in the alternative possible interpretations of Peirce's original for- mulation. The pragmatic maxim refers all fixations of mean- ing to their consequences. As Peirce (1878/1965) put it, "there is no distinction of meaning so fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference of practice" (p. 257). Dewey's Behavioral Semantics That Dewey was a semantical behaviorist is beyond dispute. Quine (1969) himself makes a great deal of the fact, as do Rorty (1979) and Sleeper (1986) among others. For Dewey social experience was social interaction and, therefore, sim- ply a continuation of natural experience and existence. Dewey (1925/1981) insisted that "the interaction of human beings, namely, association, is not different in origin from other modes of interaction" (p. 138). Of these various in- teractions, the most important by far are those that com- prise linguistic behavior. Dewey (1925/1981) indicated, "Meanings do not come into being without language, and language implies two selves involved in a conjoint or shared undertaking" (p. 226). Quine (1969, p. 27) calls attention to the following passage in which Dewey (1925/1981) remarked: Language is specifically a mode of interaction of at least two beings, a speaker and a hearer; it presupposes an organized group to which these creatures belong, and from whom they have acquired their habits of speech. It is therefore a relationship. (p. 145) Dewey believed that all meanings originated in language, and that language originated in cooperative behavior. The foregoing observations bring us to the core of Dewey's semantical behaviorism. Dewey (1925/1981) declared: The heart of language is not "expression" of something antecedent, much less expression of antecedent thought. It is communication; the establishment of cooperation in an activity in which there are partners, and in which the activity of each is modified and regulated by partnership. To fail to understand is to fail to come into agreement in action; to misunderstand is to set up action at cross pur- poses.... Meaning is not indeed a psychic existence; it is primarily a property of behavior.... But the behavior of which it is a quality is a distinctive behavior; cooperative, in that responses to another's act involves contemporaneous response to a thing as entering into the other's behavior, and this upon both sides. (p. 141) The idea here is that communication is a cooperative activity that involves individuals orienting their behavior, including linguistic behavior, to events in external reality in which they are participants in such a manner that both parties designate and fix the event(s) in a common way; that is, they assign the same essences, identities, and definitions. "To under- stand," commented Dewey (1925/1981), "is to anticipate together, it is to make a cross-reference which, when acted upon, brings about a partaking in a common, inclusive undertaking" (p. 141). Meanings, for Dewey, were socially constructed; they were the consequence of socially shared behavior. The result is the social construction of reality and of shared social practices for dealing with it. The position explicitly rejects the notion of psychic entities (cognitive structures) of the type typically championed by cognitive psychologists. Dewey would condemn this line of thinking for committing a modern version of the infamous mind- body dualism. Indeed, the epistemological behaviorism that Rorty takes from Dewey leads Rorty himself to take a very dim view of cognitive science (see Gardner, 1985, p. 86). For Dewey all meanings had several familiar realist proper- ties although, as a consequence of his social behaviorism, they have them in an unusual way. First, for Dewey (1925/1981): Every meaning is generic or universal. It is something com- mon between speaker, hearer and the thing to which speech refers. It is universal also as a means of generalization. For a meaning is a method of action [behavior], a way of using things as means to a shared consummation. (p. 147). Second, Dewey (1925/1981) affirms the objectivity of mean- ings: "Meanings are objective because they are modes of natural interaction; such an interaction, although primarily between organic beings, as includes things ... external to living creatures" (p. 149). "Things," for Dewey, had exter- nal and real reference, fixed, for a time, between organic be- ings. Dewey (1929/1981) stated: Meaning is objective.... it indicates a possible interaction. ... A meaning may not of course have the particular ob- jectivity which is imputed to it, as ... the ceremonial sprinkling of water indicates rain. But such magical imputa- tions of external reference testify to the objectivity of mean- ings as such. Meanings are naturally the meaning of some- thing ... difficulty lies in discriminating the right thing. It requires the discipline of ordered and deliberate experi- mentation to teach us that ... meanings communally developed do not represent the polities, and ways and means of nature apart from social arts. (p. 148) The putative real objective reference of a meaning, for ex- ample, sprinkling water, is given in the intersubjective co- referencing of the object that is the consequence of shared activity. Dewey's social behaviorism has many sources. One way of appreciating Dewey's behavioral semantics is to think of it as emerging out of Dewey's reconstruction of his two pragmatic predecessors. Dewey's Reconstruction of the Realism of Peirce and James In his response to Cherryholmes, House (1992) noted: "There are many versions of pragmatism, with significant differences among Peirce, James, Dewey, and Rorty. Some analysts consider modern pragmatism difficult to characterize because it is essentially negative" (p. 18). Rorty is the only "modern" pragmatist on House's list. If Rorty's pragmatism is negative, it might well be because, unlike the others mentioned, he is not a realist. Peirce (1903/1965) advocated "Scholastic realism" (see, e.g., pp. 64-67). This position is not easy to explicate. Suf- fice it to say that Peirce believed in the reality of universals, for instance, fixed laws of science. The predetermined end of scientific inquiry for Peirce was correspondence to the fixed and final structures of external reality. As Peirce put it: The progress of investigation carries them [scientists] by a force outside of themselves to one and the same conclu- sion ... embodied in the conception of truth and reality. 6 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER</page><page sequence="3">The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real. (p. 268) Peirce's realism and theory of truth is a direct extension of his pragmatic maxim first articulated in the same paper. William James was a nominalist, that is to say, he only affirmed the reality, as Dewey (1916/1980e) himself put it, of "the particular sensible consequence" rather than univer- sals (p. 76). While Peirce's Scholastic realism tended toward objectivism, James's nominalism inclined toward subjec- tivism. In a chapter titled "The Perception of Reality," James (1890/1950) wrote that "all reality, whether from the absolute or the practical point of view, is thus subjective, is ourselves" (pp. 296-297). James departs from Peirce in another impor- tant way. For James there were no permanent antecedent fixed essences, no final end of inquiry. Instead, James (1890/1950) insisted: The only meaning of essence is teleological, and that classifica- tion and conception are purely teleological weapons of the mind. The essence of a thing is that one of its properties which is so important for my interests that in comparison with it I may neglect the rest. (p. 335) James's example is water. He argues that the "real essence" of water is no more the chemists' H20 "than it is a solvent of sugar or a slaker of thirst" and that the only reason H20 is primary for the scientist is that "for his purpose of deduc- tion and compendious definition ... it is the more useful" (James, 1890/1950, p. 335). Essences, categories, logical rules of inference, methods of data collection are all, on this ac- count, constructed for our purposes; they help us secure what we desire, (e.g., higher test scores); they are teleological means for solving our problems (e.g., high dropout rates) and achieving what we value (e.g., alleviating the lack of multicultural understanding). James felt that real- ity was more made than found. Dewey's own gloss on Peirce and James is instructive. Dewey (1916/1980e) wrote: Both Peirce and James are realists.... Peirce makes clearer the fact that ... "reality" means the object of those beliefs which have, after prolonged and cooperative inquiry, become stable, and "truth" the quality of these beliefs is a logical consequence of this position.... Do not a large part of our epistemological difficulties arise from an attempt to define the "real" as something given prior to reflective inquiry instead of as that which reflective inquiry is forced to reach and to which when it is reached belief can stably cling? (pp. 77-78) There are three important things to note about this passage. First, Dewey endorses some kind of realism. Second, Dewey, like Cherryholmes, understands objectivity as in- volving solidarity in cooperative inquiry. However, the in- fluence of Peirce leads Dewey, unlike Cherryholmes, to preserve a notion of "objective reference." Finally, Peirce, like House's scientific realist, believed that there were real, fixed essences that are given prior to reflective inquiry. Dewey (1925/1981) called such a belief "the philosophic fallacy" (p. 34). Dewey's own version of pragmatism is a reconstructed combination of the philosophies of Peirce and James. From Peirce Dewey took, as all pragmatists must, the pragmatic maxim that says all meanings are fixed by their conse- quences. Dewey also understood the outcome of socially shared inquiry to be knowledge, truth, or what he preferred to call "warranted assertability." What he rejected was Peirce's objectivism, his allegiance to the existence of fixed eternal structures, for example, essences and necessary natural laws, "fated" in advance to be found by continued inquiry. From James, Dewey took the idea that essences are con- structed in the course of inquiry carried out for some specific human purpose. Dewey, however, eschewed James's tendency toward subjectivism by emphasizing the intersub- jective, or social behavioral aspect, of shared inquiry. Dewey was a realist who thought that the structures of reality were constructed by the interactions of events and that knowledge of them was fixed for human action by a special kind of social interaction called scientific inquiry. What kind of realism is this? Dewey's Transactional Realism A few months before his death, Dewey wrote his friend and collaborator Arthur F. Bentley of his intention to try yet again to make clear the philosophical work of a lifetime: If I ever get the needed strength, I want to write on know- ing as the way of behaving in which linguistic artifacts trans- act business with physical artifacts, tools, implements, ap- paratus, both kinds being planned for the purpose and rendering inquiry ... an experimental transaction. (cited in Sleeper, 1986, p. 16) In a few months Dewey was dead, his last effort at making his philosophical system more comprehensible still unfin- ished. Even if Dewey had completed his last project, it is unlikely that it would have succeeded any better than a lifetime of efforts had in communicating his holism to critics who insisted on breaking his philosophy into smaller analytic parts. Sleeper (1986) bemoans "the mistake that specialists in a single aspect of Dewey's thought, say his philosophy of education, have often made, the mistake of understanding him only after they have split him up" (p. 189). Capturing all of the reticulated connections compos- ing Dewey's holism is a difficult task. Still, it is important to start somewhere. R. W. Sleeper takes such phrases as "experimental trans- action" as expressing Dewey's transactional realism. Sleeper (1986) describes Dewey's transactional realism as follows: It is commonly accepted that Dewey's conception of philosophy led him to think of knowledge as something to be sought, not for its own sake, but for the sake of ac- tion. According to this view, Dewey's pragmatism is a form of instrumentalism. What is less commonly recognized is that his conception of philosophy required him to think of action itself as instrumental, as a means of ontological change. From this perspective .... Dewey's pragmatism is seen to be a radical form of realism- transactional realism in which instrumentalism plays a subordinate role .... and thinking entails active involvement with independent reali- ty, an involvement that is causally efficacious. Even reflec- tion is a means of conducting transformational transactions with the world, a means of changing or reconstructing, the world. (p. 3) In this passage Sleeper is connecting Dewey's metaphysics and logic of inquiry by arguing that Dewey's logic has on- tological significance, that is to say, it transforms reality even JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 7-</page><page sequence="4">as reality transforms the logical agent. Said differently, Dewey's was a philosophy of continuous reconstruction car- ried out to solve our problems. In an early work explicating his instrumentalist theory of logic and inquiry Dewey (1916/1980c, 1985) remarked, "Thought, intelligence, is to it just a name for the events and acts which make up the processes of ... testing.... These events, these acts, are wholly natural; they are 'realistic'. . . . Thinking is what some of the actual existences do" (pp. 338-339). For Dewey scientific inquiry (thinking), was a process engaged in by some natural existences, in- cluding human beings. For Dewey human nature was a seamless part of nature. This brings us to what I feel is the font of understanding for Dewey's philosophy of science and research: As Dewey saw it, we are participants in an un- finished universe rather than spectators of a finished universe. That is why our actions, our behaviors, our social constructions, deconstructions, and reconstructions have ontological significance. Dewey was profoundly influenced by Darwin's theory of evolution. As Dewey understood it, in order for individual organisms or entire species to survive and exalt their ex- istence, they must carry out successful transactions with the environment. For Dewey the environment did not pose problems independently of the needs and desires of the organism. If the organism identified a situation as prob- lematic, then it acted to transform it. Dewey's insight was that instrumentalist inquiry was a powerful "tool" for transforming the environment; that is why, for him, in- strumentalist logic had ontological significance. For exam- ple, as a result of human inquiry, there are now "elements" in the chemist's periodic table like Americium, Californium, and Berkelium whose anthropomorphic names are ample testimony to humankind not only as "truth-makers," but as creators of fundamentally new ontological structures. Dewey's Naturalistic Metaphysics, Philosophy of Nature, and Theory of Experience Chapter 2 of Experience and Nature (1925/1981), significantly titled "Existence as Precarious and as Stable," introduces Dewey's naturalistic and antifoundational metaphysics of nature. In his preface, Dewey (1925/1981) said of this chapter that it "explains our starting point: namely, that the things of ordinary experience contain within themselves a mixture of the perilous and uncertain with the settled and uniform" (p. 5). What this metaphysics declares is that if you examine your experience of natural events, you will find an "in- eradicable union in nature of the relatively stable and the relatively contingent" (Dewey, 1925/1981, p. 56). It is the unity of the precarious and contingent with the stable and secure that makes inquiry and research both necessary and possible. As Dewey (1925/1981) stated it: "The striving to make stability of meaning prevail over the instability of events is the main task of intelligent human effort" (p. 49). It is also the main task of educational research. For Dewey experience was always experience of reality; there was no appearance-reality dualism. Experience could lead to false inferences if interpreted incorrectly; nonetheless, since human nature and experience are parts of nature, human experience was an adequate guide to the metaphysics of natural existence. In Dewey's philosophy, "nature is viewed as consisting of events rather than substances, it is characterized by histories, that is, by continuity of change proceeding from beginnings to endings. Consequently, it is natural for gen- uine initiations and consummations to occur in experience" (Dewey, 1925/1981, pp. 5-6). For Dewey (1925/1981) "every existence is an event" (p. 63). As Dewey saw it, there was nothing more, or less, real than the flux of "existential events," their interactions, and the structures that emerged from their interactions. Events are processes from beginning to ending. A dialectical unity of the relatively stable and the contingent, events were never fully determinate until they terminated (see Garrison, 1985). Events are diachronic rather than synchronic. The life cycle of birth, development, educa- tion, reproduction, and death in Homo sapiens is an instruc- tive instance. Dewey's is an organic as opposed to a mechanical view of nature. In his essay "The Influence of Darwinism on Philosophy," Dewey (1909/1977) identified the source for his organic philosophy of nature: In laying hands upon the sacred ark of absolute perma- nency, in treating the forms that had been regarded as types of fixity and perfection as originating and passing away, the Origin of Species introduced a mode of thinking that in the end was bound to transform the logic of knowledge, and hence the treatment of morals, politics and religion. (p. 3) Later Dewey (1920/1982) would argue that "change rather than fixity is now a measure of 'reality' ... change is omni- present," or, again, "natural science is forced by its own development to abandon the assumption of fixity and to recognize that what for it is actually 'universal' is process" (pp. 114, 260). Nature is a mixture of the relatively stable and the pre- carious. There are about "2 million described species of liv- ing organisms" (Bock, 1982, p. 1067), and "it has been estimated that 99% of all species that have ever lived are now extinct" (Parker, 1992, p. 570). They are extinct because they failed to continuously carry on effective transactions with their environment. Cloud formations move quickly across the sky. Mountain ranges fall slowly into the sea. Some microparticles exist only for nanoseconds. Continents have collided and massive tectonic plates have been driven below the surface of the earth after millennia. Nature has the character of a historical event from origin to termina- tion. For the Deweyan, nature, including human nature, is an event; that is the way it really is. We can better grasp Dewey's philosophy of nature, and begin to see its implications for Dewey's theory of causa- tion and logic of inquiry, by understanding what he meant by the Greek term eidos, or what is translated into Latin as species and that Dewey identified with form and struc- ture. Dewey (1909/1977) wrote: The conception of eidos, a fixed form and final cause, was the central principle of knowledge as well as of nature. Upon it rested the logic of science. Change as change is mere flux and lapse; it insults intelligence .... Since, however the scene of nature which directly confronts us is in change, nature as directly and practically experienced does not satisfy the conditions of knowledge. Human ex- perience is in flux, and hence the instrumentalities of sense- perception and of inference based upon observation are condemned in advance. (p. 6) According to Dewey (1909/1977) this situation provides only 8 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER</page><page sequence="5">two alternatives: "We must either find the appropriate ob- jects and organs of knowledge in the mutual interaction of changing things; or else, to escape the infection of change, we must seek them in some transcendent and supernal region" (p. 6). Later Dewey (1938/1986) would write: "Ex- istence in general must be such as to be capable of taking on logical form.... But operations which constitute con- trolled inquiry are necessary in order to give actuality to these capacities or potentialities" (p. 387). For Dewey logical forms devolved out of the events of nature. On Dewey's (1925/1981) account, "A thing may endure ... and yet not be everlasting; it will crumble before the gnawing tooth of time, as it exceeds a certain measure" (p. 63). Forms and structures endure but they are not eternal. That they endure, though, is enough for intelligent inquiry and action. Dewey (1925/1981) wrote: The rate of change of some things is so slow, or so rhythmic, that these changes have all the advantages of stability in dealing with more transitory and irregular happenings.... To designate the slower and the regular rhythmic events structure, and more rapid and irregular ones process, is sound practical sense. It expresses the function of one in respect to the other. (p. 64) For Dewey structure is functional and transitory rather than fixed and final. Structure emerges in the interaction of natural events, including those involving human nature, and functions to bring events to some end. The following passage connects Dewey's metaphysics, philosophy of nature and theory of inquiry to his construc- tivist theory of meaningful knowledge and truth: The fact is that all structure is structure of something; anything defined as structure is a character of events, not something intrinsic and per se.... A set of traits is called structure, because of its limiting function in relation to other traits of events.... Structure is constancy of means, of things used for consequences, not of things taken by themselves or absolutely. Structure is what makes construc- tion possible and cannot be discovered or defined except in some realized construction, construction being, of course, an evident order of changes. (Dewey, 1925/1981, pp. 64-65) Dewey's example is the fixed structure of a house. Without it, the construction, that is, the interaction of human being and material being, would collapse, but it is not anything apart from the changes involved in building the house. In- quiry can restructure the interaction to bring about ends that we desire. That is why inquiry can have ontological significance. We have seen how, for Dewey, structure, including the logical structure of knowledge, can arise "in the mutual in- teraction of [real] changing things"; now let us see how it is with "transcendent" realism. Platonism has been the preeminent example of supernal realism in the West. We will not discuss it on this occasion. House's scientific realism is a fine example of "transcendent" realism. House (1991) argues that "events are explained by underlying structures, which may be explained eventually by other structures at still deeper levels" (p. 4). House (p. 4) sets up a hierarchy of reality that looks like this: Real Actual Empirical Structures * Events * * Experiences * * * House notes that "all are real, but some are more inclusive" (p. 4). House then goes on to note that "the entities and structures produce the events and experiences. But events can occur without being experienced." House then con- cludes that we must overcome the "double error, of equating experience with events and events with reality" (p. 4). For Dewey (1925/1981) experience was the interaction of events, but "there is no evidence that experience occurs everywhere and everywhen" (p. 12). To think that it does is probably to be an idealist, accepting a metaphysics that all realists reject. However, to believe in a hierarchy of reality with fixed and eternal "underlying structures" would be, for Dewey, to commit "the philosophic fallacy" of confusing structures, enduring but not eternal essences and identities that are the constructed consequences of controlled inquiry, with transcendent (or supernal) structures that lie in some mysterious realm beneath (or above) events. Dewey's realism simply will have nothing to do with eter- nal structures or with structures that are putatively more fundamental (foundational?) than the events that we can at least occasionally experience. Dewey identifies events and the consequences of their interactions with reality. For him there are antecedent, although indeterminate, events, but these do not yield antecedent meanings of any kind. Mean- ing is always socially constructed with reference to its con- sequences, just as true meaning, knowledge, is with reference to the consequences of inquiry. In Experience and Nature Dewey declared (1925/1981): "Ex- perience is not a veil that shuts man off from nature ... but rather a growing progressive self-disclosure of nature itself" (p. 5). Experience for Dewey was simply what hap- pened when human beings actively participated in transactions with other natural existences. It was not something we have by being passive positivistic spectators of nature. Follow- ing William James, experience was, for Dewey (1925/1981), a double-barrelled word.... it includes what men do and suffer, what they strive for, love, believe and endure, and also how men act and are acted upon, the ways in which they do and suffer, desire and enjoy, see, believe, imagine-in short, processes of experiencing.... It is "double-barrelled" in that it recognizes in its primary in- tegrity no division between act and material, subject and object, but contains them both in an unanalyzed totality. (p. 18) The reader will recognize in this passage the familiar holist and antidualist themes so characteristic of Dewey's philosophy. Dewey (1925/1981) wrote: Experience is of as well as in nature. It is not experience which is experienced, but nature-stones, plants, animals, diseases .... Things interacting in certain ways are ex- perience; they are what is experienced. Linked in certain other ways with another natural object-the human organism-they are how things are experienced as well. Ex- perience thus reaches down into nature; it has depth. It also has breadth and to an indefinitely elastic extent. It stretches. The stretch constitutes [logical] inference. (pp. 12-13) Everything that exists in nature and participates in natural interactions, everything carries on transactions with every- thing else-these interactions are what human organisms ex- perience. Experience, for Dewey, is simply how the human organism interacts with its environment. Social interaction JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 9</page><page sequence="6">serves, as we have seen, as the source of absolutely all meaning in Dewey's social behavioral semantics. Looking down one barrel, what we experience of nature, reality, is direct and immediate. Dewey (1925/1981) described it as follows: "But in every event there is something ob- durate, self-sufficient, wholly immediate, neither a relation nor an element in a relational whole, but terminal and ex- clusive.... Things in their immediacy are unknown and unknowable" (p. 74). We experience reality immediately, directly, and deeply. It is inference, logic, or inquiry, "the stretch," the how of experience, that connects one im- mediate experience to another. That mediated connection, sighting down the other barrel, is knowledge for Dewey; whatever closes inquiry is, for him, knowledge (see Dewey, 1938/1986, p. 15). We take up Dewey's instrumentalist theory of inquiry in the next section. For now, we turn our attention to something else. Dewey's Instrumentalist Logic and Theory of Causation Speaking with regard to "the mathematical-logical- mechanical objects of physics," Dewey (1925/1981) wrote: In the total situation in which they function, they are means to weaving together otherwise disconnected beginnings and endings into a consecutive [causal] history. Underlying "reality" and surface "appearance" in this connection have a meaning fixed by the function of inquiry, not an intrinsic metaphysical meaning. (pp. 112-113) Instrumentalist logic is the tool that functions to aid the Dar- winian labor of staying alive and living well. These tools endure but they are not eternal. The foregoing as well as other observations made earlier are all drawn together in a surprising way in an important "Added Note as to the 'Practical' "appended to his Essays in Experimental Logic. Dewey (1916/1980a) wrote: In the logical version of pragmatism termed instrumen- talism, action or practice does indeed play a fundamental role.... To use a term which is now more fashionable (and surely to some extent in consequence of pragmatism) than it was earlier, instrumentalism means a behaviorist theory of thinking and knowing. It means that knowing is literal- ly something which we do; that is ultimately physical and active ... and methods of behaving toward facts and ... active experimentation is essential to verification.... think- ing does not mean any transcendent states or acts suddenly introduced into a previously natural scene, but that the operations of knowing are (or are artfully derived from) natural responses of the organism, which constitute know- ing in virtue of the uses of inquiry, reconstruction, and con- trol to which they are put. (p. 367) The most surprising thing about this passage for the con- temporary educational researcher is the declaration that Dewey holds "a behaviorist theory" of knowledge. Dewey's "epistemological behaviorism," as Rorty (1979, p. 174) aptly characterizes it, is a derivative of his behavioral theory of semantics discussed earlier. There are two other things operating in this passage already mentioned. First, we can see that inquiry is something that mortal organisms active in an unfinished universe do to transform events into en- during essences and identities, so that they can make war- ranted assertions that, when acted upon, aid them in main- taining and enhancing their existence. Second, inquiry is totally naturalistic; nowhere does it refer to transcendent or supernal structures. Dewey's naturalism includes the very logical forms that control inquiry; for example, the law of noncontradiction or the rules of logical inference. These are usually thought to be true antecedent to inquiry. As Dewey (1938/1986) put it, "all logical forms ... arise within the operation of in- quiry and are concerned with control of inquiry so that it may yield warranted assertions" (p. 11). To believe in a priori logical structures is yet another instance of "the philosophic fallacy." We can see just how serious Dewey was about avoiding any kind of reference to transcendent reality in his logic, as well as how literal he was about his instrumentalism, by examining his paper titled "Logical Objects." Dewey (1916/1980d), stated: "The object of this paper is to pro- pound a hypothesis concerning the nature of what, for brevity, may be called 'logical entities.' By this word I denote such things as are . . . usually referred to as . . . essences" (p. 89). As we have seen, for Dewey all structures, logical or ontological, are the means of making functional connec- tions. "In other words," wrote Dewey (1916/1980a), "logical objects are things (or traits of things) which are found when inference is found." Further, "inference is an occurrence belonging to action, or behavior, which takes place in the world." (p. 90). Inference is instrumental to effective labor. So, Dewey (1916/1980a) concluded after examining the usual transcendent and supernal candidates for logical objects, "tools and works of art give the key to the question in hand: that works and tools of art are precisely the sought-for alter- native to physical, psychical and metaphysical entities" (p. 92). In this capacity, a logical object "belongs in the category where plowing, assembling the parts of a machine, digging and smelting ore belong-namely behavior" (Dewey, 1916/1980a, p. 91). Predictably, Dewey's Darwinian theory of nature prefigures his notion of causation. The following passage helps clarify Dewey's position on causality. Dewey (1925/1981) declared: Causality, however it be defined, consists in the sequen- tial order itself.... The view held ... by some "mechanist," which treats an initial term as if it had an inherent generative force ... [isolates] an event from the history in which it belongs and in which it has character ... [it makes] a factitiously isolated position in a temporal order a mark of true reality ... selecting initiation [as the cause] .... But in fact causality is another name for the se- quential order itself.... this is an order of history having a beginning and end. (pp. 84-85) To believe that there are atemporal, fixed, inner causal struc- tures antecedent to events with the generative force to cause events is the fallacy of scientific realism. For Dewey the history of science is the history of the con- struction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of workable scientific objects, that is, objects of knowledge. Instrumen- tal logic has ontological implications because it is a power- ful tool for the event of human nature to alter the historical process of other historical events by producing scientific ob- jects. For Dewey (1925/1981), "A natural end which occurs without the intervention of human art is a terminus" (p. 86). However, "the terminal outcome when anticipated (as it is when a moving cause of affairs is perceived) becomes an end-in-view, an aim, purpose, a prediction usable as a plan in shaping the course of events" (Dewey, 1925/1981, p. 86). As indicated earlier, logic connects experiences, and these 10 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER</page><page sequence="7">connections can alter the course of natural events. It does so by converting the natural sequence of events into means for achieving our purpose, the "end-in-view" that we desire. Dewey (1925/1981) affirmed: "For all the intelligent activities of men ... have for their task the conversion of causal bonds, relations of succession, into a connection of means-consequence, into meaning" (p. 277). Experimental actions, essences, identities, symbolic representations, and so forth are necessary tools for the "/scientific worker" to make connections and obtain the ends desired (see Dewey, 1925/1981, p. 268). Scientific workers use tools to help them forge new links in chains of causa- tion. Thus, we should not be surprised at the following statement: Extraordinary and subtle reasons have been assigned for belief in the principle of causation. Labor and the use of tools seem, however, to be a sufficient empirical reason: indeed, to be the only empirical events that can be specific- ally pointed to in this connection. They are more adequate grounds for acceptance of belief in causality than are the regular sequences of nature or than a category of reason, or the alleged fact of will. The thinker who proclaimed that every event is effect of something and cause of something else merely put into words the procedure of the workman .... Regularity, orderly sequence, in productive labor presents itself to thought as a controlling principle. (Dewey, 1925/1981, p. 73) Labor provides the conscious experience of interacting with nature in such a way as to transform the sequence of events, as we choose, to meet our needs (see Garrison, 1990, in press). For Dewey causality was as much a logical and in- strumentalist as it was an ontological category. Quine is cor- rect that one of the basic tenets of pragmatism is human beings as truth makers; for Dewey truth making was to be taken in the most literal workaday way possible. Social Constructivism, Educational Inquiry, and Construct Validity In Dewey's naturalistic metaphysics, existence is understood as consisting of events that are an ineradicable union of the relatively stable and the relatively precarious. Nature is an event characterized by continuous histories of change pro- ceeding from beginnings to endings rather than by sub- stances such as fixed essences, eternal identities, or perma- nent categories. Experience is of the interactions of events and is "double barreled." Natural events interacting with the natural event of our lives is how we come to have ex- perience. Experience has depth; it reaches immediately down into nature. There is no problem of experiencing re- ality as such. How could it ever be otherwise? We may, though, misinterpret what we experience and thereby fail to grasp its meaning. Experience also has breadth; it stretches across time and context. This stretch is inference. Carefully controlled inference is scientific inquiry, the supreme tools of which are science methods and logics. We must break the simple knowledge-equals-reality equa- tion. We may, indeed often do, experience reality aestheti- cally and morally without knowledge, and are left dumb- founded. The product of scientific work (i.e., inquiry) is knowledge or "warranted assertability." Knowledge establishes connections in an uncertain and precarious world, and leaves us able to act intelligently. It weaves together otherwise disconnected natural beginnings and ter- mini into a sequential causal history that allows us to act so as to achieve our purposes. In Dewey's behavioral semantics all meanings-cognitive, aesthetic, and moral-are made. They are sociolinguistically constructed between two selves participating in a shared undertaking. Meaning is objective, having external and real reference. It is the making of something intersubjectively stable and fixed, for a time, between two social actors. We are concerned with knowledge. These are the meanings that connect and are the product of inquiry controlled by the labor and tools of scientific workers. Educational researchers are scientific re-searchers of prior cultural meanings, for example, those provided by policy- makers. Through educational inquiry, they seek to produce warranted assertions that can be used to improve educa- tional efficacy by guiding events toward desirable "ends- in-view," our shared vision of improved education. Now as Dewey (1925/1981) indicated, "The same existential events are capable of an infinite number of meanings" (p. 241). Researchers, as finite organisms that need solutions now, must select only a few things within any research situation; that is the human condition. The mistake is when we do not admit to ourselves or our clients that we have selected, and that such selection involves beliefs, values, and, yes, ideology. The ultimate error is to forget our selec- tions and mistake the consequences of research for antece- dent reality, as if our selections did not partially predeter- mine the experimental transaction. For Dewey (1925/1981), to forget or fail to recognize that selection goes into making up knowledge was to commit an instance of the most grievous philosophical error possible: Selective emphasis, choice, is inevitable whenever reflec- tion occurs. This is not an evil. Deception comes only when the presence and operation of choice is concealed, dis- guised, denied. Empirical method ... protects us from the conversion of eventual functions into antecedent existence: a conversion that may be said to be the philosophic fallacy. (p. 34) Meanings are made through cooperative behavior, and knowledge is produced by using the tools of inquiry and theoretical constructions. Building a body of research re- quires choosing for a purpose, and that involves our deepest personal and cultural beliefs and values. That is why educa- tional research can never be theory or value neutral. Where in educational research, the reader may wonder, would Dewey's transactional and Darwinian realism make a difference? The response is surprisingly straightforward and amounts in many ways to little more than a reprise of some of Lee J. Cronbach's views on construct validity. Con- struct validity is involved any time the researcher asks the question, "What does the research instrument (or tool) ac- tually measure?" Ideally, construct validity would establish an identity between an attribute or quality being measured and some theoretical construct although, as any researcher knows, that is not possible in practice (see Cherryholmes, 1988, pp. 100-108). Whatever the relation, Deweyan prag- matism would require us to recognize that construct validity, like the theoretical construct and the attributes to be measured, are themselves all socially constructed in one way or another. House (1991) calls on Cronbach and his colleagues re- peatedly in a subsection of his article titled "Relevance of JANUARY-FEBRUARY 1994 11</page><page sequence="8">Research to Practice." If research is to be relevant to prac- tice, the results must display situational validity. House (1991) recalls Cronbach's argument that "external validity is more important than internal validity" (p. 8). House (1991) himself concludes: From a realist point of view, the standard distinction of internal validity and external validity is inadequate. Rather one might think of the validity with which researchers draw conclusions from their studies, the validity with which prac- titioners draw conclusions from these studies to their own situation, and the validity with which teachers and other practitioners draw conclusions for themselves on the basis of their own experiences. (p. 9) Transactional realists would agree with this assessment. They would, however, call attention to all of the choices and selections made along the way. They would also avoid com- mitting the philosophical fallacy of asserting as antecedent underlying causal structures that were really only mean- ingful consequences constructed by all the participants, for example, researchers, teachers, and other practitioners, as well as parents and students. Cherryholmes (1992) remarks in his response to House that "Lee Cronbach can also be read as having become in- creasingly pragmatized during the course of his career" (p. 13). One especially important place where Cronbach's pragmatism finds expression is in his thinking about con- struct validity. In reviewing Cronbach and Meehl's (1955) original statement of the idea of construct validity, Cherry- holmes (1988) argues that the idea takes precedence over other kinds of validity such as internal, external, or content validity, especially with regard to converting research into practice, because all the other kinds of validity presume that issues of construct validity have been resolved (see pp. 100-108). Cherryholmes (1988) further states: Construct validation occurs in the context of a nomological net, a set of related lawlike statements. This creates an in- teresting paradox because nomological nets change. Iden- tity, consistence, coherence, definition, and stability are valued and pursued in the context of change and instabil- ity. (p. 101) I believe that this view accords well with Dewey's transac- tional realism and with Cronbach's own views in a classic article not mentioned by either House or Cherryholmes. The article by Cronbach that I have in mind is titled "Beyond the Two Disciplines of Scientific Psychology." The two scientific disciplines are experimental control and systematic correlation. Cronbach concluded that "generalizations decay" both in time and place and therefore social scientists should abandon their desire to "erect 'theoretical palaces' " (see pp. 122-123). Cronbach gives many examples, including some discussed by House. The following is especially striking: A decade from now, with changes in the economy, in social morale, in the family structure, and in aspirations, com- munity attitudes will be different .... We tend to speak of a scientific conclusion as if it were eternal, but in every field empirical relations change.... It was once a sound generalization that DDT kills mosquitos, until the evolu- tionary mechanism acted rapidly to make mosquitos resis- tant to DDT. Further along the time scale, consider star maps for navigation. Those maps have not changed percep- tibly during recorded history. And yet the stars are shift- ing in their courses, and it is only a matter of time-a lot of time-before the map changes beyond recognition. All that can be considered eternal is the laws. (Cronbach, 1975, p. 122) Scientific laws are functional and transitory; they merely serve to structure our experience here and now. For the transactional realist even the so-called laws of nature are merely relatively stable compared with the current economy. Cronbach (1975) remarks: Our troubles do not arise because human events are in prin- ciple unlawful: man and his creations are part of the natural world. The trouble, as I see it, is that we cannot store up generalizations and constructs for ultimate assembly into a network. (p. 123) The decay of generalizations, Cronbach (1975) concludes, "/puts construct validation ... into a new light.... Events are accounted for-and predicted-by a network of proposi- tions connecting abstract constructs" (p. 123). This charac- terization accords well with that of Cherryholmes above. The transactional realist would put especial emphasis on the term "events." Cronbach also seems to have learned the same Darwinian lesson as Dewey regarding essences or eidos being endur- ing but not eternal. Cronbach (1975) indicates: The obvious example of success in coming to explanatory grips with interactions involving time is evolutionary biology.... Darwin considered observations on species against the background of ecologies and viewed his data in Galapagos as only the latest snapshot of an ever-changing ecology. (Cronbach, 1975, p. 123). For the transactional realist, all events and their interactions evolve over time. Educational researchers interested in validity of all kinds, especially with regard to converting research into practice, that is, generalizing results from one domain or ecology to another, could take guidance from transactional realism, and comfort for their inevitable frustrations. Conclusion: Discourse, Democracy, and Educational Research We have examined Dewey's existential metaphysics and found it a surprising dialectical unity of contrary but com- plementary opposites, like the relatively stable and yet precarious character of natural events that makes inquiry both necessary and possible. We have also looked at his in- strumentalist logic of experience and how it established essences as the consequence of inquiry, essences that may then be used to control future inquiry establishing the war- ranty of shared meanings. There is something, though, that ties together both Dewey's metaphysics and his logic. It is language. As Dewey (1925/1981) put it: There is a natural bridge that joins the gap between ex- istence and essence; namely communication, language, dis- course. Failure to acknowledge the presence and operation of natural interaction in the form of communication creates the gulf between existence and essence, and that gulf is fac- titious and gratuitous. (p. 133) Sleeper (1986, pp. 2-3) calls attention to the following passage as tying together the whole of Dewey's holistic philosophy: 12 EDUCATIONAL RESEARCHER</page><page sequence="9">When communication occurs, all natural events are sub- ject to reconsideration and revision; they are re-adapted to meet the requirement of conversation, whether it be public discourse or that preliminary discourse termed thinking. Events turn into objects, things with a meaning. (Dewey, 1925/1981, p. 132) One purpose in my writing this article is to make as clear as possible to the educational researcher why we should take this statement of Dewey's transactional realism seriously. I have cited Dewey repeatedly and at length, because I believe that it is time that we as educational researchers come to terms with the whole of what Dewey said. I believe that Dewey is substantially correct. Many, however, will find his thinking simply too fantastic to be believable. For those like myself who are attracted to Dewey's trans- actional realism, there is one special benefit I would like to call attention to. Lewis Feuer (1959) once observed that Dewey "was the first philosopher who tried to read democ- racy into the ultimate nature of things and social reform into the meaning of knowledge" (p. 568). Recall that Dewey understood language as intrinsically involving cooperative behavior. Now add to that Dewey's (1916/1980b) definition of democracy: "A democracy is more than a form of govern- ment; it is primarily a mode of associated living, of conjoint communicated experience" (p. 93). Feuer was correct. In- deed, Dewey's instrumentalist logic itself terminated with the tool of tools: The final actuality is accomplished in face-to-face relation- ships by means of direct give and take. Logic in its fulfill- ment recurs to the primitive sense of the word: dialogue. Ideas which are not communicated, shared, and reborn in expression are but soliloquy, and soliloquy is but broken and imperfect thought. (Dewey, 1927/1984, p. 371) Democracy was for Dewey the most logical form of govern- ment; it was less about voting than about equal participa- tion by all in the conversation of humankind. Initiation into this conversation is the purpose of education, and it is the purpose of educational research to provide tools that aid this task. I will conclude with a holistic sequence of implications for educational research that may be drawn from Dewey's transactional realism. We should recognize that all knowledge is a social construction, as too are the tools of knowledge construction. We should also recognize that all knowledge is contextual, that the structure of the context is determined by the local interactions at that time and place, and that these are always transitory. The presence of human organisms in a context contributes to structuring the con- text. Human organisms must carry out successful transac- tions that transform contexts into configurations that satisfy their needs. This imperative raises problems. Problem iden- tification is a complex interaction of context with human needs and desires. Our needs and desires are expressed in moral (e.g., political ideals), aesthetic (e.g., standards of taste), and cognitive (e.g., methodological norms) values. Once a problem has been identified, it is the task of inquiry to solve it. Inquirers, their language, tools, and values, are real and have real causal consequences, but they do not entirely determine the consequences of inquiry in a given context. To think they do is to be a subjectivist. Neither, however, does the context, apart from the inquirers' participation, en- tirely determine the consequences of inquiry. To think it does is be an objectivist. The reality, including the functional structure of a given context, is in the transactions among all those events that participate in the context including the participation of the inquirer. Selective emphasis and value choice in problem identifica- tion, behavior chosen by the inquirer (e.g., research prac- tices), and selection of tools and their application are all in- evitable whenever reflection occurs. This is no evil. Rather it is the fate of finite impassioned creatures that seek to con- tinue their existence. We must choose, and choice always has a moral and an aesthetic as well as a cognitive dimen- sion. Deception comes only when the presence and opera- tion of choice is concealed or denied. The deception usually takes the form of objectivism; that is, the inquirers claim to be uncovering eternal structures entirely beyond human values and choices. Sometimes, though, it appears in the form of subjectivism that claims there is no "objective" structure at all. That is a danger for some forms of poststruc- turalism, especially the deconstructionist. As an alternative to either of these, I recommend Dewey's philosophy of reconstruction and its reliance on participatory democracy. In Dewey's dialogical sense of logic discussed above, not only is democracy, at least potentially, the most "rational" of all structures of governance now known; it is also the best way to do research. If we would include more voices in the educational research conversation, for example, more women, ethnic groups, races, as well as the teachers and students we tend to do our research on rather than with, and if we were to listen to them better, the problems we iden- tify, the solutions we seek, and the facts themselves, would change. Many things that appear "natural," simply because they are actual, would be seen as contingent social construc- tions open to reconstruction. If communication occurs, all natural events are subject to reconsideration and revision; they are re-adapted to meet the requirements of the con- versation. Events turn into objects, new things with novel meanings. Notes I would like to acknowledge several conversations with Jan Nespor as well as the very helpful comments of the reviewers of an earlier version of this article. Thanks.
