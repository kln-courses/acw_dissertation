<plain_text><page sequence="1">EUROPE -The World of Odysseus. By M. L Finley. London (Chatto &amp; Windus), I956. Pp. I9I. Price I5S. 12 Homer's Greece has been claimed by stage, screen and fiction but has so far remained an untouched heritage for social anthropology. All the more satisfactory that at last a classical scholar should examine the social background of the Iliad and the Odyssey in the light of anthropological fieldwork. The author of The World of Odysseus, who is a University Lecturer in Classics at Cambridge, has combined classical learning with reading in social anthropology, to remarkably good effect. The book deserves the attention of social anthropologists in any branch of specialization. By combing the text of the poems he makes a serious attempt to estimate the demographic conditions of the society portrayed. Military organization and the kinds of obligations that bind men to leader, and leaders to each other, and the whole fluid conception of kingship are analysed. It is interesting to me to see how the meaning of Paa1iAE\S oscillated between 'king' and 'head of an aristocratic household,' in exactly the same way as the Lele of the Congo oscillate in their use of kumu as chief, head of a village and owner of a dog. A similar fluidity is found in many societies in the use of a single term for tribe, lineage, family, etc. The great aristocratic households, with their nobles and retainers I3</page><page sequence="2">Nos. I2, I3 Man JANUARY, I957 of different rank, and their warrior values, invite a comparison with the large farming households of the Mende of Sierra Leone at the turn of the last century. It is a pity that the discussion of status and economic role is obscured by references about an apparently fictitious class of free smallholders. In the large aristocratic house- holds there were the members of the noble family, and their retainers and slaves. The domestic slave was in a relatively fortunate position compared with the plight of the e's, the unattached labourer: inevitable in a political system in which murder was avenged by blood feud and the unattached individual was un- protected. All this builds up a consistent and intelligible picture, were it not for frequent references to 'independent householders with their own holdings' (pp. 57, 59, 76, 77, ioo). The author, complaining of the lack of information about them, attributes the omission to the poet's preoccupation with heroic characters. It would seem as if the 8ijiiS of a later period of Greek history keeps obtruding itself into an account of a simpler type of society. The mere existence of independent freemen in such political conditions would be more a matter for surmise than the poet's failure to mention them. Having established the aristocratic households as the principal units of subsistence and the most stable social groups, the discussion turns to a fascilnating account of the significance of treasure and of gift-giving between nobles of different households. Paiallels from Gr0nbech's Culture of the Teutons suggest themselves. The chapter on the Gods is unfortunately marred by a famous nineteenth-centry assumption about the evolution of religion. Original in so much else, Mr. Finley is surely accepting one of the hoariest prejudices of humanism when he asserts that the idea of an anthropomorphic God ranks as one of man's greatest intellectual achievements. 'One element that was decidedly not primitive was the complete anthropomorphism' (p. I47). He detects in the Homeric poems traces of earlier and later stages in religious thought-a chronology derived from subjective judgments about what appears to be primitive and therefore historically prior. 'Traces of the shift are still visible in the Homeric poems. The old nature gods survived, but they were debased or ignored . . . the malny gross atrocities in the prehistory of the gods were toned down radically (p. IsI) . . . the Odyssey also has a considerable revival of the older elements of belief that had been so rigorously excluded from the Iliad' (p. I57). Mr. Finley's gelneral thesis is that Homer's Greece was a poor, primitive culture, not comparable with the glories of the Mycenaean past. The sparse and technologically inferior Greeks had one sole superiority: they discarded belief in cruel, irrational deities, and created their gods in their own image. If such a relolution in ideas did in fact occur, it is difficult to assess it as a forward or backward step. Belief in an anthropomorphic pantheon which faithfully re- produces the structure of human society is very usual among peoples whom Mr. Finley would probably rank as primitive. It would be interesting to know the relative rating of a Bantu ancestor cult and the inscrutable God of the Book of Job on the scale which he employs. No one would claim that the Homeric poems reveal a highly developed speculative philosophy or any complex religious symbolism. It is safest to assume the no deductions about religious belief and practice can legitimately be made from them. It is only fair to point out that the weakness of the chapter on religion corresponds to a failing in social anthropology. The book is an exceptionally good example of a 'cross-disciplinary' study. The chapters on economic organization, gift-exchange, warfare alnd politics are excellent. Where modern fieldwork has most to offer, the study of Homer's Greece has been best illumined. But detailed studies of primitive religion by social anthropologists have only intermittently appeared, and Mr. Finley should be excused for having relaxed his own high critical standards on the subject of the Gods.
