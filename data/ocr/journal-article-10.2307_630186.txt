He describes the develop- ment in terms of styles and regions, illustrating his thesis with a more comprehensive range of pictures for this period than any other modem monograph, presenting many unfamiliar or rarely reproduced statues and assemblages. With 481 illustrations The World of Art Library Hardcover ?5.5o, paperback C2.95 Mining and Metallurgy in the Greek and Roman World J. F. HEALY This is the first large-scale survey devoted exclusively to Greek and Roman mining and metallurgy, set against a background of economic geology and patrology. Professor Healy examines all phases of mining operations, and discusses techniques, tools, machinery, working conditions and metal processing. He covers the period from the Greek Bronze Age to the end of the Roman occupation of Britain, basing his remarks on evidence from literary and epigraphical sources, mining sites, associated archaeological remains, and extant metal objects. With 1o0 illustrations and 2 maps Aspects of Greek and Roman Life i i.oo The Ralph Harari Collection of Finger Rings JOHN BOARDMAN AND DIANA SCARISBRICK Ralph Harari's magnificent collection of finger rings and engraved gems includes examples from such important cabinets as the Marlborough, Southesk, Guilhou, Pichon and Tyszkiewicz. Its strength is in its Greek gold rings, European heraldic rings and Renaissance decorative rings, but it embraces pieces from many different periods and lands. In this book nearly 400 items are illustrated in enlarged photographs, and fully discussed by Professor John Boardman. With 382 illustrations, Io in colour ?I6.oo The Saga of Themistocles ROBERT J. LENARDON In this scholarly biography, Professor Lenardon presents all the essential testimony available from ancient writers in his account of the rise and fall of the famous Athenian statesman and general, Themistocles. A controversial and paradoxical figure, Themistocles emerges here as a real and very human figure. The book also includes the spurious 'Epistles' attributed to Themistocles, presented for the first time in a complete English version. With 35 illustrations and 4 maps Aspects of Greek and Roman Life C8.5o The Sea Peoples Warriors of the Ancient Mediterranean 1250-1150 BC N. K. SANDARS Nancy Sandars bases her search for the identity of the marauding Sea Peoples on both the archaeological and the historical evidence, to give us the first convincing account of the mysterious activities of the warlike bands who created such havoc in the Mediterranean during the thirteenth century BC. This superbly written book is an important addition to our knowledge of the Sea Peoples, and is both wide- ranging and up-to-date.

Melody, rhythm, harmony, symphony-these are not merely Greek words: important Greek concepts lie behind them, which have influenced our musical theory and aesthetics, the instruments we use, and even our musical forms. Solon Michaelides is a conductor as well as a much respected scholar. His book is the first full-scale study of its kind to be published. Over 1100 entries cover every aspect of the subject from theory and instruments to poetry and the dance. There are many music examples and half-tone illustrations and detailed bibliographies. As Professor Winnington-Ingram writes in his foreword 'there are few who will not find the exploration of this encyclopaedia a fascinating and rewarding pursuit.' On publication, the book was awarded the Prize of the Academy of Athens.

It includes a section on the work of the contemporary members of Plato's Academy. ?17.5o net CAMBRIDGE CLASSICAL TEXTS AND COMMENTARIES The Epigrams of Rufinus DENYS PAGE Professor Page presents a text of Rufinus' poems and a concise commentary on them.

Chester G. Starr This book details the immense economic and social changes which took place throughout the Greek world during the three centuries before 500 B.C. It draws on literary and archaeological sources, and uses recently developed methods of analysis. Illustrated ?5.95 Hesiod: Works and Days Edited by M.L. West The Works and Days is a poem of great interest to students of Greek and comparative literature, ancient society, early agriculture, and folklore and superstition. This critical edition follows the pattern of Professor West's edition of Hesiod's Theogony. Many papyri and medieval manuscripts are used here for the first time. ?15 Plotinus: Opera II Edited by Paul Henry and Hans-Rudolf Schwyzer This second volume of Plotinus' Works is a revision of the same editors' major critical edition, published by Museum Lessianum. It contains a critical apparatus of manuscript readings and emendations, with occasional notes explaining or justifying the readings preferred against those of previous editions and translations, and a complete apparatus of philosophical sources. ?7.50 Oxford Classical Texts The Stagecraft of Aeschylus Observations on the Dramatic Use of Exits and Entrances in Greek Tragedy Oliver Taplin By examining the timing and manner of exits and entrances in Aeschylus, this book approaches the use of stage action as an essential element in the dramatist's overall meaning. Many problems of staging, construction, authenticity, and text are illuminated in the course of an original critical appraisal of the Greek tragedians as theatrical craftsmen. ?20</page><page sequence="6">The Loeb Classical Library RECENT NEW VOLUMES Each volume ?3.90 net 427 PLUTARCH MORALIA XIII Parts I and II Platonic and Stoic Essays Translated and by H.

Markotic ANCIENT EUROPE AND THE MEDITERRANEAN Studies presented in honour of Hugh Hencken. The twenty articles collected here cover a very wide spectrum of European pre-historic archaeology. They range from Northern Europe to Spain and Greece, and from trade and economic developments and the movements and interactions of peoples and cultures to discussion on the methods and aims of archaeology. 210pp A4, 63 drawings, 12 photos, cloth (March 1978) c.?17.50 Virginia Webb ARCHAIC GREEK FAIENCE Miniature scent bottles and related objects from East Greece, 650-500 B.C. The first comprehensive study of an important class of object of enigmatic origin which has been neglected by classical archaeologists. The core of the work is a detailed corpus of faience material with 160 photo- graphs, many published for the first time, which show the artistry and strange mixture of Greek and Eastern influences. The style, manufacture, origin and dating of the objects are discussed with reference to both the rich deposits from Rhodes and to comparative material from Egypt and the scene is set for a discussion of the growth of the faience industry and its Eastern Mediterranean trade. c. 160 pp. A4; 22 pp. photos, numerous maps and drawings; cloth (Autumn 1978) c.?12 P. Walcot ENVY AND THE GREEKS A study of human behaviour. Time and time again the ancient Greeks explained human behaviour in terms of envy. Man, they claimed, was naturally envious, and envy they accepted as a fact of life. This book examines how the anthropomorphic gods of the Greeks led to the concept of divine envy, the ways in which both Athenian and Spartan constitu- tions allowed for the prevalence of envy among their citizens, popular belief in the evil eye, and the solutions to the problems posed by envy offered by philosophy and religion. Studies by social anthropologists working in the field today supplement and extend the ancient evidence. 120 pp AS, (June 1978) c.?5 J. F. Lazenby HANNIBAL'S WAR A military history of the Second Punic War. The Hannibalic War was a turning point in the history of the Mediterranean world but, although its perennial fascination has led to the publication of an ever-increasing number of learned studies, there has been no scholarly account in English solely devoted to the war itself since 1886. The present work attempts to gather together fruit of research in many detailed fields, and in particular, by an analysis of the ancient sources, to ascertain what actually happened in those momentous eighteen years during which the struggle for the mastery of the Mediterranean was fought out in Italy, France, Spain, Greece and North Africa:in a sense the first "world war" in history. c. 300 pp AS; 16 photos, 22 maps &amp; plans cloth (1978) c.8.75 In preparation NR E Fisher HYBRIS JB Wilson PYLOS 425 B.C.
