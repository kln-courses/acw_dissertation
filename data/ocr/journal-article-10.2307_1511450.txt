Catwill, "The Reys Image Rendering Arch- itecture," Computer Graphics 21, No. 4 (1987), 95. Introduction The rise of modern mass culture has created a new profession- design. Like other professionals, designers must satisfy their clients while upholding a professional identity. Unlike the others, designers also establish their professionalism through the appearance of their products. The appearance of every design product not only reflects the client's desires but also signals the designer's excellence. The following article will follow this idea as it examines a particular design field-three-dimensional computer animation created for broadcast and corporate markets. Such animations include corporate and network logos as well as simulated products and environments for use in commercials and corporate presentations. The distinguishing feature of this design practice is its overdetermining concern with illusionism. In the words of the pioneers of computer animation technology, this technology aims to provide simulations of visual reality, "virtually indistinguishable from live action motion picture photography" and "visually rich as real scenes."1 Therefore, illusionism in computer animation refers to the simulation of perceptual properties of real life objects and environments (shape, shading, texture, atmospheric effects) as seen through the simulated codes of traditional cinematography (composition, lighting, choice of lens and camera movement). Illusionism should not be taken for granted as the natural and inevitable goal of computer animation. Illusionism acts as an umbrella for a number of distinct esthetic standards, such as the smoothness of image and complexity of motion. The role played by these standards is not to make computer-generated images more illusionistic, more lifelike, or more persuasive to the viewers. Rather, they allow the designers to signal their professional status, thus serving as the tools of competition within the industry. The struggle to simulate the real masks another struggle-the real war for professional survival. The starting point of this analysis is the theory of culture developed by French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu in his 18 a</page><page sequence="2">2) Pierre Bourdieu, Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1984). 3) Bourdieu, Distinction, 7. 4) Alla Yefimov, The Borders of Rep- resentation: The Amateur Described, unpublished manuscript, 1989. 5) Patricia Zimmerman, "Entrepreneurs, Engineers, and Hobbyists: The Formation of a Definition of Amateur Film, 1897-1923," in Current Research in Film, ed.

Esthetic preferences have the power to legitimate social distinctions precisely because they are proclaimed to be free of social values, to be grounded in a universal experience of beauty. In particular, the esthetic taste of the ruling classes serves to legitimate their social privilege: The denial of low, coarse, vulgar ... in a word, natural enjoyment, which constitutes the sacred sphere of culture, implies an affirmation of the superiority of those who can be satisfied with the sublimated, refined, disinterested . . . pleasures forever closed to the profane. This is why art and cultural consumption are predisposed, consciously and deliberately or not, to fulfill a social function of legitimating social differences.3 Bourdieu shows how this aristocratic taste defines itself structurally by inverting the preferences of lower class popular esthetics. Within the grand hierarchy of high and low esthetics, every social class distinguishes itself by adopting particular esthetic values, separating itself from the classes below and above. Thus, the logic of esthetic choices is one of distinction. This logic justifies both meanings of this work-to distinguish, to separate something from the rest, and at the same time to subordinate, to create the relations of hierarchy. Although Bourdieu talks about the consumers of cultural products, his insights can be extended to account for the mechanisms of distinction among the producers of culture, including design professionals. Following the argument of distinction, the esthetics of computer animation is the domain where the distinction between the professional and the amateur is most likely to be legitimated. In its emphasis on illusionism, the esthetics of computer animation can be regarded as a successor of earlier photographic and film technology. Before confronting computer animation directly, examining how the mechanisms of professional distinction historically developed in these industries can be useful. Amateur-Professional Recent writings demonstrate the importance of the amateur- professional distinction in shaping the photographic4 and film industries5 around the turn of the twentieth century. The professional and the amateur come into existence simultaneously and are defined in relation to each other, as separate markets. Crucial for the creation of this division is the adaptation of a particular technical standard, requiring considerable investment, 19 Design Issues: Vol. VIII, Number 1 Fall 1991</page><page sequence="3">such as a professional format (35 mm in the film industry, for example). Unable to afford professional equipment, amateurs are excluded from competition in the professional market. As Alla Yefimov says: 6) Yefimov, The Borders of Represen- tation, 5-6. Amateurs were defined in purely technical terms and were those practitioners who were not yet able to see financial return on their inventions or practices but, through the system of patents had a real possibility and a great chance of becoming entrepreneurs. The esthetic and social terms of amateurism appear only much later. At the next stage, the professional and amateur markets are separated, when a few companies establish professional standards for equipment, film, and distribution, and thus control access to a large industry segment. The amateurs still compete in the arena of "substandard" cost-cutting technology hoping to eventually hold patents and introduce standards on their own. Eventually, the professional segment of the market subsumes the amateur market by turning competitors into consumers.6 Today, the importance of technical standards in keeping amateurs from entering into professional markets can be seen even more clearly in the video industry. The acceptable video signal for broadcasting is explicitly regulated by the Federal Communications Commission. This specification excludes those who cannot afford the high initial investment of professional NTSC equipment from entering into video production for broadcast. Amateur users are defined by their own standards (VHS, 8 mm). The professional video market is itself segmented into submarkets, each competing for different clients, each defined through the use of a particular tape format. Companies in the industrial market use 3/4-inch or BETA, those who produce for broadcast, 1-inch or component BETA, and top players use digital formats. The difference in quality between these formats is not very substantial but the cost differential is steep. Esthetic and technical standards Industry-defined technical standards (such as NTSC video signal in broadcast and 35 mm gauge in film) are just one mechanism by which the professional-amateur distinction is sustained in film, video, and photography. There are also unspoken esthetic standards. After examining the history of these industries, it is apparent that the creation of esthetic standards went along with the adaptation of the technical ones. For instance, in the era of classical Hollywood cinema, just eight companies controlled 95 percent of the United States box office receipts. As Roy Armes 20</page><page sequence="4">points out, "outsiders were kept from this selected 'club' not by patent rights and restrictions, but by the level of investment 7) Roy Armes, On Video (London: required."7 The prohibitive cost of individual film production Routledge, 1988), 52. included not only the cost of professional equipment but also the costs of elaborate sets and costumes, the services of numerous technicians, actors' fees, and so forth. Thus, the particular esthetic standard of the movie industry, rather than catering to a pre-existent taste of audiences for grandiose spectacles, was deliberately constructed by those who controlled the market to legitimate their monopoly. This, of course, is in perfect agreement with Bourdieu's proposition that esthetic ideals, rather than being grounded in essentialist experiences of pleasure and beauty, serve to legitimate social privileges. In a similar fashion, the competition among professionals and the exclusion of amateurs in the field of computer animation is also supported by esthetic standards. These esthetic standards function as the technical standards in justifying the high investment required to produce a truly professional product. The widely held preference for illusionism in computer animation conceals these standards by claiming them to be the features of perceptual reality rather than the mechanisms of professional identification. In the next three sections, some of these esthetic standards and the ways in which they are achieved by those who commission and produce computer animations will be considered. Smoothness The separation between amateurs and professionals in computer animation is first of all achieved through the esthetic standard of smoothness. Those who can produce smooth images are recognized as professionals in the field of computer animation. Inexpensive software/hardware for three-dimensional modeling and animation uses the same algorithms as the most expensive professional packages and it provides the user with the same design tools. Yet, although the amateur can design three- m* A 33 dimensional images as sophisticated as the ones produced by professional companies, the final images, with jagged lines and continuous tones broken into visible stripes, will unmistakably look nonprofessional. In contrast to this characteristic "low-res" look, the images produced on expensive equipment have sharp lines and smooth transitions between colors (figure 1). Because more expensive displays have higher resolution and larger color pallets they automatically make any picture smoother. More important, professional three-dimensional software includes . -,:- antialiasing-special algorithms that compensate for the limited .. ...........resolution of displays, producing smooth images even with low- Fig. 1) State-of-the-art three-dimens- resolution displays. In addition, while both cheap and expensive ional simulation. Notice the absence of aliasing artifacts. (Digital Effects) packages offer the ability to do texture mapping (the technique of wrapping images around objects, which is the primary tool in Design Issues: Vol. VIII, Number 1 Fall 1991 21</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2) Although employing the same "illusionistic" techniques available in top-of-the-line professional equipment, such as texture mapping and shadows (see Figure 1), this Macintosh image displays jagged lines and broken tones. (Swivel 3D) 8) For examples, see Jules Bloomenthal, "Modeling the Mighty Maple," Computer Graphics 19, No. 3 (1985), 305-12; Geoffrey Gardner, "Visual Simulation of Clouds," Computer Graphics 19, No. 3 (1985), 297-04; Kenton Musgrave, Craig Kolb and Robert Mace, 'The Synthesis and Rendering of Eroded Fractal Terrains," Computer Graphics 23, No. 3 (1989), 41-50. modeling natural-looking scenes), only the expensive ones can antialiase maps properly, resulting in smooth images. Thus, amateur computer graphics equipment excludes exactly those features that are needed to produce professional-looking images. The "clean" look of properly antialised images appears more illusionistic than the "jaggies" of inexpensive equipment and serves to separate professionals from amateur users, at the same time legitimating their differences (figure 2). Among professionals, who already use expensive equipment with antialiasing capacity, the criterion of smoothness takes on a metaphorical dimension. The competition for the sleekest images is pursued not just through more expensive technology but also through the choice of what the images represent. Commercial three-dimensional designs uniformly model particular types of materials. While some man-made materials are smooth (metal, glass, plastic), most natural objects have irregular textures, rough edges, uneven color, and so forth. Although the techniques to model this irregularity of natural phenomena are well known, they are very rarely used in commercial three-dimensional animations. Instead, the typical logo animation presents an environment made from super-smooth "high-tech" surfaces, a world of glass, plastic, and reflecting chrome. Such an image becomes a visible metaphor of smoothness, clearly signaling a designer's professionalism. And when natural phenomena are simulated, the criterion of smoothness is still maintained. Many computer graphics researchers spend their careers perfecting algorithms to simulate the geometry of natural phenomena, atmospheric lighting effects, environmental reflections, and so on. They devote months and even years to polishing a single image or a short animation that will demonstrate the state of the art in digital simulation of nature. The images incorporate a tremendous amount of detail, yet the "nature" in them looks too clean, too airbrushed, too unnatural.8 The authors stop short of investing their images with the full irregularity and "dirtiness" of real scenes because such details may threaten their professional identity-an identity associated with the ability to produce "clean" images. To present truly irregular images is risky, since the imperfections may be attributed not to the intentional modeling of natural randomness but to cheap equipment or the animator's mistakes! Complexity If any single still in a computer animation strives for smoothness, the most general esthetic standard for the entire animation is complexity. Animation, by default, involves a sequence of images in which changes take place. The standard of complexity means that the more changes taking place from frame to frame the higher an animation is valued. 22</page><page sequence="6">As with smoothness, understanding the function of complexity requires investigating what it signifies for the designers and the patrons of computer animation. The smoothness of an image points to the cost of equipment since expensive equipment automatically produces smoother images. Therefore, a sleek image signifies both the designer's professionalism (since the designer who owns expensive equipment is automatically a pro) and the prestige of a client who can afford to pay for the use of this expensive equipment. With complexity, the difference in hardware and software is not very important. Instead, making the animation more complex requires more labor. Thus, the visual complexity of a three-dimensional animation is directly related to its cost to the client and functions as a sign of the client's wealth. The quest for complexity is reflected in numerous design strategies adopted by designers of three-dimensional computer animations. These strategies can be grouped into two categories: increasing the amount of movement of all kinds in a scene and complicating its geometry. In a sophisticated animation, all objects in the scene move, changing their positions, shapes, or colors. The complex motion of an object or the complicated camera move is preferred over simple motion; a changing background (for instance, moving clouds) is favored over a static one. But movement is not limited to the physical motion of objects. Moving lights or the use of reflection maps is also desirable, so that in the course of an animation the highlights and colors of an object constantly change. Recently, it has also become popular to use the "stretch" and "squash" features of traditional Disney animation, in which all the objects change their shapes as they move. Although the esthetics of anthropomorphism of the classical Disney code deserves special analysis, one reason for its comeback in computer animation is that it makes possible more complex 9) John Lasseter, "Principles of animations.9 This complexity separates top companies, which can Traditional Animation as Applied to incorporate "stretch" and "squash" effects through the use of 3D Computer Animation," Computer Graphics21, No. 4(1987),35-44. custom software, from the users of turnkey systems, which are limited to rigid objects. Adding all kinds of motion makes a final animation more complex. Complicating the geometry of the scene itself can also increase the visual complexity of an animation. Individual objects should have as much detail as possible. This is achieved not only by making objects more detailed geometrically but also by choosing one shading algorithm over another. Simple algorithms shade surfaces flat whereas more complex algorithms turn surfaces into continuous gradations, resulting in "rich" looking objects. Indeed, such objects are literally richer since more complex algorithms take more time to execute, thus costing a client more. Design Issues: Vol. VIII, Number 1 Fall 1991 23</page><page sequence="7">t _ - We Create What You Imagine Fig. 3) Stills from a three-dimensional logo animation, illustrating the complexity of design. (MetroLight Studios) Apart from the degree of detail in single objects, the design of the scene as a whole should demonstrate the amount of labor that went into it. This works in an interesting way in the animation of logos, which are the bread and butter of the commercial three- dimensional animation field. The default (and least expensive) animation involves bringing the logo into its final position on the screen in some way. Typically, a logo as whole flies in or its pieces assemble into the whole. But in top-of-the-line animations, the designer builds a whole architectonic construction involving many pieces, with the logo being just one of them (figure 3). Computer look The esthetic standards of smoothness and complexity discussed so far function to signify the professionalism of computer animation designers and the prestige of their clients. A client distinguishes itself by commissioning a state-of-the-art computer animation, complex and sleek. However, the choice of computer animation over other media is already significant, already prestigious in itself. Currently, a three-dimensional animation is still the most expensive video effect. Besides signifying monetary investment, computer-generated visuals readily function as signs of high-tech and scientific progress- something every company wants to be identified with. The use of computer animation signifies that the client is rich enough to pay for it and modern enough to use it. Thus, the use of computer animation is already a message-but only if the appearance of the images clearly reveals their computer origin. Three-dimensional animation, in principle, can be quite photo-realistic and hardly distinguishable from a real scene recorded on film. But if designed in this fashion, its main symbolic value is gone. Accordingly, commercial three- dimensional designs incorporate various strategies that accentuate their artificiality, even though separate elements can be quite illusionistic. These design strategies include the choice of very wide lenses, rollercoaster-like camera moves, the placement of objects in neutral space rather than in a familiar environment, the use of abstract design elements or exaggerated reflections, and so on. The overall geometric look in even top-of-the-line animations, which professional discourse blames on hardware/software limitations, also can be interpreted as quite intentional: by actually downplaying current technical possibilities, newer technology is used to simulate the old, familiar "computer look." Conclusion In considering the mechanisms of professional distinction in the field of computer animation, esthetic standards function like the technical standards. The conjunction "like" implies both 24</page><page sequence="8">similarity and difference. What these similarities and differences are may now be better perceived. Both esthetic and technical standards require a considerable investment to compete in the professional market. But although they have the same function, esthetic standards appear to be the more effective mechanism to legitimate the status of design professionals. As Bourdieu proposes, the proclaimed disinterestedness and universality of the esthetic makes it the most powerful mechanism to legitimate social distinctions. As with other esthetic judgments and tastes, the esthetic standards are justified by reference to the universal esthetic experiences of beauty and pleasure and are thought to be divorced from the pragmatic interests of social life. In contrast, the technical standards are explicitly formulated by the industry organizations and enforced by government regulations. While the connection between technical standards and the interests of professional groups is obvious, the supposed universality of esthetic standards makes them appear to be unrelated to the interests of any specific group. Thus the standards of smoothness and complexity in three- dimensional computer animation effectively serve to protect the status of professionals because they are perceived as esthetic ideals rather than as weapons of professional competition.
