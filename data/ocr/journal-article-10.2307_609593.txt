<plain_text><page sequence="1">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE: SIVA, CANDI, MANASA1 By T. W. CLARK THEN the geographical term 'Bengal' is used in any study of the old or medieval period of the literary history of the area, it must be borne in mind that it has so far been impossible to delineate its then boundaries with precision. Such early cartographical evidence 2 as there is, suggests that it is improbable that the topography of Bengal resembled very closely that which is now familiar in our modern maps. The great rivers, which are the most distinctive charac- teristic of the formation of this part of India, are known to have made consider- able changes in their courses; and the constant depositing of silt in the delta districts has almost certainly increased the area of its land surface during the centuries. It is convenient in practice however to assume that Bengal included, whatever reservations it is necessary to make in respect of its topography, the whole of the province as it was before partition in 1947, and some part of the contiguous provinces of Bihar, Orissa, and Assam. Nevertheless there is no evidence to support an assumption, all too frequently implied by modern writers, that Bengal was, during its old and medieval periods, a political, social, cultural, or a linguistic unit. Literary records are more in consonance with the con- clusion that the peoples of the area differed in occupational pursuits, social order, and religious practices. The linguistic features which distinguish Bengali from other northern languages began to emerge at the earliest in the 10th and 11th centuries, and Bengali Literature must by definition be restricted to that which was written after that time. Old Bengali Literature may be placed roughly in the age between A.D. 1000 and A.D. 1300. Medieval Bengali poetry, from part of which the evidence used in this study has been collected, is that poetry which was written in the Bengali language between, roughly as far as the former date is concerned, A.D. 1300 and A.D. 1800. It may be divided into two main classes: long narrative poems or episodic fragments of narrative poems; and short lyrics, sometimes isolated pieces, but quite frequently written in connected sequences. The total bulk of this poetry is very large. The mangalkavya, some of which it is proposed to examine, belong to the former category, and the majority of them, so far as our present knowledge goes, were written in the 16th century, an era of prolific literary activity, and the two succeeding centuries. In assessing the weight of the evidence they offer, two comments are necessary: first, none of the manuscripts we now possess are originals, for the poems were handed down in oral tradition 1 An abbreviated version of this article was read as a paper at the 8th International Congress of the History of Religions, held in Rome in April 1955. 2 See article by Bidhubhisan Ghosh, ' Ganga Bhagirathir Prabahapath ', Sdhitya-Parisad- Patrika, pt. 30, no. 4, 1953. 37 VOL.

CLARK for many generations, and were not in many cases committed to writing until as late as the 18th or even the 19th century, during which interval it is safe to assume that material alterations were made; and second, of even greater importance to some of my conclusions, the authors were not writing of con- temporary life and worship, but of periods preceding their own by three, four, or even more centuries. In the interval between the time of the events described and the date of composition, some of the stories and the popular characters who figure in them had been conventionalized and lifted from the level of folklore, resting on a basis of remembered experience, to that of literary creation at a distance, which, though often of a high order of dramatic presentation and characterization, was bound by no obligation to accurate reporting of the life, actions, and emotional and religious atmosphere of the peoples from whom the stories sprang. Of the many deities whose ways with one another and with man form the content of the mangalkdvya, three have been selected as illustrating the trends of the religious thought and practice of the age, giva, Manasa, and Candi. The life and exploits of giva are described in a number of short fragments and songs, and in longer, more pretentious compositions, named generically ' ivdyan'. The narrative poems about Manasa and Candi are known respectively as Manasa- and Candz-mangalkdvya, mangalkdvya being a technical term which may be interpreted 'poem in honour of a deity'. Bengali critics, since the time of D. C. Sen 1 at the end of the last century and the beginning of this, have been aware of two distinct strata in these poems, the rude or popular and the learned or puranic. What has not always been accepted in its full implications is the thesis that there is between these two strata a chronological relationship, and that the popular elements, so far as Bengali life and literature are concerned, are anterior to the puranic, that is to say pre-Brahmanic, and possibly also pre-Aryan. Neither has it been recognized generally that there is a third phase, which is the result of the work of thinkers, almost certainly Brahman teachers and apologists, who interpreted the popular material as they found it, in terms of an orthodox metaphysic, thereby making possible the inclusion of the stories in what may be called an orthodox Brah- manic literary canon. The postulation of this phase of activity is justified not only by the fact that without it the course of the evolution of certain religious myths cannot be accounted for, but by a further fact that terminological exponents of it are identifiable in the language of the poems themselves. It has been implied in some places that the puranic stage came first in point of time, and that religious practices which did not conform to the orthodox pattern are to be construed as a ' revolution ' against Brahmanism,2 on the supposition 1 Author of many works of criticism.

The scenes in the mangalkdvya vary in respect of geographical location between heaven and earth, with occasional glimpses of hell, as in the case of the birth of Manasa. The ' earth ' scenes will be examined first, for it is in them that the earliest material is to be found. The persons presented in the early earth scenes are rustic and unlettered, and they possess a civilization, social structure, and imaginative range from which the sophisticated tales of the behaviour of the deities could never have sprung, They were in their life concerned with crops, herds, fish, and game, with dearth and plenty; and the gods to whom they turned were of the same order. They produced heroes, whose fame increased and spread with the stabilization and multiplication of the legends about them, until in the hands of later poets they reached epic stature: Lausen, Behula, Cando, Kalketu. But though these great ones surpass in popular estimation Ram and Sita and the princely heroes of the ' Mahabharat', it is clear from the kavya that they sprang from humble indigenous sources. The Sivdyan poems, in the form in which we have them, appear to belong to, and may have been written as late as, the 18th century, and the greater part of their content concerns the life of Siva in heaven, his marriages, and his relations with other deities. There is one section however in which he descends to earth to plough the land. In the best known Sivdyan,1 that of Ramesvar Bhattacarya, who wrote it, according to D. C. Sen, about A.D. 1750, this section is brief and artificial, and the men amongst whom the god works do not come to life at all; indeed they are almost crowded out, and confined as it were to the wings to watch the operations of the heavenly being. Yet even in this generally unpropitious setting there are touches of verisimilitude, such as references to the technique of husbandry and to those annoying pests, the leech and the mos- quito; and for a while Siva is the krsak, the farmer, and likes it. In another poem,2 earlier and certainly in parts much less sophisticated, and nearer the soil, we have a fuller and more realistic picture of the farmers' god. The lan- guage is colloquial in flavour and the atmosphere of the countryside is authentic. Siva is very close to the peasants among whom he lives.3 He is naked, as they in their poverty so often are. His body like theirs is thin and weak with hunger. were characterized by a general tendency of protest against current orthodox religious systems . . . But this religious zeal of the masses has been responsible for the copious growth of the vernacular literature in spite of the derision and opposition of the higher communities, who sometimes threatened these revolutionaries with curses of hell' (italics mine). 1 sivdyan, by Ramesvar Bhattacarya, 2nd edn., printed Cal., 1903, Nutabihari Ray; p. 74 seq. 2 iSnya Purdnz, ed. for the Bangiya Sahitya Parisad by Nagendranath Basu, 1907.

CLARK He begs from door to door in his need. He smears his body with ashes because there is no oil. The peasants are aware of his presence with them as they work. When they go to the fields, it is he who holds the plough; they are his assistants running to fetch loam from the pond, and sprinkling the soil with water, for it is the earlier aus crop which is being described. In Siva, says Sen,1 who collected a number of songs from the country districts of Bengal, the farmer sees himself. It is for Siva that men work; the land is his, the seed, whether of rice or sugar or cotton, and the harvest. But whatever he has, hunger or plenty, nakedness or clothing, he shares with them. He goes before them with his golden plough and silver plough-share and the large harrow he made himself, a benevolent, kindly deity, who shares only a name with that majestic being who churned the ocean and drank down its tide of poison. To his people he is gosdi, the owner of the herd, and prabhu, master, simple terms for the simple deity of men who lived by the soil. His emblem is the plough, not the trident. Such episodes and the authenticity of their setting are, I suggest, clear testimony that in them, however much in some versions they may be overlaid with puranic accretions, lie the earliest records of giva worship known in Bengal, the worship by farming people of a krsak devatd. The early date of the cult is further instanced by the fact that when the adherents of Manasa and Candi began to carry their deities beyond their original localities, they came across people among whom the worship of Siva was already firmly established. It seems more probable that the struggle depicted in the mangalkdvya between the devotees of Siva and those of Manasa or Candi derives not from the rivalry between the philosophies of Saivism and Saktaism, but from a clash between farming people and semi-nomadic tribes, who had encroached on cultivated land, a clash which naturally involved the deities they worshipped.2 But however we interpret the struggle between the sects, the early date of the worship of a god of agriculture, named Siva, in the rice, sugar, and cotton growing districts of Bengal, seems incontestable. The story of Manasadevi, as found in its completest version, Manasa- Vijaya by Vipradas,3 recently edited with great care by Sukumar Sen, presents less difficulty in analysis than the Sivayan. It is true that there is but little popular matter in the introductory scenes, which are set in heaven; but thereafter, though the popular and puranic strands are closely interwoven, it is possible to isolate so much early matter that a detailed canto by canto examination would be needed to place it in full perspective; and considerations of space preclude 1 D.

It will suffice to treat of the episodes in the fourth and fifth cantos, which have the advantage, from our point of view, of revealing something of the circumstances of the origin of the cult and the manner of its dissemination. Manasa is a Bengali deity. Snake worship is, or at any rate was, widely practised in India and Nepal, but inquiries of scholars in northern, southern, and western Indian lore have not brought to light a single instance of the worship of a snake goddess who is herself not a snake, except that of Manasa in Bengal. She it is who rules the world of snakes and poisonous insects, but though she is full of disguises she is only once recordedl as having assumed the form of a snake. She makes the snakes work for her, but is not one of them, except perhaps in the malignity of her character. Her ways with men follow a definable pattern: first, an act of terror, followed by submission; second, the revelation of herself and the granting of boons, followed by the institution of regular worship. Propitiation to avert a plague leads to the adoption of an institutionalized ritual to prevent a recurrence. In a district like Bengal where at certain times of the year snakes abound, the plague is a natural commonplace. In Vipradas's version Manasa made her first appearance on earth to some cowherds, men whose work is often liable to be rendered dangerous, in the monsoon months particularly, by the presence of snakes in the grazing grounds. She came to them in the guise of an old woman, begging for milk; but they insulted her and threw earth at her, calling her a 'blood-thirsty witch'. She patiently explained who she was, and summoned her snakes in proof of what she said. The demonstration served only to increase their terror. They fled from her, but having collected sticks, returned to drive her and the snakes away. Later, however, as the herd was going to the river to be watered, the animals fell into a bog, and the herdsmen, realizing that this was Manasa's doing, fell at her feet and implored her forgiveness. She granted their request, and to press home her advantage, she gave them one more proof of her supernatural power, by milking a barren cow into a wicker basket and drinking the milk in an upside down position, a truly fairy-tale performance.2 Their surrender was complete, and she instructed them in the manner her worship was to follow. The principal emblems were to be a water-pot made of gold, which she provided, and a branch of the sij tree 3; and the date appointed was to be the 10th day of the bright half of the month Jyaistha. The branch of sij was placed over the mouth of the water-pot,4 and the worshippers bowed to it. The place of worship seems to have been out in the open, often under a 1 op. cit., Intro., p. xviii. The reference is to the puranic introductory cantos in Vamsidas's poem. Manasa becomes a snake and bites Candi. The poem is late, 18th century, and this episode is therefore of doubtful authenticity. 2 Vipradais: Canto 4, sections 14-16. 3 The sij tree is also known as the manasd tree. It has not been identified. Sen, ibid., has the term euphorbia nivulia; S. C. Mitra, Bengali Dictionary, names it euphorbia neriifolia in one place, and euphorbia antiquorum in another. Y. C. Ray, Dictionary of the Bengali Language, gives it as euphorbia tirucalli. 4 Vipradas, 4, 16: 'rakhiya sijero qala ghatera upara/ ghana ghana tachalima karae bahutara '. 507</page><page sequence="6">T. W. CLARK tree.1 In return, Manasa guaranteed them health and prosperity, sons and grandsons, and immunity from snake-bite. She also protected them from the tyranny of a near-by Muslim chieftain. It appears from the narrative that the cult later spread from the cattle- grazing country along one of the great rivers. Manasa's next appearance was to two fishermen, people, like herdsmen, whose work was from time to time rendered dangerous by snakes. Her approach to them was similar to the former in its general manner and the result was identical. There is however one apparent difference in method of worship which should be stated: the emblems were set up in the homes of the worshippers,2 where women3 joined with men in their devotions to the goddess. Two features of the origin and form of the Manasa rite at this stage emerge clearly: first, she was acknowledged a deity, though with reluctance at first, by country people, who accepted her, under duress, to ward off a manifest danger and to preserve to them the fruits of their labours, though her favours seem to have extended further; second, there is no mention of a priesthood, and her emblems, as far as can be ascertained, were set up by a frequented path or in the home of the devotee. It seems reasonable to suppose that Manasa was first a domestic deity, worshipped by families or occupational companions as small worshipping units. There is no evidence of corporate worship on any scale. From the fishermen, the cult began to climb the social scale. The servants of the wealthy householders told their mistresses of this new deity, who had brought prosperity to the fishermen from whom they bought their fish. It was the introduction of a Manasa pot into the house of Cando the merchant by his wife 4 that set in train the events which form the main story of the manasdmangalkdvya.5 Cando was a great gardener, one of whose wealthiest possessions was a large plantation of betel nut.6 It is significant that we see him first in the role of an agriculturalist, and only later as a sea-going merchant. Moreover he was a worshipper of Siva, and from the first was violently opposed to the introduction of Manasa into his house. He went so far as to smash the sacred water-pot with his hintl1 stave. Thereafter a conflict was inevitable: on the one part, Cando, the farmer-sailor, whose devotion to Siva had won for him the mahjiidna and the siddhi; and on the other Manasa herself, with her snakes, though she found allies in the womenfolk of Cando's household, Sanaka 1 ibid.: ' kariche bhuitera thana daraktera tale'. 2 Sukumar Sen, ibid., p. 301, speaking of Visnu Pal's mangalkdvya, says, 'The cowherds worshipped the goddess in any place '. 3 Vipradas, 5, 10: ' dui badhui laiya magoalagita gay/ bifala bajana kari nana draba layya/ manasa-cararla puje haraoita hayya'. 4 Vipradas: 5, 10-2. 5 ibid., 5 and 6. 6 The combination of these two different occupations in the person of Cando leads me to wonder whether there may have been originally two distinct legends which later writers have united in him. If there is any truth in this suggestion, it is probable that the farmer-hero legend was the earlier of the two. 508</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE his wife, his six daughters-in-law, and finally Behula, the widow of his seventh son, Lakhai. In her rage at Cando's act of desecration, Manasa sent snakes to destroy the betel-nut plantation. The devices of giva ultimately proved to be of no avail, and the rich garden became a wilderness. This incident, like other details in the popular stratum of the story, has the mark of verisimilitude. A feature of the struggle which will be examined in more detail later is that, in spite of Cando's heroism, giva proved ineffectual and inert before Manasa's vigorous and malicious onslaught. It is of interest to note that even at this stage in the evolution of the Manasa cult, there is no mention of a priestly function; the leaders of the rite seem now to be women. The ritual consists in the setting up of the water-pot in the house. The form of the cult as it has survived into modern times is now beginning to emerge. The association of Manasa with marriage today must be derived from the legend of Behula and Lakhai, who was killed by a snake on the bridal night. I have it on the authority of two Bengali ladies that the month of Sr&amp;van, when the monsoon rain drives snakes out of their holes, is regarded as inaus- picious for marriage, and that in orthodox families it is still customary to instruct a bride that, throughout the bridal night, when it is irregular for the marriage to be consummated, she must sit and watch over her husband, and must not for one single instant allow her eyes to close. The habitat of the first worshippers of Manasa cannot be located with preci- sion. The poets who are known to have written manasamangalkdvya lived in various parts of the province, but the majority of those whose homes can be identified lived in west Bengal, probably in what is now the Burdwan area, and in Backergunge, an extensive tract of riverine country lying near the delta, to the east of the Ganges but west of the main channels of the Brahmaputra. No fewer than nine districts claim the site of Campak Nagar,1 the city of Cando, including one in Assam and another in the Darjeeling district; but there is no certain evidence to justify any of the claims. Two pieces of evidence, the first of which has yet been only partially verified, add weight to the claim of west Bengal to be the first domicile of the cult: first, the only place where Manasa worship is reported to be regularly celebrated today with rites similar to those outlined in the poems, is the area round Burdwan,-the river festival 2 in east Bengal to which D. C. Sen makes imprecise reference must in the absence of fuller details be adjudged to be of later origin-; and, second, some of the 1 D. C. Sen, Bengali Language and Literature, p. 256. 2 D. C. Sen, Bengali Language and Literature, p. 255. ' In the month of graban the villages of Lower Bengal present a unique scene. This is the time when Manasi Devi is worshipped. Hundreds of men in Sylhet, Backergunge, and other districts throng to the river side or to the temples to recite the songs of Behula. The vigorous boat-races attending the festivity and the enthusiasm that characterizes the recitation of these songs cannot but strike an observer with an idea of their vast influence over the masses. There are sometimes a hundred oars in each of the long narrow boats, the rowers singing in loud chorus as they pull them with all their might. The boats move with the speed of an arrow, even flying past the river-steamers. These festivities of Manasa Puiji sometimes occupy a whole month, during which men keep vigil and recite the songs before the goddess, and are generally known as Bhisan Y&amp;tra.' 509</page><page sequence="8">T. W. CLARK poets of eastern kdvya state that their families originally lived in west Bengal, and were later for political reasons compelled to migrate. It may on these grounds be held, even if only tentatively, that the Manasa cult was born in west Bengal, and that when it spread to the rivers and was accepted by the people who sailed both them and the Bay of Bengal, it was carried to the eastern and north-eastern districts, and possibly also to Assam. The story of the goddess Candi recorded in the candimangalk&amp;vya, though differing materially, presents some features of cult evolution which resemble those which have been abstracted from the manasdmangalkdvya. As we see her first, Candi is a goddess of forest life, and her especial proteges are a hunter and his wife, who earn their living by hunting and selling meat to the people of near-by settlements; she also shows concern for the well-being of the wild animals of the forest. Kalketu, hunter and butcher, and his wife Phullara, who sells the meat for him in a village market, are poor, rough, and hard-living people, if anything even further removed from civilization than are the herds- men and fishermen of the Manasa poems. Yet it is they whom Candi, appearing in the guise of a beautiful high-born maiden, chooses to be the vehicles for the propagation of her cult. They are dismayed that she should so demean herself as to sit among the bones and squalid remains that surround the butcher's hut, but she rejects their invitation to return to her own people, and when Kalketu in despair makes a show of force to compel her to return, she strikes him motionless. She then reveals her identity. Having convinced the hero that she is the goddess Candi, she leads him and his wife to a place in the forest, where Kalketu with his hunter's knife, for he has no agricultural implements,1 digs up, under her instructions, seven jars of gold and jewels. Candi thereupon instructs him to clear the forest, establish a city and a nation, build her a temple, and conduct her worship there on Tuesdays.2 Kalketu, the butcher, is to be the founder and first priest of the sect. The second part of the story, that of Dhanpati the merchant, his two wives, Lahana and Khullana, and his son, grimanta, has no connexion with the Kalketu episode. It bears such a close resemblance to that part of the manasdmangalkdvya, in which Cando sails overseas on a trading expedition, and suffers great hardships because of his rejection of the goddess, that the influence on it, and hence the earlier date, of the Manasa poem cannot be denied. The internal evidence of the Dhanpati story leaves no doubt either that it was later, probably much later, than the Kalketu story, from which it differs so greatly in respect of content and style that it is hard to understand how a poet of the order of genius of Mukundaram Kavikankan could have con- sented to link them together in a single kdvya. In the course of following the instructions of Candi, Kalketu came into conflict with a tyrannical king who ruled over a tract of land called Kalinga, which seems to have included parts of Orissa and the coast-line of what is now the recently formed province of Andhra, a geographical identification which may be 1 Kavikaikan-Candi, ed.

II, pp. 863-4. 510</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE taken as proof that the earliest worshippers of Candi lived in south-west Bengal, in the district then known as Radha. As in the case of the manasdmangalkavya, some writers of Candi poems, including Mukundaram, who at the time of writing lived in other parts of Bengal, inform us in their autobiographical notes that their families had emanated from the south-west. Further confirmation of this location is given by Asutos Bhattacarya,l who claims to have evidence that a goddess of young men and hunting, who resembles Candi as she is depicted in the popular stratum of the mangalkdvya, is still worshipped in certain villages in Orissa.2 Later, as was the case also with that of Manasa, the new cult spread to the inhabitants of the river settlements, and was carried by them to other parts of Bengal, and beyond the seas to Malaya and Indonesia. The early history of the Candi cult as disclosed by the kdvya may be broadly summarized as follows, She was first worshipped in the south-western part of Bengal, which we may take to include part of Orissa, by people who were probably pre-aryan and nomadic within the tract of country which was their habitat. It is improbable that they had ever come under Brahmanic influence. The priesthood was apparently chosen from the people on grounds of personal suitability. Caste was no factor in the selection. I can find no evidence of objection to Kalketu's election based on the fact that he was a butcher. It would appear that Candi was not in the beginning a malignant deity. To achieve her ends, she used cunning, bribery, and some force, but not murder. The terrifying aspects of her dealings with men belong to the second half of the poems, that of Dhanpati, where the influence of the Manasa legend is present. There is a marked contrast between the manner of her release of Kalketu from prison in Kalinga and that of her rescue of Srimanta from execution at the hands of the king of Ceylon. Kalketu was saved by a dream which Candi sent to the king,3 whereas the execution of Srimanta 4 is stayed by a battle as repulsively sanguinary as that of Candika in the Mdrkandeya Purdna, which was probably its model. The Sanskrit learning, with its treasury of myth and legend, from which was drawn the puranic material which forms so large a part of the mangalkdvya as we have them to-day, began to spread widely in Bengal towards the end of the 11th century. An earlier date is unlikely, as there is no evidence of any migration of Brahmans on any significant scale until the foundation of the Sen dynasty, which roughly covers the period from A.D. 1100 to A.D. 1200. The Gupta dynasty was far in the past, and it is doubtful whether its influence had extended to the tribal areas where the cults of Manasa and Candi were born, or whether the few Brahmans they imported 5 were known beyond the narrow limits of the centres of government. The Sens were orthodox Hindus, and 1 A^utoq Bhattacarya: Banii Mangalkavyer Itihas, p. 299 seq. 2 See also S. C.

CLARK although there is no record of religions coercion or persecution, their power opened the way for the establishment of Brahmanism; and in spite of the political uncertainty and set-backs during the centuries of Muslim domination, there was no effective break in the growth of the Brahmans' religious authority and the prestige of the Sanskritic learning they brought with them. The new kings were enlightened rulers and generous patrons of scholarship and literature as well as of religious teaching. It is probable that their inclination tended not towards the suppression of indigenous cults and their mythology, but towards the incorporation of them within a framework of Sanskritic myths, thereby in effect Hinduizing them. The operation of some such tolerant and accom- modating process is confirmed by the form in which the mnangalkavya have been transmitted to us. The foregoing examination of the early material in our poems seems to warrant a conclusion that the cult of the rustic Siva was still widely practised at the beginning of the 12th century, and that those of Manasa and Candi, already developed beyond their original content and strengthened by converts from the givaite following, had travelled along the great rivers and were by that time known in the central, northern, and eastern areas of the province where the centres of Sen authority were located. The contact between these early beliefs and Brahmanic Hinduism could hardly have been later than the 12th century, because there must have been a fairly considerable lapse of time after the first contact for the primary and secondary material to be fused into integrated structures, as they clearly were before the advent of the great poets in the 15th and 16th centuries. The disruption caused by the Muslim invasions and the resultant fall of the Sens precludes any attempt to shorten this interval. The extant Sivayan poems consist almost entirely of episodes drawn from puranic sources. Of Ramesvar's composition, which is in form an agglomeration of very loosely connected parts, without a central theme, barely five per cent concerns giva the krsak devatd. The rest consists of hymns in praise of the puranic giva and various other deities and the hackneyed stories of their doings in heaven. The motive of Siva's visit to earth was not a desire to help the human farmers, but the continued nagging of his wife, the goddess Gauri, who was angered to see him sitting idly on Kailas, or at the most begging, while she and the children were without food. It is an extreme example of the almost complete obscuration of primary by secondary material. Part of the cause, perhaps a major part, was the fact that the Siva mythology had not developed human characters of heroic stature, robust and dynamic enough to resist submersion under the weight of the puranic overlay. Another cause was undoubtedly the ease with which the farmers' god was identified with Mahadeva, who immediately usurped pride of place and obscured the personality of the other, with the result that the visit to earth became merely one of many exploits, all of which originated in heaven. It is interesting to note however that one of the popular Siva songs, collected by D. C. Sen, naively keeps the question 512</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE open by querying the identity of the god, asking in a refrain at the end of each stanza, ' Jibanath ki maheo ? ' (Is Siva the Great God ?).1 Cando, Sanaka, and Behula of the manasamangalkdvya, Kalketu, Phullara and some of the minor characters of the candimangalkdvya had, early in the history of the legends, achieved a popular fame and literary stature in their own right which resisted such cavalier treatment as the humans suffered in the giva stories. The subsequent re-shaping of their stories has not obscured their human qualities, or the fact that they are Bengalis; and the greater of the poets, notably Ketakadas and Mukundaram, have been able to glorify their epic greatness and develop it in scenes of dramatic power and appeal. Nevertheless their stories were incorporated with stories of Sanskritic origin, and the whole set in a puranic frame, which, it cannot be denied, is in some versions fully worthy of its picture. The heroes were given ancestry in heaven and their actions were explained as deriving from heavenly situations, though the genius of some of the poets was occasionally able to reverse the process and import human situations into heaven. The marriage of Manasa to Jaratkaru was celebrated, as Sukumar Sen points out, according to the accepted Bengali rite. The first three cantos of Vipradas's Manasa- Vijaya are set entirely in heaven or hell, and describe the birth of Manasa from the seed of Siva, her fashioning in pdtdl, her frequent quarrels with Candi, who here is giva's wife, her saving of Siva when he fell senseless after drinking the poison from the sea, and the distribu- tion of the poison among snakes, scorpions, and poisonous insects: an unques- tionable example of what V. A. Smith calls 'the processes by means of which tribal gods are converted into respectable Brahmanical deities '.2 There are a few other episodes in these cantos, which, having no recognizable connexion with the main theme of the story, must be regarded as digressions which had grown to be part of the corpus of legends for reasons other than those of literary structure and coherence. One of these concerns Ganga,3 the eponymous goddess of the holy Ganges, whose sanctity as an accepted deity it was apparently necessary to proclaim here. Another is relevant to an historical interpretation of Manasa worship, though it is formally a digression from the story. It tells of the death of Pariksit 4 by snake-bite and of the snake sacrifice of his son, Janamejaya, and may be taken as implying an intention to establish the priority of the puranic snake stories to those of popular lore; in other words, to prove that the sages not the tribal peoples had known about snake worship, including the snake goddess, first. Another instance of the same tactic is found in the genealogy that makes Manasa mother to Astika.5 She is also described as being adorned with ndgabes,6 the Naga ornaments, an identification which carries still further a synthesis which attempts to present as one all the different snake cults and myths, whether puranic or indigenous. 1 D.

CLARK Manasa, the daughter of giva, came to earth to establish her cult; but, realizing the resistance that Cando was likely to offer, she arranged for Anirud- dha and Usa, heavenly beings, to be incarnated respectively as Lakhai, Cando's seventh son, and Behula, Lakhai's heroic wife. Dhanvantari, the heavenly sage and snake doctor, was also sent to earth as friend to Cando. Thus the principal characters of the epic story are to begin with not ordinary human beings but incarnated divinities. But poets are not necessarily philosophers, and poetry makes its own claim on those who would write it; for this reason the vitality and epic greatness of such kavya as possess them at all, springs from the indivi- dual human qualities of Bengali men and women living their life on earth and struggling against chance and circumstance. There is throughout much going and coming between heaven and earth, and the final solution of the problem, the restoration to life of Lakhai, who had been killed by the bite of one of Manasa's snakes, was reached only after Behula had ascended to make a personal appeal to a giva who is reluctant to intervene. I form the impression however that there are fewer visits to heaven in earlier works, for instance Ketakadas's, than in the later, Vipradas's; though, of course, this impression, if true, might possibly be ascribed to the poet's native wit and sense of dramatic weight rather than to the increase of puranic influence in the course of time. One marked, and in my opinion significant, difference between Ketakadas's version and that of Vipradas is the manner in which the final submission of Cando to Manasa has been contrived. In the former, Cando, being compelled to acquiesce in Behula's promise to win his submission in return for her husband's restoration to life, takes a flower and with averted head throws it towards the goddess with his left hand, a defiant and insulting gesture, which Manasa is none the less prepared to accept as a token of his surrender.l In the latter version the picture is quite otherwise: the emblems are set up with great magnificence, Brahmans are invited to perform the rites, animals are sacrificed, and Cando makes an elaborate apology for his previous ignorant actions.2 The ceremony is important in the interpretation of the story, even if it impairs the unity of characterization; and particularly noteworthy is the presence at it of Brahmans, being proof that the cult has won respectability and been admitted to canonical status. And parallel with this change in the status of the cult is a change in the status of the chief character: Cando, originally a gardener and trader, a man of low 'caste' despite his wealth, is finally spoken of as' narapati ', king. Behula and Lakhai return to heaven with Manasa, where they resume their divine station. The integration of the two levels is complete; but it is clear that the cult has travelled far from the homely rites of the herdsmen and fishermen. As was the case with the primary material, the evolution of the Candi mythology follows a course so similar to that of Manasa that a detailed analysis would involve much needless repetition. A brief mention of the main features 1 Ketakadas-Keemananda's Manasdmangal, ed. J. M. Bhatt.acarya, 2nd edn., 1950, pub. Cal. Univ. 2 Vipradas's Manasd- Vijaya: canto 13, sections 8-10. 514</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE will show how alike their two histories were. The unoriginal Dhanpati episode may be ignored; it is to that of Kalketu that we must look for reliable witness of the growth of an indigenous story through the stages of augmentation from Sanskritic sources to an ordered structure, in which both elements are fairly balanced. Candi has become the queen of heaven, the wife of the Great God, though she still retains sufficient of her early qualities to be differentiated from the Candika of the twelfth century ' Markandeya Purna '. Kalketu and Phullara are only to the superficial view to be taken as 'low caste' people; they have become divine beings, born on earth to be agents in the propagation of the Candi cult; and like Lakhai and Behula, they are withdrawn from their earthly sojourn as soon as that task is completed. The pattern of accretion and absorption is the same in both of the kdvya. The narrative of Mukundaram shows how in the hand of a genius the two strata can be blended into an artistic unity, each complementing the other and contributing what it alone had to give. The material of the popular level could conceivably have been worked into a coherent design, but the canvas would have been smaller; and it is hard to see how the puranic material by itself could ever have come alive and informed the poem with that wealth of human experience and emotion which makes it to this day so beloved of even illiterate Bengali audiences. The final part of my general thesis is that the poets of the mangalkdvya could not have proceeded with their task of fusing the two strata and inter- preting the earlier in terms of the later without the mandate of a competent religious authority. A Hindu poet, in most cases himself a Brahman, would not have thought of permitting Brahman priests to take part in Cando's ceremony of submission to Manasa without the assurance that he could do so without heresy. He was only the literary producer of a synthesis which others had contrived and placed to his hand. So behind the poet, supplying the necessary sanction for the re-shaping and presentation of his material, must be premised the philosopher-theologian, who had himself first solved the complications of a situation in which Brahmanic Hinduism was brought face to face with primitive creeds, some of them involving the worship of malignant female deities, almost certainly hitherto unknown. The operation of this process of theological justification and accommodation is the third phase of what the mangalkdvya reveal of the historical evolution of Hinduism in Bengal. Chronologically, it must be placed between the first and second phases. It was not at work during the early stages of the Siva, Candi, and Manasa cults in the localities where they were practised, or they would have been affected by it; and it must have preceded and then evolved contemporaneously with the process of puranic adaptation, which it authorized, inspired, and informed, to supply a theological foundation on which the poets could erect the composite superstructure of the mangalkdvya. It is not to be supposed that the principles, whether philosophical or methodological, which the Brahman scholars enunciated to draw primitive religions within the ample embrace of Hinduism, were specifically devised to 515</page><page sequence="14">T. W. CLARK deal with the situation they found in Bengal in the 11th and 12th centuries. Indigenous practices, including goddess worship, had been met and accommo- dated in other parts of India long before this era, as for instance, to mention some, the totemistic rites of the snake-worshipping Nagas, the deification of rivers, notably the Ganges, on which the fertility of the land depended, and the ' mother' cults of west and south India. The evidence of the Vedic hymns and the treatises which were based on them suggests that the invading Aryans had no important female deities,1 if any at all; but they encountered many among the earlier inhabitants of the country. Though dates are missing, it is possible that the metaphysical problem raised by these female powers had been solved in part, at any rate, before the beginning of the Christian era. The solution of the dilemma seems to have been found by postulating a theory of the bi-sexual nature of the primal being, who, though one and indivisible, had two aspects, male and female, which appear in literature under a variety of names, the commonest of which in medieval Bengal are Siva and gakti, Krishna and Radha. The doctrine of Sakti, the female aspect of the deity, was known in the Yogic and Tantric writings and practices of the first millennium A.D. ; and schools existed in north-east India, including Bengal, long before our period, that is before the emergence of a distinctive Bengali language. This is not the place to examine the doctrine, even if I were qualified for such a task, but it is clear that its formulation had provided scholars with a theological system they could apply to the creeds of the pre-Sen peoples of Bengal. Its elasticity and tolerance in action enabled the adherents of these primitive creeds to be received into the Hindu religious and social framework at an appropriate level, bringing their deities with them; and its authority empowered the poets in their task of synthesis at the literary level. The mangalkavya, being the work of poets, reveal the operation of the Brah- man scholars only at second hand, for which reason it is not surprising that it is difficult to abstract it from the body of the poems, as has been done in the case of the first and second phases. There are however two features in particular which owe their origin clearly to the scholars, and which, because they can be formally identified in the structure of the poems and in their vocabulary, may be re- garded as justifying the postulation of a third phase of activity in the man- galkdvya as we have received them. First is the writing of the new deities into puranic mythology, as instanced by the association of Manasa with giva and the other gods in the churning of the ocean, which has been referred to above. The second consists in the insertion into the older material of a revised, orthodox terminology, including the use for the deities of a wide range of names and epithets, most of which are transferences from the vocabulary used for the gods and goddesses of the Aryan pantheon. It is easy for a modern reader to fail to realize the importance of these verbal intrusions because of the general accep- tance of them today. There are also numerous references to orthodox belief 1 R. G. Bhandakar, Vaisnavism, naivism, and Minor Religious Systems, Triibner, Strassburg, 1913, p. 142 seq. 516</page><page sequence="15">EVOLUTION OF HINDUISM IN MEDIEVAL BENGALI LITERATURE and practice which are made so naturally, indeed with such apparent casualness, that it requires vigilance to detect them. The poets have served the Brah- man priests well. There is, in other words, no explicit statement of the religious issues involved; they had been solved, and in the mangalkdvya were taken for granted with such easy assurance that there is but little trace of any conflict left. The Bengali giva, having been identified with the puranic Siva, assuming thereby the latter's heavenly habitat, his characteristics, and his names, is in the philosophy of the mangalkdvya the male aspect of the primal being. His inability or unwillingness to protect his adherents against the onslaughts of Manasa and Candi, so easy to account for in the early tribal form of life from which the cults originally sprang, cannot be explained in the new context, without reflection on his godly prestige, except by recourse to the doctrine that giva without Sakti is inert.1 Yet the poets express no surprise at his seeming callousness in abandoning Cando and Dhanpati to prolonged persecu- tion, which is surely proof of the established acceptance of the doctrine before their time. giva and Candi are husband and wife, in which relationship is to be found an anthropomorphic figure of their unity within the person of the primal being. Candi is gakti. Further evidence lies in the indiscriminate use for her of the names of other incarnations of gakti in the varied stories of the puranas: Parvati, Uma, Bhavani, Abhaya, etc. She is also frequently referred to as Candika, the name of the goddess of ' Markandeya Purana '. When she appears in her glory to Kalketu, she does so under the guise of mahisamardin7, one of the best known figures of Durga; and she is attended by the eight traditional aspects of Sakti, the asta ndyikd. She is also, in Mukundaram's kavya, referred to as ddyasakti, 'the 'primal Sakti', in which epithet the metaphysical identification is complete. In the case of Manasa, on the other hand, there are indications that she was not easily embraced within the ample circle of orthodox belief. She is the daughter of giva, not his wife, being born of his seed which fell into a lotus flower and travelled down its stem into pdtdl, where it was fashioned by Vasuki's mother into a beautiful girl. Some of the names used for her are individual and reflect her personal attributes as goddess of snakes: Visahar;, 'she who removes poison'; Visadhar;, 'she who contains or controls poison'; Totald and Jdgul, names which occur in the manasamangalkdvya only, and which Sukumar Sen ascribes to a tantric origin. The names Padmrdvat; and Kamald she shares with the goddess Laksml. The name Ketakd, which occurs frequently, is difficult. According to Sen, Ketakd is the daughter and wife of Dharma, and the mother of Siva. It is a heterogeneous collection, impossible to 1 Saundarya-Lahari, ed. S. S. gastri and T. R. S. Ayyangir, pub.

But in the closing canto of 'Manas-Vijaya ', the goddess is referred to as adimdtd, 'primal mother', an epithet which makes clear the general intention of the poet and of the teaching he represented; and it is the intention to provide a formula whereby primitive cults could be admitted within the canon of Hinduism, which constitutes the third phase in the evolution of that religion, as it is revealed in the mangalktvya of medieval Bengal.</page></plain_text>
