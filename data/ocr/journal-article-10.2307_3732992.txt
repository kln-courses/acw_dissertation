This book has been long-awaited and much-needed. Now it is published, it is no disappointment. Would that the author had been able to deal with a longer period - but her choice of thoroughness instead of chronological spread is amply justified by the result. The book starts with a coup d'aeil at the privilege system as it developed across Europe, but quickly settles into a systematic analysis of all the aspects of the development and use of privileges in France until 1526, with chapters concerning the privilege-granting authorities, the legal procedures involved, the grounds on which privileges were granted, the dating and duration of privileges (in this period usually two or three years, with variations depending on the granting authority), the display and advertising of privileges, a subject analysis of the books protected (especially interesting), the ownership and transfer of privileges, and their enforce- ment and efficacy. Elizabeth Armstrong concludes that within twenty years the majority of books being printed for the first time were covered by privileges. Authors and publishers were prepared to invest not inconsiderable sums on fees in the expectation of a worthwhile return; later in the century the dwindling supply of unpublished literature placed a new emphasis on the authors of new literature as printers sought material to publish. Armstrong has examined thousands of books in pursuit of the basic knowledge which underpins this work, and further applied her profound knowledge of the literature of the sixteenth century. The result is far richer than a mere listing of the privileges she has unearthed. But for good measure there is a Register of some 400 privileges, divided usefully according to the authority by which they were granted (Royal Chancery; Parlements and other Sovereign Courts; Royal Officers; authority not known), presented in exemplary form. We must hope that the thousands of other privileges which Armstrong has recorded can somehow eventually be listed, and the lists published and analysed. The present work indicates just how valuable that information would be. UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW STEPHEN RAWLES The Dissident Montaigne. By MAX GAUNA. (American University Studies, 2: Romance Languages and Literature, 118) New York, Bern, Frankfurt a.M, and Paris: Lang. I989. xiv + 303 pp. ?31. This is an interesting but, in some ways, infuriating study: interesting because of the scholarly and pertinent points it raises, infuriating because of the pedestrian method employed. Max Gauna has set out to 'examine the credentials of the case to be made for considering the Essais as containing upwellings of that great countercurrent of dissidence which flows under the surface of religious conformity' (p. I). In pains- taking fashion he has gone through the Essais, chapter by chapter, page by page, and often line by line, commenting upon the significance of Montaigne's remarks about religion. He has forestalled eventual criticism to a certain extent by admitting that the Essais may say things which Montaigne may not have understood as such, or contradictory things in different contexts and with differing intentions (p. 3). He contrasts his own interpretation of Montaigne's words with that of previous readers such as Sclafert, Dreano, Smith, and Screech, especially the latter, often harshly. His conclusion is one which many of us could accept: that Montaigne had a healthy sceptical attitude towards religious tenets and that he had an 'inability to come to terms either intellectually or emotionally with anthropomorphic conceptions of the</page></plain_text>
