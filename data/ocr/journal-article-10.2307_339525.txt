Oviedo: Instituto de Estudios Asturianos, 1974. 292 pp. This extraordinary book is a pioneering work, a "must" not only for Clarin specialists. It suc- ceeds in applying to Spanish literature the styl- istic approach of R. A. Sayce (Style in French Prose. A Method of Analysis). We must point out, however, that this praiseworthy accomplishment required more than an automatic transfer of critical tools from one field to another. Prof. Nfiiez is well acquainted with the stylistic re- search of other Hispanists, as evidenced by several pertinent references. She is also aware of non-Hispanist criticism, e.g., Snell, Coseriu, Bally, Richter, Ullmann, Biihler, Cressot. She has studied likewise the previous scholarship on Alas. But of course, sources and information are not enough. Intuition, organization, and cogency are needed, and this is where Ndfiez displays impressive gifts as a critic. Her book progresses from an examination of single words according to part of speech. It covers syntactic structures, first dealing with composition of the sentence; then with enu- merative, conceptually reiterative, and phonical- ly reiterative structures. Here she exhibits great critical cogency, analyzing passages where such devices as alliteration and anaphora accord with the conceptual aspects of Clarin's prose, which appears sometimes to attain the characteristics of poetry. The third chapter focuses on Clarin's use of simile and metaphor to obtain an inter- penetration of the material and spiritual realms, a characteristic of determinist naturalism. Especially instructive are the following: the onomastic discussion, including the analysis of the suggestive power of the name, La Regenta; the toponymic study; antonomasia (p. 49); the impressionist treatment of colors; animism; ex- pressionism; the brilliant analyses of Clarin's materialization of intangibles and original color symbolism (p. 67); synaesthesia; animalization; anthropomorphic verbs; oscillation between anal- ysis and synthesis; the amazingly masterful analysis of the first three paragraphs of La Re- genta; "cosificaci6n"; assonance; binary con- structions; "bimembraci6n"; chiasmus; liturgical parody; polyvalent symbols; triple adjectiviza- tion; and metricism. It is interesting to compare her analysis of a Regenta passage (p. 256) with Garcia Donminguez's in Archivum, 19 (1969), 224. Ndfiez is unconvincing in a few places. Her concept of verb aspect appears vague (p. 160). She is wrong in interpreting the passage on pp. 263-64 as "visi6n artistica objetiva." We need only read Maupassant's Bel Ami or his salon articles to understand the connection that a naturalist would make between the sterility of academic art and Ana's state of mind. Several passages of Su tinico hijo are misin- terpreted owing to Ndfiez's overlooking Alas's antifeminist essay, "Psicologia del sexo" (Ilustra- cidn Ibhrica, vol. 12 [1894]), indispensable for an understanding of the deep structure of this novel. In accordance with his biologically gen- erated pessimistic naturalism, Alas believed in the intellectual irreconcilability of the sexes. In Su tinico hijo he ironically presents egoism as pseudo-altruism, according to a system in which the Comtian scale of affects has been radically altered by positing two sexually differentiated altruisms (i.e., what for Comte is maternal ego- ism is for Alas feminine altruism). In fact, Ndfiez's confusion, attributable to her ignorance of this macrostructure, constitutes a felicitous refutation of Sayce's exaggerated claim for the superiority of the stylistic method, quoted on p. 13, n. 12. Though not superior to others, it is an indis- pensable method, and Ndfiez's masterful book is highly recommended. PIEEUniv. of Wisconsin- L.
