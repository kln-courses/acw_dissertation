<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROST AND ELIOT JEFFREY HART AS the first half of the twentieth century begins to re cede, and acquire shape as history, Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot seem to loom ever larger in the landscape of American poetry. Each complements the other. They are re lated dialectically, and the achievement of each is enhanced by that relationship. Twenty-five years ago one would not have been inclined to say "Frost and Eliot." Eliot was by far the dominant figure. But it is accurate to say that during the past generation Frost has been gradually reperceived. Truly first-rate Frost criti cism remains relatively rare compared with the sustained and intense attention accorded Eliot. On Frost we have only a handful of first-rate essays, by Randall Jarrell, James M. Cox, William Pritchard, and a few others, plus some aca demic work; but the biography by Lawrance Thompson has been important, and above all the poetry has gradually estab lished its claims as a major body of work. If one reads Frost's and Eliot's volumes in the order of their appearance, from A Boy's Will (1913) and Pr?f rock and Other Observa tions (1917) through Four Quartets (1943) and In the Clear ing (1962), Frost is by no means overwhelmed by Eliot. Different as the two poets are in many ways, and though Frost conducted a kind of private war with Eliot, it is possible to discern interesting resemblances beneath the obvious con trasts. In both men the central theme is metaphysical desola tion. Both poets are profoundly at odds with the current of secular optimism flowing from the enlightenment through the nineteenth century. Frost's New England landscape, spare, hard, and usually unyielding, inhabited by its declin ing Yankee stock, can be taken as an extended metaphor ex pressive of that desolation. In Frost's poetry the central per sona or dramatic voice speaking the poems finds ways to</page><page sequence="2">426 FROST AND ELIOT live with that desolation. In Eliot's poetry the central persona lives through and finally beyond the desolation. Both Frost and Eliot were in the broad sense of the word conservatives, though of very different kinds. Frost liked to deliver himself of querulous remarks regarding the New Deal, but at bottom his conservatism had to do with both the valid claims of the self and his sense of limits, limits of near but not altogether complete intractability. There are limits in the form of psychological and physical barriers between people ( "Home Burial," "Into My Own," "Mending Wall," "A Hun dred Collars"), the limits implicit in the act of choice ("The Road Not Taken," "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Eve ning"), the barriers between man and nature ("Two Look at Two," "Storm Fear," "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things"), the limits that make a mockery of political ideal ism ("New Hampshire"), limits to the value of science ("The Star-Splitter"), limits to the wisdom of the world ("Provide, Provide"), limits to what we can know about the past ("Van ishing Red"), the limits implicit in mortality ("Out, Out?"). If it is accurate to say, with Kenneth Minogue, that the liberal sensibility is distinctively concerned with the claims of victims, real and imagined, then we find in Frost some thing quite different and opposed: a resolute defense of the valid claims of the self ("Love and a Question," "Two Tramps in Mud Time," "A Considerable Speck"). In con trast to Eliot the central figure in Frost does not "develop." Instead he increases in solidity and weight through a kind of dramatic accumulation. The drama consists of his changing relationship to those limits. The limits are real; that is the un utopian donn?e. But there are moments when he gets past or through them. In Frost the voice of reason and of skepticism is para mount, the "sound of sense"; but Eliot is a thaumaturge, mesmerizing us with mysteries and incantations, the "sense of sound." He once remarked that poetry began with a savage beating a drum in a jungle, and for all of its learning one</page><page sequence="3">JEFFREY HART 427 senses the presence of the primitive in Eliot's poetry. He engages us in an enormous act of recovery, reaching back beyond the present to "the mind of Europe"?not only "from Homer to the present" but also to the spiritual perceptions recoverable from the great myths. The Golden Bough h? read "as a revelation of that vanished mind of which our mind is a continuation." II Beginning in 1923 with the collection New Hampshire, Frost conducted a kind of literary guerrilla warfare against Eliot. If Frost took the offensive, however, he was also engaged in defensive operations, designed to defend the validity of his own poetry. Frost plainly believed in 1923 that he had to offer a rejoinder to the author of The Waste Land, which had been published in 1922 and had immediately become one of the most influential works of the modern movement. When New Hampshire appeared, Frost at forty-eight was a well-known and frequently honored poet. The title poem "New Hampshire" constitutes a Frostian manifesto and con tains an almost explicit attack on Eliot as one who "took dejectedly/His seat upon the intellectual throne." It is strik ing to note that "New Hampshire" (414 lines) is almost the same length as The Waste Land (434 lines), and that it defines, as does The Waste Land, the imaginative world of the poet. New Hampshire is Frost's answer to Eliot's desert. The notes Eliot appended to his poem were of course notorious; the second section of Frost's volume, following the long title poem, consists of shorter poems with the collective designation Notes. In the first edition the title poem con tained footnotes referring to the later poems. Frost seems to be implying several things here, playfully but also seriously. That he is a poet, not a pedant. That "New Hampshire," in contrast to the desert, "gives birth": the poems included as Notes often amplify some theme or incident in the title poem.</page><page sequence="4">428 FROST AND ELIOT The third and final section of the volume was originally called Grace Notes, a declaration, I take it, of further fecundity, with perhaps a pun intended on the word grace, offering an ironic comment on Eliot's religious preoccupa tions.* In the poems that follow and frequently are related to the title poem, the glances at Eliot are frequent. "The Census Taker" brings the Frostian sensibility to a waste land, here a deserted logging site, a tarpaper shack surrounded by an autumn landscape of tree stumps. Negation echoes through the poem: I came as census-taker to the waste To count the people in it and found none, None in the hundred miles, none in the house. . . . Frost here confronts his own version of the waste land, and pointedly remarks that you do not have to go abroad to en gage spiritual experience: This house in one year fallen to decay Filled me with no less sorrow than die houses Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe. The poem characteristically concludes, not with the expecta tion of theophany as in The Waste Land, but with the asser tion of the will, and specifically an earthly will, against the void. The melancholy of having to count souls Where they grow fewer and fewer every year Is extreme where they shrink to none at all. It must be I want life to go on living. * Louis Untermeyer quotes Frost as remarking early in 1940: "Eliot and I have our similarities and our differences. We are both poets and we both like to play. That's the similarity. The difference is this: I like to play euchre. He likes to play Eucharist.,,</page><page sequence="5">JEFFREY HART 429 There may be more in his poetic universe than the human will, but here Frost insists on at least that element. Other poems in the New Hampshire volume glance un mistakably at Eliot. "Wild Grapes" is a kind of rewriting of the earlier poem "Birches" with an Eliotic rebirth theme woven in. The poem playfully glances at the myths. Frost's sacred wood lies in New Hampshire. Other poems in the volume, read individually, would not carry the implicit allu sion to Eliot, but read in their context they easily do so. Con sider in this light "Fragmentary Blue," "To Earthward," "Fire and Ice," and even the familiar "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." The tough-minded conclusion of the last poem, "The Need of Being Versed in Country Things," can be read as a rejoinder to the urbane Eliot immersed in his "unreal city." Poem after poem in New Hampshire carries this resonance, even such an unlikely candidate as "The Pauper Witch of Grafton." The Waste Land is full of sexual defeat. That is its subject, both in itself and as a metaphor for a larger sterility. In "The Pauper Witch of Grafton" Frost in effect replies that he can write a triumphant poetry of sexual fulfillment. Ill Returning now to "New Hampshire," I will confine myself to Frost's central act of self-definition. The poem as a whole is immensely rich. Frost fashions the state of New Hampshire before our eyes into a poetic world of many modes and many voices, a poetic quarry from which the subsequent poems are drawn, a quarry of apparently inexhaustible resources. In its central section Frost addresses himself to the subject of New Hampshire's mountains?the opposite of a desert flatland. A bit earlier Frost had quoted Emerson to the effect that "the God who made New Hampshire/Taunted the lofty land with little men," and (in line 308) he returns to the theme of the mountains and makes of them a symbol of the poetic imagination in operation.</page><page sequence="6">430 FROST AND ELIOT If I must choose which I would elevate? The people or the already lofty mountains, I'd elevate the already lofty mountains. His poetic imagination will go to work on those mountains and in the process give birth to a kind of personal myth. Frost begins by inquiring: What has given me assurance To say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains, Or any mountains? He goes on to consider, and reject as far as he is concerned, several common accounts of the nature of art. He suggests that the idea of enlarging the mountains originated in a mis take on an old map, "the sad accident of having seen/Our actual mountains given in a map/Of early times as twice the height they are." A large creative act, we understand, can be triggered by trivia, by accident. Our attention thus naturally shifts away from the trivial occasion to the creative act itself, which, with a dramatic heightening of the tone, blank verse turning to rhyme, Frost performs before our eyes: Whereas I never had a good idea About improving people in the world, Here I am over-fertile in suggestion, And cannot rest from planning day or night How high I'd thrust the peaks in summer snow To tap the upper sky and draw a flow Of frosty night air on the vale below, Down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry. Here he steps forward explicitly as the creator of his own poetic world. His "New Hampshire" is not the actual state but a poetic artifact. We see him creating part of it. That pun on the poet's name?a "flow/Of frosty night air"?is</page><page sequence="7">JEFFREY HART 431 surely intentional. There is a chill in Frost's poetry and he knows it; that chill is the imaginative signature Frost. He embodies it here in his symbolic myth of his own art. To the heat of Eliot's symbolic desert, burning, burning, Frost offers by way of contrast the cold summer snows of those imagined mountains. In the final section of "New Hampshire" Frost gives us his declaration of independence as a poet, and he defines the persona which will be and has been its dramatic expression. He rejects both the inhibitions of the older genteel tradition and the newer fashion on wallowing in misery. He scorns "the new school of the pseudo-phallic," by which he presum ably means the cult of Lawrence and the popular versions of Freud current in 1923. Attacking Matthew Arnold, he also hits obliquely at the author of The Waste Land. In "The Scholar Gypsy" Arnold had written about the despondency pervading Victorian intellectual life, and about "One"? perhaps Tennyson, whose In Memoriam had been published in 1850 when he succeeded Wordsworth as poet laureate: and amongst us One, Who most has suffer'd, takes dejectedly His seat upon the intellectual throne; And all his store of sad experience he Lays bare of wretched days; Tells us his misery's birth and growth and signs. . . . This great poet of despair may be the author of In Me moriam; the pronoun may also include the author of Dover Beach, who contemplates his buried life or alterego in the form of the Scholar Gypsy. In 1923 Frost's allusion could hardly fail to suggest the author of The Waste Land, another great poet of despair?but it also defines Frost himself as a kind of Scholar Gypsy: 6</page><page sequence="8">432 FROST AND ELIOT For early didst thou leave the world, with powers Fresh, undiverted to the world without, Firm to their mark, not spent on other things; Free from the sick fatigue, the languid doubt. . . The public self he chooses does have affinities with the Scholar Gypsy of the Arnold poem. In choosing this persona he carefully calls attention to the fact that this is an act of choice, an imaginative creation: "I choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer." IV When the critics and literary people equipped to understand Robert Frost finally did recognize that he belongs among the most powerful poets of our time?a recognition that came absurdly late, actually when Frost was in his seventies?when, that is, informed recognition finally did arrive, there was still something askew about it, something out of focus, some dis abling distortion in the very terms of its definition. Frost was no cracker-barrel philosopher, we were reassured. No, he was a "terrifying" poet, a spirit out of the abyss, a journeyer into the heart of darkness. In that famous speech on Frost's eightieth birthday Lionel Trilling, very consciously (even self-consciously) reacting against the popular cracker-barrel Frost, presented us with the Revised Version. "I think of Robert Frost as a terrifying poet," he said. "The universe that he conceives is a terrifying universe. Read the poem called 'Design' and see if you sleep the better for it. Read 'Neither Far Out Nor in Deep.' " This vein of criticism con centrates on these and other such "pessimistic" poems as "Ac quainted with the Night," "The Most of It," and "Desert Places" to fashion that terrifying and so recognizably?and reassuringly?modern Frost. Frost, Trilling was saying, is really all right despite the unpromising first impressions. Like the popular version of Frost this one too misses the</page><page sequence="9">JEFFREY HART 433 point. Surely it is the point of Frost that he precisely refuses to be terrifying; his refusal is virtually programmatic. Terror, at least in literature, is?though not comforting?at least en hancing. Literary terrorism moves us and thrills us, and as it does so it confers a certain sort of stature. The circumstance or the person capable of generating terror becomes through that very capacity dramatic, important, striking. But Frost refuses us this experience. He stops just short, points, and draws back. In so drawing back he forces us to confront something in its own way worse than terror. There is a bleak ness, a barrenness in Frost which corresponds to something bleak and barren in the American reality, sensed not only in the dying Yankee culture which is the subject of his poetry, but with equal intensity in a Los Angeles suburb or the plains of the Midwest; and it is somehow also a presence in American history, whether one thinks of the grinding bleak ness of that advancing frontier or of, say, one of Grant's re lentless campaigns. Frost's poetry deals with a pervasive as pect of American reality, something inescapable; but it is not terror. Frost's refusal, sensed everywhere in his poetry, to comfort us with something grand, with the purgation of terror and tragedy, is connected with his skepticism and his rationalism, though these are to be understood as habits of mind, not anything systematic; hence this frame of mind constitutes a kind of chastity of the imagination. Temperamentally he is rooted very much in the eighteenth century, that eighteenth century New England with its spare white churches and chaste classical fa?ades as well as the Lockean eighteenth century with its distrust of enthusiasm and its analytic sus picion of similarities, analogies, metaphors. Things have differences. Frost is as wary of metaphor as Swift, or Dryden, or Pope. Like them he is unwilling to give the emotions their way completely, to say my love is like a red red rose, to per mit the awful daring of a moment's surrender. The chiU of reason is always there, the Frostian chill, and he is aware of</page><page sequence="10">434 FROST AND ELIOT the pun. There is always the cooling touch of humor or irony, or perhaps a single deflating word. Consider one of his characteristic "dark" poems, "Desert Places," which might be cited to sustain the claim that Frost is a "terrifying" poet. The scene is the familiar one of "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," but here the falling snow and the gathering night possess none of the real if also sinister attractiveness that they have in that poem. The whiteness gradually cover ing the earth is pure negation?repulsive, blank, and be nighted. It has no expression, nothing to express; nature is alien, numbing, meaningless. The poet thinks of the similar barrenness of the stars, and of the famous sentence from Pas cal's Pens?es: "The eternal silence of these infinite spaces terrifies me." But he changes his Pascal, using instead of terrifies the homely and diminishing word scare. He knows about the "desert places"?Eliot's Waste Land is just offstage in this poem?but he is not mastered by the desert, over whelmed, terrified. By the time we reach the last line we rea lize that the subject of this poem is just that refusal to com fort himself and the reader. He can "scare" himself, he has it in him to do so?but in fact he won't. He knows the mean ing of that desert, but the reason and the will remain in charge. Similarly the entire tone and meaning of the poem "Acquainted with the Night" are conditioned by the single word acquainted. The poem is about loneliness, fear, hys teria?the emotions traditionally associated with night taken as a symbol?and the poem convinces us that the poet is no stranger to them. But in this poem he uses the word ac quainted; whatever his past experience with them he now will admit openly only to acquaintance: the formality of the word distances that terror. Once again the point is his re sistance and refusal. The reason and will remain in control, if only by the narrowest margin. V The characteristic movement of skepticism and rationalism in</page><page sequence="11">JEFFREY HART 435 Frost's poetry is back to earth. In "New Hampshire" Frost created a myth in which the "frosty" night air flows down to the vale below, "down from the stars to freeze the dew as starry." From the early "Trial by Existence" to the very last poems this insistence on the primacy of earth (as against the transcendent) is one of Frost's principal themes. It is fundamental to his imaginative differences with Eliot. The early and immensely popular "Birches," which can be read as a Frostian manifesto, glances toward transcendence, but then turns back to make room for a different kind of affirma tion. In "Birches" the poet begins by recalling that he has seen birches permanently bent by the ice that collects on them in the winter, and then he toys with a pleasant fancy. When he looks at birches bent in this way, he "like[s] to think some boy's been swinging them." But he knows that this is not true?that the trees bent by ice all winter are permanently bent and that swinging does not do this, and he withdraws the thought almost as soon as it is offered. In this seemingly casual discourse, a serious point is being broached: truth has asserted its claims at the expense of fancy. Ice, not a boy playing. But fancy is not defeated. It comes forward again in the form of a playful simile. The trees, bent by the ice, now arch in the woods Like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair Before them over their heads to dry in the sun. Only "like" girls. The poet returns to the ordinary world of prosy reality: But I was going to say when Truth broke in With all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm I should prefer to have some boy bend them As he went out and in to fetch the cows....</page><page sequence="12">436 FROST AND ELIOT The resistance to the metaphorical mode throughout the first part of the poem is important?indeed it is the subject of the poem: the Frostian skepticism will admit no easy beauties, and this skepticism prepares us for the emblematic passage which follows. The poet himself, we hear, was a swinger of birches when a boy, and now, when "weary of considera tions" and when "life is too much like a pathless wood," he dreams of going back: "I'd like to get away from earth awhile/And then come back to it and begin over." Frost's "pathless wood" in this poem can hardly fail to re mind us of Dante. Frost too has been lost in that wood. He would like to get away from earth awhile?but only for awhile. Frost will not go on with Dante to the Paradiso and the heavenly love of Beatrice; the movement is back to earth, a movement analogous to those lines in which Truth success fully asserted its claims against fancy: May no fate willfully misunderstand me And half grant what I wish and snatch me away Not to return. Earth's the right place for love: I don t know where it's likely to go better. I'd like to go by climbing a birch tree, And climb black branches up a snow-white trunk Toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more, But dipped its top and set me down again. That would be good both going and coming back. One could do worse than be a swinger of birches. It is the point of the birches that they climb toward heaven, but also return the poet to earth, for "earth's the right place for love:/I don't know where it's likely to go better." The skepticism is pervasive, and works both ways: he does not know where it is 'likely" to go better. Issues of epistemology and probability lurk behind the line. We are in the men tal climate of eighteenth-century skepticism, and among eighteenth-century philosophical issues; we think of Locke</page><page sequence="13">JEFFREY HART 437 and Berkeley, and of Hume. And this eighteenth-century skepticism, this resistance to metaphor and analogy, takes on an ultimate importance in Frost, for all philosophical the ology, all affirmation of connection between time and eter nity, man and God, depends on some form of analogy: it gets us from here to there and back again. Despite his pervasive skepticism, and despite the experience evoked in the lines about the pathless wood, Frost does make his affirmation. Not only that "earth's the right place for love" but that, as in the childhood joys of swinging birches, earth enables us to climb "toward" heaven. Whether we ever get closer or not, our approach is from earth. These affirmations, moreover, are all the more potent because earned amid the surrounding skepti cism. The final two lines develop enormous power: good both going away and coming back to earth. Then in the seemingly casual throwaway: "One could do worse. . . ." Read in this way, "Birches" asserts the claims of Frost's skepticism and sense of human limits against the desire for transcendence and the sense of mysterious possibility. His goal is to wring a great poetry out of an irreducible minimum, to triumph over the possibility of desolation which is always present, and is never finally transcended. The triumph is in its way as impressive as Eliot's. VI If the Frostian mode characteristically keeps things separate, insisting on their differences, the central impulse of Eliot's poetry is to achieve coherence by perceiving identities. The disparities of the early poetry become the final identities of Four Quartets. Eliot has suggested that Shakespeare's plays can be read as a single long poem. So can Eliot's oeuvre be read. It moves from the fractured metaphor with which "Prufrock" begins,</page><page sequence="14">438 FROST AND ELIOT Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherised upon a table, to the culminating conceit in which the most disparate things are perceived as one: "The fire and the rose are one." The parts of a world have been put together, but not wholly in time's covenant. Eliot's poetry also moves through a succession of voices to the final purified voice of "Little Gidding," where no persona is left to be shed. Thus J. Alfred Prufrock refuses to be the great poet of The Waste Land. He might, but cannot, say I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows. . . . That is, he cannot be the great poet of modern urban truth. And he might, but cannot, say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,/Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all." Pru frock will not tell us what it is like to be dead. He ends as a minor romantic sensibility: "I have seen them riding sea ward on the waves. . . ." But another voice later takes up the challenge thus refused. "April is the cruellest month." Laza rus will tell us all, after all. For the American aspect of Eliot's journey I would like to focus on "The Dry Salvages," which can be read as his "an swer" to Frost and to America. I accept in general the thesis proposed in a famous essay by Donald Davie. In Four Quar tets "The Dry Salvages" sticks out like a sore thumb. It does contain some magnificent passages, but also some conspicu ous ineptitudes, in both form and content. This "American" quartet is deliberately defective, and the defects express a judgment. Davie notices, for example, the conspicuous awkwardness</page><page sequence="15">JEFFREY HART 439 of the sestina, as in the sequence of rhymes: "motionless," "emotionless," "devotionless," "oceanless," "erosionless." The poet or persona here is clearly overcome by the demands of form. And telltale ineptitudes abound throughout. We have the inert clich? "worshippers of the machine," the flaccidity of "watching and waiting," the vague idea that the rhythm of the river "was present in the nursery bedroom." The allu sion to Krishna may also be a signal to the intellectually wary: "I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant." Earlier, at Harvard between 1911 and 1914, Eliot had applied himself to oriental studies, which had recently had a consider able American vogue. As he later said: "Two years spent in the study of Sanskrit under Charles Lanman, and a year in the mazes of Pantanjali's metaphysics under the guidance of James Woods, left me in a state of enlightened mystification." Yeats once remarked about "those translations of the Upani shads, which it is so much harder to study by the sinking flame of Indian tradition than by the serviceable lamp of Walt Whitman." And Whitman turns out to be a presence in "The Dry Salvages," in "the rank ailanthus of the April door yard," and in the Whitmanesque "fare forward, voyagers" re frain of section 3. In T. S. Eliot and Walt Whitman Sydney Musgrove observes of this passage that "Eliot has employed Whitman's material and manner in order to reject his phi losophy. For Whitman, time stretches away in one infinite linear direction. . . . For Eliot, the sense of direction is illusory; time is an eternal present." "The Dry Salvages" ex plicitly rejects other themes easily associated with the nine teenth century and with American secular optimism gener ally: It seems, as one becomes older, That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere sequence? Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy, Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution, Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of dis owning the past.</page><page sequence="16">440 FROST AND ELIOT And it offers a comment on the trivialization of culture that results from this mistaken conceptualization of time: To communicate with Mars, converse with spirits, To report the behaviour of the sea monster, Describe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry, Observe disease in signatures, evoke Biography from the wrinkles of the palm And tragedy from fingers_ "The Dry Salvages" is parodie, a deliberate mixture of the true and the false, the beautiful and the inept, insight and confusion. As Davie puts it, "It is hardly too much to say that the whole of this third quartet is spoken by a nameless persona; certainly it is spoken through a mask, spoken in character as an American. This, and nothing else, can explain the approximations to Whitmanesque and the other pre symbolist American verse procedures." That persona is recog nizable as a compound American ghost; the echoes are of Mark Twain, Whitman, Melville, perhaps Emerson and Henry Adams. "It is thus," Davie says, "that the incompe tence turns out to be dazzling virtuosity; and the inhumanity of the conclusion reached turns out to be only a parody of the true conclusion reached in 'Little Gidding,' which is thoroughly humane in its insistence that all varieties of hu man folly and imperfection are the conditions for appre hending perfection, that the world is therefore necessary and to that extent?even the worst of it?good." The "strong brown god," suggestive of nineteenth-century pantheism, is not the transcendent God of Four Quartets. The strong brown god has nothing to do with the moment in and out of time. The "American" quartet presents a false resolution set against the true resolution of "Little Gidding," in which Eliot leaves America and moves back behind the nineteenth century and the enlightenment to the English seventeenth century. After the deliberate ineptitudes, formal and conceptual, of</page><page sequence="17">JEFFREY HART 441 "The Dry Salvages," the final quartet brings the sequence to its triumphant conclusion, the verse in its concentrated power one of the peaks of twentieth-century achievement. Transcending spiritual desolation, the voice in "Little Gid ding" concludes with lines of haunting beauty, full of the Eliotic sense of mysterious significance, but now the rever berations offer a complete contrast to those of "April is the cruellest month": We shall not cease from exploration And the end of all our exploring Will be to arrive where we started And know the place for the first time. Through the unknown, remembered gate When the last of earth left to discover Is that which was the beginning; At the source of the longest river The voice of the hidden waterfall And the children in the apple-tree Not known, because not looked for But heard, half-heard, in the stillness Between two waves of the sea. Quick now, here, now, always? A condition of complete simplicity (Costing not less than everything) And all shall be well and All manner of thing shall be well When the tongues of flame are in-folded Into the crowned knot of fire And the fire and the rose are one. The imagery here recapitulates earlier themes in the poem, giving them a final resolution. It reaches back autobiographi cally to Eliot's own earliest memories: the 'remembered gate," the "children in the apple-tree," the 'waves of the sea." Whitman is also present in the theme of exploration, but to un-Whitman-like purpose.</page><page sequence="18">442 FROST AND ELIOT VII Transcendent reality plays no comparable role in the poetry of Robert Frost. But though the poetry remains "in time," signals do occur?and more frequently than is generally recognized?that the total reality may contain much more. In such major poems as "After Apple-Picking," "West-Running Brook," and "For Once, Then, Something" Frost peers be yond the epistemological barriers, presses against Hume, Kant, and Wittgenstein, and sees in a glass not altogether dark. We have seen the importance of barriers, the recogni tion of a sense of limits in Frost's poetry; but there is a countermovement as well, the dialectic set up between them which makes for much of the drama present in the poetry. This is particularly striking in those poems that are addressed to questions of ultimate meaning. The Frostian consciousness normally resides in the time-space continuum, and finds it extremely difficult to move behind or beyond the world of ordinary appearances. Sometimes however, while remaining drenched in skepticism, that consciousness catches through the epistemological veil glimpses of what may be a signal of transcendence. It hears, in Peter Berger's memorable phrase, rumors of angels. The Frostian consciousness thus moves back and forth be tween the experience of skepticism and the experience of possible metaphysical affirmation. "After Apple-Picking" inti mates a resurrection that completes the analogy of spring time awakening. "The Onset" may easily be read analogically, and its April seen as an assertion against Eliot's cruellest month. Let me focus however on "For Once, Then, Some thing" from New Hampshire (1923), a more serious effort in every respect than the late quasi-theological "masques" of reason and mercy. The first sentence of this poem, ex tending over six lines, describes the speaker kneeling at a well-curb. The posture might suggest prayer, but the image the speaker gazes at, the reflection on the surface of the</page><page sequence="19">JEFFREY HART 443 water, is himself: "Me myself in the summer heaven godlike." At least two possibilities of interpretation are present. The literally superficial view may be an anthropomorphic god, projected by man's vanity into the heavens. But the view suggested may be humanism of the sort that contains in its conspectus nothing higher than man. "Me myself" contains some mockery. So does the human face looking down from the summer heaven "out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs." It may be that both anthropomorphism and the humanism of "man the measure" are branches of the same tree: a vanity that is "wrong to the light." The poem pivots on the italicized "Once" with which line 7 begins, and it offers an alternative to the superficial view of the first part. Once the epistemo logical barrier represented by the surface of the water per mitted the speaker to see "a something white, uncertain,/ Something more of the depths." A metaphysical rumor, I take it. Though the speaker holds out the skeptical possibility that the "whiteness" could be a "pebble of quartz," the in sistence of the first part of the poem on turning itself into a parable goes against the conclusion that the whiteness is merely a pebble of quartz. On the literal plane it may be; on the parabolic, that is unlikely. If the speaker in the first seven lines were merely looking into wells, "others" would have no reason to "taunt" him over the results of so trivial an ac tivity. The poem retains skepticism, but it also steps beyond it. In one of his last major poems, the mysterious and haunt ing "Directive" from Steeple Bush (1947), Frost returned once more to his oblique quarrel with Eliot. In New Hamp shire (1923) Frost had asserted his own claims against the author of The Waste Land. In "Directive" he takes on the author of Four Quartets and in particular of "Little Gidding," which had appeared in 1942. It is illuminating to set the concluding lines of "Little Gidding" beside Frost's "Directive." The latter poem also re cords a quest; it too is a journey backward in time that ends</page><page sequence="20">444 FROST AND ELIOT with a clarification. In Eliot the abandoned Chapel Perilous of The Waste Land becomes the past-haunted chapel where prayers have been valid. Frost takes us not to a haunted chapel but to an abandoned and haunted farm, where the dead are felt as unseen presences. "Directive," like "Little Gidding," has its "children" and even its "apple tree." "Little Gidding" is thus very much present in "Directive," but pres ent by way of contrast. The central image in "Little Gidding" is fire, the transformed fire of The Waste Land, the refining fire that in the last line becomes one with the rose of divine love. Ice provides the contrasting image in "Directive," the chill of Frost. We find it first in the lingering sense of the glacier's presence. The chill of the glacier and the hard re alities of rock and iron assert themselves powerfully against the poetic analogy, in which the glacier "braced his feet against the Arctic Pole." The personification of the Glacier becomes just a manner of speaking. The claims of metaphor are chilled. The chill persists, informing the climactic lines of the poem, in which metaphor is reborn. Your destination and your destiny's A brook that was the water of the house, Cold as a spring as yet so near its source, Too lofty and original to rage. (We know the valley streams that when aroused Will leave their tatters hung on barb and thorn. ) I have kept hidden in the instep arch Of an old cedar at the waterside A broken drinking goblet like the Grail Under a spell so die wrong ones can't find it, So can't get saved, as St. Mark says they mustn't. (I stole the goblet from the children's playhouse.) Here are your waters and your watering place. Drink and be whole again beyond confusion.</page><page sequence="21">JEFFREY HART 445 We again enter the world of parable. The brook suggests Frost's own poetry. It is "cold"; it is "too lofty and original to rage" in the manner of the lesser "valley streams." Perhaps we are meant to think again of Eliot, and of the "exasper ated spirit" who proceeds from "wrong to wrong," prior to the refinement of the fire. Frost is not unaware of die gifts reserved for age or the place where a story ended. First there's the children's house of make believe, Some shattered dishes underneath a pine, The playthings in the playhouse of the children. Weep for what little things can make them glad. Then for the house that is no more a house, But only a belilaced cellar hole, Now slowly closing like a dent in dough. This was no playhouse but a house in earnest. It is not necessary or even perhaps desirable to read these lines autobiographically, but behind them it is surely possible to see Frost's own "house in earnest"?the loss of three chil dren (one through suicide) and the intermittent near madness and sudden death of his wife. The word confusion in the final line of "Directive" awakens echoes. Frost in a famous definition described poetry as a "momentary stay against confusion." But in "Directive" the claim made for the cold stream of Frost's poetry appears to be larger: "Drink and be whole again beyond confusion." Perhaps we can say that Frost moves between the two formulations, as he moves between skepticism and affirmation, between simile and metaphor. Poetry may offer only a momentary stay. But per haps it can make us whole again beyond confusion. Finally "Directive" is Frost's last manifesto on how to read him. The opening lines suggest one way: as the popular and beloved poet of a simpler rustic past, the spokesman for en shrined pieties, a kind of New England Sandburg. But the past was not simple, we learn later in the poem, and this</page><page sequence="22">446 FROST AND ELIOT poet knows that it was not. The prevailing sense of Frost as the national hand-holder is an error. At the end we come to the cold stream of the true poetry. That poetry is not simple either, nor is it topical or subject to fashion. It is "lofty and original." Pure, it escapes labels. Indeed that poetry now seems less dated than much identifiably "modernist" poetry. VIII In a curious way the sociology of knowledge may shed some light on the differences between Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot as regards knowledge of the metaphysically transcendent. One of the fundamental propositions of the sociology of knowledge holds that the plausibility of a view of reality de pends upon the social support it receives. We obtain our no tions about the world largely from other people, and these notions continue to be plausible to us because others continue to affirm them. The signals of transcendence in Frost are intermittent and tend toward the ambiguous. The conscious ness in Frost's poetry is resolutely individualistic. It discovers its truths on its own. It maintains those truths on its own. In terms of the sociology of knowledge this individualistic con sciousness receives very little collective reinforcement. Its "plausibility structures" are all internal. Eliot, in contrast, does inhabit a supportive "community"? only it exists in time rather than in space. Eliot's spatial com munity is the ordinary secularized urban western world. But in "Little Gidding" Eliot's "neighbors," so to speak, are Juli ana of Norwich, Nicholas Farrar, George Herbert, Charles I, John Milton. Such intimations of the transcendent as are available to Eliot's own consciousness as dramatized in the poetry receive continuous support from that community. As the sociology of knowledge tells us, such support increases its plausibility and accessibility. Eliot himself says as much in "East Coker":</page><page sequence="23">JEFFREY HART 447 And what there is to conquer By strength and submission, has already been discovered Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one can not hope To emulate?but there is no competition There is only the fight to recover what has been lost And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions That seem unpropitious. 7</page></plain_text>
