XXXI APRIL, 1937 NO. 2 KELSEN'S THEORY OF LAW* HENRY JANZEN Hamilton College Professor Hans Kelsen is the leading exponent of the "pure" theory of law, which is attracting a great deal of attention abroad' but as yet has received scant notice in the United States. His theory marks the culmination of the tendency toward a strictly legal theory, represented in the writings of K. F. von Gerber, Paul Laband, and Georg Jellinek. This movement aims to eliminate all purely metaphysical postulates-such as the natural law con- cepts-from legal theory, as well as to free it from the political tint which it so often manifests. It also endeavors to separate the va- lidity of law from dependence on any personal authority. This attempt to "depersonalize" law is the last stage of a de- velopment that began with the passing of absolutism. At that time, ideas of a "general will" and of popular sovereignty-attended by a demand for "a government of laws and not of men" and by the introduction of the principle of separation of powers-made their appearance, only to be supplanted, more recently, by the concept of the Rechtsstaat. The latter concept really grew out of the theory of'the "general will" owing to attempts to make that will conceiv- able as an objective norm, the transition stage being marked by Hegel's exploitation of the idea of the "general will" but without its democratic implications. Subsequently, the conception of the ''general will' itself progressively lost ground and the concept of the * The attention of readers is called to Professor Kelsen's paper, "Centralization and Decentralization," appearing in a volume entitled Authority and the Individual, published recently by the Harvard University Press. This Harvard Tercentenary paper, which it was at one time planned to present in this REVIEW, having thus been made easily accessible, it has been deemed best to present here Professor Janzen's analysis of Kelsen's legal thought instead.

During the last half of the nineteenth century, the concept reached a stage in its evolution at which it reflected the belief that obedience is owed to an objective jurisdiction and that in obeying law one is obeying law only and not a personal ruler.2 The legal theory based on this conception of law encountered difficulties in attempting to reconcile it with sovereignty. Being un- able to conceive law except as an expression of a sovereign will, the Kompetenz-Kompetenz and auto-limitation schools3 endowed the personified state with a will. If the exponents of these theories had been consistent, they would have conceived this will as an ideal objectivity or would have discarded it altogether. But only the contemporary school of legal purists, with which Kelsen is so prominently associated, has gone as far as that. The members of the schools mentioned in the preceding paragraph make an attempt to explain the source of legal obligation in legal terms, alleging that the personified state and its will are purely formal legal concepts. But an examination of their writings makes it obvious that they confuse these concepts with the "substantive" state and its concrete functions, and that the will of the state to them is more than a metaphorical expression for the imperative nature of norms.4 This inconsistency (namely, the confusion of for- mal concepts with the concrete functions of the substantive state and the conclusions made possible by this alternation) cannot pos- sibly be an inadvertency, for these theorists must be presumed to 2 For a discussion of this development, see H. Heller, Die Souverdnitdt; Ein Beitrag zur Theorie des Staats- und Voilkerrechts (Berlin and Leipzig, 1927), pp. 18-20. a The best known exponent of these theories is Georg Jellinek. In the United States, the most prominent representative of the Kompetenz-Kompetenz school is Professor W. W. Willoughby, who has presented to the English-speaking world what he calls the "juristic conception of the state." 4 See particularly G. Jellinek, Allgemeine Staatslehre (3rd ed., Berlin, 1914), pp. 170ff., 465-469; Die rechtliche Natur der Staatenvertrdge (Vienna, 1880), pp. 38- 41; Das System der subjectiven 6ffentlichen Rechte (Tubingen, 1905), pp. 2, 17, 125; Die Lehre von den Staatenverbindungen (Berlin, 1882), pp. 34, 54-55; W.

Kelsen not only tries to free legal theory from this political tint, but he also avoids the methodological error of viewing the state interchangeably from two points of reference. That is why his theory attains inner consistency. He conceives the state as a system of legal norms and affirms a rule of law without the intervention of metajuristic factors. That is to say, he is not concerned with the extrinsic (i.e., non-legal) sources and sanctions of law. These socio- political factors, he points out, belong in the realm of a science of causality and are not relevant to a normative discipline which must deal with norms exclusively. In the Kantian manner, he insists on drawing a line between Sein and Sollen; and, viewing law as an objective norm (ein Sollen), he carefully disassociates it from its empirical sources and sanctions.5 A normative science, according to Kelsen, does not regard law as an imperative because it is a command (an empirical expression of a will), but because law ought to be obeyed. To this "oughtness" (Sollen) Kelsen does not ascribe the absolute value that attaches to morality. A legal norm, he says, is not a categorical imperative but a hypothetical judgment denoting a specific relationship between a determined fact and a determined consequence. To take criminal law, for example, the connection between delict and punishment is not a natural cause-and-effect relationship but a relationship in the normative sense. It means simply that in the case of non-compli- ance a coercive act will follow. Thus "oughtness" as the category of law has only one specific meaning, namely, that the fact which determines the legal consequence and the legal consequence at- tached to it are brought together in a legal norm. This relationship is of a purely formal nature and is adaptable to any empirical legal material, or, in other words, "oughtness" is a relative a priori category which enables one to grasp the empirical legal material. But it is not the distinctive characteristic of law, it is only the most general concept (Oberbegriff). Kelsen, who continues in the positivist 5 Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. vii-viii, 6-7; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 2-4. See also J. W. Jones, "The 'Pure' Theory of International Law," British Yearbook of Inter- national Law (1935), p. 19. Mr. Jones says: "The pure theory of law does not assert that law is free from elements of psychological, sociological, and, above all, political importance. What it attempts is to put a purely legal construction upon some of the terms which are fundamental in modern legal science-positive law, the sources of law, the sovereign state."</page><page sequence="4">208 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW tradition, sees the distinctive quality of law in its being a coercive order with an external sanction (i.e., a sanction which does not spring from the subject's inner consciousness).6 Kelsen's resolve to maintain the normative character of law is manifest in his differentiation of the act to which a norm attaches a legal consequence and the norm proper. When a "natural" act is designated as a legal process, that, Kelsen says, means nothing more or less than that the validity of a norm is asserted, the content of which is definitely related to the actual occurrence. The con- stitution of a state is "produced" by the empirical volitional act of the constituent authority, but derives its validity from a precon- ceived legal norm. That is to say, by juristic hypothesis, the con- stituent authority is derived from a legal principle or norm. A statute is enacted by a legislature, but it derives its validity from the constitution. In the same manner, the exercise of a judge's will who renders a decision derives its validity from a statute. Thus, whether or not a norm is valid depends on whether or not its maker has jurisdiction. For example, the legislature is competent to enact certain statutes when it is given the necessary jurisdiction by the constitution; and custom becomes law when the constitution makes provision for such a transmutation. The mere historical fact of issuing a statute is not proof of the competence of the legislative organ and does not make law, nor does custom become law without a legal norm to that effect.7 In separating the normative sphere from that of actual occur- rences, Kelsen does not overlook the fact that legal norms refer to human actions which occur at a certain time and in a certain place. He points out that the content of the norms which the legal theorist supposes to be valid must correspond in a certain measure to actual human behavior. In other words, only those legal norms are sup- posed to be valid which manifest their effectiveness in a certain minimum of corresponding human actions. However, the norma- tive sphere and that of actual occurrences must not coincide; to regard them as identical amounts to a negation of law, for laws, being rules of conduct, obviously have a meaning only if a dif- ference between the two spheres is possible. And, if the disparity is too great, law cannot be used as a criterion for the evaluation of human conduct. As a matter of fact, positivist legal theory pro- 6 Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 20-38. 7 Das Problem der Souveranitat, pp. v-vi; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 2-9.</page><page sequence="5">KELSEN S THEORY OF LAW 209 ceeds on the basis of the "principle of effectiveness," i.e., it does not affirm the validity of norms which are ineffective.8 Nevertheless, in his attempt to explain the imperative character of law in a strictly legal fashion, Kelsen distinguishes between effectiveness and validity. He says first of all that effectiveness is not the decisive factor for the validity of law. Furthermore, he insists that the discipline with which he deals is entitled to be an independent branch of study-distinct from theology, ethics, or the science of politics-and maintains that for that reason, and in order to comply with the methods of formal logic, the obligatory nature of law must be derived from another legal norm, a norm that is original and self-sustaining and not derived from a "higher" though not specifically legal principle. As an independent disci- pline, it deals with its own specific material-namely, law-viewing it as an independent entity, i.e., one that stands on its own founda- tion and is not derived from another norm-system.9 Although concerned only with positive law, Kelsen knows that he must derive its imperative nature from a norm that is beyond positive law. Since empirical volitional acts can become norms only if compliance with the dictates of the law-giver is enjoined by a norm, the positivist who refuses to view law as a mere instrument of force must presuppose a norm that is not laid down by a legis- lator. The introduction of this "initial hypothesis" (the preconceived basic norm) enables Kelsen to preserve the normative character of law. The question as to how empirical volitional acts or custom become law has caused many jurists to stray from the straight and narrow path of pure legal theory and to seek an answer in the fields of ethics, or group-psychology, or even the psychology of hyposta- tized legal persons. Kelsen avoids these digressions. To him the basic norm is only a thought-content, an assumption beyond which the jurist cannot go without leaving his universe of discourse. A. Verdross, criticizing this aspect of Kelsen's theory, insists 8 Allgemeine Staatslehre, p. 18. This should satisfy the most exacting of the posi- tivists, and yet, Mr. Stern questions Kelsen's success as a positivist. See C. W. Stern, "Kelsen's Theory of International Law," in this REVIEW, Vol. 30, pp. 736- 741. 9 Das Problem der Souverdnitdt, pp. 83-89; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 1-2; Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. 103-106.

As a purist, he is unable to explain the nature of this norm. Should he attempt such an explanation, it would amount to a definition of the basic norm in the light of a Weltanschauung. In that case, the Weltan- schauung would be the standard by which norms would be tested as to their legality, and, instead of having a theory of law, we would have a theory of what law in the theorist's opinion should be. If it were possible to discern immutable absolute universal princi- ples of justice, an attempt to explain law with reference to them by an omniscient legal philosopher would not be objectionable. But the attempt to develop a general theory of law by men with limited vision and in the light of a Weltanschauung shaped by conditions peculiar to a certain locality and to a certain time amounts to an explanation of an institutionalized form in terms of the socio- political forces which form its temporary and localized content. Such a theory is likely to be a rationalization of the status quo, and, if widely accepted, would tend to make law inflexible in that it would retard the adaptation of its content to changing social needs. Or, if the legal theorist is dissatisfied with the existing order of things, and defines law in the light of his point of view, intending by that means to direct social and political development toward an end considered desirable by him, no amount of referring to al- legedly objective values on his part can change the fact that his theory, instead of being an objective explanation of law, is the instrument of a subjective ideology. Thus we see that in either case legal theory is a mere hand-maiden of politics. Legal theory of that variety conflicts with Kelsen's conception of the sovereignty of law. For as a means to an end-be it a politi- cal, moral, or any other end-law would be a mere subordinate part of a higher order." As we have seen, Kelsen insists that a legal theorist is entitled to view law as an independent entity that serves none but its own inherent purpose. And he uses the term sovereignty merely as a symbol of the independence and separate- ness of law from religion, morals, and politics. The concept of 10 Die Verfassung der Vdlkerrechtsgemeinschaft, pp. 2-3, 21-23, 32, 35. "Das Problem der Souveranitat, pp. 83-86; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 1-2.</page><page sequence="7">KELSEN' S THEORY OF LAW 211 sovereignty is therefore of a purely formal nature. In existential reality, Kelsen says, no source of power or motivating cause can be found which is original and entirely self-sustaining (i.e., one that has no causal connection with another source). Even the most powerful state suffers diverse limitations in its cultural, economic, and political life, to say nothing about legal restraints. Sovereignty is therefore not a sociological phenomenon that can be empirically ascertained.12 That a will cannot be sovereign is self-evident to Kelsen. He steers clear of the anthropomorphism in which legal theory has been entangled since the passing of absolutism. Most people seem to be unable to visualize law without a subjective psychical bearer; that is why many legal theorists have attributed characteristics to the personified state which are commonly associated only with real persons. These characteristics, in turn, have made the state con- ceivable as the bearer of sovereignty. One of the attributes with which the state has been endowed is a will which is alleged to be the source of all law. The idea that the state has a will is the result of a superficial and faulty analysis of certain phenomena. It is based on the illusion that the interplay of wills which occurs in existential reality and which generates law results in the creation of a psychical unit. To make this unit (i.e., the state) more plausible as the psychical bearer of law, it is per- sonified and invested with a will. The psychic interplay itself, how- ever, does not even offer an adequate explanation of the social unity of the members of the state. There are interests and, there- fore, wills which tend to separate as well as those which have a centripetal effect. What is more, such interplay occurs only when people live in association. The basis of association, or the factor that unifies individuals and diverse interest groups, is a system of norms-the state. It cements the group together in that it com- pounds the conduct of the multitude of individuals inasmuch as it imposes duties on them. As a system of norms regulating conduct, the state is a super-individual entity, to be sure, but only in the normative sense, not in the realm of physical or psychical reality. When there is a concurrence of several wills, an actual coalescence is present only in the act of thinking about it. That is to say, this concurrence does not really produce a transcendental super- individual entity with a will, or even a will alone, that is distinct 12 Das Problem der Souverdnitat, pp. 7, 9; Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. 102-103.</page><page sequence="8">212 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW from the individual wills which are synthesized, so to speak. In other words, that synthesis of wills which is the essence of the con- cept of every social structure, as well as that of the state, is merely a thought-content.'3 Kelsen points out that in the eyes of the jurist a "person" is a personified norm-system; in other words, it is a collective name for the ensemble of legal rights and duties which are attributed to a real person or group of persons. The personified state, therefore, is nothing but a symbol of the unity of norms which give certain rights and duties to the organs of the state. And a person is subject to the will of another only in so far as the subordination is com- manded by a norm. Those in authority are commissioned by a norm; and their will is the "will of the state" only because they are commissioned by a norm to express a will which passes for the will of the state. That is to say, one is subject to authority in the sense of being subordinated to a norm. The legal norm, therefore, is the real ruler, and the state is identical with law, i.e., it is the legal system. Legal theory is concerned with the government-which is a part of the substantive state-only in so far as power delegated by law is not power in the real sense but competence, and is therefore a part of the legal system.'4 Criticizing those who distinguish between the internal and the external aspects of sovereignty, Kelsen says that the state is not independent externally because it is superior to other legal entities within its borders. The state is independent only in the sense that it is coordinated to other states. Such coordination obviously im- plies a superimposed authority which allots to the states their respective spheres of jurisdiction.'5 Therefore, if the word sover- eignty is at all useable, it is applicable only to the state's conduct of its internal affairs. "When viewed from within, the sovereignty of the state becomes simply the quality ascribed to municipal law of being the last, highest, underived system, as contrasted with subordinate systems deriving their validity from it, and the ex- pression sovereign state is seen to be a mere pleonasm."'6 Since sovereignty is synonymous with supremacy, and supremacy is a 13 See H. Kelsen, Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. 7-15; L. T. Hobhouse, The Meta- physical Theory of the State (New York and London, 1918), p. 66; N. J.

Jones, op. cit., p. 9.</page><page sequence="9">KELSEN' S THEORY OF LAW 213 superlative, the state is not really sovereign even internally, al- though it is superior to the legal entities which it encompasses.'7 Having defined the state in terms of law, Kelsen considers the problem of the relationship between municipal and international law. He says that the relationship between two norm-systems may either be one of subordination or one of coordination. In the case of the former, the lower order finds the source of its validity-the relatively basic norm for itself-in the superimposed order. In the latter case, there must be, in addition to the coordinated systems, a higher order; for the coordination of two legal systems amounts to a delimitation of their respective jurisdictions, and that simply means that the content of the lower norms is determined by the higher norms. The relationship between the higher norms and the lower norms may be either direct or indirect. That is to say, the higher norms may either determine the procedure by which the lower norms are to be enacted or else may delegate to certain authorities the competence to issue norms which are to be valid in a certain sphere. In both cases the relationship of the higher order to the lower is that of a whole to its parts. And, if the two systems of norms which we designate respectively as international law and municipal law are law, the relationship between them must be one of those described here.'8 A dualistic construction of law, i.e., one that is based on the assumption that international law and munici- pal law are two systems, distinct as to source and content, is methodologically impossible. Kelsen admits that, in the final analy- sis, the difference between municipal and international law lies in a difference of "sources," i.e., sources in the sense of social facts. But he also points out that such sources lie outside the scope of legal theory, since a normative discipline concerns itself only with the sources of the imperative nature of law, namely, the basic norms. The best known exponent of dualism is H. Triepel.'9 According to Triepel, municipal law is the product of the will of the state and international law is created by the merging (Vereinbarung) of the wills of the individual states. The expression of this common will of the nations constitutes a law which is binding and which is not subject to change by unilateral action. Triepel readily admits his 17 Das Problem der Souverdnitat, pp. 38-40; Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. 106-107. 18 Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 136-137. 19 Vblkerrecht und Landesrecht (Leipzig, 1899).</page><page sequence="10">214 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW inability to explain the source of the obligatory nature of this law, pointing out that this difficulty is the common lot of all who try to explain the source of obligation in jurisprudence. Granting that this can be done only on the basis of an "initial hypothesis," such an explanation is to be preferred to Triepel's explanation or, to be exact, omission thereof.20 Triepel's construction gives law a psy- chological basis, whereas that offered by the pure theory preserves the normative character of law. Supposing a coalescence of the wills of several states does take place, it still remains to be shown how an expression of this common will can be transmuted into a legal norm without presupposing a norm that attaches legal con- sequences to the factual meeting of wills. This Triepel does not explain. Therefore, to be subject to one of Triepel's laws means nothing more than being confronted by an empirical will. As Mr. J. W. Jones aptly observes, The theory which founds the basis of the validity of international law on an aggregate or union of the wills of states had never been able to ex- plain how the empirical description of the origin of the content of rules can provide a legal basis for their obligatory force. States enter into agree- ments, but the analysis of this fact in terms of psychology leaves un- solved the problem why treaties are binding even after the will to be bound has disappeared.21 Even if one were to deduce that "the will of the international community" is the source of the imperative nature of international law from "the reason of the thing," as Mr. Lauterpacht suggests, one would encounter the same difficulties that the social contract philosophers had to face in connection with their doctrine of the ''general will," difficulties that they tried to evade by introducing the far-fetched doctrine of "tacit consent." Therefore, the intro- duction of the "initial hypothesis" by the Austrian school as a solution of the problem of legal obligation seems to be quite an improvement as compared with Triepel's evasion of the question.22 Because Triepel conceives international and municipal law as binding norms and not as mere conglomerates of socio-political facts, he cannot take the disparity of the two systems as his point of departure and construe their contemporaneous validity without violating the rule of identity. The monistic construction is required as a matter of methodological consistency.23 Kelsen argues that if 20 For a different view, see H. Lauterpacht, The Function of Law in the Interna- tional Community (London, 1933), p. 416. 21 Op. cit., pp. 18-19. 22 Op. cit., p. 421. 23 In view of the contribution of the Austrian school in the field of methodology</page><page sequence="11">KELSEN 'S THEORY OF LAW 215 the dualists were right in their contention that the two systems are separate and distinct, it would be impossible for them to view the state and international law as well as two or more states as con- temporaneously valid systems of norms. The dualist must be satisfied with viewing his own state as the only valid system of norms and must look upon all other states and international law as phenomena in existential reality, not in the normative sphere. He must exclude them from his universe of discourse for the same reason that he must exclude ethics, for example. At any rate, he cannot designate them as systems of legal norms.24 Since it seems unreasonable to deny a normative character to international law as well as to the other state systems, some dual- ists, according to Kelsen, resort to a fiction in order to establish the legality of the aggregates of norms which are outside of their own state system. They derive their legal nature from the "recogni- tion" which is accorded them by their own state. That means, of course, that international law and the other legal orders become the "external" law of the state which extends the recognition; in other words, they become the norms by which the state unilaterally regulates its relations with other states. Thus, in spite of the dualistic orientation of the exponents of the "recognition" theory, the tendency inherent in juristic cognition inadvertently comes to the fore. Namely, the legal order of the world becomes a unitary system on the basis of the law of the recognizing state. However, whether the dualist admits it or not, his doctrine implies the primacy of the state and thus amounts to a denial of international law, one of the functions of which is the coordination of states.25 Referring to the affirmation of the current theory that inter- national law regulates the conduct of states,26 whereas municipal alone, the statement of Lauterpacht, that "little, if anything, has been added to it [i.e., Triepel's theory] by recent jurists," seems unwarranted. Ibid., p. 416. 24 Das Problem der Souverdnitat, pp. 94-98, 105-107, 121, 123; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 136-139. 25 Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 139-143. 26 The assertion that only states as such can be subjects of international legal rights and obligations is another corollary of the personification of the state. In the days when the overlordship of the personal ruler over his domain was regarded as a property right (see for example Hugo Grotius, De jure belli ac pacis, tr. by F. W. Kelsey, Oxford, 1925, pp. 113-119, 137), it was quite proper to regard him as a possessor of international legal rights and duties. However, the attempt to present the personified state as the heir of the personal ruler to these rights and duties amounts to an attribution of rights and obligations to an abstraction.</page><page sequence="12">216 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW law regulates relations among individuals and between individuals and the superimposed state, Kelsen points out that this alleged distinctive function of international law and the implied dualism cannot be explained regardless of whether the theorist postulates the primacy of municipal law or the primacy of international law. Supposing, for the sake of argument, that the state "recognizes" the norms of international law as a limitation on its competence. From the standpoint of the jurist, that means-as was pointed out in the preceding paragraph-that the state incorporates inter- national law in its own legal system, or, in other words, that inter- national law becomes the external law of the state. In that case, the law of nations cannot limit the state in any other way than the state's own legal system-of which it has become a part-limits the "state." But the state can limit itself only by prescribing cer- tain lines of conduct to the men whose conduct, by legal fiction, is considered to be the conduct of the state. It follows that inter- national law really regulates the conduct of men who are agents of the state and not that of the state itself. In other words, to say that international law imposes obligations and confers authorizations on states simply means that individuals are on the receiving end of the relationship. The situation is analogous to the relationship between municipal law and a subordinate juristic person-a cor- poration, for example. In both cases, the higher law determines what is to be done and what is not to be done, but the individuals who are to act or to abstain from action are determined by the subordinate legal person, the state and the corporation, respec- tively. The relationship between individuals and international law is therefore not direct or immediate, with the exception of such laws as the rules of blockade and guerilla warfare which in some of their aspects apply to men who are not agents of the state in the usual sense but private citizens.27 27 Das Problem der Souverdnitat, pp. 126-127, 130-133, 139, 162-165; Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 132-134. This argument of the dualists loses all its significance when one considers that in any case law, as viewed by the jurist, regulates only relations among norm-systems. That is to say, although law actually regulates relations among men, it is only through the agency of law that relations are brought into being which are relevant to juristic study. In the eyes of the jurist, a "person"2 is only a collective name for the aggregate of rights and duties that pertain to an in- dividual or group. Every person in the legal sense is therefore a system of norms, and legal relations are relations within a legal order and among legal systems only. Cf. Das Problem der Souverdnitat, pp. 125-127.</page><page sequence="13">KELSEN 'S THEORY OF LAW 217 If international law does not regulate the relations with which it is concerned directly, but delegates that function to the state, the two systems must logically be derived from the same source and they must be linked together by legal norms. That is to say, the two systems must be regarded as one. The dualism of municipal and international law would be conceivable, according to Kelsen, if the latter could be regarded as limiting the states as such. But that is obviously impossible without regarding the state as a real person.28 There are also those who argue against a monistic construction by pointing out that the separateness of the two systems of law follows from the possibility of irreconcilable conflicts between them. By way of rebuttal, Kelsen points out that the dualist's use of "recognition" as a link between the two systems actually re- moves this objection to the monistic construction. That is to say, such conflicts are inconceivable when one considers that, in the final analysis, it all goes back to the same "will" and, especially, when one bears in mind that the so-called will of the state is nothing but a metaphorical expression for the imperative nature of norms.29 Kelsen also points out that the alleged conflicts of laws are really factual situations and that from the purely logical point of view they are not contradictions. There are analogous situations within the state, and yet no one thinks of denying the unity of the state's legal system. An unconstitutional statute may be regarded as binding, or an administrative act may be ultra vires, without destroying that unity. The repugnant lower norm may be annulled by prescribed procedure and the agent exceeding his authority may be held personally responsible in jurisdictions where such acts are punishable offenses. But a delict is not a breach of law in the sense that it interrupts the existence of law; in fact, it confirms the exist- ence of law in that it is the prerequisite condition to the specific reaction of law, namely, the coercive act. Since there is no logical contradiction between a delict and the norm which establishes it, it follows that from the purely logical point of view it is conceivable that an illegal act may lay down a valid norm. Though the issuance of such a norm in some jurisdictions may make the issuer liable to a penalty, the norm may nevertheless be valid until it is abrogated 28 Ibid., pp. 130, 133. 29 Reine Rechtslehre, p. 144.</page><page sequence="14">218 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW by another legal act, or it may remain valid indefinitely if there is no legal remedy provided for its deficiency.30 In a similar manner, a statute may be repugnant to a treaty or to customary international law without affecting the validity of these international legal rules. International law obliges the states to carry out certain measures by attaching certain consequences to non-compliance, namely, its specific sanctions-retortion, reprisals, and war. But this does not preclude the possibility of a statute of a state being at variance with the dictates of international law. And-although some treaties make provision for the solution of such conflicts-as far as general international law is concerned, the situation is similar to that within a state the constitution of which fails to establish a procedure by which unconstitutional statutes may be voided but fixes the responsibility for unauthorized acts on the agencies that act ultra vires. That is to say, a government which enacts a statute that is repugnant to international law is guilty of an international delict and is subject to the appropriate penalties.3' One need not have a will-to-believe or a desire for "a completely homogeneous and unified theory of law" to be convinced by this argument. And, when Mr. Jones, who apparently is not convinced, insists that "if there is one proposition clearly recognized by both international and municipal law, it is that a rule which is opposed to the former may yet be binding in the latter,"32 he does not affirm something that Kelsen denies. As was shown above, Kelsen is fully aware of that fact and merely insists that such a discrepancy does not destroy the unity of law. Continuing his criticism of Kelsen, Mr. Jones says also: How is it possible to say that an act contrary to international law is to be attributed to the complex of rules of which the state is the personifica- tion and which owe their validity to international law itself? Such a con- clusion can only be reached by adopting the hypothesis of the supremacy of municipal law, which, says Kelsen, is as much as to say that inter- national law is not law at all, with the consequence that the act cannot be unlawful ... The problem of the validity of state legislation contrary to international law only arises if we accept the monistic position for the act of legislation, and the dualistic for the rule when once it is laid down.33 Mr. Jones' difficulty seems to spring from the fact that he seeks and fails to find analogies in municipal law, as is indicated by his 30 Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 38, 145. 31 Reine Rechtslehre, pp. 144-147. 32 J. W. Jones, op. cit., p. 13. 33 Ibid.</page><page sequence="15">KELSEN 'S THEORY OF LAW 219 statement that "even in the Common Law it is not yet admitted that a corporation can be held responsible for damage caused by an act which is ultra vires of the corporation."34 To find such analogies, one need not go beyond the laws and judicial decisions in the United States defining the liability of municipal corporations for the torts of agents engaged in so-called proprietary functions. Furthermore, for examples of a contemporaneous existence of two mutually incompatible laws one needs only to examine the consti- tutional history of federal states. In such states, a lower norm which is repugnant to a higher norm is not ipso facto invalid. It has the effect of law for all practical purposes until it is annulled in a prescribed manner by an authorized agency. In other words, a legislative enactment by a government whose competence is limited by a constitution which is enforceable by the courts has the effect of law. until it is declared to be repugnant to the higher law and therefore null and void. In some jurisdictions, the courts must apply the statute without being competent to exercise the power of judicial review; and administrative agencies generally must carry out statutes regardless of whether or not they are in accord with the constitution. Thus we see that "conflicting rules can and do exist side by side" without destroying the unity of the legal order. When Mr. Jones insists that international as well as municipal law recognizes "that a rule which is opposed to the former may yet be binding in the latter," he fails to tell the whole story. For a government which is guilty of enacting statutes or decrees in viola- tion of international law may not invoke these statutes or decrees as a defense against claims arising in consequence of its delict. A government, the rights of whose nationals are violated by the government of another state either by a statutory enactment or by a decree, or by its failure to protect them, or by a "denial of justice," has the right to insist on the repeal of the repugnant en- actments as well as to determine what procedure to use in pressing the claims arising from a violation of these rights. Some of these rights rest on provisions of treaties, others arise from the generally recognized rule of positive international law according to which foreign nationals are entitled to the same measure of protection from the government of a state as that government affords its own 34 Ibid., footnote 1.</page><page sequence="16">220 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW citizens.35 Granting that legislatures do enact statutes which are contrary to treaties and to general international law, and that municipal courts, following the rule lex posterior derogat priori, may apply them in preference to the treaties, or in preference to general international law, insisting on "express adoption" of the latter by their own state before they give effect to it, this does not deprive a government, the international legal rights of whose citizens have been violated in this manner, of the right to insist on arbitration or adjudication or to exert pressure on their behalf by all available means, such as diplomacy, reprisals, and war. And the agencies responsible for the conduct of the foreign relations of the refractory state yield to such demands or pressure unless they feel strong enough to stand the consequences of resistance. The available means of self-help in the international forum may not always be effective in solving the conflicts between state action and inter- national law, but this deficiency, as we have seen, does not disprove the formal unity of the international legal system and of the state systems which it encompasses; it merely proves the inadequacy of its implementation and sanctions. Having determined that formally law is a unity, the problem of primacy remains to be solved. The question is not solved by posit- ing sovereignty in law; it remains to be determined whether mu- nicipal or international law has precedence in the legal hierarchy. In relation to this subject, Kelsen takes the view that legal science has a choice between two hypotheses: it may proceed on the as- sumption that municipal law is supreme, and, again, it may postu- late the primacy of international law. From the standpoint of scientific method, both approaches are warrantable, asserts Kelsen, because we are concerned with a problem that cannot be empiri- cally verified. Therefore, one may assume, on the one hand, that a 3' Cf. E. M. Borchard, Diplomatic Protection of Citizens Abroad (New York, 1927), pp. 18, 181-182, 213-230, 330; J. L.

On the other hand, one may assume that the state arranges its relationship to international law by a legal norm which incorporates international law, or at least a part of it, in its own law. Finally, one may assume that the state ab- stains from linking the rules of the so-called international law to itself, for there is nothing in juristic cognition which makes it im- perative to regard as valid norms rules that cannot be included in the category law on the basis of the primacy of municipal law. In other words, the jurist is not compelled to ascribe a legal character to factual phenomena which, according to his point of view, are not legal norms. The material which is designated law is not law a priori; it acquires legal character only through the hypothesis by means of which it is interpreted. Whether it is law at all, and what its relationship to other law is, depends on the hypothesis of the observer. The choice of this hypothesis is arbitrary, and in making his choice the observer is influenced by his Weltanschauung.36 Thus, according to Kelsen, the solution of the problem varies according to the point of departure of the jurist, which may be either inter- national law or the state. Kelsen says, in effect, that the political views and attitudes of the legal theorist determine whether munici- pal law has precedence over international law or vice versa, or whether international law is law at all. Criticizing Kelsen's relativism, Verdross maintains that it is inconsistent with his assertion that only a system of norms which is actually effective is positive law.37 Verdross contends that if this is the criterion of positive law, the legal theorist does not have the freedom of choice that Kelsen assigns to him, but is compelled to regard as a positive legal order any system of norms that is effec- tive, And, therefore, if it is possible to show that international law meets that qualification, it must be regarded as law. In other words, if the legal theorist whose point of reference is municipal law finds it impossible to include international law in his universe of discourse, he must, according to Verdross, expand his universe of discourse so as to include international law.38 It does not follow from Kelsen's statement, as Verdross seems to imply, that all norms which manifest their effectiveness in actual conduct of human beings are law. Kelsen merely states that the 36 Das Problem der Souveranitat, p. 103; Allgemeine Staatslehre, pp. 128-129. 37 See above, p. 208. 38 Die Verfassung der Vblkerrechtsgemeinschaft, p. 17.</page><page sequence="18">222 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW positivist legal theory does not affirm the validity of norms that are ineffective.39 This does not mean that all effective rules are generic norms and that they must be included in the category law. The dictates of fashion and the rules of morality, for example, are effective; yet it would not occur to anyone to designate them as law. They refer to lines of conduct the regulation of which gov- ernments have not seen fit to take upon themselves. One may agree with Verdross when he makes the term law the common denomi- nator for all the norms which are effected by governmental agen- cies, including the rules governing international intercourse; yet one must admit that these rules and municipal law are sufficiently dissimilar in their secondary characteristics to make a differentia- tion of the norm-systems seem reasonable. For that reason, and because a definition is arbitrary, there is nothing to prevent a legal theorist from defining law in such terms as to exclude the rules governing international relations. Having affirmed the freedom of the jurist to choose as his point of reference either international law or municipal law, Kelsen ex- plains why he bases his own theory on the primacy of international law. He has demonstrated the unity of the two systems of norms by a negative argument denying the possibility of a logical con- tradiction between them. After that, his analysis of the "origin" of the state and of the principle of state equality inevitably leads him to the conclusion that the concept of law is actually as well as formally complete only if the primacy of international law is recognized and if it is conceived as the highest all-encompassing system. According to the principle of effectiveness-which is not only Kelsen's criterion of positive law, but also a generally recognized principle of positive international law regulating the rise and fall of states and governments-a government is considered to be legitimate if, during a certain length of time, it has demonstrated that it is capable of enforcing its enactments. This means that a community in which a legislative authority has operated effectively for a period of time constitutes a state in the international legal sense, or, what amounts to the same, it is a state by authority of international law.40 Not only does a state receive its legislative 39 See above, p. 208. 40 The idea that states are creatures of international law is by no means new. We find it in the writings of Richard Zouche (1590-1660), for example, who says</page><page sequence="19">KELSEN 'S THEORY OF LAW 223 authority from the law of nations by way of delegation, but inter- national law also delimits its temporal and territorial validity through the principle of effectiveness. Thus the origin as well as the termination of states is explained by Kelsen in legal terms in the same way that one explains the formation and dissolution of sub- ordinate juristic persons within the state.4" As Mr. Jones points out, recognition on the part of other states can therefore have only "declaratory, never constitutive, effect."42 That international law thus legitimizes revolutionary governments after they have satis- fied its requirements, and "gives to the order immanent in the facts . . . the dignity of law,"43 is not Kelsen's fault, as Mr. Jones seems to imply. For a legal theorist, in referring to concrete situa- tions, cannot by his fiat make law more perfect than it actually is. The territorial limits of a state also are determined by the prin- ciple of effectiveness. These limits coincide with the extent of the effectiveness of the legal order of the state. And international law not only guarantees the integrity of this territory by attaching certain legal consequences (i.e., its sanctions) to acts of encroach- ment on the part of other states, but, looked at from another angle, it also enjoins the state from undertaking coercive measures be- yond its confines, except in special cases. If states are viewed as coercive orders, it is only in this manner that their legally coordi- nate existence is conceivable. In other words, the principle of state equality, which is generally recognized as a rule of positive law, can have a legal meaning only from the standpoint of the primacy of international law.44 According to Kelsen, the state has residual powers. That is to say, its claim to the totality of powers is limited by the specific powers withdrawn, or to be withdrawn, from its competence by the international legal order. In this respect the state differs from other agents of international law, namely, those resting on treaty or convention basis, which have only delegated powers. As an agent of the international legal order, the state participates in the that by international law nationss are separated, kingdoms founded, commerce [is] instituted, and lastly wars [are] introduced."

But, says Kelsen, even treaties, i.e., express agreements, are law-producing factors only because there is a norm to that effect. This norm must be part of a higher order, for, considering the legal equality of states and the territorial delimitation of the state's authority, it is plain that one state cannot bind or authorize the citizens of another state. And, since the competence of one state engaged in the conclusion of a treaty with another cannot be added to that of the other-as one might add two mathematical figures-to produce a higher author- ity competent to enact norms the validity of which would extend over both states, there must be a higher law which makes the creation of such particular international law possible. Theoreti- cally, the creation of particular international law is conceivable only on the basis of a general law of nations.48 Among the norms of general international law, the rule pacta sunt servanda is very important. It is the norm which attaches legal consequences to the empirical act of concluding an agree- ment. Without it, treaty-making would not be a law-producing factor, or, in other words, treaties would not be law. It also obliges states to conduct themselves in conformity with the terms of treaties. Since the fundamental law, upon which treaties rest, is one of the norms of general international law, treaties (i.e., par- ticular international law) are on a lower level in the hierarchy of law than the general law of nations.47 This general international law imposes obligations and confers authorizations on all states. It came into being through usage; i.e., it was formed by acts of state agencies authorized by their constitutions to conduct foreign relations. But it did not acquire its legal character from usage, says Kelsen; even customary law must rest on a norm which stipulates that usage creates law.48 Since the legal nature of treaties is derived from general inter- national law, the representatives of two or more states engaged in concluding a treaty constitute one organ, which is primarily an agent of the international legal order and not the common agent 45 Ibid., p. 150. 46 Ibid., pp. 150-152. 47 Ibid., pp. 129-130. 48 Ibid., p. 129.</page><page sequence="21">KELSEN' S THEORY OF LAW 225 of the two or more states. This is apparent, Kelsen points out, when one bears in mind that it is the general law of nations which authorizes states to designate representatives for the purpose of negotiating treaties. But, obviously, these representatives, who jointly are an agent of the international legal order, severally are also agents of their respective states; thus the states also are organs of international law, with delegated authority to participate with other states in the formation of treaty law.49 In this manner, Kelsen establishes the unity of the universal legal order. He hastens to point out, however, that he is by no means speaking of a unified organization of the world in a universal state. He is fully aware of the fact that in reality there is a great deal of disunity. The unity he has demonstrated is a formal (erkenntnismdssige) unity.50 Therefore Mr. Stern's statement that "only the future can tell whether or not Kelsen idealized the pres- ent international status"51 misses its mark. It has also been stated that Kelsen "did not succeed in develop- ing a 'pure' theory of law any more than other philosophers before him," because he was impelled to posit the supremacy of inter- national law by his "internationalist ideology" and not by logical deduction alone.52 Kelsen does say that the conception of a number of co-existing communities which, in spite of differences in size, population, and power, are equal before the law and which, with their respective jurisdictions delimited, are united in a greater com- munity, is an eminently ethical idea. He hastens to add, however, that it is tenable only when supported by the juristic hypothesis of a superimposed legal order."3 And in pointing out that the theo- retical refutation of the dogma of sovereignty is one of the important achievements of the pure theory, he says that it was not under- taken with a political purpose in mind. He admits that it may have political consequences because it removes one of the obstacles that has impeded the growth of international law and a more complete unification of the international legal order-developments that have been opposed by the champions of the dogma of sovereignty as being incompatible with the nature of international law and of the state.4 The doctrine of sovereignty-a political dogma in the 49 Ibid., p. 152. 50 Ibid., p. 153. 61 C.

If political devel- opment is retarded by an "archaic" ideology, it may be expected that the extirpation of the obsolete concept of sovereignty, which is suffused with emotion in the "public mind," will strengthen law-abiding sentiment and accelerate the growth and implementa- tion of law in the international community. But such developments are neither assumed nor advocated by Kelsen. His theory, as a theory, is indifferent to its possible politi- cal consequences. As we have seen, he does not define law in terms of the purposes which it, in his opinion, should serve. Nor does he define it-as is often done-as the product of a particular political institution, and, therefore, he does not make the existence of such an institution in a particular form the essential and unalterable prerequisite or source of law. The fact that he may have had a political purpose back in his mind when he chose his own funda- mental hypothesis and rejected several other theoretically possible alternatives, is an entirely different matter. Granting that one might object to Kelsen's choice on empirical grounds, that is not the same as saying that his choice and the motives which deter- mined it affect the inner purity of his theory. Above all, Kelsen must be credited with having relegated a piece of make-believe-namely, the sovereign will of the personified state-to its proper place among other relics. His theory is signifi- cant because it shows that the postulation of sovereignty is not prerequisite to an explanation of law. By founding his theory on preconceived legal norms, he furnishes a formula by means of which he is able to explain the source of legal obligation in legal terms and to preserve the objectivity of law. Not only that, but this formula also makes it possible to conceive international law as law in the proper sense; in other words, it supplies a common de- nominator for a greater number of generic norms than a theory which posits the will of the sovereign state as the source of all law. In this manner, Kelsen takes the state off the pinnacle of the legal pyramid-a position to which it had been elevated by the doctrine of sovereignty-and consigns it to an intermediate place in the legal hierarchy.</page></plain_text>
