<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMAN TRIUMPHS AND ETRUSCAN KINGS: THE CHANGING FACE OF THE TRIUMPH By LARISSA BONFANTE WARREN (Plates v-viii) The triumph, to a Roman of the later Republic and Empire, seemed sacred and all of a piece. Its venerable antiquity was more important than its origin or development. So on the one hand Roman antiquarians agreed the triumph was as ancient as Romulus himself; and on the other its antiquity was felt to be confirmed rather than impaired by the connec- tion of many details with the Etruscans-though the ancients never claimed, as modern scholars have done, that the institution itself was borrowed from the Etruscans. It was simply neither important nor desirable to pin down precisely the dates or phases of such a hallowed celebration. Of course it is not true that there were no changes. Yet the Roman attitude may have also affected modern historians, who until rather recently have been satisfied with a kind of 'unitarian' view of the triumph as something permanent and immutable, untouched by history; discussions of particular problems, such as the alleged divinization of the trium- phator or the location of the porta triumphalis, have taken very little account of changes in the triumph itself. Many Roman rituals did, indeed, continue practically unchanged, and it is a peculiarity of Roman history that our most reliable documents for the early period are religious festivals celebrated year after year, rather than written records or histories. But the triumph was, more than other religious festivals, a part of the political life at Rome. It was celebrated by the commander-in-chief himself, not by a priest or rex sacrificulus. Hence, though the Romans did not like to admit it, important changes were bound to occur in its celebration. This institution, which continued throughout the whole history of Rome from pre-Etruscan to Late Imperial times, shows an almost stratigraphic pattern in its evolution; and the historical phases of early Rome are illustrated as if by an archaeological excavation. No less important perhaps, it illustrates a change in Roman mentality. We can follow the gradual transformation of the triumph from a purification ritual, which cleansed the city and the soldiers of Rome from the blood-guilt of the ' murder ' of war, into a purely honorific ceremony, whose chief importance lay in the auctoritas and consequent political power it bestowed upon the victorious general, and the honour it brought his family and his troops. Historically, then, I shall deal with three main periods of the triumph: I. The IE, proto-Latin, pre-Etruscan phase, before the sixth century B.C. Perhaps this level really did belong to the very earliest history of Rome, the time of Romulus, as the tradition said. II. The Etruscan monarchy at Rome, the end of the sixth century B.C. III. The Hellenistic period, from the third century B.c. down to and including the end of the Republic. Two other important periods of the triumph have been studied elsewhere-by J. C. Richard, for example, or by A. Alfoldi-and I shall therefore not deal with them here: IV. The late Republic and early Augustan period; and V. The Empire. If we look at each of these periods in turn, we can see the persistence of certain basic elements, whose externals change in the course of time, but which never completely disappear from the triumph: i. The type of rite and its intention; primarily a victory rite, it includes procession, dedication and sacrifice. 2. The person celebrating the victory, leading the procession, carrying out the dedica- tion, and performing the sacrifice. 3. The victorious army taking part in the procession. 4. The god to whom are offered dedication and sacrifice. 5. The topography of the procession and its physical goal, the god's sanctuary.</page><page sequence="2">50 LARISSA BONFANTE WARREN I. THE PRE-ETRUSCAN LEVEL We cannot of course hope to go back to the very beginning. My point of departure will be from the middle, so to speak: the triumph as it appears during the sixth century in the period of the Etruscan monarchy. It will be argued that the Etruscans did not bring the rite itself to Rome, but only changed a pre-existing religious celebration, adding external features typical of their more advanced culture. The details of the Etruscanized triumph logically belong later in the paper; here we are concerned rather to look beyond the parts of the ritual that are evidently Etruscan additions for those more basic elements listed above. There is, of course, bound to be a lot of conjecture in such an enquiry, in a period of history where we are almost literally moving in the dark. In spite of the valuable contribu- tions made by G. Dumezil, S. Mazzarino, P. De Francisci, A. Alfoldi and others,1 a recon- struction of this early form of the triumph, in the period before the Etruscan monarchy at Rome, must by its very nature be speculative; and if at times my statements seem too sanguine, it is because of certain similarities in details of Italic and early Latin rites which seem to me, at any rate, too close to be merely fortuitous. The picture may not be true, but I hope at least it seems possible. To begin with, we have not one but three triumphs. There is the triumph proper; the ouatio 2 and the triumph outside the city, celebrated at the temple of Jupiter Latiaris on the Mons Albanus.3 The greater triumph, we have seen, was considered by the Romans to be as ancient as Rome herself. But definite dates were given both for the first celebration of the ouatio, and the less honourable form of triumph at the Mons Albanus, which a general could celebrate without special permission. According to tradition the ouatio was granted for the first time to the consul P. Postumius Tubertus, in 503 B.C.; 4 while it was only in 23 I B.C. that C. Papirius Maso first took advantage of the privilege of celebrating the rite during the feriae latinae on the Mons Albanus.5 According to tradition, then, the relationship between these three types of triumph was chronological as well as hierarchical, the triumph proper being not only the most honourable but the earliest as well, the triumph on the Mons Albanus least ancient and least honorific. It does not follow, however, that the triumph proper was historically the most ancient form of the rite.6 It is certain, in fact, that the most ancient of all these ceremonies was that of the feriae latinae, celebrated at the I G.

Rohde is careful to distinguish the ouatio, which had to be granted by the Senate, from the unofficial triumph celebrated at the Alban Mount, though both were celebrated by Marcellus in 2I 1 B.C. (Plut., Marc. 22). Rohde also lists the differences between the ouatio and triumph proper: I. The ouatio was celebrated on foot (later on horseback). 2. The dress was the toga praetexta, not the uestis triumphalis. 3. On his head the general wore a myrtle, not the triumphal laurel, crown. 3C. Hiilsen, RE s.u. Albanus Mons, 2310-2322. R.

(This is not quite the same as saying ' the Latin triumph on the Alban mountain ... was certainly the prototype of the Roman triumph, not vice versa, as the Annals would have us believe' : Alfoldi, 391-2.) In the pompa of the games, Piganiol (28) distin- guishes the same basic three phases to be found in the triumph, as in most Roman institutions: Roman, archaic Greek or Etruscan, and Hellenistic: on the development of votive games, offered by ambitious generals : . . . 'les jeux vou6s par les g6n6raux sont un ph6nomene tardif, ils sont un sympt6me des progres de l'individualisme, ils annoncent la revolte des g6n6raux contre l'1gtat. . . ' (83); cf. the same phenomenon reflected in the celebration of the triumph. In these, as in most rituals, tradition preserves elements from several periods, without however preserving the chronological distinctions among them.</page><page sequence="3">ROMAN TRIUMPHS AND ETRUSCAN KINGS 5I sanctuary of a most ancient native divinity, Jupiter Latiaris,7 and preserving an archaic Latin rite which Rome had shared with the villages of the neighbouring hills. To this very ancient ceremony was attached, at a late date-203 B.C.-an out-of-town Roman triumph, so to speak. I shall come back to this later. The ouatio, however, in its simpler ceremonial, preserves an earlier and purely Roman form of victory rite. The general entered the city and went up the Capitol on foot or on horseback, in contrast to the triumph, in which he rode in a chariot. This fundamental difference was reflected in the names for the two rites, the ouatio being called a TFeoS epiaii3os, and in the two contrasted expressions ovantem triumphare vs. curru triumphare. Now it was certainly the Etruscan king celebrating a triumph who introduced the chariot; before that, the kings of Rome entered the city on foot. Plutarch tells us in the life of Romulus, pre- serving a detail that is evidently part of the same tradition, that Romulus celebrated the first triumph on foot. The other important ' improvement' of the triumph over the ouatio, the uestis triumphalis the general wore rather than the simpler dress of the magistrate, was also, we shall see, an Etruscan contribution. So we have in the ouatio, in effect, an older form of the triumph, while the 'triumph', as it was later known, represented an Etruscanized ceremonial, a more impressive rite, and a later stage in its development. When this more ornate form of triumph took the place of the earlier ouatio, the latter was still preserved, though demoted to a less honourable position. The traditional date of the first ouatio celebrated as such, 503 B.C., would, indeed, fit this reconstruction. I do not think it likely that the leaders of the Republic instituted this ceremony anew. It is much more the Roman way, as with the tribune's intercessio or veto, to adapt an existing rite or institution to a new function. In just such a fashion, after 231 B.C., the feriae latinae were adopted, as yet another honour and political advantage for ambitious generals and politicians. Indeed, this last adaptation of a peaceful ceremony into a victory celebration, since it occurred in historic times, can perhaps conveniently exemplify the kind of change which we assume to have taken place at a yet earlier stage ; the triumph, with its warlike connotations, had itself developed out of an early purification rite that was presumably the common ancestor of a number of other Latin ceremonies. An attempted reconstruction of the original Latin form of the triumph must take us back into the context of other very ancient ceremonies; in Rome, the ritual of the Arval Brothers,8 the dance of the Salii,9 the dedication of the spolia opima,10 the ceremony of the fetiales; 11 outside Rome, the Italic ritual of the Iguvine Tables.12 In them we find important 7 E. Samter, RE s.u. luppiter, (I4), Latiaris, 11 3 7-I I 3 5 ; and Feriae Latinae, 22 I 3-22 I 6, held in his honour on the Alban Mount, of which the last day was called Latiar. The registration of the feriae latinae in the Fasti dates only from 451, but the festival was very ancient, predated Roman super- vision, and was connected with the Etruscan kings of Rome. Tarquin-either Priscus or Superbus-was said to have instituted the Roman festival, and built the temple of Jupiter Latiaris at the same time as the Capitoline Temple in Rome: its remains were still visible in the eighteenth century, A.

I shall try to heed Jacques Heurgon's advice-which Roman antiquarians, unfortunately for us, repeatedly ignored-' il est dangereux d'y vouloir mettre trop d'ordre '.14 Yet something is to be gained from seeing how it might have been. To begin at the beginning, then, the name. i. The type of rite and its intention. A. The name. We do not know its original name. In 503 records apparently showed ouatio and triumph as two distinct ceremonies.'5 Both names are linguistically somewhat puzzling; elsewhere I have tried to show that triump(h)us was originally an Etruscan word, adopted as a name for the ceremony in the sixth century B.C., from the shout io triumpe!,'6 but no one has been able to decide whether ouatio is a parallel formation, from the Greek shout, E'VOI, or whether it had a native origin, from the word 17 Could ouatio have been the original name? I am fairly certain in any case it was not triumpus. This word also appears in its early form, triumpe, in the hymn of the Arval Brothers.'8 Although both the triumphal rite and the hymn of the Arval Brothers went back to the earliest phase of Rome's history and antedated the period of Etruscan influence in the sixth century, they adopted Etruscan elements during this period,'9 in the name 'triumph' and the word triumpe in the hymn; we may compare also the trabea of the Salii, adopted as their priestly dress at this time. Others have already remarked on the relationship between triumpe and the Latin word tripudium, ' a three-beat dance step '20 The instructions accompanying the text of the Carmen Aruale use the noun tripodatio and the verb form tripodare-' tripodauerunt in uerba haec '-as ' stage directions ' accompanying the repeated cry triumpe, triumpe at the end of the prayer of the Fratres Aruales.2' It is suggestive that the prayers of the Fratres Atiedii, transcribed in the Iguvine Tables, end with similar instructions to the officiating priest to perform a tripudium: Pesculu semu uesticatu atripursatu 22 ('In precatione media(?) tripodato' Buck i i8; ' Precatione eadem libato, tripodato,' Pisani 154). We seem, then, to have three parallel forms: Latin tripudium, Umbrian atripursatu, Etruscan triumpe. The Etruscan term, which seems to have been adopted in Rome because of the similarity of its formation to the existing term tripudium (related to Umbrian atripursatu), signified a musical or technical improvement upon the rustic tripudium or native dance: triumpe might have been substituted for an original Latin tripudium or tripodatio at the end of the Arval Brothers' hymn, corresponding to the Umbrian atripursatu at the end of the prayer. The co-existence of the two words, triumpe and tripudium, preserves in the language a trace of the double culture present in Rome at the time of the Tarquins. B. The intention. Striking similarities with the triumph appear in a pre-Etruscan rite of the bringing home of spoils, recently reconstructed by Gilbert Charles-Picard.23 In this 13 Feriae latinae, above, n. 7, and below. 14 J.

Alexander Kerns, to be published by Mouton, 1970. For the antiquity of the word tripudium in Latin, compare the ancient legal word repudium, also related to pes and originally meaning 'to kick (your wife) out' (Brugmann, KG 145), though the later Romans preferred a more moral sense and related the word to pudet (Festus 350, 3: ob rem pudendam).

Both are, essentially, victory celebrations. Though the triumphator did not carry spolia himself, the ritual procession included the final dedication of part of the spoils to the gods by the commander in person, and this confrontation between the imperator and the god persists into the latest phase of the triumph.25 According to tradition, Romulus, as the founding father of Rome, had carried out the first consecration of spolia to the gods, and long after, any political leader who aspired to appear as parens patriae imitated this symbolic act: Caesar, Augustus and all the emperors after him. Most striking was the tropaiophoria of Constantine, when he founded the new Rome.26 The various stages of the ritual ana procession are still reflected, as Picard has also shown, in a very ancient lex regia attributed to Numa,27 the 'fifth law of Numa', describing the three kinds of spolia which the general of the victorious army dedicates to the gods: 28 the spolia opima (prima) to Jupiter Feretrius, the secunda spolia to Mars of the Campus, and the third spolia to Janus Quirinus. Roman antiquarians, no longer recognizing the context in which the series belonged, gave a simplified version which ignored the gods other than Jupiter Feretrius, and reduced the three types of spolia to a chronological order. According to this version, the spolia opima were dedicated only three times in all Roman history.29 Instead, as Picard shows, these three types of dedication of the spolia originally corres- ponded to three hierarchic divisions of the same ceremony; the sacrifices to three gods, Jupiter, Mars, Janus Quirinus, forming three phases of a procession which went around the city performing a progressive ceremony of purification. Spolia were first consecrated to Mars in the Campus Martius extra pomoerium, outside the city boundaries. Next came the dedication of spolia as the dux passed through a gate and entered the city itself: these were spolia consecrated to Janus Quirinus, presiding over the prototype of the porta triumphalis.30 The final phase of the ceremony consisted of offering the spolia opima (prima) to Jupiter Feretrius at his sanctuary on the Capitoline Hill. This is the phase remembered in connec- tion with Romulus, who is described as dedicating the spolia opima of the enemy commander at the temple of Jupiter Feretrius.31 As in the triumph, the general entered the pomoerium at the head of his troops in order to accomplish the lustratio or purification of the army, and undertook a series of successive sacrifices and dedications constituting a ritual circumambu- latio. In this primitive triumph, it may be inferred, the performance of a circumambulatio was more important than in the later procession, which still obediently circled the Palatine -as did the equally ancient institution of the Luperci-but found the true climax of the ceremony on the Capitoline Hill. The Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was to become far more of a focus than the sanctuary of Jupiter Feretrius ever seems to have been. In the triumph, too, the ritual purification of the general and his troops is implied. Festus still remembers the purificatory basis of the triumph, and the religious significance of the passage under the arch: ' laureati milites sequebantur currum triumphantis, ut quasi purgati a caede humana intrarent urbem.' 32 24 Charles-Picard, o.c.

In both cases, Jupiter Feretrius and Janus Quirinus are listed together. 31 Plutarch, Rom. i6. For 'spolia' dedicated on the Capitoline Hill, see the suggestion of S. Reinach, 'Tarpeia', RA 4 S.2 (I908), 42 f., that an early sanctuary of the goddess Tarpeia was covered with enemy shields or spolia, thus giving rise to the later legend of Tarpeia: quoted by A. Momigliano, Misc. Fac. di Lett. e Filosofia S.2, Torino (1938), 28 (also 23, n. 2): ' forse prima che fosse costruito il tempio di Giove Capitolino.' 32 Festus 104 L (I 7 M).</page><page sequence="6">54 LARISSA BONFANTE WARREN Picard's reconstruction, which I quote here in an over-simplified form, gives a con- vincing picture of an original Roman ritual from which the triumph perhaps developed: a rite celebrated after a victory, involving dedication of the spolia to the gods and a solemn religious procession, designed to purify the commander and his troops. 2. The person celebrating the ritual. This was the victorious commander, the king. He alone had the necessary imperium and was granted auspicia. The hazy figure of this primitive rex of the community and the nature of his power have been studied in recent years by G. Dumezil, S. Mazzarino, U. Coli, P. De Francisci and others.33 One of the scholarly problems about the ritual of the triumph concerns the practice of the king or triumphant general of reddening his face with minium. The custom might have been originally simply part of a special way of dressing, to make the hero look like an exceptional person; yet one would expect it to have had special connotations, of the kind we think of as ' magic'. If it is indeed connected with a primitive belief in blood-guilt, as Wagenvoort and others consider,34 then it, too, belongs to this earliest level of the rite, and relates to the purification which is one of the basic intentions of the rite. 3. The procession. The victorious rex, as commander (rego), led his army, the returning populus of Rome, in sacrifices and rites making up a lustratio; and this would cleanse them from the impurity of their killing, as we see in a passage from Festus.35 The purifica- tion was carried out by an ambitus, the magic practice either of walking around the area to be purified, or leading the thing to be purified in a procession that culminated in a specific sacrifice. Such were the amburbium, and the ambarualia,36 which survived as long as the triumph, and still retained what must have been their original names. So, too, the lustratio described in the Iguvine Tables, where the purification is carried out by the procession of the people led by the officiating priest who makes sacrifices at stated stops.37 As for the returning populus of sturdy farmers, this should not yet be called an ' army' or legion, a term more suitable to the later procession of troops trained and organized by Etruscan officers. 4. The God. It was to Jupiter that the spolia opima (prima) were dedicated. Jupiter was always the chief god of the triumph, and his temple the goal of the whole procession.38 Jupiter Feretrius, especially associated with the Roman Mars and Quirinus, was a more truly Roman, or Latin, Jupiter, who was also connected with the ancient priesthood of the fetiales, themselves responsible for the most ancient ritual of war and peace.39 Very different was Jupiter Optimus Maximus, whom the Etruscans placed in his temple on the Capitoline Hill together with his Etruscan partners, Juno and Minerva. In historical times the cult of Jupiter Feretrius was of no importance, having been supplanted by that of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.40 Later, the Roman triumph once more was celebrated in honour of a Latin god, Jupiter Latiaris, at his ancient sanctuary on the Alban Mount. 5. The route of the procession. Many details are uncertain, but several things are clear. The procession circles the city in a counter-clockwise direction, the normal pattern in a lustratio; it is seen also in the procession of the Argei, in the Ambarualia, and the list of hills as given in some sources.41 But the route is more clearly implied in the description of the three sacrifices dictated by the lex regia, which would have the procession begin in the Campus Martius, enter the pomoerium through the site of the later porta triumphalis, and then, after following the foot of the Capitoline Hill on the east and making a curve along the Vicus Jugarius and across the '3 Above, n.

After circling the Palatine, it turned into the original Sacra Via; in traversing then the pre-Etruscan Forum it passed in front of the Temple of Vesta and the temple of another god, whose name we do not yet know, in the area of the later Regia. In its final phase one would expect the procession to have led past the ancient sanctuary of Saturn and so to the Capitoline Hill, where in the Temple of Jupiter Feretrius the spolia opima would have been dedicated. It is intriguing, however, to find that Roman sources do not connect the Sacra Via with the Capitoline Hill, but rather describe it as leading from the Temple of Vesta and the Regia to the Arx; 42 it is curiously like the Iguvine traf Sahatam, the sacred road on the way to the citadel of the city, which was to be purified by the procession (see below). On the way, the procession passed by the site of the later Circus Maximus and of several sanctuaries of Hercules in the Forum Boarium. These included the site of the later cult statue of Hercules Triumphalis who was regularly dressed, like the later triumphator, in the triumphal insignia on the occasion of a triumph; 43 his cult, represented by the Ara Maxima and round temples dedicated to him as Victor and Invictus, was very ancient in this area, and it is likely, in view of his titles and the route of the procession, that he was connected in some way with the pre-Etruscan victory ritual.44 Comparison with the Iguvine Tables. Startling resemblances with the rituals described on the Iguvine Tables may confirm certain details of this reconstruction. It is true that the Iguvine tablets, like the Roman triumph, show Etruscan influence-the earlier ones are actually written in the Etruscan alphabet-but since this community had never been ruled by Etruscan kings who celebrated the native Italic rite as their own, as had the Romans, the Etruscan influence was less marked; and it is therefore understandable that the rites described on these priests' ' breviaries ' should agree with those the Romans celebrated before Etruscan influence came to Rome. Both institutions were far older than the sixth century B.C. The similarities are all to be found in Tables Ia, b (written in the national alphabet, adapted from the Etruscan), and VI and VII (in Latin script),45 which describe two types of ritual, the piatio, the purification of the hill or arx (ocar in Umbrian), and the lustratio populi. The text is preserved by the Fratres Atiedii, a priestly brotherhood com- parable to the Roman Fratres Aruales.46 42 Most recently Coarelli, op. cit., 55-103, with bibliography. For information on the results of recent excavations I thank Frank Brown; in a preliminary report in Les Origines de la republique romaine, Fondation Hardt, Entretiens, 13 (I966), 45-6I, he discusses the development of the Forum in this area during the first three quarters of the sixth century (before the 'Etruscan Triumph '). See E. Gjerstad, Les Origines de la republique romaine I7, on the pre-Etruscan divinities of the Forum, the sacred unit of Jupiter-Mars-Quirinus, Janus and Vesta, represented by their respective priests, the rex sacrorum (Janus), flamines maiores (Jupiter-Mars- Quirinus), pontifex maximus ('sacerdos Vestae ').

Ernout's remark (57), that the Iguvine Tables bear witness to the later stages of an ancient cult, applies also to historical triumphs, and to the recording of the hymn of the Arval Brothers. Both this text and the Law of Numa discussed above (nn. 10, 27), for example, were updated by the mention of specific fines to be paid, in order to keep pace with a higher economic development: Charles-Picard, op. cit. 13I, Ernout 58. 46 An *adfertor (arsfertor: Devoto, 'flamen') led the procession and performed the stated sacrifices after a ritual consultation with the auspex (in Um- brian, poi angla aseriato est, ' qui oscines observatum ibit '). The purification of Iguvium begins by de- fining the limits of the templum, the boundaries of the city. The *adfertor, then, dressed in the perca arsmatia (or having taken it up, if perca means staff rather than costume), leads the people around to perform sacrifices at each of the gates of the city in turn (vi a, i9: perca arsmatia habitu; see n. 48). There is a definite route to procession and sacrifice. The first sacrifice is dedicated to Jupiter Grabovius, with a prayer on behalf of the citadel Fisia (ocar *Fisir) and the people of Iguvium (i a, 3-4, vi a, 22: ' te hoc bove opimo piaculo tertio ', cf. spolia opima?). There follow sacrifices to Trebus lovius, Mars Grabovius, and Fisus Sancius (cf. Dius Fidius). A prayer to another god, Fisovius Sancius, on behalf of the citadel, the ocar *Fisir, and the people of Iguvium (vi b, 5 f., 6-I6), ends with instructions to the officiating priest to perform a tripudium (Pesculu sernu uesticatu atripursatu: ' tripodato ', Pisani 154, Buck Ii8 ; above, n. 22). After other sacrifices, including two to Vofionus Grabovius (equivalent to the Roman Quirinus, the god of the people, and the Etruscan Bacchus, Fufluns, whose name seems also related to *poplo- ' of the people '), the hill is purified. The lustratio populi also was performed by means</page><page sequence="8">56 LARISSA BONFANTE WARREN The following comparisons between the Umbrian ceremonies at Iguvium and the dedication of the spolia opima at Rome, identified with a primitive triumphal rite, seem worth pointing out: (i) the lustratio populi, performed at Iguvium by means of a circumlatio, or procession of the people, and at Rome by circling the primitive pomoerium; 47 (ii) the procession, led by the person performing the ceremony: the *adfertor at Iguvium, the triumphator at Rome; (iii) the special dress of *adfertor and triumphator ; 48 (iv) auspicia taken at the beginning of the ceremony and referred to the *adfertor- the triumphator, too, had to have had the auspicia; 49 (v) the boundaries of the city preserved in the ritual (templum, pomoerium); 50 (vi) sacrifices performed along the route of the procession according to a fixed order in the Umbrian ceremony, which are mirrored in the original Roman triumph by the dedica- tion of the spolia opima to three gods in turn: Jupiter, Mars and a god whose name in Umbrian, Vofionus Grabouius, may be the name of the people, as the Roman Quirinus is god of the Quirites; 51 (vii) the importance of the gates of Iguvium, at which sacrifices are made-compare at Rome the sacrifice to Janus Quirinus, and the importance of the porta triumphalis; 52 (viii) the sacred route of the procession along at least one Via Sacra; (ix) a corrida, or ludi(?) performed after sacrifices to Jupiter; of a procession around the city, led by the priest after he has put on his ceremonial dress. The route is once more marked by sacrifices along the way, in- cluding one traf Sahatam, ' trans Sanctam (uiam ?) ', perhaps equivalent to the Sacra Via (TRASATE, i b, 3I; SATAME i b, 38; trahaf Sahate vii a, 41 ; traha Sahatam VII a, 4I and 45). The priest must return by the same route. A kind of corrida, when animals are let loose and caught again, may be comparable to the ludi, but their nature is not clear. The importance of the number three is striking in this ritual, as in a number of Roman traditions; for example, the prayer repeated three times, este triper deitu, 'haec ter dicito '. For the magic character of the number three, cf. the triads (nn. 5I, 85), and the tripudium. 47 cf. the ambarualia, amnburbium, etc. Above, n. 42. 48 The special costumes worn by the persons celebrating these rites-Iguvine purification cere- monies, dedication of the spolia opima, or Etrus- canized triumph-are described in our sources by means of technical terms difficult to interpret, and have been in each case the objects of considerable speculation. The Iguvine rites. The perca (above, n. 46) has been interpreted as either a staff (uirga) or a garment; it is arsmatia, 'sacred ' (ritualis), and it is anouihimu (vi b, 49), ' put on ', or ' girded '. Opinions are almost evenly divided on the meaning. In favour of' staff ' are Walde-Hofmann3 (s.u. pertica), Poultney (239), Pisani (I35, i68), Whatmough (Language 29 (I953), 297-298, 'measuring-rod '; and review of Ernout, Le Dialecte ombrien in CW 56 (i962), 8z). ' Dress ' has as its supporters Br6al (56: ' cf. praetexta '), Devoto (I72: ' cf. toga '), Bottiglioni, (Convivio, racc. nuova (1951), 449: 'cf. trabea '), Ernout (I25: '. . . emploi technique de perca au sens de vetement ray6; cf. uirgatis lucent sagulis, Verg., Aen. viii, 66o '). The word ponisiater, puni_;ate, which has been connected with perca, 'dress ' (Ernout), is often translated as puniceatus, purpureus, or ' dressed in a purple garment', a tempting theory in the present context. (Devoto, Tab. Iguv, 271 ; Poultney 27I, puniceus: why ' purple stripe'? * cf. Br6al, praetextam (cum) purpureis (clavis). Contra, Pisani I 69). The dedication of the spolia opima may have been connected with the cinctus Gabinus, not a special garment but a special way of wearing the toga, which was girded up for action, and was therefore the dress for war: Mau, RE s.u. Cinctus Gabinus. Livy VIII, 9, 5, cf. VIII, 9, 9; X, 7, 3. Servius, ad Aen. V, 755: cf. Aen. vii, 612, opening the Temple of Janus, Alf6ldi, 39 and note. The sources unfortunately do not describe just how the general was dressed. See, for example, the passage on Numa's lex on the spolia opima, Festus I89 M : 'M. Varro ait . . . esse etiam Pompili regis legem opimorum spoliorum talem: ' Cuius auspicio classe procincta opima spolia capiuntur, lovi Feretrio darier oporteat. . . ' The dress here signifies the state of action. The spoils the general has won when dressed for war (Paul. ex Fest. 25I b, 225 M : ' Procincta classis dicebatur cum exercitus cinctus erat Gabino cinctu confestim pugnaturus ') must be dedicated to the gods, and the general must make amends, perhaps in order to be allowed to make the final consecration in the dress of peace, the prototype of the triumphal costume. The triumphal dress of the Etruscan period and later will be discussed in the text. 49 P.

Iguvini iubentur in lustratione congregari arsmimo, kateramo ' (to which he compares Livy xxix i, i: 'ordinauit centuriauit '.) 54 The special costume of the adfertor (iii) and the corrida (ix) correspond to the trium- phator's special insignia and to the ludi triumphales, both of which would seem to be later Etruscan elements of the Roman triumph. Either these are Etruscan elements in the Iguvine rite, too; or, more probaby, the primitive Roman rite also followed the custom of dressing the triumphator in special clothes and celebrating the games, but under the Etruscan dynasty substituted Etruscan clothes and ludi for the native forms. II. THE ETRUSCAN MONARCHY For the Etruscan phase we have not only more, but more varied evidence: linguistic, archaeological and literary (or ' historical '). For the moment, let us briefly summarize the chief elements to be attributed to this Etruscan level. We shall deal with details, dis- crepancies and problems later. We can accept as certainly Etruscan the following: (i) the name of the triumph; (ii) the basic dress and insignia of the triumphator-the toga purpurea, tunica palmata, triumphal chariot and other traditional paraphernalia; (iii) the type of procession and its organiza- tion; (iv) not the god himself-Iuppiter is an IE name-but the anthropomorphic image and concept of the god around whom the rite centred, Jupiter Optimus Maximus, and the cult statue representing him ; (v) the temple on the Capitoline Hill dedicated to him, the physical goal of the procession, which fixed once and for all the topography of the ritual itinerary of the triumph. All these changes date this ' Etruscan level ' to the end of the sixth century B.C., in traditional terms during the dynasty of the Tarquins, the approximate date being given by archaeological and linguistic evidence at least in part contemporary with the actual events. i. The name of the rite and its intention. It is now, I believe, that the triumph gets its name. The Etruscan word *triumpe, from the Greek epi'appos, equivalent to Latin tri- pudium, originally meant a particular musical beat and dance. It was probably introduced, as we saw, as marching and singing directions designed to set the beat for a parade which was now no longer a primitive procession, but a more formally organized military pompa, led by Etruscan musicians and Etruscan officers.55 As Varro tells us: ' sic triumphare appellatum, quod cum imperatore milites redeuntes clamitant per urbem in Capitolium eunti, " io triumphe "; id est a epi&amp;appco ac Graeco Liberi cognomento potest dictum' (LL vi, 68). So the ceremony, according to Varro, was named after the soldiers' cheer, 'io triumphe'. At the same time the word was also introduced into the hymn of the ancient priesthood of the Fratres Arvales; since they did not change their name, their pre-Etruscan nature is not in doubt. In both cases, the basic religious ritual seems to have changed but little: the Etruscans added the outward, civilizing forms, such as music and technical terms. 2. T'Ihe person who celebrated the ritual. In the Etruscan form of the ceremony the place of the primitive Roman rex was taken by the Etruscan king of Rome, the lucumo (or was he already a zilac?); 56 he now celebrated the victory of the army according to the 54 Tabulae Igucvinae 26I (cf. 277 f.) on no.

Cf. also acclamations in the highly conservative ceremonial of the Byzantine court, and commands in the Byzantine army, which continued to be in Latin, though few knew their derivation. Constantine VII Porphyrogenetos him- self, who transcribed some of these phrases into Greek phonetically, no longer realized the original meaning of Tov,uppnKas-tu uincas! or 'may you win!', a shout resembling the triumpe of the Etruscanized triumph at Rome.

The appearance of this Etruscan king can be much more clearly reconstructed, with the help of contemporary artistic evidence, than the figure of the earlier Roman rex. Although we know more now, perhaps, about the powers of the rex than the Romans did, or even than was known fifty years ago, we cannot yet visualize his appearance; since those robes and insignia of office and honour which meant so much to the Romans were taken over from the Etruscans, it is the Etruscan king that we see in Rome, dressed in his magnificent purple robes, driving his chariot in the Via Sacra to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, as the soldiers cheer, ' io triumpe! io triumpe! ' But the triumphal dress, like the word triumpe, meant different things for the Etruscans, from whom it was adopted in the late sixth century, and for the later Romans who used it on special occasions only. Can we then attempt to reconstruct the insignia of the triumphator of Etruscan times ? This has not been done, so far as I know, although the monuments available tell us a good deal about Etruscan dress of the late archaic period, when Etruscan influence was strongest in Rome. The chariot in which the later Etruscan king and triumphator rides is the normal vehicle of Etruscan nobles in honorary processions; this we know from fragments of chariots found in Etruscan tombs and contemporary representations of Etruscans chariots on reliefs of the late sixth and early fifth century (P1. V, I, 2). 7 Other elements of the Etruscan triumph are also familiar from archaic Etruscan con- texts. Though an ' eagle-topped sceptre X 58 has not been found in Etruria, sceptres with eagles appear elsewhere at an early date, for example in Cyprus (P1. VII, I).59 In Etruria an ornate pommel, probably for a sceptre, found in the seventh-century Tomba del Duce at Vetulonia, might have been a symbol of the dead man's status, along with the chariot which accompanied him to his grave ; 60 surely symbolic, too, was the ' ivory-topped sceptre ' 57 Relief from Velletri, A.

The Monteleone chariot in the Metropolitan Museum, New York, dating from soon after the middle of the sixth century, gives us an idea of the kind of decorated chariot the Etruscan king drove into the city. Cf. the story of Tullia who ran over her own father with a carpentum on the Capitoline Hill (Livy I, 48); Tarquinius Priscus and Tanaquil come to Rome in a carpentum (I, 4). Though this is a covered wagon rather than a chariot, ob- viously Livy always sees the Etruscan rulers driving carriages or chariots. W. Helbig, ' Le cuirruts du roi romain,' Melanges Piot (Paris I903) I67-172, col- lects the material known at that time, but erroneously assigns the currus of the Etruscan king to the Latin rex of Rome. Chariot fragments are found in tombs as early as the seventh century: G. Camporeale, La Tomba del Duce. Vetulonia I (Florence I967), 23 f., 28. For the currus triumphalis, Ehlers, RE 503. According to some (below, n. 75; Fowler 153-7), Jupiter himself took part in the pompa, carried in the triumphal tensa; this may be illustrated on the Praenestine cista in Berlin with a representation of a triumph, L. Bonfante Warren, AJA 68 (I964), 35 ff. I do not believe it was originally the ' chariot of Jupiter ', as some sources call it, though this connotation was un- doubtedly present in later times. 58 References in Ehlers, RE 495 (he thinks the sceptre did not originally belong), and Inez Scott Ryberg, 'Rites of the State Religion in Roman Art', MAAR 22 (I955), 20. According to Alf6ldi the symbol of rule was originally, in the pre-Etruscan triumph, the lance which the victorious general carried back from war. He agrees with W. Helbig (Abh. Ges. Wiss. Gottingen, phil.-hist. Klasse, n. F. IO (I908), no. 3) in recognizing the hasta or lance as the symbol of the imperium of the Latin king (vs. the Greek sceptre) and sees a lance, rather than a slender staff, as the attribute of one of the figures on the late-sixth-century Etruscan relief from Chiusi, now in Palermo (P1. VII, 2): A. Alfoldi, 'Hasta, Summa Imperii', AJ7A 63 (1959), I ff., illustrated 4, pL. 3, I. Mazzarino, op. cit. (n. I) 69 ff., first used this as a historical document. Cp. E.

Livy v, 4I; Appian, Pun. 66) illustrated on a late sixth-century terracotta plaque from Caere (P1. VI, I).61 On contemporary monuments we can also recognize the original model of the trium- phator's toga purpurea, to be identified with the peculiarly Etruscan tebenna which appears on male figures at this time (Pls. VII-VIII); its rounded shape is easily distinguishable from that of the rectangular himation worn by Greeks and, indeed, by many except the Etruscans. The tunica palmata, or bordered tunic, was also often represented on Etruscan male statues of both men and gods at this time. A good example is the Apollo from Veii, of the late sixth century B.C., who wears a rounded mantle and purple-bordered tunic (P1. VI, 2).62 The triumphator's golden necklace or bulla fits into this original Etruscan context, though it was soon given a special meaning by the Romans. Modern historians explain it as an apotropaic and honorary symbol, adopting the Roman explanation. Whether or not the bulla had any magical significance for the Etruscans, it was certainly a widely used type of jewelry, judging from its constant appearance on all types of figures, dancers or divinities, nude or draped.63 This much archaeological documents tell us about the dress of the triumphator in Rome at the time of the Etruscan monarchy. What did the dress signify for the Etruscans themselves, when it was first used for the triumph in Rome ? The answer must be sought within the Etruscan context as we can reconstruct it from contemporary linguistic and archaeological evidence, rather than in inferences from Roman sources to assumed Etruscan institutions. The latter approach has, I believe, led modern scholars to take seriously apparent contradictions in the Roman tradition, and project these back to Etruscan times. The question concerns the original symbolic value of the triumphal dress. It takes us into two different, though basically related issues: (i) the dress of the Etruscan kings, and (ii) the ' divinization ' of the triumphator. (i) Roman authors often identify the triumphal dress and insignia with royal insignia: the insignia of the Etruscan kings is said to have been just this gold crown, ivory throne, eagle-topped sceptre, purple gold-decorated tunic and mantle of purple, ' like those of the kings of Lydia and Persia .64 There is no doubt, furthermore, that in the Roman mind 'triumphal' and ' royal' dress were practically equivalent. Under the name of triumphal garments, Masinissa was granted in fact the emblems of a king.65 Romulus, the first king, was described as wearing triumphal garments. Caesar, who had been granted the privilege of wearing triumphal dress, almost wore the dress of a king-he lacked the crown or diadem, which Antony tried to give him.66 The emperors, when they assumed triumphal dress as their permanent robes of honour, took the garb, if not the name, of kings.67 On the other hand the Romans often refer to the insignia of the triumphator as the 'ornatus' of Jupiter Optimus Maximus.68 What, then, was the relation between the dress of the triumphator, the dress of the king and that of the god ? Were the insignia of the triumphator originally royal or divine ? The difficulty is that scholars have projected a later, Hellenistic idea of the triumph back into an Etruscan context. The distinction between divine and royal dress was created 61 Alfoldi, op. cit., 36, pl. i. Giglioli, AE pl. io8, i. M. Pallottino, Etruscan Painting (Skira 1952), 33 f. (not illustrated). J.

The Etruscans, at the end of the sixth century, did not distinguish men and gods by their dress, as far as we can see in the monuments; this lack of clear distinction, notoriously, often makes it difficult for us to recognize certain figures as divine or human. Witness, for example, the still unresolved controversy about the identification of scenes represented on stone and terracotta reliefs of the late sixth and early fifth centuries; are we to see assemblies of magistrates or divinities (e.g. in P1. VII, 2), or human or divine banquets ? The use of the same type of standard scene with different meanings according to the context-sometimes the figures being meant to represent gods, sometimes humans-is plausible, just because no distinction was made, in this case, between the appearance of a man and that of a god.69 The Romans not only developed a different dress for divine, royal, priestly and civil persons, but in explaining the distinctions often misinterpreted earlier evidence on the basis of their own conceptions: and Etruscan monuments, often so closely related to known events of Roman history, were read as documents of their own past. An example of such explanation is a passage of Suetonius describing the difference between the toga of the gods, the toga of the kings, and the trabea of the augurs: Suetonius in libro de genere uestium dicit tria genera esse trabearum: unum dis sacratum, quod est tantum de purpura: aliud regum, quod est purpureum, habet tamen album aliquid: tertium augurale de purpura et cocco.70 This is a purely Roman attempt to organize the evidence of the past according to a later hierarchy of values. We have no proof that the dress of the Etruscan ruler, king or tyrant, was any different from that of the other Etruscans. Dress similar to that worn by the seated personage on the painted terracotta plaque from Caere (P1. VI, i), which is often quoted to illustrate a special costume ' of Etruscan kings ', is to be seen on figures which cannot possibly be kings. Indeed Livy's story that Mucius Scaevola mistook Lars Porsenna's secretary for the king because they were dressed alike, and consequently assassinated the wrong man, may well reflect Roman surprise and confusion at such a lack of distinction.71 Suetonius was obviously trying to put some kind of order into certain special forms of the toga, which had by his time come to symbolize the hierarchical order of priest, king and god. The use of the word trabea for toga is, of course, to name the part for the whole. Strictly speaking, the trabea refers to the short, rounded mantle with a striped design (*toga trabeata) that was pinned at the shoulders; it was reserved as a uniform for the knights and for such ancient priesthoods as augurs and Salii and is identifiable as the third type described by Suetonius, ' de purpura et cocco '. The second type is, I assume, some version of the toga praetexta, though as far as we know this costume was white with a purple border and not vice versa. The Etruscan 69 For the relief cippus from Chiusi, above, n. 58. Cf. a terracotta relief from Velletri : Akerstrom 205 f., fig. 4; Alfdldi, AJA 63 (I959), 3 f., pl. 3, fig. I. Luisa Banti argues (II mondo degli etruschi, pl. 52 below and text; cf. pl. 37 above) against interpreta- tion of the Chiusi relief as an assembly of magistrates from Clusium, pointing to similar scenes with female figures which would speak in favour of assemblies of divinities ; such a standard scene, how- ever, could also be adopted to represent human scenes. Recently, scenes on sixth-century terracotta relief frieze-plaques, excavated at Poggio Civitate, have reopened the question. Of the four frieze-types found (banquet; chariot race; funeral or wedding procession ; and group of seated figures), the last is interpreted as an assembly of major deities by the excavator, Kyle M. Phillips, 'Bryn Mawr Excava- tions in Tuscany I967', AJA 72 (I968), I21-124; Archaeology 21 (I968), 254-257. The size and attributes of the figures, rather than their dress, distinguishes them from the servants in attendance, but there is nothing about their dress that dis- tinguishes them further as divine: it is the way the second figure holds out her mantle which makes it likely she is to be identified as Hera, or Juno (Uni in Etruscan), with her husband Zeus (Jupiter, Tinia). The armour-bearing figure behind him is probably not Athena, as Kyle Phillips suggests, but conceivably a male servant. Nor do the three make up a' Capito- line Triad' in the company of the triad of the lower world, according to Otto Brendel and Georges Dum6zil, with whom I have discussed this question. In an article on 'Etruscan Dress as Historical Source', to appear in AJA in 1970, and in a forthcoming book on Etruscan dress, I discuss the problem of the interpretation of divine vs. human figures according to their dress. 70 Servius, ad Aen. vii, 6I2. Cf. A. Alfoldi, Die altrdmische Reiteradel und seine Ehrenabzeichen (Baden-Baden I95z) on the trabea, which was not, however, restricted to the knights, but was a cere- monial uniform which was practical for people such as the Salii, since it was short, and pinned securely at the shoulder. 71 Livy ii, I2.

VI, i). This toga praetexta of the magistrates was indeed often attributed to the kings; but Roman tradition was not agreed upon the kind of toga the kings used to wear, several sources claiming it was the triumphator's toga purpurea. According to Suetonius the toga purpurea was dis sacratum, reserved for the gods: he is evidently thinking of the mantle of Jupiter. The triumphator, too, as we know from other sources, wore a toga purpurea before the toga picta came into use. (ii) The image of the god and the triumphing general-in the present context, the Etruscan king-wore the same type of garment. Does this mean that the general became the god when he wore the same clothes as the god ? Many modern scholars have used this similarity in dress and insignia to ' prove' the temporary deification of the early trium- phator; in fact, such a conception is quite un-Roman, and did not enter the triumph until Hellenistic times. The issue has been hotly debated, and I only reopen it here because the temporary deification of the triumphator is still unquestioningly accepted in the most recent works.72 Modern scholars have tried to solve this problem by deciding which had the priority-god, king or triumphator, and so to find in one of the three the original model followed by the others. But the failure to distinguish between the chronological levels of the triumph has kept the discussion from reaching any definite conclusion. The minium with which the triumphator paints his face or body probably belongs to the level of the pre- Etruscan triumph; the insignia of the triumphator are those of the Etruscan king of the late sixth century, and those ' of the god ' belong to the contemporary Etruscan image of Jupiter Optimus Maximus; finally, the idea of divinization belongs to a Hellenistic context. A summary of the discussion to date may be in order. i. The earliest theory gave precedence to the image of the god; thus, whenever Roman sources testified to the triumphator's use of the ornatus of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, the god's chariot, and red minium like that on the cult statue in the Capitoline temple, they implied that he was impersonating the god; 73 that was why he wore the apotropaic bulla, while a slave whispered in his ear, ' Remember, you are a man.' 74 2. A reaction against this view emphasized the royal as against the divine character of the triumphal insignia. Deubner, especially, took the king to be the source for the images of both god and triumphator.75 The king was the model reflected in the statue of the god, the divinity being in effect represented as Jupiter Rex.76 3. Wagenvoort, followed by De Francisci, takes the image of the triumphator, rather than the king, as being primary. De Francisci even suggests that, in external appearance 72 C.

The red paint on the face (and body) of the triumphator has a quite different origin, and is due to religious, magic reasons: Wagenvoort, op. cit. I66 f.; Deubner, op. cit. 32;I cf. E. Wunder- lich, Bedeutung der roten Farbe im Kultus der Gr. und Rom. (Breslau-Tiubingen 1925), 2I f. The coinci- dence between the two facts has confused both ancient Romans (Pliny, HN XXXIII, 36, III-II2) and modern scholars. Wagenvoort, op. cit.

The bulla, Deubner points out, would not be necessary to protect the triumphator from inuidia if he were indeed the personification of Jupiter Optimus Maximus; cf.

According to Deubner, the 'royal' emblems, dedicated to Jupiter and kept in his temple, belonged to Jupiter in this sense only. 76 Deubner, op. cit. 321 f. Fowler, op. cit. i56, was no doubt right: triumphator and divine image were each originally painted red for different reasons. The statue's colour at this date, though, was as much due to artistic convention as for ' intensiveres Leben '.</page><page sequence="14">62 LARISSA BONFANTE WARREN as well as in conception, the triumphator preceded the image of the god,77 and that, because the triumphator's face was painted blood red for apotropaic reasons, the god imitated the triumphator in this detail as in others. Later, he suggests, when the image of the god had long been accepted, and the primitive custom of painting the king with minium had been forgotten, the priority was reversed; it was then said that the triumphator imitated the image of the god. Though such reversals of cause and effect, original and imitation, often did take place in the minds of Romans and antiquarians, we cannot ignore the evidence of the monuments: contemporary Etruscan works, like the Apollo of Veii (P1. VI, 2), prove that it was normal practice to paint the flesh parts of male terracotta statues dark red.78 Vulca in creating a type of cult image surely had no need to imitate either king or triumphator, when he was following an established artistic tradition. It should not surprise us, then, to find that the dress of the Etruscan king who celebrated the triumph was similar to that of the god; for this was an Etruscan statue of Jupiter Optimus Maximus, made by an artist from Veii. King or tyrant, triumphator and divine image were simply dressed in contemporary Etruscan manner. The identity is no more than an identity of fashion, without any of the implications of divinity or religious signifi- cance attributed to it. In the Etruscan triumph the type of insignia and dress were still flexible. It was the Romans who, in handing down the tradition, gradually construed each element strictly as a symbol, though they could not keep contradictions out of their neatly ordered picture when its origins had not been so strictly organized. The purple toga worn by the statue of Jupiter eventually took on divine associations, no doubt, from the image of the god on the Capitol. Other garments, too, developed special symbolic connotations; for Roman magistrates and officers, after the expulsion of the Etruscan lords, adopted their foreign and luxurious clothing either as military uniforms or as insignia of power, and preserved them as the marks of ancient priesthoods; but it was within a new hierarchy, and its symbolism had no longer anything to do with the Etruscans. Let us return to our reconstruction of the Etruscan triumph. 3. The procession of the Etruscan triumph, we should suppose, was quite a different thing from that of the early Roman ritual. The Etruscans not only introduced military organization into Rome-Servius Tullius' constitution preserves the memory of this change; the three tribes have Etruscan names, the very word populus may be Etruscan.79 They also introduced or transformed music in all phases of life, in games, funerals and military life the Etruscan army trumpet, called by the Greeks the aocXiriy(, or salpinx, was known in all the Mediterranean world, and was exported widely.80 In this military and musical context, the Etruscan word for a dance or marching step was taken over as a cheer, and eventually came to be the name of the most awesome of Roman pompae. Those funerary pompae of important Etruscans descending into the underworld, riding in chariots and preceded by musicians (P1. V, 3), that are often represented on later Etruscan sarcophagi or funerary urns, are still related to the triumphal procession as the Etruscans had transformed it. 81 The Etruscans, then, organized the populus as an army; and when they came back from war victorious, the soldiers marched to Etruscan music, and sang ' io triumphe! ' as the Etruscan ruler ascended the Capitol in his splendid robes. The picture Varro paints of the triumph, as we have seen, is an Etruscan one.82 The shout, leader and goal of the procession have all been changed from the early Roman rite. 77Wagenvoort, loc. cit., De Francisci, loc. cit. 78 For the painting of sculpture, see G.

The deity which the triumphator confronted, and which he resembled in his way of dressing, was now an Etruscan god, Jupiter Optimus Maximus, substituted for Jupiter Feretrius. Within his great temple the terracotta cult statue, commissioned from Vulca of Veii, was venerated until its destruction in 83 B.C., when it was replaced by a copy of the Greek Zeus, Pheidias' statue at Olympia.83 There had been no image at all of Jupiter Feretrius, since before the end of the sixth century, when the statue of Jupiter was consecrated, the Romans had worshipped their gods without images.84 The very concept of a god so anthropomorphic that he could be depicted and actually greeted, as it were, in person, was new to the Romans. The partners of this god were new, too; the trio of Jupiter, Juno and Minerva, each of whom had a cella in the temple 85 was an Etruscan and not a Roman combination. The statue of Capitoline Jupiter belonged to the school of Veii; it is thus contemporary with statues actually found there, all of which are to be dated near the end of the sixth century (P1. VI, 2 and cp. n. 62). Was Jupiter shown seated, like the contemporary statue of a divinity from Paestum (P1. VIII, I, 2),86 and like the later image which took its place, a copy of the Pheidian Zeus of Olympia? Or was he, as Ovid describes him, standing (Fasti I, I, 20I): ' Juppiter angusta uix totus stabat in aede, inque louis dextra fictile fulmen erat '- i.e. a terracotta statue of Jupiter brandishing a thunderbolt? He was dressed, no doubt, in rounded purple mantle, the Etruscan tebenna-at least one bronze statuette of the god found in Etruria wears this-and purple-bordered tunic like the victorious Etruscan king, the Apollo of Veii, and those figures of divinities or humans we see on Etruscan reliefs (PIs. VI-VII).87 It is noteworthy that other figures connected with the triumph also wore Etruscan dress: the bronze statue of Hercules in the Forum Boarium, and possibly a second statue, the Hercules fictilis, made by Vulca and perhaps commissioned in connection with the triumph; 88 not to mention that strange figure of a clown who performed a kind of war- dance in the triumphal procession, wearing the toga praetexta and golden bulla.89 5. The route of the procession and topography of the Etruscan triumph. The triumph now took place in an outwardly Etruscan city, yet, even in this changed environment, the triumphal procession followed its earlier pattern. It still circled the boundaries of the earlier city, ending at the Capitoline Hill. What seems to have changed was not the path, but the focus. Whatever the Forum had been like before the Etruscans-and the traditions concerning the foundation of the great temple perhaps imply that the Capitol had not always been the religious centre of Rome-from now on the end-point was clearly the new temple of its southern side.90 83 M.

Dumezil sug- gests, however, that the statue might not really have been made at Rome, but brought in from Veii later, as were so many statues of divinities. Certainly there must have been a tendency to attribute late Etruscan influences to an early period. 89 Festus 428 (36 L): ' Senex cum toga praetexta bullaque aurea.' Appian, Pun. viii, 66; Plutarch, Rom. xxv, 5; Quaest. Rom. 53. Deubner, op. cit. 322. Pliny, HN XXIII, 4, 9-IO, connects, in a different context, the toga praetexta and the bulla with the Tarquins; Jean Gage, MEFR (I962), 99 f., thinks he represented the king of Veii of the fourth century. Cf. Piganiol, op. cit. 29-30, who is, I think, probably right in identifying him as one of the original Pyrrhic dancers of the procession; they had belonged to the ancient Roman rite-witness the Salii and their armed dance-but adopted Etruscan dress during the transformation of the triumph; their sole survivor was later looked upon as a clown by the people of Rome. 90 Leifer, loc. cit.

It is certainly a problem of great importance, since the change marks a new direction in Roman religious and political thought; but I have not been able to determine precisely when this trend begins. III. HELLENISTIC PERIOD Other elements of the triumph, often attributed by Roman tradition to the ' Etruscan kings ', clearly belong to a later period of development in Hellenistic times.9' The evidence for this phase is again both literary and archaeological; but now the literary evidence is much more reliable. To this period belong the famous descriptions of historical triumphs. As has been pointed out, Appian's description of the triumph of Scipio Africanus in 201 B.C. marks the beginning of a new type of triumph (Pun. viii, 66), while Plutarch's account of Aemilius Paullus' triumph in I67 B.C. (Aem. Paul. 34) presents this new tradition as already firmly established.92 The accounts illustrate the new features of the Hellenistic triumph: the unheard-of luxury it introduced into Rome, and the enormous personal prestige it bestowed upon the victorious general. The luxury brought with it changes especially in the triumphal costume. No matter how sacred or luxurious the toga purpurea and tunica palmata had been in the days of the Etruscan kings, they now seemed relatively old-fashioned and plain, and were replaced by more elaborate dress. Roman antiquarians of the first century B.C. were aware that certain changes had taken place in the triumph between the early Republic and their own time.93 The triumphal dress of the late Republic and Empire no longer resembled archaic Etruscan dress of the sixth century. Both the special toga and tunic had changed. Festus tells us that the original toga purpurea was replaced by the toga picta, decorated with designs in gold threads,94 and that the tunica palmata, though it kept the same name, changed in form, and was also decorated with a design, probably a palmette design, instead of having a border the width of apalma, or handspan.95 This change in the costume occurred in the third century. Descrip- tions of triumphs after this period talk about the toga picta, but Festus says he saw honorary portraits of generals still wearing the toga purpurea in temples of the third century. We have few examples of Roman painting from this period, but we can turn (P1. VIII, 3) to the portrait of Vel Sathies in the Fran9ois Tomb from Vulci to see the effect of a purple toga 91 Adrien Bruhl, 'Les influences hellenistiques dans le triomphe romain', MEFR XLVI (1929), 77-95. Wallisch, Philologus xcix (I955), 245-258, goes too far in attributing the triumph as a whole to this late date. Latte, op. cit., 212 f., 22I ff. Cf. also Jean Gage, 'De Tarquinies 'a Vulci: les guerres entre Rome et Tarquinies au 4e siecle avant J. C. et les fresques de la " Tombe Franqois,"' MEFR (I962), 99, I22. 92 Coarelli, op. cit. 92. 93 Other changes in 'official' Roman dress in- cluded the use of the gold ring and the regularization of the width of the stripe on the tunic: Pliny, HN XXXIII, 7, 29. 94 Festus 228 L (209 M), 'picta quae nunc toga dicitur, purpurea ante vocitata est, eaque erat sine pictura. eius rei argumentum est . . . pictum in aede Vertumni, et Consi, quarum in altera M. Ful- vius Flaccus, in altera T. Papirius Cursor trium- phantes ita picti sunt ' (after the destruction of Volsinii, 264 B.C.). 95 Festus, loc. cit.: 'Tunica autem palmata a latitudine clauorum dicebatur, quae nunc a genere picturae appellatur.' Clauus refers to either a border, or to a stripe like the angustus or latus clauus of the civil tunic. Martial, VII, 2, 8 ; Servius, ad Bucol. X, 27; Tertullian, de corona militis I3. A toga palmata (powiE) is also mentioned. That the later decoration consisted of a palmette design was sug- gested to me by Otto Brendel. For the symbolism of the palm tree, see W. D6onna, Rev. Hist. Relig. 139-140 (I95I), I43 f. The kind of decoration, the genus picturae, might have been considered by the Romans to be a Phoenician luxury: cf. F. von Lorentz, ' ,apexpwv *(p&amp;opvaira' RM LII (937), I65-222; Pliny, HN VIII, 195-196. Since tunics are usually covered, they are difficult to identify. See, however, the bordered tunic worn by the principal figure on a Praenestine cista (L. Bonfante Warren, AJA 68 (I964), 35 f., figs. I-5), at least partly dressed as a triumphator, but probably representing the magistrate leading the pompa circensis, who wore triumphal dress (Piganiol, above, n. 72): Otto Brendel points to the dishes laid out for the epulum louis as evidence that the representation refers to these ludi, rather than to the triumph proper (Piganiol 87, ioo). The description of the pompa in my article stands, since there is no real difference between the procession of the triumph and that of the ludi (Piganiol 75). A palmette border-decoration on the tunic of one of the other figures on the same cista may give us an idea of what this other palmata decoration looked like.</page><page sequence="17">JRS vol.

In place of the old idea of the purification or sacred protection of the city other religious connotations now enter the triumph, and there are discernible changes in its meaning. It is the general and his troops who are glorified in the triumphal pompa, which is identified with the Dionysiac procession following the god.98 Now, for the first time, we can detect in the rite the idea of the divinization of the general.99 He rides into the city at the head of his troops with so much gold and glory that he must be carefully protected from the evil eye. Therefore the necessity for the slave's warning, the apotropaic sense of the bulla and the insults hurled at him along with the cries of io triumpe: elements which, whatever their origins, are now meant to shield the person so dangerously exposed to evil spirits and the gods' envy. The custom, for example, of allowing the soldiers an unbridled license to insult the general they followed in the triumphal procession is certainly a primitive element, akin to the obscene comments which tradi- tionally accompanied the marriage procession.100 Yet there is no way of telling at what point it became connected with the triumph. The fact that it was primitive does not necessarily mean that it was a part of the triumph from the beginning; it could easily have been attached to it along the way, as a result of the growing importance of the general- and of the soldiers, who certainly found the practice congenial. In the midst of all this foreign influence, too, various elements attributed by both ancient and modern historians to the early Etruscan triumph may belong rather to the Hellenistic period. Moreover, Jean Gage may well be correct in emphasizing the importance of another phase of Etruscan cultural influence, that visible in Rome in the fourth century after the capture of Veii.101 We can point to several instances of such influence. In 364 B.C., histriones were brought to Rome from Etruria ('ludiones ex Etruria acciti' Livy, VII, 2, 3-4). The Etruscan language was at this time still used by the Roman aristocracy (Livy Ix, 36), and all the musicians in the procession were Etruscans, playing Etruscan musical instru- ments (Appian, Pun. VIII, 66). All this may, certainly, have reinforced the earlier borrowings from Etruria. But the more typical developments of the triumph were surely connected, not with any continued or renewed Etruscan influence, but with new historical realities and ways of thinking of the Hellenistic period. 96 The Franqois Tomb was constructed in the fifth century, but the paintings are variously dated. Most recently, M. Cristofani (' Ricerche sulle pit- ture della tomba Fran9ois di Vulci. I fregi decora- tivi', Dial. Arch. I (I967), I86-219, with previous bibliography) accepts a date in the fourth century on the basis of the decorative motifs. Cf. Pallottino, Mostra dell'arte e della civilta etrusca (Milan 1955) no. 420 (second-first century B.C.); Alfoldi, op. cit. 212 f., zz I ff.

The pre-Etruscan, originally IE, ceremony had as its goal not only a celebration of the victory but also a purification of the soldiers and the city. The character of the rites, sacrifices, topography and the participants-that is, god and triumphator-all went back to this first phase, which was independently remembered in the ouatio and in the dedication of the spolia opima, and which had elements in common with many other primitive rituals in Italy. 2. The period of the Etruscan monarchy at Rome, in the later sixth century, is reflected mostly in theform of the triumph. Scholars have been tempted in the past to consider the triumph as a whole an Etruscan contribution to Roman culture. But even though the triumph received many of its external features at this time-for example the name, the insignia of the triumphator, the statue and temple of the god-it seems the Etruscans did not change its essential meaning very much. The transformation of the triumph, from a purification rite for the whole city to a personal glorification of the general, apparently began to take place some time after this. 3. In the Hellenistic period outward changes were adopted that were consonant with the greater luxury and power of Rome; and, as a further step in the gradual transformation that had already been taking place, the idea of divinization now also entered the triumph.
