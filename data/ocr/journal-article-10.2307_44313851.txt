<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christianity and Literature Vol 57, No. 4 (Summer 2008) Awakened to the Holy: "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" in Ritualized Context Stephen Richard Turley On the afternoon of Wednesday, July 8, 1741, the Northampton pastor Jonathan Edwards began to preach a sermon titled "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" at the second meetinghouse in the town of Enfield. Following George Whitefield s visit earlier that year, the neighboring town of Suffield was experiencing a significant revival, with ninety-five communicants added the previous Sunday (Medlicott 218). Such enthusiasm, however, had not reached Enfield. In response to this spiritual lethargy, a number of clergy had banded together to stoke the fires of revival by instituting a series of weekday services, traveling back and forth between pious Suffield and impious Enfield (Marsden 219-20). Those weekday services included a visit from Northampton's pastor. What greeted the Enfield congregation was a sermon of unparalleled logic and vivacious imagery delivered by an orator known not for theatrics but for a pulpit voice characterized by "a powerful sense of restraint, authority, and discipline" (Buckingham 139). Stephen Williams provides the contemporary account of the congregations response to Edwards: He preached a most awakening Sermon from those words [in] Deut. 32:35 and before [the] Sermon was done there was a great moaning &amp; crying out throughout the whole house: what Shall I do to be Saved - oh I am going to Hell - of what shall I do for a Christ, etc. The Shreiks &amp; crys were piercing &amp; Amazing (qtd. in Medlicott 218). The people of Enfield had just experienced what would be considered "the most famous sermon in American history" (Minkema 663). It took a while, however, before "Sinners" received the attention of literary analysts. Kenneth P. Minkema documents that studies on Edwards s preaching style and sermons began in the late eighteenth century as part of larger studies in American sermonic literature and continued into the 507</page><page sequence="2">508 Stephen Richard Turley twentieth century in the work of literary scholars such as Wilson Kimnach and Helen Westra (663-64). Originally published in 1741 in Boston, "Sinners" began receiving literary attention only in the 1930s with its inclusion in the Faust and Johnson Representative Selections of the Writings of Jonathan Edwards. But in 1949, three prominent events converged around Edwards and "Sinners": Edwin Cady published his "Artistry of Jonathan Edwards" in the New England Quarterly (detailing Edwards's masterful use of images of suspension and suppression in "Sinners"), Perry Miller published his biography of Edwards, and Billy Graham preached "Sinners" in Los Angeles (Minkema 664). 1 By the 1960s, "Sinners" became the "proxy" for Edwards in high school and college early American literary anthologies, though the sermon has been "balanced" with the inclusion of other selections of Edwards writings in the Norton Anthology of American Literature and Carla Mulforďs Early American Writings. Cady s article was followed by a stream of literary analyses of "Sinners," with the sermon receiving the attention of two articles in the June 2000 issue of the New England Quarterly (Minkema 669).2 In rehearsing the various proposals for explaining precisely how Edwards rhetoric moved his contemporary audience, Edward J. Gallagher concludes that the question for literary critics has always been accounting for the how and the why of the sermons power (220). And yet, in the midst of rehearsing the various proposals, each observing aspects of Edwards s rhetorical strategies, logic, form, and stylistic artistry, there appears a basic assumption that the sermons original power can be accounted for by inherent rhetorical features abstracted from the nature of religious discourse and its ritualized context.3 Several historical factors contribute to the implausibility of such an assumption. First, Edwards preached the sermon earlier to his own congregation in Northampton with no notable effect. Though widely recognized among literary analysts, there is very little account for this discrepancy of reaction between Northampton and Enfield in the secondary literature, other than Northampton had perhaps been desensitized having heard sermon content like "Sinners" before. Second, according to Kimnach, it is questionable as to how much of the sermon was actually heard amidst the tumult of the congregation ("Edwards as Preacher" 116). Third, the response to the sermon was so overwhelming that Edwards apparently did not even finish preaching it,4 which may have been the only time that happened to him (Stout "Jonathan Edwards Tri-World Vision" 44). Thus, a text-centered analysis of the efficacy of the sermons original delivery must address this gap between the sermon text and its original ritualized performance.</page><page sequence="3">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 509 This study will attempt to address this gap by a heuristic application of a ritual-theoretical approach to the sermon text. The analysis will follow several lines of inquiry: How is ritualized speech (i.e. the sermon) different from mundane language, and how can the nature of ritualized speech account for the efficacy of the sermon? How do the auditors in a communal context contribute to the efficacy of ritualized speech, thus accounting for the discrepancy between different reactions to the same sermon? Do emotional states obtained in ritualized settings account for intense experiences in the midst of limited apprehension? And how do the performer and audience interact to affect conversion on the part of the auditor? By interacting with both the literary features and the historical factors specific to the sermons original delivery, these lines of inquiry can illuminate the ways in which the dynamic interplay between ritualized speech and its communal context contributed to the sermons original efficacy. Performance and Authority We begin our analysis by asking: How would Edwards's speech from the Enfield pulpit differ from ordinary speech characteristic of mundane life? And does that difference contribute to an understanding of the sermons efficacy? Philosophers over the past few decades have been highly interested in the distinctly performative characteristics inherent in ritualized speech, characteristics termed "performative utterances" and "illocutionary acts" by J. L. Austin and "speech acts" by J. R. Searle. The peculiar characteristic that has attracted attention is the creative or generative quality of performatives. Speech acts, as in the case of ritualized speech, do not so much correspond to reality, as do the reporting nature of what Austin called "constatives," (3, passim ) statements, or reports, the truthfulness of which being determined by the degree of correspondence to a reality objective and previous to the statements. Rather, performative or ritualized speech generates reality; it creates a state of affairs the truthfulness of which is an inherent property of the speech itself. As such, ritualized speech functions as the inverse of the correspondence theory of truth.5 The utterances that transform a prince into a king, dub a knight, bestow manhood upon a Marring boy through supercision, or pronounce newlywed status upon the betrothed do not entail statements considered true because they report a previously existing state of affairs; rather, these states of affairs are considered true to the degree to which they conform to the ritualized utterances (Rappaport 132).</page><page sequence="4">510 Stephen Richard Turley An important distinction is made by Austin between illocutionary and perlocutionary acts, noting that the former (e.g. "I warn you that") is not the same as the latter (e.g. "I convince you that") (Austin 130). However, while the efficacy of a performative utterance is not dependent on the personal belief of the auditor, it is dependent on the acceptance of the auditor.6 Austin observed that the illocutionary force of expressions, their efficacy in generating a state of affairs, presupposes a socially accepted institution whereby such words are uttered by properly authorized persons under proper circumstances (14). But Austins recognition of performatives as "conventional procedures" contingent upon accepted institutions never amounted to a detailed examination of these conventions (Rappaport 125). This task was taken up in the work of the French philosopher and sociologist Pierre Bourdieu, who argues that the success of performative utterances is conditioned on the appropriateness of the speaker in the context of the speaker s social function, since rituals are constituted by a "combination of a systematic set of interdependent conditions" (111). Bourdieu develops his assertion that the "power of words is nothing other than the delegated power of the spokesperson" (107, emphasis in original): What one might call the liturgical conditions, namely, the set of prescriptions which govern the form of the public manifestation of authority, like ceremonial etiquette, the code of gestures and officially prescribed rites, are clearly only an element , albeit the most visible one, in a system of conditions of which the most important and indispensable are those which produce the disposition towards recognition in the sense of misrecognition and belief, that is, the delegation of authority which confers its authority on authorized discourse . . . the language of authority never governs without the collaboration of those it governs ... (113, emphasis in original) Bourdieu observes that the structure of ritual is "circular," in that the authority inherent in ritual and its generative oratory is ultimately contingent upon its acceptance by those presumably subject to it (Bourdieu 113; Rappaport 430). In Bourdieus category, if the institution that invests authority in a speaker is socially rejected, then the speakers authority will be proportionately implausible. Thus, the plausibility of the state of affairs generated by ritualized discourse is directly proportionate to the fidelity invested by the auditors in the ritual institution of which they are participants.</page><page sequence="5">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 511 Authority Incarnate in New England The above performative model may be used heuristically to further illuminate the significance of homiletic speech in eighteenth-century New England. In his chapter on the liturgical setting of New England sermons, Hughes Oliphant Old observes that "New England understood itself as a covenant community. It was a community which existed to serve God, and therefore it must regularly hear from God how it was to serve him" (178). The primary instrument through which the community heard from God was the sermon, a genre that had in ancient times acquired "an association with the idea of privileged, sanctioned, even divinely inspired speech" (Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney xi). In New England Congregationalism, the sermon was architecturally enthroned "in the dominance of the central pulpit on the long wall of practically every Puritan meetinghouse, as well as in the symbolism of the open Bible resting on a velvet cushion on the pulpit s edge" (Davies 79). Kimnach observes that though "the term reason and the reputation of the Puritans for 'iron logic have fostered the notion that something approximating modern academic logic exists in the arguments of these sermons, the burden of proof is actually carried by authority- that of the ministerial Voice and that of the Word of God" ("The Brazen Trumpet" 278 ).7 Harry S. Stout observes: New Englands unique social structure of interlocking institutions governed by a single nucleus of covenanted saints gave congregations the coercive powers necessary to impose their brand of piety on society, and it also endowed the sermon with unprecedented range and influence. Although spoken exclusively by the ordained ministers, the sermons source was not ministerial wisdom but Scripture, and its powers were the common possession of ministers, magistrates, and congregations. Besides dominating the Sunday worship services, sermons were delivered at every significant event in the life of communities. They were authority incarnate. ( The New England Soul 23) Although Edwards and the revival enthusiasts negatively interpreted the spiritual state of New England villagers, the analysis of Patricia Bonomi and Peter Eisenstadt suggests such spiritual declension did not translate in terms of large numbers of Americans rejecting the institutional church.8 Overall, the authors estimate that 80 percent of the New England population</page><page sequence="6">512 Stephen Richard Turley was churched (denoting those who attended church on a regular basis) in the eighteenth century, aided by compulsory church attendance laws in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, and South Carolina (275, 271 n. 109). Whitefields challenge to the authority of the ministerial office, though substantial, had yet to work its way through the warp and woof of New England social life (Marsden 210). In fact, Bonomi and Eisenstadt document George Whitefields comment in 1740 that as for "the Establishment of Religion" New England appeared to exceed "all other Parts of the World" (270). Thus, the English colonies continued to invest significant fidelity to the state of affairs generated from their pulpits. This delegation of authority, as Bourdieu would call it, served as an indispensable foundation for the potential efficacy of Edwards s sermon, enabling him to command the towns attention by performatively generating a world interweaved with biblical text and life in such a way as to profoundly shape the thought and practices of the people.9 Awakenings and Enfield As Edwards generated that world from the Enfield pulpit, there were several dynamics playing out behind the scene of the sermon. The original delivery of "Sinners" at Enfield was situated within the general milieu of awakenings in the Connecticut Valley in the 1740s following the Boston - to-Savannah preaching tour of the itinerant evangelist, George Whitefield. Upon learning of Whitefields plans to preach in New England, Edwards excitedly wrote to him in February 1740. After inviting Whitefield to Northampton, Edwards wrote: I hope this is the dawning of a day of God s mighty power and glorious grace to the world of mankind ... until the kingdom of Satan shall shake, and his proud empire fall throughout the earth and the kingdom of Christ, that glorious kingdom of light, holiness, peace and love, shall be established from one end of the earth unto another. ( Works 16:80- 81; qtd.in Marsden 204) 10 The visit by Whitefield to Northampton in October 1740 left a profound impression on Edwards. "By December 1 740, unmistakable evidences appear in Edwards manuscript sermons that he had begun to experiment and perfect his own revival rhetoric in Whitefield-like directions" (Stout, "JETWV" 42). For example, Kimnach describes the shifts in Edwardss sermon Notebook</page><page sequence="7">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 513 45 starting in 1735, among which was the adoption of a duodecimo sermon transcription that enabled Edwards to "palm" his sermons, "allowing for greater freedom and the appearance of extemporaneity" (Stout, "JETWV" 42; Kimnach, "General Introduction to the Sermons" 62-63, 100-01). In one of the entries made in his sermon notebook in early June 1741, Edwards writes: Doc. From some text, that there is nothing that keeps wicked men every moment out of hell but Gods sovereign pleasure. (P. 52.). (qtd. in Kimnach, "GI" 63) Edwardss idea was realized with his third sermon on Deut. 32:35 (the first two were preached in the early 1730s), which he titled "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God." It was first preached in Northampton in June of 1741, though apparently with little effect (Stout, "JETWV" 43). Regardless, this lack of efficacy seems not to have deterred Edwards in his use of the sermon, since he apparently took the sermon on the road. Itinerant evangelists found a certain prominence during the awakenings of the 1740s, and while little is known on how much Edwards itinerated during the summer of 1741, we do find him in the town of Enfield on July 8 armed with the sermon he preached a month before. Enfield provided perhaps the ideal setting for an awakening sermon. The contemporaneous perception provided by Eleazar Wheelock characterizes the inhabitants of Enfield as remaining "very secure, loose, and vain" in the midst of religious revival in neighboring towns, so much so that such towns interceded on behalf of Enfield that God would spare its inhabitants his judgment (Pudaloff 48). In fact, the congregational audience assembled to hear Edwards's sermon "hardly conducted themselves with common decency" (Pudaloff 58). But all was not well for Enfield. Ross J. Pudaloff s survey of the economic permutations in eighteenth-century Enfield reveals that the inhabitants faced an uncertain future. An intense scramble for land in Connecticut and Rhode Island had an eroding effect on the Puritan ideal of social unity entailed in the original establishment of Enfield in 1680 (Pudaloff 49). With the combination of what appears to be a freeze on the number of proprietary rights together with a large population boom affecting Connecticut, the original democratic distribution of land in Enfield increasingly gave way to the rise of a competitive, commercial society which, by 1750, effectively disenfranchised sixty percent of the inhabitants of Enfield (Pudaloff 50). Furthermore, a mild inflationary trend</page><page sequence="8">514 Stephen Richard Turle y caused by the issuance of paper money resulted in a widening socioeconomic gap between those who had a large surplus to sell and those who did not (Pudaloff 52-53). It was at the pulpit of Rev. Peter Reynolds where the awakening mission of Edwards and the disenfranchised stubbornness of Enfield met one Wednesday afternoon. The Sermon and Verbal Performance Well-schooled in the classical scheme of the Puritan sermon manuals, Edwards structures "Sinners" according to the conventions of this classic homiletic tradition.11 A significant stylistic change for sermons occurred by the beginning of the eighteenth century, one that "demanded a less elaborate sermon form than the baroque forms popular among both Anglican and Puritan congregations during the seventeenth century" (Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney xiii). This refined form comprised a tripartite structure of text, doctrine, and application,12 which for "Sinners" functioned "like spoked wheels, each deriving from and pointing back to the sermons Biblical text" (Buckingham 142). Edwards begins the sermon with Deut. 32:35: Their foot shall slide in due time , yet he offers no explanation of the context of the verse (situated within the "Song of Moses"), nor does he indicate that the quoted passage constitutes only part of the verse (Kreider). Rather, Edwards provides a verbal and conceptual explanation of the text that combines familiar imagery with a subtle shift in verb tenses over the course of four implications. The vestibular image of the "sliding foot" in the text and its development in the implications was recognized by Cady as a "sort of generic picture of him that walks in slippery places: a condition then as now realizable every New England winter" (Cady 261). But while the "[wicked Israelites] were always exposed to destruction," the second implication likens the "suddenness" of that destruction with the present tense example of "he that walks in slippery places is every moment liable to fall" (Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney 49, emphasis mine).13 The shift to the present tense is maintained throughout the remaining two implications and then universalized in the indicative statement or doctrine entailed within Deut. 32:35: There is nothing that keeps wicked men , at any one moment , out of hell, but the mere pleasure of</page><page sequence="9">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 515 God (50). In explaining the implications of the text in terms of the present tense and familiar imagery, the doctrine takes the present world of the Enfield congregant and merges it into the ancient world of the Deuteronomy text, transforming Enfield into a living sequel to the biblical narrative. From the vantage point of Richard Baumans conception of verbal performance, where performance is understood as a form of communication, Edwards (the performer) establishes himself as an authoritative interpreter of the congregants circumstances and thus draws his audience into the narrative world generated by such an interpretation (Harding 42). As the narrator, Edwards can bind the listeners to his performance and thus create a relationship of dependence that keeps the listeners caught up in the display (Harding 42; Bauman 15-24). Joining Enfield with the world of the biblical narrative entails for Edwards the primacy of Gods sovereignty, which involves an immediate divine preservation of a wicked world that finds rationale only in God s own forbearance rather than in any obligation on his part: By the mere pleasure of God, I mean his sovereign pleasure, his arbitrary will, restrained by no obligation, hindered by no manner of difficulty, any more than if nothing else but Gods mere will had in the least degree, or in any respect whatsoever, any hand in the preservation of wicked men one moment. (50) The unmediated proximity of Gods merciful preservation of the congregants life is subsequently developed in ten considerations that have significant relevance in reconstructing the sermons original delivery. Underlying the form-pattern of the considerations is a brief two-page outline at the end of Edwards s hand written notes that appears to have functioned as a prompt for rhetorical spontaneity. The fragment text reads: [Humankind] alwaies exposed to fall suddenly fall noting that tis G. that holds em up no want of power in G. They deserve it. They are Condemned to it [Hell] Tis the place they belong to God is angry with them. The devil if not Restrained would Immediately fly upon them and seize them as</page><page sequence="10">516 Stephen Richard Turley his own They have those Hellish principles in them that if G. should take off his Restrains Tis no security that there are no visible means of death at hand. Their own care and prudence to preserve their own lives, (qtd. in Stout "JETWV" 44) 14 Stout designates this fragment text the "real 'Sinners sermon" (44-45), 15 in that it provides the analyst with what Edwards considered the central paradigmatic thought from which he could generate a wider association of literary images. The images proper would be flexible, in that the outline of "Sinners" would allow Edwards to adapt his "performance to the situation of the audience, making it longer and more elaborate, or shorter and less adorned, as audience response, his own mood, and time constraints may dictate" (Bauman 39). Thus, the published text of "Sinners" can give us examples of a wider range of rhetorical techniques by which Edwards through a verbal performance predicated the paradigmatic thought of the two-page outline upon the unconverted congregants. This predication is demonstrated in the considerations with an interesting use of dialogue that would serve to draw the listener further into the world generated by the sermon. Edward J. Gallagher observes that Edwards repeatedly relies on imaginary dialogue, rhetorically inviting the listener to assume the role of Edwardss interlocutor. "Each of the ten reasons is an antiphonal dialogue with an invisible, rationalizing self, and one by one each excuse presented for postponing conversion drives the unconverted closer to his or her doom" (Gallagher 208). Gallagher on page 209 provides the following "antiphony" that develops the divine / human antithesis in the doctrine: There is no want of power in God to I have power to resist. defeat rebels. Divine justice never stands in the I deserve mercy, not hell. way. I'm legally free. You are already bound over to hell. The glittering is whet, hell's mouth I'm physically free. open.</page><page sequence="11">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 517 The devils await like greedy, hungry I'm not in imminent danger. lions. Hell is far off. Hell is within you already. The arrows of death fly unseen at I'm alive. noonday. I'm wise. The wise man dies like the fool. I plan. Listen to a planner in hell. I have God. No covenant, no obligation. What Gallagher did not observe is how such an "antiphony" reflects the way "rhetoric may be used by the advocate to insinuate himself or herself into the psychology of the potential convert" (Rambo 82). More specifically, the sermon can generate conversion within the auditor as he or she mentally appropriates Edwardss words in his or her own voice, creating a divided self where the listener becomes the speaker, a process that will be analyzed below. At this point, we may note that Edwardss performative interpretation of Enfield's world becomes embodied in the auditor through the latter s appropriation of imaginary dialogue. Already in the text and doctrine sections of the sermon, Edwards has drawn the unconverted congregant to the realization that this Deuteronomic text is talking about "me." In the application or use, Edwards directs the sermon explicitly toward awakening "unconverted persons in this congregation" (55). 16 While the text and doctrine of the sermon drew the listener into a world, the application generates a state of affairs underneath the unconverted listener. That world of misery, that lake of burning brimstone is extended abroad under you. There is the dreadful pit of the glowing flames of the wrath of God; there is hells wide gaping mouth open; and you have nothing to stand upon, nor any thing to take hold of: there is nothing between you and hell but the air; 'tis only the power and mere pleasure of God that holds you up. (55) By generating factives underneath the unrepentant congregants, Edwards infuses the sense of acrophobia (Steele and Delay 247) inherent in the vestibular imagery of the text, doctrine, and considerations directly into the bodies of his auditors, weighing them down as lead and pulling them into</page><page sequence="12">518 Stephen Richard Turley hell (Kimnach, "Gl" 7). Christopher Łukasik observes that by predicating the Newtonian law of universal gravitation to the human state of original sin, Edwards interprets the downward trajectory of gravitational pull as a lived-out embodiment of humanity's natural movement toward hell, a destiny delayed by Gods sovereign grace: "Your weight, as heavy as led, predisposes you downward, and it is God keeping you from falling as a rock" (55-56; Łukasik 234-42). The significance of the body in "Sinners" has been further illuminated by Steele and Delay in their analysis of Edwardss use of tactile imagery. Steele and Delay observed that Edwardss psychological manipulation of his congregation was rhetorically achieved through an incessantly threatening appeal to the tactile sense, "the most basic of all the major senses and the best avenue to reality" (244). They note that Edwards first generates sensibility to Gods restraint with a three-dimensional sensation of "fullness" and "overfullness": "The world would spew you out, were it not for the sovereign hand of him who hath subjected it in hope. There are the black clouds of God s wrath now hanging directly over your heads, full of the dreadful storm, and big with thunder; and were it not for the restraining hand of God, it would immediately burst forth upon you. . . . The wrath of God is like great waters that ... increase more and more" (Steele and Delay 246). Second, Edwards evokes a proprioceptive sensation generated by the piercing of the sinners heart with a blood-soaked arrow: "The bow of Gods wrath is bent, and the arrow made ready on the string, and justice bends the arrow at your heart, and strains the bow, and it is nothing but the mere pleasure of ... an angry God . . . that keeps the arrow one moment from being made drunk with your blood" (249). Third, there is the appeal to temperature, in the imagery of "flames of hell," "the flames gather and flash about them," "That lake of burning brimstone is extended under you," provoking a sense of pain on the part of the auditor (250). By predicating an eternally dire state upon the physical bodies of his auditors, Edwards takes abstract concepts and makes them substantial and in being made substantial, the abstract concepts are made comprehensible. The immediacy of Gods preservation of the unconverted is effectively predicated by virtue of the body, since "nothing can be experienced more immediately than the sensations of ones own body" (Rappaport 149). Kimnach notes that Edwards utilizes the anthropomorphic "hands of God" motif for the same purpose ("General Introduction" 169). With the precedent of its use in the writings of Ezekiel Hopkins and Edwardss esteemed colleague, Benjamin</page><page sequence="13">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 519 Colman, the hand image conveyed the idea of God s immediacy: "God is as close as the atoms which compose and sustain our being . . . The hand image had been fully sanctioned by the Bible and was clearly associated with the power of God to act in this life , particularly in terrible, retributive acts" (171, emphasis in original). The generative nature of performatives further enables Edwards to create a state of temporal / spatial nearness for the congregant, which, as Smith and Hyde have observed, accounts for the intensity of emotional experience in Aristotle s rhetorical model of pathos (450). The intensity of fear, for example, is in proportion to the nearness or remoteness of what one fears. The notion of destruction brought close to the audience (along with its inherent tactility of temperature) is illustrated by the following passage: O sinner! Consider the fearful danger you are in: 'tis a great furnace of wrath, a wide and bottomless pit, full of the fire of wrath, that you are held over in the hand of that God, whose wrath is provoked and incensed as much against you as against many of the damned in hell: you hang by a slender thread, with the flames of divine wrath flashing about it, and ready every moment to singe it, and burn it asunder; and you have no interest in any mediator, and nothing to lay hold of to save yourself, nothing to keep off the flames of wrath, nothing of your own, nothing that you ever have done, nothing that you can do, to induce God to spare you one moment. (58) Edwardss sermon, like all evangelistic preaching, "is intended to create a spiritual crisis by calling to the fore one s desperate and lost condition, which one may have been totally unaware of" (Harding 38) . Contrary to the popular perception that "Sinners" is a hell-fire sermon, its evangelical intensity is generated more by its focus on this life, "depicting the inevitability- and the temporal unpredictability- of death and judgment. Most people have no real belief in their own mortality, at least until a brush with death makes them feel their vulnerability. This sermon is Edwardss attempt to construct a verbal correlative to such a brush, and it is unremitting in the pursuit of its effect" (Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney xviii). "Sinners" and the Numinous Our analysis thus far has found that the generative nature of sermonic discourse functioned to create a state of affairs for the auditors, the plausibility of which was directly proportionate to the fidelity invested</page><page sequence="14">520 Stephen Richard Turley by the auditors in the ritual institution of which they were participants. Because the authority of the church was still widely accepted in eighteenth- century New England, Edwards was able to generate from the pulpit a felicitous state of affairs for the Enfield congregation, one that took full advantage of a range of rhetorical techniques that centered on predicating a dire state upon the bodies of the Enfield congregation. But what are we to do with the discrepancy between the Northampton and Enfield reception of the sermon? Why the life-changing reaction of the one congregation against the backdrop of the seeming ambivalence of the other? And what of the historically inconvenient situation for literary analyses that attempt to account for the sermons original efficacy by appealing to a rhetorical content that was limited in both its audibility and delivery? How were people affected given the limited apprehension of the sermons generativity? The corporate reaction to the sermon can be accounted for, at least in part, by its communitarian context. Anthropologist Roy Rappaport observes that communitarian rituals are the most common form of cultural event in which two experiences reciprocally arise. The first is an experience that the German theologian Rudolph Otto termed "numinous": the nondiscursive ineffable experience of the holy or divine (Otto 5-11; Rappaport 371f). It is the emotion of a creature, submerged and overwhelmed by its own nothingness in contrast to that which is supreme above all creatures . . . [the feeling expresses] the note of submergence into nothingness before an overpowering, absolute might of some kind ... The numinous is thus felt as objective and outside the self. (Otto 10-11) The object of the numinous is expressed as " mystérium tremendum ," that which is "quite beyond the sphere of the usual, the intelligible, and the familiar," characterized by "awefulness," "overpoweringness," and "energy," the encounter of which evokes variegated and complex emotional reactions, ranging from the terrifying to the sublime (Otto 12-26). In Ottos analysis, the wrath of God ( orgé ,) is the experience of the tremendum itself accompanied by a feeling of absolute "profaneness," resulting in a sense of self-pollution and defilement, "a direct reflex movement at the stimulation of the numinous" (Otto 18, 50-51). According to Rappaport, the primary way to numinous experience is through the second experience generated by communitarian ritual, what Victor Turner termed communitas (Rappaport 380). Communitas refers to a stage in the ritual process that creates an often egalitarian context that is</page><page sequence="15">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 521 perhaps reflective of a pretribal social order (Turner 94-165). This ritualized change in social conditions entails a change in the quality of experience, time, and personal identity. Set apart from the rational categories characteristic of the thought processes of daily life, participation in communitas may override discursive logic with the primacy of metaphoric representation and strong emotion. With the discursive logic and temporal regions of quotidian time vacated, communitas is marked by a sense of experience and time unique from ordinary affairs. Thus, it becomes normal for people "to behave in ways that would in other contexts seem bizarre. Trance and less profound alterations of consciousness are frequent concomitants of ritual participation" (Rappaport 2 19). 17 The dynamics of ritualized communities can account for both the discrepancy of reaction between Northampton and Enfield to the sermon on the one hand, and the intensity of corporate response to a limited apprehension of the sermons content on the other. First, while communitarian rituals are the most common form of cultural event in which the experience of the numinous arises, such an experience is not necessary to communitarian ritual. Put differently, though numinous experiences are most often associated with congregational gatherings, such experiences are not guaranteed by those gatherings. Hence the potential discrepancy between two corporate experiences of the same sermon. Second, provided that such an experience does arise, even without many congregants hearing the sermon, a corporate sense of numinousness could have been enough to create a subjective sense of direness on the part of the unconverted. What was heard from the pulpit, however sparse amidst the accumulated cacophony, would have then elicited the participative energy of the audience to invest Edwardss words with that sense of numinousness and thus allow themselves to be caught up in the world generated by the verbal performance (Bauman 43-44). Lewis R. Rambo well summarizes this interactionist efficacy between the words of the performer and the experience of the audience: Ritual provides experiential validation of the religious belief system being advocated. ... Ritual, which may include various meditation techniques, can enable a person to have direct, personal experience of a spiritual phenomenon that is then interpreted by the group as a confirmation of the doctrine being advocated. (115-16) The communitarian context accounts for a corporate experience of numinousness independent of the discursive data coming from Edwardss</page><page sequence="16">522 Stephen Richard Turley pulpit. To the extent the sermon was apprehended, the ritualized speech provides discursive data, which communally generated experience can in turn invest with nondiscursive numinousness, infusing the discursive data with a perlocutionary plausibility unrealized by the discursive data alone (Rappaport 383). The combination of all the performance indicators in Edwards's sermon- scripture reading, metaphors, parallels, dialogue, tactility, motion, weight, gravity, etc.- functioned illocutionarily to generate a state of affairs for the auditors. The ritualized community generated a numinousness that was wedded to the discourse of the performer, affecting the perlocutionary response among the audience. The effect of Edwardss verbal performance, the union of his discourse with the communally generated numinous among his auditors, the union of the illocutionary and the perlocutionary, produced an experience like no other - the sinner s encounter with an angry God. Conversion to the Holy According to Stephen Williams's account, the congregational reaction to this encounter was expressed in a cacophony of shrieks: "Oh I am going to hell" and "What shall I do to be saved?" These reactions exemplify a striking characteristic of the conversion process. Susan Harding's analysis of conversion in evangelistic preaching sees the process beginning when the listener appropriates the saved speaker's language as his or her own: The speakers language, now in the listeners voice, converts the listeners mind into a contested terrain, a divided self. At the moment of salvation, which may come quickly and easily, or much later after great inward turmoil, the listener becomes a speaker. The Christian tongue locks into some kind of central, controlling, dominant place; it has gone beyond the point of inhabiting the listener s mind to occupy the listeners identity. The Holy Spirit, the very Word of God, has come ... to indwell the heart of the believer, who may now publicly display in speech and action a personal, which is to say, conversational, relationship with God. (34) Moreover, the desperate pleas for salvation are consistent with Otto's analysis of the numinous wherein, upon an encounter with divine presence and creaturely profaneness, there is the human hope of deliverance by "atonement" and "covering":</page><page sequence="17">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 523 It [the perceived need for covering] comprises, first, a manifestation of the numinous awe, viz. the feeling that the "profane" creature cannot forthwith approach the numen, but has need of a covering or shield against the orgé of the numen. Such a "covering" is then a "consecration", i.e., a procedure that renders the approacher himself "numinous", frees him from his "profane" being, and fits him for intercourse with the numen. The means of "consecration", however - "means of grace" in the proper sense - are derived from, or conferred and appointed by, the numen itself, which bestows something of its own quality to make man capable of communion with it. (54) Enfields pleas for salvation were answered by Edwardss offer of Christ in the covenant of grace to the unconverted sinner: And now you have an extraordinary opportunity, a day wherein Christ has thrown the door of mercy wide open, and stands in calling and crying with a loud voice to poor sinners; a day wherein many are flocking to him, and pressing into the kingdom of God; many are daily coming from the east, west, north and south; many that were very lately in the same miserable condition that you are in, are in now an happy state, with their hearts filled with love to him who has loved them and washed them from their sins in his own blood, and rejoicing in hope of the glory of God. How awful is it to ... see so many rejoicing and singing for joy of heart, while you have cause to mourn for sorrow of heart, and howl for vexation of spirit! (63) The language of the pulpit occupied the listeners identity while the numinous experience evoked the need for a covering of ones creaturely profaneness, thus providing experiential confirmation to the Christ invitation. As Enfields unconverted embraced the salvific offer, the world generated by Edwards's pulpit and the world of the unconverted sinner became one. The performers words occupied the listeners identity. The listener thus became the speaker, and by embracing fully the world generated by that which was spoken, the divided self was overcome. This union reflects one of the fundamental properties of communitas, which is the blurring of distinction between self and other, revealing a hidden oneness of all things, which indeed might be the core meaning of communitas (Rappaport 381). And it is within this union that conversion receives a profound sense of plausibility, since the union between the world of the pulpit and the auditor entails overcoming the dire anomalies in the auditor s life about which the sermon informed him. Carl Raschke notes that the overcoming of anomalies is central to conversion:</page><page sequence="18">524 Stephen Richard Turley [A] conversion . . . enables a person to "make sense" out of what strikes his perceptual field by giving the descriptions of his world a new "sense." What is involved is a redescription of such a world, but the redescription is not randomly essayed. The redescription itself (in keeping with the new paradigm) is forced by the strength of the evidence. The old paradigm no longer works; it is riddled with anomalies. (435-36) With the overcoming of the anomalies entailed in an unconverted life, the experience of the numinous itself transforms from the ominous to one of communion. The numinous together with sacred discourse unite within the new believer to form what Rappaport terms the all-embracing sense of "the Holy," where nondiscursive feelings, emotions, and presentiments grasp, envelop, or pervade objects of discursive thought providing further confirmation of the doctrine being advocated (383). The term "holy," sharing as it does its etymology with "whole" (both words are derived from the Old English hale), is appropriate for the designation of that which encompasses and integrates both the discursive and nondiscursive aspects of human experience into an anomalously overcoming experience of union with Christ (Rappaport 384). What is striking about the contemporaneous account of the Enfield congregation is how this new congregational union around Edwardss interpretation of the world was corporately actualized - indeed, embodied- in the songs and prayers of the congregation: After some time of waiting the congregation were still So that a prayer was made by Mr. W[illiams] &amp; after that we descended from the pulpit and discoursed with the people - Some in one place &amp; Some in another and amazing &amp; Astonishing the power [of] God was Seen &amp; Severall Souls were hopefully wrought upon that night. Oh the cheerfulness &amp; pleasantness of their countenances that received comfort. Oh that God would strengthen &amp; confirm. We sang an hymn &amp; prayed &amp; dispersed the assembly, (qtd. in Medlicott 217) To sing and pray with others was not merely to symbolize this new Christological union; such actions were in and of themselves the union of the participants in the reproduction of a larger Christ-centered order. To paraphrase Rappaport, the participants did not simply communicate to each other about their experience of this larger order of the Holy but communed with each other within it. The songs of praise echoing from neighboring villages had now become the songs of Enfield. Hence our analysis accounts for Robert Lee Stuarts concern that the hope and comfort</page><page sequence="19">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 525 that some congregants received from the sermon not be overlooked, noting that "there is no evidence that the sermon at Enfield engendered despair more than hope" (46, 55). lhe despair was intended to be momentary, the joy eternal. The hymns and prayers following Edwards s sermon embodied a new order at Enfield, one that resolved a corporate despair by transferring the unconverted into a new state of being, members of the covenant of grace in Christ. Thus many of the congregants who left the meetinghouse that evening on July 8, 1741, were not the same as when they first entered. They were no longer objects of Gods wrath. They were now embodiments of his everlasting grace. Conclusion Using a ritual-theoretical approach helps to account for the extraordinary reception of Edwards's sermon at Enfield. The interpretive difficulties for the sermons original effect consisted of accounting for the difference of reception between Northampton and Enfield, the limited apprehension of the sermon amidst the tumult of the Enfield congregation, and Edwardss premature conclusion to the sermon. A ritual-theoretical approach bridges the gap between the published text and the corporate setting of its original delivery in order to account for the sermons original efficacy. Thus, the generative nature of sermonic discourse functions to create a state of affairs for the auditors. In turn, the plausibility of the state of affairs generated by ritualized discourse is directly proportionate to the fidelity invested by the auditors in the ritual institution of which they were participants. Because the authority of the church was still widely accepted in eighteenth-century New England, Edwards was able to generate from the pulpit a felicitous state of affairs for the Enfield congregation, one that took full advantage of a range of rhetorical techniques that centered on predicating a dire state upon the unconverted in the Enfield congregation. Communitarian rituals were the most common form of cultural event in which the experience of the numinous arose. Because such an experience was associated with but not guaranteed by those gatherings, communitarian numinousness could account for both the discrepancy of reaction to the sermon between Northampton and Enfield on the one hand, and an intensity of corporate response to a limited apprehension of the sermons content on the other. Finally, the interaction between performer and auditor contributed to conversion by the creation of a divided self where the</page><page sequence="20">526 Stephen Richard Turley listener became a speaker. The language of the pulpit occupied the listener s identity while the numinous experience evoked the need for a covering of ones creaturely profaneness, thus providing experiential confirmation to the sermons content and Christ invitation. The divided self was resolved in the listener s adoption of the pulpits paradigm for interpreting life and the embracing of a new unified corporate order in Christ that embodied that interpretation of life in song and prayer. As the hymns and prayers ended, the congregation had embraced the vision of Edwards. The mantle of Whitefields ministry, which so impressed Edwards, had now been passed to him. With the songs of praise and joy in neighboring villages echoing in Enfield, Edwards could hear New England resounding with the music of the kingdom of light dawning upon the earth. Through his tearful eyes, Edwards witnessed the pride of Satans kingdom shatter before the heralding of Gods sovereignty, awful wrath, and deliverance in Christ. Against the expectations of the neighboring villages, Edwards preaching did what no mere man could do. Enfield had been awakened to the Holy. Durham University NOTES lThe Jonathan Edwards center at Yale University hosts a digital exhibit of Billy Graham and "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," available at edwards.yale. edu. 2The stream of literary analyses include: Buckingham, Gallagher, Hearn, Kimnach, "General Introduction"; Lemay, and Steele and Delay. 3It is vital to note that the term "ritual" is used throughout this essay in its anthropological or nonsectarian sense. As such, there is an emphatic resistance to equivocating the term with precisely what Puritan covenantal theology sought to eradicate for the Christian, namely, "the intermediacy of ritual, of ceremony, of the Mass and the confessional" (Miller 185). As the historical survey provided by Catherine Bell has documented, the field of ritual studies has moved beyond the pioneering and foundational work of, for example, Émile Durkheim, and the structural and / or functional analysis of liturgical events. Proposals in ritual studies, particularly those in performance and practice theory, currently perceive all aspects of life as exemplifying ritualized activity. Such activity is characterized by various features that set apart ritualized practice from those activities that are characteristic of mundane life, such as the adherence to formalism, traditionalism, invariance,</page><page sequence="21">"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" 527 rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance. Formalism predicates actions with a certain elaborate punctiliousness that separates them from the informal and casual. Traditionalism infuses actions with a meaning that transcends the current and contemporary. Invariance consists of a repetitiveness of highly choreographed activity in contrast to the relative spontaneity of mundane activity. Rule-governance refers to activities subjected to a number of formal rules, such as athletic contests and dress codes. Sacral symbolism involves the material substantiation of abstract concepts such as nationalism (flag), holiness (temple), fidelity (marriage ring), and divine presence (crucifix). Perhaps most importantly, ritualized activity is performed, since it is in the participation of ritual that the performer embodies and thus is predicated with the various messages communicated through ritualized activity (e.g. a princes participation in a crowning ceremony predicates the prince with monarchy, thus transforming him into a king). See Bell passim , especially 138- 72. 4Stouts citation of the Stephen Williams account includes the statement: "there was a great moaning and crying out throughout ye whole House. ... So that ye minister was obliged to desist" (43). 5The correspondence theory of truth asserts the facts, events, or situations to which a statement refers presumably exist independent of and previous to the statement referring to them, with assessment of truth or facticity to a statement contingent upon its agreement in some sufficient degree to those previously existing and independent states of affairs. "The state of affairs is the criterion by which the truth, accuracy or adequacy of a statement is assessed" (Rappaport 117, 132). 6Rappaport explains the difference between belief and acceptance in terms of private and public orders respectively. Belief is "an inward state knowable subjectively if at all, and it would be entirely unwarranted either for us or for participants or witnesses to assume that participation in a ritual would necessarily indicate such a state. Acceptance , in contrast , is not a private state , but a public act , visible both to witnesses and to performers themselves . . . acceptance does not even imply belief. Ritual performance often possesses perlocutionary force, and the private processes of individuals may often be persuaded by their ritual participation to come into conformity with their public acts, but this is not always the case" (1 19-20, emphasis in original). 7 the sermon was most frequently likened to a silver trumpet by Puritan typologists, and Cotton Mathers manual for ministerial students, Manuductio ad Ministerium , contains the running title, 'The Angels preparing to Sound the Trumpets' It is an appropriate image, for the tripartite sermon is a dynamic instrument: intellectual and emotional Vibrations receive their fundamental character in the small mouthpiece, the Text; they acquire timbre as they pass through the Doctrine, and realize their full effect only in the bell of the Application" (Kimnach, "The Brazen Trumpet" 279).</page><page sequence="22">528 Stephen Richard Turley 8See further the comprehensive study by Cook. 9It again should be stressed that this "delegation of authority" did not necessarily entail belief in that authority but its acceptance. In other words, the public acts of church attendance and financial support entailed the acceptance of the institution but not necessarily personal belief in all that the institution espoused. 10 As evidenced by his correspondence, both the latest awakenings and those in Northampton in the early 1730s were for Edwards interpreted within a larger eschatological framework as outlined in his History of Redemption sermons (published 1739). There Edwards provides a comprehensive overview of the "grand design" of Gods plan of redemption (Westra 37). Of the perceived patterns of consistency inherent in Gods plan of redemption is the sequential manner in which Gods Spirit periodically interrupts the spiritual declension of humanity with a springtide of divine activity, with each periodic appearance intensifying in spiritual and soteriological degree. See Westra passim. nFor an analysis of sermon manuals in the Puritan tradition, see Hearn 45-49. 12Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney point out that the text-doctrine-application structure is the standard form of Edwards s sermons, from which he never varies (xiii). 13Unless otherwise noted, all quotes from "Sinners" are from the reproduced text in Kimnach, Minkema, and Sweeney. 14Kimnach speculates: The thought arises that Jonathan Edwards, under the influence of Whitefield, might have made an outline of his Northampton sermon for the Enfield performance ... but close examination of the ink of the outline reveals that this ink . . . has a vehicle quite different from that of any ink used during the summer of 1741" ("General Introduction" 145 n. 3). 15On the matter of Edwards s reworking and repreaching of his sermons, see Kimnach, "Gl" 140-63. 16Usually Edwards addresses a "double- audience" in his sermons: application for the converted and unconverted. A unique feature of "Sinners" is that the application is addressed solely to the unconverted (Kreider, n.p.). 17 A similar connection between community and emotional intensity has been applied specifically to "Sinners" by Smith and Hyde. Drawing from the classical rhetorical tradition and the philosophical analysis of Martin Heidegger, Smith and Hyde provide examples in which Edwards seems to deliberately employ strategies of identification, unifying his audience, by linking them together over the course of the sermon with the ancient Israelites and every listener in his audience (e.g. "whether you be young or old ..."), together with an intensification of emotion through the proximity of divine judgment (457). The authors conclude that "identification in personal relationships has a large role to play in the susceptibility to and intensification of emotions . . ."
