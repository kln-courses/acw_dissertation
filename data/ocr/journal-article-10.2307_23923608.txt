<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREGORY THE GREAT'S "LIFE OF ST. BENEDICT" AND THE ILLUSTRATIONS OF ABBOT DESIDERIUS II John B. Wickstrom In the spring of 582 the small monastery of Monte Cassino, founded by St. Benedict a generation earlier, lay in ruins. The onslaught of the Lombards, last and fiercest of the Germanic invaders of Italy, had caused the monks to abandon the foundation and flee to Rome for protection. The abbey was slow to recover. Monks from Fleury in Gaul picked among the ruins of Monte Cassino and found, they claimed, the bones of Benedict. These they transferred to the abbey of Saint Benôit sur-Loire, which became the preeminent center of Benedict's cult for centuries. In the late ninth century seafaring Saracen raiders once again scattered the community of Monte Cassino.1 As peace returned to the peninsula in the late tenth century, monastic life was slowly restored. Over the next century and a half a series of capable abbots slowly acquired the lands and reputation for religious leadership that transformed Monte Cassino from a ruin to "the first and head of all the monasteries."2 This restoration climaxed triumphantly in the reign of the greatest of its abbots, Desiderius II ( 1058—85), who rebuilt the abbey basilica on a grand scale on Monte Cassino's highest point. On the kalends of October, 1071, with much of the prelacy and nobility of Italy in attendance, and witnessed by a crowd "as numerous as the stars in the heavens," Pope Alexander II reconsecrated the great church.3 During the celebrations Desiderius dedicated to St. Benedict a lavishly illustrated lectionary for Vigils, specially created for the occasion. The opening illustration (Fig. 1) shows Desiderius presenting Benedict with the book. The splendid new abbey churches loom in the background, and Monte Cassino's vast possessions extend over a landscape beneath the feet of the two abbots. This book, now Vatican Library, Vat. lat. 1202, contains illustrated vitae of Sts. Benedict and Maurus along with material on Benedict's sister, St. Scholastica. A text much loved by Desiderius, the "Life of St. Benedict" composed by Pope Gregory I, forms the centerpiece of this codex.4 Its illustration by Desiderius's workshop forms the subject of this essay.

The placement of the illustrations clarifies the designers' intent to emphasize certain themes in Benedict's "Life," and this essay analyzes their presentation as Desiderius's com mentary on, or reinterpretation of, Gregory's sixth-century text.7 Novel political issues and the changing spirituality of the age of Desiderius are clearly evident in the illustrations, especially in their divergences from the emphases of Gregory's text. Desiderius's career spanned the last half of the eleventh century, one of the most important transitional periods in the history of the Church and monasticism. The new ecclesiastical environment of the late eleventh century introduced into the old monasticism many new concerns: debates over the relationship of the lay and ecclesiastical power intensified, as did issues of ecclesiastical hierarchy and right succession in the Church. The emergence of devotion to the Eucharist and debates over its nature developed in association with the increased prestige of the priesthood, while at the same time lay patronage and spirituality were becoming increasingly influential. Closely associated with these issues, the particular concerns of Desiderius also informed the iconography of the "Life": his rebuilding of the abbey church was a sign of the power of Monte Cassino in the new Church; his position as the successor and vicar of Benedict mirrored the growing concern of the nearby popes for their authority as heirs to St. Peter. Desiderius's concern for monastic chastity, as a source of authority in the atmosphere of anxiety over clerical celibacy, also found expression in the illustrations. The institution of oblates, an important source of income and of connection with the local noble families, is carefully illustrated. Nonetheless, Pope Gregory's interpretation of Benedict's life also remains fundamental to understanding the eleventh-century illustrations. For Gregory, Benedict's life was identical to his Rule: "Anyone who wishes to know more about his life and character can discover in his Rule exactly what he was like as abbot, for his life could not have differed from his teaching" (Dialogues 2.36). Gregory also considered Benedict's life a recapitulation of the lives of the heroes of Scripture, above all that of Christ: "For Benedict possessed the living spirit of all the Old and New Testament figures whose miracles he performed, including that of Christ" (Dialogues 2.8). The identification of Benedict with scriptural heroes in the eleventh-century illustrations is thus rooted in Gregory's sixth-century view of the patriarch of monasticism. However, the repeated visual suggestions of identity Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 33</page><page sequence="4">between Desiderius and Benedict (and perhaps with Benedict's disciple and successor, Maurus as well) keep the eleventh-century abbot before the viewer throughout the cycle. Monastic Formation The opening scenes of the cycle, occupying the entire surface of fol. 17r (Fig. 2), are more reflective of Gregory's core themes than of Desiderius's eleventh century concerns. The opening illustration, top register, left, shows Gregory, pen in hand, undertaking to write the life of Benedict. Seated in the classic pose of an evangelist, Gregory's figure here reminds the viewer that the monastic tradition considered the Gospel to be the foundation of Benedict's Rule. The titulus beneath the illustration reads: "Open your heart, be steadfast, reflect on what I will produce." These words recall the opening verse of the Rule: "Listen carefully, my son, to the master's instructions and attend to them with the ear of your heart." This double echo of the Rule, oral and visual, connects this figure of Gregory writing the "Vita" with that of Benedict composing his Rule (fol. 82r), the scene that opens the last group of illustrations. The next illustration in the top register, right, continues the theme of Roman intellectual and aristocratic life. It portrays, at least on the surface, the secular education that Benedict had pursued as a young nobleman in Rome and then rejected for the monastic life. Wearing the green and orange garments reserved in this manuscript for nobles and higher clergy (e.g., Pope Gregory's vestments in the preceding scene to the left), Benedict, with veiled hands, receives a book from a figure who is either blessing or instructing him.8 The titulus beneath reads: "The one teaches, while the other one learns, what letters and syllables are."9 Thus the book may represent secular learning, although in the Byzantine iconographie tradition the reception of a book with veiled hands most often occurs in the context of Moses receiving the Law.10 Such a reference is not inappropriately applied to Benedict, who was, the Cassinese tradition implied, a new Moses." Stylistically this scene anticipates Benedict's reception of the monastic habit from St. Romanus in the bottom register, left. The viewer might then contrast the image suggestive of the Old Law stemming from Moses on Sinai, in the upper register, right, with the new monastic law of love that emerged as a result of Benedict's adopting the monastic habit. From his perfect monastic life flows the new law of perfection, Benedict's Rule for monks, whose composition is depicted in the final scenes on fol. 80r. The middle register appropriately serves as a transition from the world to the monastic life. It depicts Benedict's first miracle, in which a tray, broken by the 34 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="5">t MmufL^y. ^-Lr-fc't^teuf.nu^. f-Ilnrirj Figure 2.

As Benedict prays alone in the church, he still wears the green mantle of a nobleman, but his aristocratic orange tunic has been replaced by a pale violet garment. This hue is associated throughout the manuscript with humility and social inferiority: it is the color of clothing worn by servants, such as Benedict's nurse in this register, and by peasants and novice monks. As the colors shift from the top to the bottom register of fol. 1 7r, the bright orange, green, and gold of Gregory's scriptorium, and of Benedict's Roman schoolroom, shade off into the paler green and violet of the transitional middle register; finally they are replaced by the deep ultramarine of the bottom register, where Benedict is shown fully embracing the solitary life. Ultramarine and vermilion are colors associated in the manuscript with the figure of Christ and with those persons and sacred objects closely connected to him. Vermilion seems to express Christ's divinity and power, whereas ultramarine suggests his presence in the world in his humanity. On this folio, for example, ultramarine is used for the figure of St. Romanus and for the hermit's cave, expressing the presence of Christ in the world through monastic holy men and their dwellings. (St. Romanus, according to one tradition, taught Benedict the principles of the monastic life as well as providing him with food at the beginning of his eremitic life.)12 The scenes that follow illustrate Gregory's principle of explicating the Rule through events in Benedict's life. Incidents in the training of Benedict's first disciples, Maurus and Placid, illustrate stages of formation in the monastic life. However, eleventh-century social and economic developments appear to have inspired the opening illustration of these scenes (fol. 30v): the reception by Benedict of Maurus and Placid as child oblates (Fig. 3). Benedict's Rule (ch. 59) mentions the practice of oblation, but by the eleventh century it was contributing much more significantly both to the economic well-being of monasteries and to the perpetuation of their populations. The Liber pontificalis praised Desiderius ' s Monte Cassino as a school for intellectual and spiritual formation that attracted "young men of extraordinary talent" from throughout the region.13 Consequently, Desiderius's illustrators transformed Gregory's passing mention of the oblation of Maurus and Placid (Dialogues 2.3) into an illustration occupying a major portion of fol. 30v (Fig. 3).14 Maurus and Placid, dressed as young nobles, are handed over by their natural fathers to their new spiritual father, Benedict. The solemn character of entry into the monastery is heightened by placing Benedict outside the abbey entrance, which stands invitingly open to the interior behind him. The young oblates indicate their desire to embrace the religious life by outstretched hands. Their attitude of petition is repeated in the illustration immediately below, where they are engaged in the fundamental activity of the Benedictine monk: 36 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="7">«&amp;8*&amp; itffr e«€jlfmiptm*m &gt;£ W«*t&amp; d&amp;fauty n&gt;T-vP6xKfg' W^Rfewto 3ma}pK$f r&lt;6p#lafl*s^i^6 twjf^sc^tnfo^H fmfaSpMyfe vAn l^o &lt;wj &amp;i is I JgK^ ^ ^ mu«*f .

In fact, the scene depicted on the bottom of fol. 30v provides a rare illustration of monastic meditative prayer after the office (Dialogues 2.4).15 Placid and Maurus lie prostrate before the altar in prayer, the titulus stating simply, "they pray" (orant). They are, however, distracted by a possessed monk who disturbs the communal meditation by wandering about. Maurus and Placid turn toward the scene on the right, where Benedict strikes the possessed monk, freeing him from the demon.16 While both Maurus and Placid look toward the exorcism, only Maurus's eyes are open, illustrating Gregory's text, which explains that through Benedict's assiduous prayer, Maurus alone (along with Benedict) was able to see the demon. This miracle symbolized Maurus's emergence as Benedict's closest disciple and chosen successor, since the charism of seeing spiritual realities to which others were blind was associated originally with the apostle Peter (Matt. 16:13—19), Christ's heir. The parallel between Maurus and Peter would not be lost on monks knowledgeable in Scripture and patristic writings. A parallel between Maurus and Desiderius would also have been evident to the contemporary observer. Since Maurus was the successor of Benedict just as Peter was of Christ, Desiderius would be the successor of Maurus much as the current pope would be the successor of Peter. In an age when the connection between the pope and Peter was receiving renewed emphasis in Roman ecclesiastical thought, the monastic parallel would have been difficult to miss, especially given the closeness of Monte Cassino's abbot to the papal party of Gregory VII. This scene also shows the importance of figurai position and orientation. In general, figures of virtue are to be found on the viewer's left. Thus Benedict is almost always depicted there. The good monks Maurus and Placid prostrate them selves in prayer on the viewer's left, facing the altar, located on the viewer's extreme left, whereas the possessed monk moves in the opposite direction to the right, away from virtue and order. From the perspective of the virtuous monks, Maurus and Placid, the possessed monk's movements are towards the left, towards damnation. As Benedict strikes the monk, thus breaking the possession, the monk looks back toward the altar, the source of virtue and grace, while the devil who had tormented him flies off to the right. Perfection and Power The examples of monastic training provided in Gregory's text remained relevant to the formation of monks in eleventh-century Monte Cassino, so the illustrators rendered these exempla rather faithfully. However, when Gregory turned to the subject of the building of Monte Cassino, Desiderius's illustrators 38 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="9">took a much freer approach. According to Gregory, when the training of the disciples was completed, Benedict determined to leave Subiaco. He and the dis ciples came to the site of Monte Cassino, where Benedict overthrew the altar of Apollo and constructed in its place two chapels and other monastic buildings. However, this rather minor incident in Gregory's text is transformed by Desi derius's workshop into a major series of illustrations clearly inspired by contem porary events. Desiderius's recent rebuilding of the abbey church, "the head and first of all monasteries,"17 is reflected in twelve contiguous scenes occupying two complete facing folios, 39v (Fig. 4) and 40r (Fig. 5), which form the central tableau of the entire picture cycle. Gregory had constructed his narrative so that the foundation of Monte Casino coincided with Benedict's attainment of monastic perfection. As a visible mark of Benedict's new status, the illustrators transform him from a beardless young man into an ancient grey-bearded patriarch. Two panels that form the core of the central scenes (fol. 39v, middle register) depict high-ranking clerics dedicating the altar of one of the two abbey churches (Fig. 4). Benedict and his monks look on from the other sanctuary, which has apparently already been dedicated, since its sanctuary lamp is lit. Gregory's text says nothing of church dedications, merely noting Benedict's replacement of pagan shrines to Apollo with two churches. However, seeing in this manuscript the gold and green of the high Roman clergy mingling with the sober black of the abbey's monks, viewers of these central scenes were perhaps less likely to recall the original foundation by Benedict than the splendid rededication of the basilica by Pope Alexander II, "one of the great events of the 11th century."18 In the illustrations of that splendid moment, Benedict and Desiderius seem to merge across centuries of Cassinese history into a single icon of "the great abbot" of Monte Cassino.19 These central scenes are framed by related actions in the top and bottom registers. In the top register, left, Benedict topples the statue of Apollo in the pagan shrine that occupied the site of Monte Cassino. The inverted, naked idol plunging earthward contrasts with the upright posture and the stately bearing of the heavily robed monastic and clerical figures immediately beneath.20 The falling Apollo also recalls the figure of Florentius plunging to his death in the previous set of illustra tions. There, a personal enemy of Benedict was miraculously brought down by divine power; here, the sensuality and disorder of the pagan world are symbolically overthrown and replaced by the asceticism and ritual discipline of the servants of the true God. The scenes in the lower register of fol. 39v (Fig. 4) draw the lay nobility into Desiderius's celebration. According to Gregory's text, Benedict went out from his new monastery to preach to the countrymen of the neighborhood. Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 39</page><page sequence="10">Figure 4.

Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 41</page><page sequence="12">Although Gregory's text does not indicate their social status, they are depicted here in the gold-trimmed garments of the nobility. The efforts of Benedict himself, the illustrators seem to suggest, had converted the predecessors of the noble laymen now attending and supporting the rededicated abbey and Benedict's successor, Desiderius. That such notables, including local aristocrats, the regional Norman rulers, and the emperor, viewed this book is not at all unlikely. It is one of the finest examples of monastic illumination from the century. Turning its pages before an audience of visitors would have provided Desiderius an opportunity to impress and educate. The six scenes on the facing folio (40r) illustrate the construction of the monastery buildings (Fig. 5). These too reflect events of Desiderius's time, since not only the main church but also many other monastic structures were rebuilt by Desiderius. The most striking eleventh-century reinterpretation within these scenes is the addition of laymen to each of them. Gregory's text mentioned only monks as builders (Dialogues 2.9, 11), but Desiderius's illustrators reflected the contempo rary reality that local lay workers were much involved in his building projects.21 In the top register, left, lay workers mingle with cowled monks as they attempt to move a stone toward the construction site. In the middle register, left, Benedict sends a messenger dressed in lay clothing to warn his workers that the devil is approaching, and in the middle register, right, a lay worker continues to work on the wall, while the monastic laborers attend to a fallen comrade. The focus of Gregory's narrative changes from this point. Since Benedict had achieved monastic perfection and did not venture forth again from Monte Cassino, the second half of Gregory's work abandons a chronological narrative to give examples of Benedict's supernatural powers. The most creative of these illustra tions represent three related incidents, depicted on fols. 43 v and 44r. In the first incident, according to Gregory's text, two monks dine at a holy woman's house while traveling, an action contrary to the Rule. On their return Benedict reveals his knowledge of their offense and assigns a penance (Fig. 6, top register). In the next episode, by sharing a meal with a fellow traveler, a layman breaks the fast he had promised to observe on his annual visit to Benedict (Fig. 5, bottom register). Later the abbot reveals to the laymen his knowledge of the meal and imposes a penance for the broken promise. In the third incident, Totila, king of the Goths, attempts to deceive Benedict by disguising a servant in royal robes and then sending him in his place to an interview with the abbot. Benedict sees through the deception and the astonished Totila begs his forgiveness (Fig. 7). In Gregory's text, these incidents illustrated Benedict's ability to see events from afar and to read the hearts of men closer at hand.

The three scenes are similarly designed and placed one after the other on facing folios (43v, 44r); the offenses are depicted on the left and their discovery and punishment on the right. Although the transgressions of the two monks and of the layman seem quite similar, Desiderius's illustrators depict their confrontations with Benedict quite differently: the two monks stand erect before the seated patriarch to be rebuked, whereas the layman's posture, in the lower register, right, is abject. The monks' heads are on a level with the abbot's, and they retain the dignity of the clerical status that they share with him. To a modern eye, the layman's offense may seem less serious than that of the two monks: they violated the rule of the monastery, whereas he simply broke a private promise to fast. Yet the layman literally falls at Benedict's feet, his arms crossed in a gesture of total abandonment to the patriarch's judgment, while Benedict makes an ad monitory gesture.22 It is also noteworthy that, although Gregory's text offers no indication of this man's social status, he is here depicted as a peasant.23 Both these scenes contrast strongly with the related episode that follows on the facing folio (44r): the submission of King Totila to Benedict (Fig. 7). The aesthetic high point of the entire cycle, this scene was painted with great skill by a new illustrator. The monumental figure of Benedict, posed in a blessing, towers over the kneeling king. The abbot's finely worked head has been described by commentators as "Petrine."24 This scene has inspired a good deal of political as well as art historical commentary. The abasement of the king before the churchman has been adduced as proof for the assertion that Desiderius's abbey was connected with the radical papal program of reform, especially its anti-imperial stance. Indeed, more than one scholar has asserted that this scene represents the victory of the sacerdotium over the regnum.25 However, several recent studies have failed to find radical ideas in Desiderius's policies before the 1080s.26 This work depicts a more traditional churchman whose primary object was the advancement of the well-being of Monte Cassino, both materially and spiritually. This goal required cooperation with, and respect for, the lay rulers of central Italy, including the emperor, who had special privileges while visiting Monte Cassino, which enjoyed imperial rank.27 He was entitled to special hospitality, and, as late as 1137, the emperor Lothar III said that a visit there was like coming to his own home.28 It is anachronistic at best to attribute to Monte Cassino in 1071 the hostility towards lay rulers that was only taken up by radical clerics at Rome during subsequent years. It is clear, moreover, that the focus of Desiderius' s political attention throughout this period was directed not towards the empire or the papacy but towards his powerful neighbors, the Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 45</page><page sequence="16">Normans, whom he treated with great skill and deference and with a keen awareness of common interests.29 Desiderius was fundamentally a peacemaker and a compromiser. His success in maintaining good relations with all the Italian political powers is evident in the attendance of leaders from throughout the peninsula at the dedication of the abbey basilica in 1071. A careful reading of this scene, especially in conjunction with the two preced ing, reinforces this latter interpretation. The king had attempted to deceive Bene dict, and, following Gregory, the illustrator shows him doing penance. But the posture of Totila shows nothing of the abject surrender of the poor layman in the previous scene. His is a dignified homage offered by a ruler still wearing his crown. The illustrator did not take the opportunity to depict Totila fallen prostrate before Benedict, although Gregory's text stated that Totila had prostrated himself.30 The illustrator chose instead the moment when Benedict responded to Totila's request for a blessing. Moreover, the monumental stature of Benedict here is balanced by his posture: he stands erect with head uncovered, suggesting deference toward royalty. In the two previous scenes, and in the left-hand panel on this folio where he reveals Totila's impostor, Benedict was shown seated and hooded, in a posture of judgment. The eleventh-century viewer of the Totila panel was likely to envision the powerful abbot of Monte Cassino receiving the gifts and respectful attendance of great men, a commonplace event at Desiderius's Monte Cassino.31 The eleventh century illustrations of these three incidents affirm the traditional medieval hierarchy in which clerics ranked above laymen. But they also suggest a traditional view of the special status of kingship, which was summed up well almost fifty years ago by Gerd Tellenbach: "There was never any doubt that the laity were the lowest in rank. . . . However, until the time of the Investiture Controversy the general conviction prevailed that kings were essentially different from all other laymen. They had a special mission from God and in them God's ruling will was peculiarly active, ennobling their persons."32 Gregory's text cleverly links the encounter of king and abbot with the following scene, the encounter of Gregory and Bishop Sabinus of Canosa (.Dialogues 2.15). Desiderius's illustrators went further and linked this scene to yet another, earlier event, the attempt of the wicked monks of Vicovaco to poison Benedict. This results in a scene of layered meaning of a sort that delighted medieval monastics. According to Gregory's text, Benedict prophesied the fall of Rome to Bishop Sabinus of Canosa. In the tale of Sabinus recounted in Dialogues 3.5, the bishop, like Benedict, had been tested by Totila. Having gone blind in his old age, Sabinus was said to have the gift of prophecy. Hearing this, Totila wished to test the gift. So when Bishop Sabinus invited him to dinner, Totila took the wine 46 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="17">cup from the server's hand and offered it to the bishop, hoping to discover whether the old man could discern who held the cup. Sabinus immediately identified Totila as the cupbearer. Some time later, Sabinus's archdeacon, impatient to take over the bishopric, bribed a servant to poison the bishop's wine. But when the server offered Sabinus the cup, the bishop replied "take the cup you are offering me and taste of it yourself'33 {Dialogues 3.5). At that moment the archdeacon fell over dead, although he was in another place. The location of the meeting of Sts. Benedict and Sabinus was not specified in Gregory's text, but according to Cassinese tradition, it occurred in the context of a meal.34 It is so presented here, on fol. 48r (Fig. 8). Benedict is seated at table with Bishop Sabinus attended by two monks, one of whom offers the holy men a beaker of wine. The design of the illustration repeats that of an earlier meal (fol. 26r; Fig. 9) at which the wicked monks of Vicovaco attempted to poison Benedict {Dialogues 2.3). In both scenes Benedict is seated on the left to bless the wine being offered him by a monk standing on the extreme right. The presentation of wine is also evocative of the attempted poisoning of Sabinus. The bishop of Canosa, seated on Benedict's left, here replaces one of the murderous monks from the earlier scene; but a seated monk who had looked out at the viewer on fol. 26 reappears here with the colors of his habit reversed, serving perhaps as a sign that a godly supper at Monte Cassino succeeds to the murderous meal of Vicovaco. The decision of Desiderius's illustrators to organize both of these scenes around a meal highlights the happy reversal of Benedict's career. At the first meal he was surrounded by rebellious, murderous monks in some nameless monastery. In the second he shares bread and wine with a renowned and saintly bishop in the great abbey of Monte Cassino. However, the elements of the meal are presented in a manner that also recalls eucharistie images: Benedict blesses the bread, displayed as a large host on the table, as the wine is formally presented. Such a strategy allowed the illustrators to shift attention to the eucharistie images that would dominate the scenes that follow (fols. 57r, 57v). Growing devotion to the Eucharist and intense debate concerning its nature played a large part in eleventh-century piety and theology. The debates were associated with the rise of clerical power, through which alone the supernatural power of the Eucharist could be made available. Abbot Desiderius and his monks were major participants in these developments, figuring prominently in the debates over Berengarius's teaching concerning the symbolic presence of Christ in the Eucharist that culminated at the council of Rome in 1079. A Cassinese theologian, Alberic, attacked Berengarius's views there, and his tract on the subject, De corpore domini, had a decisive impact on the council's decision to condemn Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 47</page><page sequence="18">ccMmcjivtmwrf ComySjcOfO- v rmnuf ^rrcpx^tenwcm JuM|f fux/ . }.• (tt$f$flittt«f£f*Tua: . nenTrtuUtr f£ crfwufumfuf . fcfhfcmcntic^ttc . ticxtemomntf fftr x^xc&amp;pen fficxer . nc^**cuttetnc*&gt; M«lf{^/uStero&lt;r «|f fo&gt;tac jfer a^tvcwf.-^fw^wf txwn -"xxn vixcxix pftrprfe^ur . f«r &lt;* *ur^ % '** Lec^c v*y Figure 8.

Berengarius.35 The unusually free adaptations of Gregory's text in the Eucharist illustrations are particularly striking in the context of this debate and the rise of devotion to the Real Presence, as well as of the associated growth of clerical power. In depicting three Eucharist-centered stories (fols. 57r, 57v), Desiderius's illustrators altered their original order. The first and the third in Gregory's text (Dialogues 2.22, 24) are shown first in two closely positioned, almost conflated, scenes on fol. 57r (Fig. 10). The third story, that of the unrepentant nuns, the second of these three stories in Gregory's text (Dialogues 2.23), is illustrated as a third, separate scene on the following folio (57v). This is the only reordering of Gregory's material in the entire cycle. Since this third scene contains powerful eucharistie images, the stories were reordered so it could serve as a climax for the series. The first of these images, on the left of fol. 57r, depicts the appearance of Benedict in a dream to two sleeping monks whom he had sent to found a monas tery. In the dream he explains the desired placement of the new buildings. Although Gregory's tale emphasizes Benedict's power to influence remote events, it also introduces a potential eucharistie theme by comparing Benedict to the prophet Habakkuk, who was transported long distances to share his meal with the prophet Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 49</page><page sequence="20">t*%a $&amp;(&amp;.

"As he [Habakkuk] came in the body to impart food to the body, so he [Benedict] came in the spirit to nourish the spiritual life." Three looming ecclesiastical structures in the background frame the eucharistie actions. In his appearance to the sleeping monks, Benedict stands on the roof of a church with crozier in hand, one of only two times he appears in this cycle bearing this symbol of authority. In the contemporary Exultet Rolls from Monte Cassino and other churches in southern Italy, the figure of Ecclesia, usually female but sometimes male, is frequently depicted on the roof of a church.36 These images suggest the importance of the ecclesiastical authority that is intertwined with the eucharistie themes of these scenes. The church buildings unite this scene with the one immediately to the right, representing Gregory's tale of a homesick young monk who left the monastery without asking Benedict's blessing; he died as a consequence, but his body would not remain quiet in the tomb until Benedict gave his parents a consecrated wafer with instructions to place it on the boy's breast. When that was done, the body finally found peace in its tomb. Important details are added to this scene that are not found in Gregory's text: the Eucharist is protected in a pyx that is received from Benedict by a tonsured cleric with veiled hands, following eleventh-century rituals for reverencing and protecting the Eucharist outside the mass.37 The rearrangement of Gregory's material allows a dramatic eucharistie scene to bring this section to a climax (fol. 57v, Fig. 11). This is Gregory's tale of the two unrepentant nuns (Dialogues 2.23). Two noblewomen had been living a religious life, but they retained a sinful pride in their high birth. They so abused the simple layman who served their needs that he complained to Benedict. Ordered by the holy man to desist under pain of excommunication, the sisters nonetheless died unrepen tant and were buried in the church. During mass, however, their devoted nurse noticed that when the call went out for non-communicants to leave the church, the sisters' souls left their tomb. She reported this occurrence to Benedict, who gave her an offering (oblationem) and ordered her to have it "offered up" (immolata) to free their souls from excommunication. Once it had been done (dum oblatio pro eis fuisset immolata), the sisters' spirits were never again seen to leave the church before communion. Gregory concluded that "they had been admitted to communion with our blessed Lord in answer to the prayers of His servant Benedict" (.Dialogues 2.23). Gregory's text is here replete with terms from the sacrificial core of the mass, emphasizing the "perfection" that the sacrifice of Christ in the mass gives to Benedict's power, which is limited in this circumstance, since in terms of Gregory's theology, "only the holy sacrifice of Christ benefits souls after death."38 Desiderius's illustrators shift the emphasis even further away from Benedict, whose Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 51</page><page sequence="22">. iwr In gjuf ^tfnuotw ^ pfg^luxcnr ^TB fci ■ a jtoAk. a a £L a M ^ ^ orjjwcitirr^ rrn ttffcgmmtjTtf h fctpttlff futf ten ftfugfg wetxxft f&gt;um*&amp;tttfl^ '&lt; fwprwi) ten |?ni|^^puero^ fhfcttf yeetft' ^ Figure 11.

This arrangement suggests that, by the eleventh century, the power of the Eucharist and of its ministers was replacing the charismatic authority of saints as the fundamental mediating force between God and humankind.39 The scene to the right of Benedict's figure conflates two events: on the extreme right, the spirits of the two sisters are seen to leave the church as the deacon gives the command to noncommunicants to depart. Immediately to the left the same deacon assists a priest in communicating a female figure, presumably the "devoted nurse" of the two dead nuns. This latter scene is not described in Gregory's text, and since the illustrators otherwise limit themselves to illustrating Gregory's text (however altered in emphasis), the addition of this scene highlights the eucharistie motif. The titulus beneath the illustration on the top of fol. 57v reads: "Per sacra dat sacris" ["Through holy things he restored the holy women"]. The term sacra was often reserved for the mass and sacramental objects.40 The scene also emphasizes the central importance in eleventh-century Cassinese culture of intercession for the dead, especially in the context of the mass. Although Monte Cassino under Desiderius had not developed intercessory liturgies for the dead to the extent that Cluny had done, its rituals for the departed would reach a high point of development under Desiderius's successor, Abbot Oderisius I (1087—1105).4' Although the saintly power of Benedict is displaced by clerical and euchar istie images in the scenes described above, he regains a central position in the next section, which describes his victories over powerful human and superhuman entities. The first and most dramatic of his successes involves Satan himself, disguised as a mulus medicus (usually translated as "veterinarian") (Dialogues 2.30). Benedict encounters him on the road to a chapel "at the summit of the moun tain" and asks where he is bound.42 Satan responds that he is going to visit the monks in order to give them a "potion." Each then goes on his way, the devil proceeding to Monte Cassino, where he entered into a elderly senior monk who was drawing water. On his return to the abbey, Benedict immediately understood what had occurred and, striking the monk on the back, expelled the demon. The paired scenes illustrating this tale on fol. 63v (Fig. 12) are constructed in a dramatically sensual manner. On the left, Satan is shown moving away from Benedict, heading toward the monks' chapel. Unlike most architecture depicted in the cycle, the structure bears no sacred emblems. Cryptic designs decorate the exterior walls, which one commentator has identified as "pseudo-Kufic" designs, such as were sometimes found on Byzantine churches.43 Is this chapel towards which he moves perhaps intended to depict the abode of Satan?

Although an attempt has been made to rub out its features, it remains a handsome, clean-shaven visage: the hair is a lush green, the color often used to depict Satan as the "hunter of souls."44 He wears a reddish purple, classically draped tunic, which one commentary notes, "he clutches . . . about him in such a way as to expose his left leg nearly to the groin in frank obscenity."45 A unique brownish-yellow hue is employed for the exposed flesh of Satan's leg. Here, as elsewhere in the cycle, nudity represents sexual temptation and the presence of evil.46 By these symbolic means the eleventh-century illustrators transformed Gregory's tale into a visual essay on sexual temptation in the monastery, a subject of importance to a community vowed to chastity. It was also important to Desi derius, whose major work, Dialogi de miraculis sancti Benedicti (which was patterned after Gregory's Dialogues), emphasized chastity as the most important of the virtues.47 The sexual core of this tale was probably drawn from an incident in the Egyptian Vita of St. Macarius, on which Gregory's tale was based.48 Satan carries a horn, traditionally a phallic symbol, which here too probably carries a sexual reference, despite its usual translation as a "medicine horn."49 The horn may function as well to identify the disguised Satan, who from this period forward is most often depicted with horns.50 The language of Gregory's text itself suggests these sexual images; Satan's appearance as a "mule doctor" hints at the extraordi nary sexual potency equine figures traditionally symbolized.51 The term mulus medicus has no precise meaning in the Middle Ages, despite the usual translation of "veterinarian." Satan might be seen here as a medicus who will cure the ecclesiastical sterility of the monks, to whom he brings a potio, a term often used to describe a love philter (or a poison) as well as a medicament.52 Satan carries a tripedium, or shackle, depicted here as a long strap-like object, which may signify the halter of sensuality or the chains of desire with which Satan intends to ensnare the celibate monks.53 Immediately to the right, Benedict strikes the possessed monk, thus exorcising the devil, who flees off to the right in the form of a tiny horned humanoid. Glossing Gregory's text, the artist shows the monk drawing water out of a well immediately to his left. Owing to their pagan associations, wells were traditionally considered Satan's territory. In Christian symbolism, moreover, the closed well denoted virginity, thus making this open well, containing the water of death rather than of eternal life, twice over Satan's territory.54 Still, one recent commentator has seen this monk as the celibate antithesis of Satan: "whereas the former's thigh is obscenely exposed, the monk's long plane ta is arranged so that the area between the monk's legs is protected and the position of his hand, covering his groin, Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 55</page><page sequence="26">reinforces the notion of sexual repression."55 A less forced reading would suggest simply that, when the old monk was invaded, he became satanic. In addition, the monk's tunic echoes the color of Satan's limbs and his planeta shares the pigment of Satan's tunic. The monk, although he still wears the habit, has been stripped of his monastic substantia, the inner purity that is the defining virtue of monastics.56 Benedict's next victory over evil powers also involved the rescue of a victim helpless in the clutches of evil. Gregory describes Benedict's rescue of a peasant from a cruel Gothic warlord named Zalla, who had been harassing the monks and laity of the region. One unhappy peasant, whose money Zalla had demanded, claimed that Benedict was holding his assets. Hearing this, Zalla bound him and forced him to lead the way to the abbot. When they arrived at Monte Cassino, Zalla ordered Benedict to hand over the peasant's money, but the saint merely looked up from his reading, and as his eyes fell on the cords that bound the peasant, they fell away.57 Amazed and terrified, Zalla fell at Benedict's feet, begging for his prayers. Benedict cordially offered him food and drink and bade him leave off his evil ways, which, thoroughly humbled, Zalla did (.Dialogues 2.31). In the illustration of this story on fol. 72r (Fig. 13, top register) Zalla, on the extreme left, goads the peasant forward on the road. Seated on his prancing horse, the warlord is depicted in the green and orange colors reserved for the nobility. An orange shield surrounds him like a diabolic halo. On the right, Zalla kneels before Benedict, the symbols of his worldly power—horse, spear and shield, spurs and riding boots—put aside. The noble orange color of his shield has been transferred to the abbatial throne on which Benedict sits, suggesting the transfer of power from evil and worldly forces to the holy man. Here, as in earlier scenes, two different moments are blended together. Benedict admonishes the repentant Zalla while he glances back across the page—and across time—to free the peasant from his bonds, as Zalla goads him on toward the abbey. This suspension of ordinary time within a narrative movement suggests the eternity in which divine action occurs. The illustration immediately beneath on fol. 72r (Fig. 13, bottom register) depicts Gregory's account of how Benedict raised the dead to life, a phenomenon traditionally reserved in hagiographical topoi for the greatest of saints.58 It is thus fittingly included as Benedict's final miracle. A peasant's son had died, and his grieving father approached Benedict, who was working in the fields with his brethren. He begged the abbot to restore his son to life, but Benedict refused, objecting that "only the apostles can restore the dead to life."59 At the man's continued insistence, however, Benedict prayed over the corpse and "the child's whole body once again began to throb with life" (Dialogues 2.32). In the scene to the left Benedict, surrounded by his monks, refuses the peasant's request, his hand 56 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="27">[isftttcumuif St bSfcwr. mcc tyjr.vmx crlrfc? fcjfctwwcfttfc&amp;l fpn yfcvqnuf ^ xj^C^ccn $CCuffW.

On the right Benedict prays over the child at the instant his eyes are opened; he seems literally to be pulled back from the earth toward the abbot and toward life. The figure of the peasant links the two different moments of the drama: his right hand is raised in petition to Benedict for his son's cure, whereas the direction of his gaze and his left arm indicate the resurrection scene to come. That each scene on fol. 72r focuses on the figure of a peasant invites the viewer to ponder the message implicit in both. In the upper scene Zalla, in his pomp and violence, represents the power of the world. In the scene below the paradoxical power-in-weakness of God is demonstrated by the simple work clothes of the monks and Benedict's insistence on his inability to act. The figures representing each realm wield appropriate symbols. Zalla grasps a spear, whereas Benedict holds a pruning knife,60 which recalls the prophecy of Isaiah 2:4: "and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning hooks." Finally, on the right of each scene, God's power working through Benedict defeats the power of the world and of death: in the first scene Benedict frees a peasant from Zalla's tyranny; in the second he raises from the dead another peasant's son. These illustrations thus bring to mind the central Christian theme of the "kingdom of God," in which the first shall be last and the last first, and where the proud are humbled and the humble exalted. The proud and worldly figure of Zalla kneels before Benedict, whereas the son of a poor peasant is raised up. Indeed an identification of Benedict with the poor may be suggested here: the violet of the peasant's tunic in the top register is similar in hue to the work scapular Benedict is wearing immediately below.61 These panels modify the impression of other scenes that tend to associate Benedict with the rich and high-born. Some evidence suggests, in fact, that in the eleventh and twelfth centuries Monte Cassino exhibited a special concern for the renewal of parish life and for the spiritual welfare of the laity of the surrounding areas, including the common people. The illustration of peasants being rescued by Benedict, a notable feature of this cycle, is perhaps linked to this mission.62 Christomimesis Benedict's resurrection miracle introduces the final part of Gregory's "Vita," the death and ascent to heaven of three holy persons: Benedict's sister, Scholastica; Germanus, the saintly bishop of Capua; and finally, Benedict himself. The portrayals of all three incidents are unified by the mystical vision of Benedict during the ascent of the soul of Bishop Germanus. This central scene, standing alone on fol. 79v (Fig. 14), occupies almost half of the folio. Gregory explains that 58 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="29">eft fgcfrw pftxg &lt;ttwtevQtnmn» tofSputcfr^ ^enf. cntnp^Temr| fw&lt;r'pwtffW ■ fcnoyttrmf^ ^ucfwcac c&lt;m Icrufc&amp;uf ^ftvf «j«^Wcjtu*tttn f&amp;fcifcur- tttfetf tmor ftwy chawm fbhO* Ui&amp; fv^xcr . _ mrc*J&lt;vxncr t fc»futrt&lt;ju«f,cor Qucf S^cctn pfwrjm pefw *tt$c ffyat •&lt;rri'W.tur^cofpu ouftv fSpyfccfSC i X.6c% Vt] Figure 14.

Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 59</page><page sequence="30">Benedict was watching and praying one night when suddenly the whole world was gathered up before his eyes in a single ray of light. The "entire world" is here depicted as an urban landscape, appropriate to an eleventh-century vision in Italy. The landscape has both ecclesiastical and secular elements, in which the former predominate: the central church tower is somewhat higher than the adjacent city walls, as are the ecclesiastical structures that occupy the high ground on the extreme left. As Benedict watched, the soul of Germanus was carried by angels up to heaven in a fiery sphere. Benedict called a visiting deacon to join him, but Gregory says that the deacon caught only a "final glimpse" of the miraculous light (Dialogues 2.35). It has been suggested that Benedict, the perfect contemplative, witnessed the whole mystical vision, whereas his companion, less practiced in contemplation, saw only partially.63 This difference in perception is suggested by the illustration on fol. 79v, which shows the deacon gazing toward the earth while Benedict looks directly at the "fiery sphere" containing the soul of Bishop Germanus. The "fiery sphere" is the dominant image in this scene. Rather than a ball of fire, however, the illustration shows a bust enclosed within a medallion, examples of which can be found on Late Antique tombs as imagines clipeatae.M These classical funerary reliefs frequently depicted anthropomorphic figures of Earth and Ocean lying beneath the ascending figure (Fig. 15). These symbols of nature here have been replaced with an urban landscape by Desiderius's illustrators. Medal lions enclosing figures of Christ, the Virgin, or the saints were also common in Late Antique and Byzantine painting.65 Other models, closer in time to Vat. lat. 1202, such as scenes of the deaths of Sts. Amand and Aiden, show holy men carried to heaven by angelic figures, although they are not contained within medallions.66 They resemble the widespread Byzantine depictions of Christ ascending to heaven surrounded by angels.67 In fact the "fiery sphere" or medallion of St. Germanus consists of two disks, one above the other, with yet a third, larger disk behind them. Figure 15. Classical imago clipeala. Sarcophagus; Paris, Louvre. (Photo: Geuthner.) 60 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="31">The image of Germanus is encased in the lower of these, whose border forms the shape of a crescent moon, whereas the upper disk encloses yet another, smaller disk from which extend eight rays, each ending in a star-like cluster. These symbols are also classical in origin. Numerous examples of pagan figures, both human and divine, contained within such double orbs survive from the Hellenistic and late Roman period. In one example, a disk of radiating stars appears above a medallion containing the head of the deified Alexander (Fig. 16), functioning like a crown, much as a disk surmounts the bust of Germanus.68 A similar disk containing a crescent moon with stars appears in the previous scene on fol. 72v, depicting Benedict's vision of the ascent of the soul of Scholastica, which enters a heavenly sphere of moon and stars. The fifth-century "Dream of Macrobius," with which Benedict's vision has many literary parallels, discusses the ascent of the blessed soul from the lower heaven of the moon to the higher sphere of the planets and the stars.69 Thus while liberties were taken at several points in illustrating the text to accommodate eleventh-century interests, Desiderius's workshop seems at the same time to have followed very ancient traditions of illustration. Oddly, the bust within the medallion of Bishop Germanus appears to have the features of Benedict's sister, Scholastica, represented on fol. 72v, a circumstance that has perplexed commentators.70 This device may have been intended as a means of symbolically uniting this scene with the ascent of Scholastica. A long tradition of Benedictine commentary has understood Scholastica as a figure of contemplatio, so the medallion may thus have been intended to emphasize the mystical character of Benedict's vision.71 Furthermore, the soul {anima) had traditionally been understood to be female in its essence, so the feminine figure in the medallion may be an attempt to represent the soul of Bishop Germanus. The cycle culminates in scenes depicting the death and ascent of Benedict. Occupying the whole of fol. 80r (Fig. 17), they balance the opening scenes on fol. 17r, creating a frame for the entire work. The top register, left, portrays Benedict writing down the Rule. He has lived that Rule to perfection and has thereby become the perfect follower of Christ, since Benedictine tradition regarded the Rule as a paraphrase of the Gospel. Fittingly, then, Benedict's earthly end reproduces the passion and death of Christ. The top register, right, depicts the expiring Benedict standing before the altar, his arms held aloft by two assisting monks. The posture of Benedict recalls not only the crucified Christ, but also the patriarchal figure of an earlier lawgiver, Moses, praying at the battle against Amalec (Ex. 17:9-16).72 Visually, this scene recalls the very first scene on fol. 17r (Fig. 2), where Gregory composes his "Life of Benedict" on the left while, on the right, the young Benedict as a Moses-figure receives the law.

Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 63</page><page sequence="34">The following image, in the middle register, left, depicts Benedict's funeral rites. These, like the dedication of the abbey churches, are not mentioned in Gregory's text, but both were central to Desiderius's renewal of the Cassinese cult of Benedict. In an attempt to refute the claims of the French abbey at Fleury that it possessed Benedict's relics, Desiderius claimed to have discovered Benedict's bones during his reconstruction of the abbey church. The rectangular object carried by a monk on the extreme left of the middle register has been identified as a grave tile.73 This object, commonly found in sixth-century burials, gives some substance to Desiderius's claim. Anyone viewing this scene would be reminded of his proximity to the newly discovered tomb of the patriarch. The resemblance of this funeral scene to the death of Christ is further heightened by comparison with the contemporary fresco of the burial of Christ at Sant'Angelo in Formis, a church not far from Monte Cassino, which had been donated to the abbey and had been newly decorated by Desiderius's workshop (Fig. 18).74 The illustration on the middle register, right, of fol. 80r depicts the ascent of Benedict's soul to God. Gregory's text states that on the day Benedict died, two monks, one at the monastery and the other "some distance away," had an identical vision: both saw a magnificent road (via) that stretched from Monte Cassino to heaven. In the midst of this scene stood a "man of resplendent appearance" (venerando habitu vir) who told the monks that the road was "the way taken by Blessed Benedict, the lord's beloved, when he went to heaven." The language of Gregory's text clearly suggests that this via is the "way" of Benedictine monastic observance.75 Desiderius's illustrators, however, constructed these scenes so that Benedict's ascent parallels the resurrection of Christ, a theme that is not suggested in Gregory's text. The figure described in Gregory's text as "a man of resplendent appearance" has in this illustration become an angel, reminiscent of the "angel of the Lord" at the empty tomb of Christ (Matt. 28:2). The two monks whom Gregory situated in different locations are here depicted together sleeping beside the via, recalling the Roman soldiers asleep at the tomb of Jesus. The plain colors of the monks's habits contrast strongly with the gold and vermilion of the angel, who is separated from them by the via. Vermilion, the color associated in this cycle with divinity and supernatural power, here suggests passage from the natural human world to the supernatural realm of the divine.76 This celestial color links Benedict's "resurrection" scene with those shown in the final register, placed at the bottom of 80r. The continuing presence of Benedict's spirit in the world is there symbolized, much as the final chapters of the Gospels illustrate the continued presence of Christ after his ascent, especially through the work of his disciples (Matt. 28:20; Mark 16:20). The cave at Subiaco 64 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="35">Figure 18. Burial of Christ. Fresco; S. Angelo in Formis. (Photo: Di Mauro editore.) appears here at the end of the cycle as it had at the beginning, providing the setting for the posthumous miracle with which Gregory ends his narrative. According to Gregory's text, an insane woman had wandered into the cave searching for a place of refuge as Benedict himself had done many years earlier. She lay down to sleep, and the next day arose cured of her affliction. On the left of the scene she appears as insane, breasts and feet bare, her face shown in profile to indicate diabolical possession. Immediately to the right, however, she is awake and assumes the frontal posture of an orant outlined against the now brilliantly crimson background of Benedict's cave. The humble hermit's ultramarine has been transformed into a glorified supernatural, reliquary-like space where the spirit of Benedict continues to mediate between heaven and earth. The Cassinese cult of Benedict strongly maintained that he had promised to be even more present among his followers after death than he had been in life.77 The medieval viewer might also be inspired to conclude that his spirit was especially present at the great church of Monte Cassino, Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 65</page><page sequence="36">now transformed by Benedict's successor, Abbot Desiderius, into one of the great shrines of Christendom. Conclusion This cycle of illustrations ends as it began, with the figure of Pope Gregory. In the last panel on 80r (Fig. 17) Gregory presents the completed "Vita" to his deacon, Peter. Their figures mirror the illustration diagonally above, in the top register, left, of Benedict composing his Rule. Benedict's Rule was the distillation of his life-experience, an experience that Gregory says made composing the "Vita" possible. For Gregory, of course, Benedict's life and his Rule were fundamentally identical. As Gregory says to Peter in concluding his "Vita," "Anyone who wishes to know more about [Benedict's] life and character can discover in his Rule exactly what he was like as abbot, for his life could not have differed from his teaching" (.Dialogues 2.36). The eleventh-century illustrations of Gregory's text display in a variety of ways this identity of Rule and life in his biography of Benedict. They also trace the development of the holy man as he evolved from a novice facing temptation to a perfect abbot wielding great powers and, finally, to an icon of Christ. Perhaps most usefully for the historian, the illustrations show how often Benedict's sixth-century life, interpreted by a seventh-century biographer, was visually reshaped by his eleventh-century disciples to speak to a more complex world. In the intervening centuries monastic liturgy had become more elaborate: prayers for the dead and eucharistie devotion had come to dominate much of the communal prayer life of the monastery. All of these developments were given concrete form in Abbot Desiderius's grand reconstruction of Monte Cassino and in his illuminations of the "Life of Benedict." Turning its pages one is certainly reminded of the fidelity of Cassinese life in the age of Desiderius to the early medieval visions of Benedict and Gregory. However, medieval writers and artists often innovated under the guise of maintaining traditional forms. Thus, core elements of the Desiderian illustrations— the central twelve-panel representation of the founding of the abbey, the oblation and Petrine presentation of St. Maurus, the prominence given to laymen of all ranks, the eucharistie tableaux, and the graphic depiction of sexual temptation—all bear witness that in this visual recreation of the life of the early medieval Benedict, there lives a new spirit, that of the eleventh century and of Benedict's great successor at Monte Cassino, Abbot Desiderius. 66 Life of Saint Benedict</page><page sequence="37">NOTES 1.

The iconography and historical context of these illustrations are treated by Penelope Mayo, "An Art Historical Introduction to the Codex Benedictus," in The Codex Benedictus: An Eleventh-century Lectionary from Monte Cassino, ed. Paul Meyvaert, 2 vols. (New York: Johnson Reprint, 1982), 2:33—57; and at greater length in Brenk, Das Lektionar des Desiderius. Their commentaries emphasize matters of style and sources. 8. Both Gerhart Ladner and Brenk identify the figure with Benedict's teacher. See Gerhart Ladner, "The So-called Square Nimbus," Medieval Studies 3 ( 1941 ): 42; and Brenk, Das Lektionar, 44. Mayo ("Introduction to the Codex Benedictus," 2:51), on the other hand, suggests it is a clerical figure. 9. "Hie docet hie discit quod litera, sillaba quid sit." 10.

See also 277, fig. 265 (Gregory Nazienzus holding a sacred book with veiled hand). Moshe Barasch, Giotto and the Language of Gesture (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), 106, supports this reading. Barasch's chapter on veiled hands suggests that most examples refer to the reception of Christ, either as flesh or as Eucharist. Since Christ is the Word of God incarnate, his reception with veiled hands is in effect identical to the reception by Moses with veiled hands of the Old Law on Sinai. 11. Chron. cas. 3.28, ed. Hoffmann, 397. In the apse of the new basilica the following verses were inscribed: Studies in Iconography 19 —1998 67</page><page sequence="38">"Hec domus est similis Synai sacra jura ferentis, Ut lex demonstrat, hic que fuit édita quondam" ["This house is like to Sion bearing sacred commandments, as the law shows, which was in former times brought forth in this place"]. 12.

Mauri," which follows the "Life of Benedict" in this manuscript, the oblation of that saint is given a similarly prominent illustration (fol. 114v). The other contemporary illustrated "Vita s. Mauri," from St. Maur des Fossées, portrays Benedict receiving Maurus in full pontifical vestments, surrounded by a crowd of monks and lay persons unmentioned in the text of the "Vita." See Odo of Glanfeuil, "Vita s. Mauri," Troyes, Bib. Mun., MS 2273, fol. 45v. 15. "Et constituta hora, expleta psalmodia, sese fratres in orationem dedissent" ["When the psalmody had been completed, the brothers gave themselves over to prayer"]. 16. In the illustration of the exorcism, with his left hand Benedict makes the sign traditionally associated with the "evil eye" to ward off diabolical powers. For a discussion of the sign of the evil eye see Leonard W. Moss and Stephen C. Cappannari, "The Mediterranean: The Evil Eye Hovers Above," in The Evil Eye, ed. Clarence Maloney (New York: Columbia University Press, 1976), 9-10, fig. 1.3 (mano cornuta). In South Italy and Sicily the color blue, used for Benedict's habit in this manuscript, was the color of magic protection against the evil eye (8). Benedict employs this gesture several times in the cycle when the devil is in the vicinity. The gesture has also been interpreted as invoking or indicating the presence of Christ, the positive means of warding off evil. 17. H. E. J. Cowdrey, Age, xiii, quoting Liber pontifîcalis 2.311. 18. Ibid., 16. 19. According to Leo of Ostia, only under Abbot Desiderius did Monte Cassino attain the glory that God had promised Benedict it would enjoy; see Chron. cas. 3. prol., ed. Hoffmann, 362. Note the equal proportions allotted to the figures of Benedict and Desiderius as they face each other on fol. 26r (Fig. 1). 20.

The peasant's gesture of abandonment recalls Mary's posture during the Annunciation, crossing her arms over her breast with the words, "fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum" (Luke 1:38). Barasch (Giotto and the Language of Gesture) discusses a similar gesture of humility and powerlessness made by Christ after his scourging during the Passion (81) and a similar gesture used in the liturgy during a confession of sinfulness (79). For the use of the gesture by John the Baptist see Brian D. Steele, "The Humblest Prophet: The Infant Baptist in Venice ca. 1500," Studies in Iconography 16(1994): 165—90. 23.

The cult of Peter had long been associated with Benedict and Montecassino. This cult was revived and strengthened by Desiderius; however, this project should be seen as part of his attempt to strengthen the cult of Benedict and the influence of the abbey rather than as a reflection of radical papal reform policies; see Gunhouse, "Fresco Decorations," 332ff. It was not until after the death of Gregory VII that the feast of Peter was celebrated at Monte Cassino with the same solemnity as that of "his brother," Benedict; see Cowdrey, Age, 79. When the Normans pressed for Desiderius's election as pope, he was bitterly opposed by the Gregorian reformers as being "dangerously soft" towards the emperor; see Colin Morris, The Papal Monarchy: The Western Church from 1050 to 1250 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1989), 121. 27. Cowdrey, Age, xxx. 28. On the privileges of the emperor when visiting Monte Cassino see Cowdrey, Age, xxx. In 1065 Desiderius made a special journey to Amalfi to buy a fitting gift for Emperor Henry IV, whose visit was imminent, "for the protection and honor of the monastery." The abbot purchased twenty pieces of silk cloth of royal purple, which were made into vestments when the emperor failed to appear; see Chron. cas. 3.3.18. The intricate and influential design patterns for the historiated initials in Vat. lat. 1202 were adapted from the Gospel Book that Emperor Henry II presented to the abbey earlier in the century; see Gunhouse, "Fresco Decorations," 343. 29. Concerning the relationship between the Norman rulers of Italy and the abbey Cowdrey writes, "It seems clear that Desiderius saw the Normans as his principal benefactors and allies, upon whose goodwill and unity his plans depended. His bond with the papacy was secondary, and he was unlikely to follow it in its policy of dividing the Norman rulers" (Age, 121).

That this incident was connected with the life of Benedict is also illustrated by the fact that a variation of this phrase became part of the "blessing of St. Benedict," a popular verse in the later Middle Ages often inscribed on the obverse of medallions of Benedict: Vade retro satana, Nunquam suade mihi vana.

"[l]n refectorio qui est juxta . . . dormitorium profetavit de Roma" ["He prophesied regarding Rome in the refectory which is next to the dormitory"]. This information is contained in Codex Cassinensis 175, a valuable source listing the places within Monte Cassino where Benedict tradi tionally performed the miracles mentioned in Gregory's Dialogues. In most cases these do not seem to correspond to the locations illustrated in Vat. lat 1202. The document has been printed in G.

Desiderius of Monte Cassino, Dialogi de miraculis sancti Benedicti. According to Cowdrey Desiderius's concern for chastity in his writings was imitated by other Cassinese writers of his day to the extent that it "was a major theme of their propaganda" (Age, 88). 48.

There are three versions of the Macarius story in PL 73:981 (the version Gregory knows), 769, and 1027. Also see the editor's comment in PG 34: 124—7. A convenient English version is found in The Sayings of the Desert Fathers, ed. Benedicta Ward (Kalamazoo: Cistercian Publications, 1975), 106-8. One day Abbot Macarius met the devil who was disguised as a man going to "stir up the memories of the brethren." He carried two flasks filled with food for the brethren to taste. Satan was able to corrupt only one old monk, whom the spirit of fornication still troubled. Macarius cured the troubled monk by urging him to fast, to meditate on the Gospels, and to "look up" when tempted. Compare the posture of the afflicted monk in Fig. 12. 49.

However, the ordinary medieval medical container was represented as a flask or chalice.

On the horn as symbol of sexual prowess see James Hall, Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art (London: J. Murray, 1974), 157. For the association of horns with depictions of Satan see Russell, Lucifer, 131. In Sulpicius Severus's Life of St. Martin, the source for some of Gregory's stories, one tale contains sexual themes similar to those of Gregory's "Life of Benedict." Martin, as Benedict, was famous for being able to discern Satan in all his disguises. One day Satan burst into a room holding a blood-stained ox horn, boasting that he had killed one of Martin's men. A search discovered a peasant mortally wounded, who said that he had been suddenly gored in the groin by one of a pair of oxen with which he had been plowing.

See entries "potio1" and "potio2" in Oxford Latin Dictionary (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982), 1418. 53. The curious term tripedium invites speculation. It is usually translated as "shackle"; cf. Dialogues, trans. Zimmermann, 97; and Vie de Saint Benoit, trans. Adalbert de Vogiié, 221. There is also testimony for its meaning as "an article three feet long"; see "tripedale" in Alexander Souter, A Glossary of Later Latin to 600 A. D. (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1949). But its ordinary meaning both in Antiquity and throughout the Middle Ages is "three-footed object." It is intriguing in this context that the term appears in Antiquity primarily in Livy. There it is connected with prodigies such as deformed births, in particular of "three legged mules," and in one case the term is used in connection with the overthrow of an altar of Apollo.

Gregory believed that, just as there was one body of the saved with Christ as its head, so there was a single "body of the wicked" with Satan as its head, consisting of all condemned sinners; see Carole Straw, Gregory the Great, 61. 57.

Cowdrey (Age) argues that the Sant'Angelo frescos depend upon a series in Desiderius's rebuilt church at Monte Cassino that has not survived (7f); Cowdrey also states that Desiderius obtained the church from Prince Richard of Capua in 1072 and then rebuilt it in order to house a community of some forty monks (17). For the decoration of this church by Abbot Desiderius see Bloch, Monte Cassino in the Middle Ages, l:40ff. For a thorough study of Sant'Angelo see Gunhouse, "Fresco Decorations," esp. 160, 245. 75. Commenting on this famous scene, Peter Damian, a friend of Desiderius, wrote that the ladder that rose to heaven from Monte Cassino when Benedict died was still thronged with his sons, who ascend it behind their leader like an army; see Cowdrey, Age, 35. Damian's image of a "ladder" recalls the central chapter of Benedict's Rule (7.5), which analyzes the virtue of humility, depicted as a twelve runged ladder reaching to heaven. Ladder imagery was so central in the Rule that Benedict was often pictured in the Middle Ages with a ladder; see George Ferguson, Signs &amp; Symbols in Christian Art (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1961), 176. A mystical ladder is also the organizing metaphor of John Climacus's Ladder of Divine Ascent. Monks climbing Climacus's ladder was a popular theme of eleventh-century painters, to whom the style of this manuscript is much indebted; see Weitzmann, Studies in Classical and Byzantine Manuscript Illumination, 108. 76. Vermilion is reserved in this manuscript for sacred objects such as saints' halos and the Rule and for royal garments and the mantle of Christ. 77. Odo of Glanfueil, "Vita s.
