<plain_text><page sequence="1">Plato's Theology. By FRIEDRICH SOLMSEN. ("Cornell Studies in Classical Philology," Vol. XXVII.) Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1942. Pp. ix+201. $2.50. That Plato's thought is deeply imbued with religious feeling and that the influence of his philosophy must be recognized in any account of later religion have been universally ad- mitted. But the nature of his theological views and the relation of them to the rest of his thought and to its historical context have not been thoroughly investigated. There has not been unanimity even as to the portions of Plato's text that should be considered theo- logical, nor as to the emphasis to be placed on the various ingredients. Professor Solmsen's important book addresses itself to the task of selection, orientation, and interpretation, and is very welcome. The theme is definitely Pla- to's theology, not his religious ideas and his philosophy in general, except as they are nec- essarily related to theology. Where, then, are we to find Plato's theol- ogy? Primarily in the tenth book of the Laws, Mr. Solmsen believes. But in order to under- stand this rather neglected book, which pro- fesses to find a theological basis for the au- thority of a state, it is necessary to consider, first, the relations between religion and the polis in earlier Greek history, and then to re- view the steps by which Plato himself ap- proached the views that he came to hold in his last great work. This necessity dictates the logical form of the present book. In the first part, "The Background," chap- ter i-"Religion in the City-State"-sketches the close relation, amounting to identity, be- tween the city and its protecting deity and the modification of the conceptions of the deity as the city developed. Chapter ii, "The Destruc- tion of the Old Religion," notes the inadequacy of the civic religion, as other and more secular ideas prevailed: the struggle of the individual for moral values; the criticism or purification of myths; the physical explanation of natural phenomena; and the rational explanation of human behavior, culminating, in the age of the Sophists, in the dissolution of the bond be- tween gods and city institutions. Chapter iii, "The Defense and Reconstruction of Reli- gion," reviews the positive attempts of poets and philosophers to define deity in more ac- ceptable terms: now as protestants against anthropomorphism; now as allegorizers; now as troubled apologists for the divine justice and providence; anid sometimes as teleolo- gists, seeing in Mind (perhaps identified with Air, or Ether) a divine, purposeful principle in the cosmos. But since the "science" of the age just before Plato's obviously could not rein- state a political deity, or even a just, provi- dential god, and since human calculations often miscarry, this age witnessed also an atti- tude of resignation before irrational Tyche. The second part of the book, "A Variety of Approaches," deals with Plato's successive at- tempts to relate theology to his philosophy. In chapter iv, "Plato's First Approach: Ex- purgation," Mr. Solmsen considers Euthyphro and Republic ii and iii as Plato's exhibition of the inadequacy of the old religion from an ethical and educational point of view. Myth may be useful, but only if morally "true"; thus the two "forms of theology" emerge: the gods, Plato assumes without much argument, must be represented as good and as unchang- ing. He hardly troubles to refute systematical- ly the three types of atheism enumerated in Rep. 364 (which he will refute with thorough- ness and vehemence in Laws x), for the sub- ject is merely incidental to education; indeed, the foundation of the state is now "not reli- gious; it is secular, rational, philosophical"; and "religion and the gods occupy a plane be- low the highest," the Idea of the Good (p. 72). Chapter v, "The Second Approach: Philoso- phy of Movement," considers Plato's advance</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 129 from the concept of eternal, unchanging Ideas, hardly to be envisaged (if wholly transcend- ent) as productive of particular objects, to his recognition in the "dialectical" works, espe- cially in Sophist 246 e-248 e, of life, change, movement, as "Being in its fulness," a Being which includes Mind, Thought, Soul, in the cosmos no less than in human psychology. And "Plato's philosophy of Change is histori- cally the point of origin of scientific Physics" (p. 83). The sketch of Plato's theory of Soul, as the explanation of movement in its various kinds, naturally draws on Theaetetus, Phae- drus, Timaeus, and Laws x; his astronomy, though probably supported by empirical ma- terial gathered by Eudoxus that indicated the regularity of heavenly movements, was essen- tially theoretical and was evidence of the op- eration of Mind. But to explain how the Pla- tonic God, the "first movement," the source of all other movements, begets life, Mind alone will not suffice; hence Plato's new con- ception of Soul, an idea already important in the mystery-religions and in his own thought (e.g., Phaedo) and now conceived as the origin of all process in the Cosmos. "Plato's God is not an Idea nor are his Ideas gods ..... He is the principle through which the physical world of Becoming partakes of the qualities of Being" (p. 92). In the Phaedrus myth, "Soul in her totality has the care of inanimate beings everywhere" (246 b); but the relation of this "World-Soul," as Plato will presently call it, to the Ideas which are "above" the Cosmos and yet "feed" individual souls, Plato dis- cusses not in Phaedrus but rather in Timaeus and Laws x. Chapter vi, "The Teleological Approach," touches on the mathematical system of Ti- maeus, as another method of bridging the gulf between Physics and eternal Being, and ex- plores Plato's search for a teleological inter- pretation of the Cosmos, begun in his criti- cism of Anaxagoras in Phaedo and given fuller expression in Timaeus. Here, though the radi- cal opposition between Being and Becoming persists (in spite of the reasoning of the earlier Sophist), the divine Demiurge seeks to make the Cosmos "as excellent as anything in the order of Becoming may be" (p. 102), especial- ly in order, rationality, fitness for function; the details of the myth are less important to its author than the goodness of the Demiurge. Obstacles ("Necessity") are recognized; they are "persuaded," as far as possible, by Mind (not, be it noted, by Soul). But for life and or- der, Soul is employed by Mind; and the World- Soul, created by the Demiurge who is not him- self a soul, emerges as the active, intelligent source of the life of the Cosmos. The heavenly bodies, as the rational creations of the Demi- urge, and the Cosmos, oriented toward the Good, are divine; but the implications of these conclusions and the status of the traditional gods are yet to be clarified by Plato. Chapter vii, "The Influence of the Mystery-Religions," is brief; since the present subject is not pri- marily Plato's philosophy of Soul but his philosophy of God, it is not his (and the Or- phics') doctrines of immortality and his es- chatological myths that receive attention but the concepts of deity presupposed in them. These are the divine care for human souls; di- vine justice based on real merit; the divine quality of soul and therefore the unique status of individual souls; and an attitude of personal piety toward man's divine "masters." Now that four lines of "approach" have been severally formulated, Mr. Solmsen un- dertakes in the third part of his book, "The Comprehensive Picture," to show that they all, and no others, reappear in Laws x, but re- appear in a new context. In chapter viii, "Nat- ural Evolution and the Philosophy of Soul," he finds that in the Laws religion and law are in mutual support; the demonstration of God's existence, placed late in the work, is neverthe- less "the best and noblest prelude for all our laws" (887 c). In the Republic, religion is in- cidental; in the Laws it is basic, and atheism is regarded as a political offense. Yet the religion to be defended against the three types of athe- ism already enumerated is not the traditional religion but Plato's own theology; the athe- ists are primarily the materialistic philoso- phers who deny all gods; the other two types are those who admit gods but deny their inter- est in men or who believe they can be bribed. The materialists conceive of a "nature" rising from lifeless elements, controlled largely by</page><page sequence="3">130 BOOK REVIEWS Chance, and somewhat by -reX? and the arti- fices and conventions of men, among which are reckoned the gods. To this "evolutionary" theory, Plato opposes his own system of Move- ment, with living Soul (prior to Matter) as the only possible source of original motion. "Soul then directs all things in heaven and earth and sea by her movements" (896 e), though in varying degrees; more in the heavens than here below, where "secondary" movements of Body impede-how, is not clear, even if Timaeus be added to Laws, or if it be admitted, as Mr. Solmsen seems willing to admit (pp. 141 f.), that Laws x entertains a bad type of Soul ("the bad World-Soul"), as well as the "good Soul." Moreover, as in earlier works various spiritual entities were given dignity and priority over Matter by their alliance with the Ideas, so in Laws x they achieve a similar place by association with Soul. To the idealis- tic State of the Republic, Plato thus adds the idealistic organization of the Cosmos; but moral values and artistic and political activi- ties and Law itself still find priority over ma- terial things. Next, Plato undertakes to prove that the gods concern themselves with human affairs (chap. ix, "God and the Individual: Teleology and Providence"). This follows not so much from the World-Soul or from star-gods (that is, from astrological assumptions) as from three familiar Platonic tenets. (1) The good- ness of God, always maintained even before the doctrine of the World-Soul, excludes negli- gence and self-indulgence; no secondary, thwarting principle is here considered. (The goodness of the gods is used presently also to refute those who think they can be bribed.) (2) Living beings are the "property" of the gods, as in Phaedo. (3) In spite of the apparent lack of justice in the world and in tragedy and in spite of man's petty nature, Plato urges tha! the gods seek the perfection of an organic "Whole," in which all the parts must function; the experience of the parts must therefore be judged not within a limited range but in the light of the Whole; not in narrow terms of in- dividual human lives, or even (as by certain poets) of successive generations, but of the rise or fall of souls according to merit, with a balance effected in an afterlife. This means a Providence interested both in the Whole and in every individual human soul. The emphasis on the Whole, rather than on parts, has been set forth in Rep. 420 b-421 d, 519 e ff., but in political terms; here in cosmic terms, as later by the Stoics. The afterlife was described in Gorgias and Republic, but as something het- erogeneous to the secular arguments, here as "the logical sequel to the exposition of Plato's philosophical physics and cosmology" (p. 158). But the god who thus "assigns to all souls their proper status is not himself a soul"; rather, as in Tirnaeus, which this part of Laws x seems to echo in thought, mythical form, and tone, he appears as Deiniurge, or Administra- tor, or King, or as the divine Mind (p. 154). Now that Plato has set forth "the concept of the divine World-Soul as the fountain of movements and as the intelligent power con- trolling the world of Becoming" (p. 162), his attempt to establish a new alliance between State and Religion-not the old religion but the new cosmic, teleological theology-be- comes at least possible (chap. x, "The State and the Cosmos: The Philosophy of Natural Law"). If it is not to seem an arbitrary alli- ance, it must be because of his view of Law as a spiritual entity close to the power of the Cosmos. "True laws .... are those which es- tablish in human life a priority comparable to that which Plato has discovered in the Uni- verse" (p. 167), that is, the superiority of spiritual over material and bodily goods. His legal philosophy is therefore a theory of "natu- ral law" and, in its appeal to the cosmic order, represents a new departure, though prepared for by the treatment of human behavior in Timaeus as a phase of cosmic behavior. Though the first nine books of the Laws deal with Man and the State chiefly on the secular level, the tenth finds man a citizen of the Cosmos, a spiritual world. If the atmosphere is often archaic, the thought is novel; in dealing with typical earlier forms of materialism and rela- tivity, Plato foreshadowed Hellenistic and later ways of thinking; "while he was anxious to restore the original unity of religion and political life, he became the founder of 'natural theology' " (p. 170).</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 131 In his "Conclusion" (chap xi, "Influence and Transformations"), Mr. Solmsen notes the debt of later theological systems to Plato. Greek theology after Plato abandons any at- tempt to define divinity and religion in the context of a political system; for Hellenistic ruler-cults are, after all, something else. The main trend continues with Plato to find God in nature, but with different results: astrology (Epinomis); natural theology (Aristotle, On Philosophy); the transcendent God of Aris- totle's mature thought (the "fifth element," the First Mover); the Stoics' immanent God and Providence; the "Trinity" of Plotinus (the One, Mind, and Soul, descended, respec- tively, from the Platonic Idea of the Good, Demiurge, and World-Soul); and Origen, Platonist as well as Christian. Nevertheless, influential though Plato has been, his concep- tion of God as mediator between the intelli- gible and the physical worlds has been eclipsed by Aristotelian, Neoplatonist, and Christian conceptions of God as the apex of Being. Ac- cordingly, the part of Plato's philosophy that has had the greatest influence on theological thought has been the theory of Ideas rather than the theology dealt with in this book. In the foregoing summary of Mr. Solmsen's argument I have tried to set forth, with a minimum of comment, what seem to me to be his major points, expressed here and there in his own language; the reader of the book will discover much more in the way of exposition, qualification, and comparison. Mr. Solmsen has been scrupulously honest in refraining from going beyond Plato's text in any attempt to reconstruct a consistent theological system, reconciling passage with passage, supplying lacunae, and then labeling the result as "Pla- to's theology." For his restraint he has the sanction of Plato himself, whose use of the dia- logue form and whose shifts of emphasis ac- companying shifts of theme undoubtedly should warn modern men against rash at- tempts to find unity of thought where only converging lines of approach are to be sought. Even Shorey, the leading exemplar of the school that believes in the essential harmony of the dialogues, wrote soberly in deprecation of "mechanically 'equating' the terminology and imagery-the literary machinery, so to speak, of three distinct lines of thought in three different dialogues, for the sake of at- tributing to Plato a rigid and ingenious meta- physical system wholly foreign to his spirit" (The Unity of Plato's Thought, p. 65). Mr. Solmsen may therefore feel well justified in his frequent expressions of reluctance to identi- fy terms or otherwise to establish a synthesis not clearly indicated by Plato himself (e.g., pp. 113; 121, nn. 42, 43, 45; 131; 138; 146, n. 1; 147, n. 18; 161; 149 f.; 159, n. 1; 173, n. 10; cf. TAPA, LXVII [1936], 217). But I regret that he has twice (pp. 131 and 161) quoted in support of his own reluctance Tim. 28 c in Jowett's incorrect translation: "The father and maker of all this Universe is past finding out, and even if we found him, to tell of him to all men would be impossible." Plato does not say "is past finding out" but "is a hard task (Ep-yop) to discover." And if it is "impossible to tell of him to all men," it may still be worth while, when one can reveal as admirably as Mr. Solmsen has done the several "approaches" of Plato, to attempt in a synoptic view "to coordinate the different aspects of the theologi- cal problem in a comprehensive and unified theory," something which, we are correctly told (p. 161), Plato does not attempt. If Mr. Solmsen "cannot accept Professor Hackforth's conclusions" (p. 147, n. 18; cf. CQ, XXX [1936], 4-9), which I personally have found helpful, if he is resolved, perhaps wisely, not to undertake an exhaustive discussion of the relation between Plato's God and the Idea of the Good, then he might win his readers' final gratitude simply by assembling the points that he has himself made, with a brief suggestion of their relationships. For my own edification I have made such a collection; at the risk of seeming officious I set it down here, with page references to Mr. Solmsen's book, as presenting certain articles in Plato's "creed." 1. God is good (Rep. [68]; Tim. [111]; Laws [149]) and unchanging (Rep. [68]). 2. "Plato's God is not an idea, nor are his Ideas gods" (92). 3. His God is a mediator between Being and Be- coming (89, 92, 102 f., 111, 172, 192); he is, on the whole, immanent (179).</page><page sequence="5">132 BOOK REVIEWS 4. In the context of the theory of movement, God is the principle responsible for movement, change, and life generally (later dialogues [89]). 5. In the account of God's nature, both Mind and Soul are to be included (89). 6. In Timaeus, the rational order of the Cosmos is the product of Mind, which is the basic principle (112 f., 116); its movement and life are the product of the World-Soul, which is one of the implements created and employed by Mind (89 f., 113, 116); the Cosmos, too, is divine (117 f.). 7. In Laws, the World-Soul, with Mind as ally, is basic (112, 116, 138, 162). 8. God is not himself a soul, but he is concerned with Soul alone, and with the moral advance of individual human souls (Laws [153 f.; 156-59]). Like all creeds, the foregoing recital of cer- tain beliefs extracted from the dialogues lacks the logical and imaginative power of their philosophical or liturgical contexts; creeds, after all, are for believers, not for inifidels. Un- like most creeds, however, this collection of tenets lacks also logical coherence through its failure to define the relationships between God, Mind, and Soul, not to mention Ideas. It avoids "confounding the persons," as it were, but at the cost of "dividing the substance" of the deity. In phrasing point 5 above, I found it difficult to represent adequately Mr. Solm- sen's language in the paragraphs beginning (p. 89) with the sentence "What is the nature of this Platonic God and by what name will he call him?" In the sequel he refrains from identifying Plato's God with Mind, and he explicitly-and riglhtly-denies (as against Burnet and Taylor) that Plato's God is a soul. He has well explained by reference to their re- spective contexts the emphasis on Mind in Tirmaeus and on Soul in the Laws, as is sug- gested in points 6 and 7 above. I have already indicated elsewhere (Moira, pp. 291-93; also CW, XXXV [1942], 220) my reasons for agree- ing substantially with Mr. Hackforth's posi- tion. Utilizing Philebus 23 c-30 e (Nous as cause and as creative of Soul; a passage ig- nored by Mr. Solmsen), together with Timaeus 29 a (the Demiurge, the "best of causes," creator of Soul) and Laws 896 d (Soul, though prior to all other created things, achieves good- ness only through association with Nous), I conclude that Plato's God, never described in and of himself, except as good, reveals himself in his works. As I have phrased it: "God, Nous or Reason, is both transcendent and imma- nent, both perfect and outgoing. Soul, how- ever, is not transcendent, since it operates only through genesis or kinesis. Nous and Psyche together comprise Plato's conception of God's manifestation in the cosmos. The Word was made Spirit and dwelt among us." The Ideas, to be sure, are not included in this statement, yet must somehow be related to the theology; for this, Mr. Solmsen's insistence on Plato's God as mediator is important and could be profitably developed, perhaps in the light of J. Souilhe, La Notion platonicienne d'internie'diaire. Two other recent studies, both of which appeared since Mr. Solmsen's book was writ- ten and which should be considered along with it, though for quite different reasons, are those of H. Kuhn, "The True Tragedy: On the Relationship between Greek Tragedy and Plato," HSCP, LII (1941), 1-40; LIII (1942), 37-88, wlich contains a penetrating analysis of the ethical side of Plato's theology; and J. B. Skemp, The Theory of Motion in Plato's Later Dialogues (with L. A. Post's review, AJP, LXV [1944], 298-301), which supple- ments Mr. Solmsen's brief treatment of Pla- to's later mathematical physics. Plato's short way with dissenters (an in- quisition against stubborn atheists, if any can be supposed to withstand the ingenuity and patience of the Nocturnal Council) Mr. Solm- sen clearly considers no part of his theme and dismisses in a few sentences (pp. 132 f., 162). Yet either here or somewhere else it deserves serious treatment. Naturally Grote and all in- fluenced by him have been deeply troubled by such an attitude on Plato's part. Shorey, to be sure, calls it "whimsical" (Unity, p. 86) and refers to "a few petulant and perhaps not en- tirely serious pages" (What Plato Said, p. 391; cf. also p. 398) and would thus reduce Plato's attitude, I suppose, to the kind of comic ges- ture by which actual poetry, shown to be in- ferior to an ideal philosophy, was sentenced to "exile." But for the present case, I feel sure,</page><page sequence="6">BOOK REVIEWS 133 that is too facile a procedure; in the Laws Pla- to is in dead earnest (thus Taylor, Plato: The Man and His Work, p. 494); politics is to rest on religion, which, in turn, is to rest on a par- ticular kind of science. A noble program, if we may allow for a margin of error and mutual tolerance among poor mortals-scientists, theologians, and statesmen alike. But Plato is in no mood to condone free-thinking or non- conformity, and thus at this one point he pre- sents a fair target for the attacks, elsewhere unfair, of Professor Farrington in Science and Politics in the Ancient World, pages 87-136. Probablyfew today, except totalitarians, would care to defend this aspect of Plato's theology. Within the limits chosen, Professor Solmsen has made a notable advance, in logical analy- sis and in lucid and sympathetic presentation, over previous treatments of his subject; his book will remain for a long time a standard in- troduction to it.
