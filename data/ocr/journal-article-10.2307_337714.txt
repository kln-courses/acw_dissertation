<plain_text><page sequence="1">OBSERVATIONS ON THE NARRATIVE METHOD, THE PSYCHOLOGY, AND THE STYLE OF "LOS PAZOS DE ULLOA" ROBERT E. LOTT University of Illinois STRUCTURALLY Los Pazos de Ulloa (1886) is centered around the struggle between the forces of civilization and good and those of nature and evil. The struggle takes place in the Pazos, a degenerate mansion which is being overrun, literally and symbolically, from within and with- out, by rampant nature.' The novel's esthe- tic appeal derives mainly from the master- ful interweaving of this simple but often symbolic action with suspenseful or play- ful moods, from interesting, complex characterizations, particularly those of Nucha and Juliain, and from the creation of a believable fictional world, which un- obtrusively embodies the author's insights into some of the major concerns of her age, and which authentically evokes rural Gali- cia in the people, language, and customs. The proper novelistic representation of these effects presupposes, and in this case gets, a narrative method, a style, and liter- ary techniques deeply congenial to the artist's experiences and world-view. This world-view is one of "mitigated naturalism," as I prefer to call it, rather than the "Catholic naturalism" that Donald Fowler Brown speaks of.2 The author's Catholi- cism is only one of the factors which at- tenuate her admiring emulation of Zola. Another is her innate Spanish sense of pudor, which prevents her full acceptance of naturalistic material and techniques. Despite the glorification of nature, she does not "demonstrate man's fusion with nature in historical process," as Zola and Blasco Ibaiiez do, but reflects instead "a dualistic vision of the world, in which the two forces of good and evil war with each other,"3 thus at least allowing room for spiritual forces and providing freedom from pseudo-scientific determinism. I The action, cast in thirty short chapters of fairly uniform length, can be divided into five parts. A schematic account of the action will serve to elucidate the author's narrative method by revealing significant shifts in mood, pace, center of attention, and point of view. Part I (chs. i-viii). Exposition. The pace is mainly slow, with detailed treatment of short periods of time. Chapters i-iii treat the afternoon and night of Julian's arrival and the following day. Several days go by in chapter iv. The entire winter passes in chapter v. Chapter vi describes the celebra- tion of St. Julian's Day in Naya. Chapter vii presents Juliin's argument with Don Pedro that evening. Chapter viii treats their departure for Santiago the following morn- ing. The mood of hopeless physical and moral decadence is alleviated only by the description of the feast day. Part II (chs. ix-xiii). Don Pedro, re- placing Julian as the center of the author's interest, courts his cousins and finally selects Nucha. The pace is rapid; the rest of that year and the following winter quickly pass. The tone is gay and opti- mistic, in marked contrast with the gloomy atmosphere at the Pazos. Part III (chs. xiv-xvii). Attention is focused on Nucha's pregnancy, her ma- ternal interest in Perucho, and her visits to "distinguished" neighbors (chs. xiv-xv). Six months go by. Don Pedro's restlessness ex- plodes into resentful anger, when, in 3</page><page sequence="2">4 ROBERT E. Lorr October, after a long labor (chs. xvi-xvii) that leaves her unable to have more chil- dren, Nucha gives birth to a daughter rather than the male heir he expected. Part IV (chs. xviii-xxviii). In this, the main action, we see Nucha's unstable convalescence (ch. xviii) and her increas- ing nervousness and fear, culminating in hysteria, hallucinations, and delusions of persecution (chs. xix-xx, xxiii, xxvi-xxvii). A decisive event is the discovery that Perucho is her husband's son (ch. xxiii). The climax begins with Juliain's determina- tion to help Nucha leave the Pazos (ch. xxvii). The tension is broken three times. First, by the change to a costumbrista scene, the festive, "epic" preparations for a hunt and the hunt itself (chapters xxi-xxii). Seem- ingly extraneous, this passage increases our knowledge of this natural, elemental world and of Julian. His utter ineptness, in the midst of primitive manly virtues, makes him the butt of ridicule. The second major interruption concerns the political struggle between the government-sponsored candi- date, backed by the violent Trampeta, and Don Pedro, whom Barbacana supports. Because of Primitivo's betrayal Don Pedro loses the election, thus killing Nucha's faint hope of getting Don Pedro away from the Pazos. Afterwards Barbacana and his men fight the opposition's supporters in the street. While needlessly detailed, this epi- sode is important for the background and the ironic criticism of another supposedly civilizing force, the local government, which has fallen under Primitivo's expand- ing influence. It also sets the stage for Nucha's decision to leave and for Primi- tivo's murder by Barbacana's henchman, El Tuerto. The tension is broken a third time by the author's totally unexpected and rather contrived shift to Perucho's point of view in the climactic chapter xxviii. While the narrative is still third-person, every- thing is presented through his eyes. This is done in an interesting, impressionistic way that reflects accurately the boy's psychology and scale of values.' Yet the shift seems motivated by the author's avoidance of the melodramatic and violent details of Primi- tivo's murder and of the angry confronta- tion of Don Pedro, Juliain, and Nucha. These two events are followed by Peru- cho's brief sequestration of the baby, to protect her from Don Pedro's anger. In this main part of the novel the mood is one of suspenseful dread. As the novel draws to a close, the symbolic meaning is underscored, outside events are brought to bear, and the pace quickens. Part V (chs. xxix-xxx). These chapters, telling of Juliain's enforced departure and subsequent return ten years later, present the pathetic contrast between Primitivo's well-kept tomb and Nucha's shoddy one, as well as the melodramatic appearance of a well-dressed boy (Perucho) and a shabby looking girl (Nucha's daughter), thus constituting an epilogue to this novel and setting the stage for its sequel. There is a wave-movement in the mood of terror and impending disaster. After each spot of relief the wave surges higher and stronger, finally sweeping everything before it. Religion, virtue, culture, and government are mismatched against nature and evil. Primitivo and Sabel become all- powerful but symbolically shadowy figures, as if they were devilish incarnations of evil forces. In one illuminating scene Juliain witnesses the diabolical world of sensualism and evil in the huge kitchen, ruled over by Sabel and her friend, the crone and sus- pected witch, La Sabia (ch. xix). Shortly thereafter, Julian hears a cry and rushes downstairs, thinking that Don Pedro is beating Nucha, although he is only killing a huge spider which caused her to scream. Terror reaches its peak in Julian's and Nucha's search in the dark basement on a stormy day (ch. xx). First Nucha tells JuliAn: Veo cosas muy raras. La ropa que cuelgo me representa siempre hombres ahorcados, o difuntos que salen del ataid con la mortaja puesta ...</page><page sequence="3">NOVELISTIC TECHNIQUES IN "Los PAZOS DE ULLOA" 5 Hay veces que distingo personas sin cabeza; otras, al contrario, les veo la cara con todas sus facciones, la boca muy abierta y haciendo mue- cas . . . Esos mamarrachos que hay pintados en el biombo se mueven; y cuando crujen las ven- tanas con el viento, como esta noche, me pongo a cavilar si son almas del otro mundo que se quejan. . .. 5 On opening the basement door, Nucha says: "Se me figur6 al abrir que estaba ahi dentro un perro muy grande, sentado, y que se levantaba y se me echaba para morderme . . . juraria haberlo visto" (p. 223). She fights this chaotic nether-world, which is guarded over by an imaginary Cerberus, in the lower depths of the horrifying, monstrous mansion. There the confused and deformed objects take on the frightening and macabre aspects of dead figures or parts of the body. She resolutely subdues her fear, but back in her room she is overcome by the first at- tack of hysteria, which will worsen to the point that she will fear for her child's life and finally succumb. II Pardo Bazin, as a good realist should, displays considerable skill in the depiction of her characters. Noteworthy are her keen observation of child psychology, in the case of Perucho, the penetrating details used to describe the care and development of the infant, and the fine secondary characterizations. Of special importance in the structure of the novel is her depic- tion of Pedro's inadequacies and Nucha's hysteria. But in the interest of brevity and in order not to belabor the obvious, it is preferable to leave these characterizations to the care of the attentive reader and treat instead the excellent portrayal of Julian, who provides the main psychological inter- est and serves as a catalyst in the novel's action. Physically Julian is scrupulously clean, blond, of slight frame, and with an other- worldly look. Though very conscientious about his duties, he lacks charity and understanding for others and has excessive pride, which he continually tries to con- ceal. These defects are seen in his pleasure in Primitivo's murder, his attitude toward the attempted reforming of Don Pedro, and the half-successful effort to Christianize Perucho. In general, Julibn's behavior represents an over-reaction to his basic character trait, which is his almost femi- nine prudishness. He is also largely responsible for the major error of the characters: Don Pedro's decision to wed Nucha and not the flirta- tious Rita, who would have made him a better wife. But Don Pedro heeded Julifn's advice and the dictates of an excessively honor-conscious society, which refused to accept any hint of sinfulness in the pro- spective wife. (Slander and pundonor play a great role in the novel. Both the bad marriage and the ending are dependent on it.) To understand Julian we must interpret the few details given about his childhood. He was the only child, perhaps illegitimate, of a strait-laced, zealous, and domineering housekeeper in Don Manuel's employ. Thus he became accustomed to having a very subordinate role in the household. He was not allowed to play with Don Manuel's daughters, nor is it likely that he had any other opportunity to develop normal heterosexual social relationships. But he was permitted to be with Gabrie- lifio, several years his junior, and with Nucha, who took very seriously the role of the deceased mother toward the baby boy and even in the household. Tempera- mentally she was similar to Julian, meticu- lous and prudish, with a religious bent. Given the nature of this trio, and Juliin's subsequent religious training, we can better understand his constant references to Nu- cha as the Madonna, the Virgin Mary, in different aspects of, her life. As a child she had "miraculously" (in the light of his youthful religiosity) appeared as a mother figure. This would have been an uncon- scious interpretation; later he made a more conscious one of Nucha and her real child.</page><page sequence="4">6 ROBERT E. Lorr For this reason Don Pedro was an obstacle; Juliain was glad to usurp his place in every way possible. So in a sense he plays Saint Joseph to the Virgin and Her babe. On a more literal level it is obvious that as a child Juliain had repressed his interest in the opposite sex and his love for Nucha. Now he reenacts his childhood fantasy- world with Nucha and suppresses his ex- cessive affection for her. Instead of true sublimation, there is a displacement of his love to a safer object, Nucha's baby daugh- ter. His love for the infant is out of all due proportion to his role as a priest and friend of the family. He is willing to put up with almost anything to maintain this relationship and even has the absurd idea, if Don Pedro is elected, of wanting Nucha to leave the baby at the Pazos with him. It is permissible, according to social mores, for him to see the nakedness of the infant as she is bathed, cleaned, and dressed. One day his happiness is supreme. A soft, warm sensation spreads over him as he holds her in his lap. He is henceforth unwilling to forego this pleasure, taking the precaution to wear old trousers. (A Freudian psycholo- gist would perhaps relate this experience to physical and emotional problems derived from enforced celibacy, but such was not the author's intent.) Another important aspect of Juliin's psychological portraval is the dream he has after witnessing the infernal "witches' kitchen" and fortune-telling scene and the scene in which Don Pedro killed a spider (pp. 214-16). Juliin dreamed that the Pazos became a feudal castle and that Don Pedro, dressed in armor, dropped a strange weapon on him, a steel boot, but it seemed suspended over him and suddenly turned into an owl, which landed on his shoulder. The disheveled owl was strangely like the witch, La Sabia. As he fled her mocking laughter, Nucha, in the form of the sota de bastos (English equivalent here: the queen of clubs), lowered herself from a window of the castle. Not the king of clubs (equaling Don Pedro), as it first seemed to be, but St. George (equaling a self-projection of Juliin) slowly stuck his lance in the dragon. Oddly enough, Julian felt the pain in his own side, thus revealing his secret guilt. The dream also evinces the duality of his role as a defense against evil and a defender of virtue. His defense of Nucha is reflected in the dream as a frustrated desire for manliness and courage. Outwardly secure in his spiritual strength, especially regarding matters of duty, he is inwardly aware of the shortcomings of his virility. When, in real life, the artificial nursery world is destroyed and engulfed by the primitive and evil world of the Pazos, Julian is forced to flee. When he returns, his mode of living is another form of over- reacting: he lives ascetically and detached from his parishioners. III Pardo Bazin's prose is sufficiently flexible to achieve stylistic effects ranging from the serious creation of suspense, moods, and terror to irony. The sentence structure is direct and uncluttered, proceeding rapidly and incisively to the conclusion. Without being an impressionist, Pardo Bazain repre- sents an advance from the more traditional prose of her novelistic predecessors and contemporaries (in the 1880's) toward the loosely organized, sketchy, but vivid syn- tax of impressionists like Blasco Ibifiez and Azorin. The style is frequently nomi- nal, with stress on the nouns in enumera- tions or, occasionally, even in verbless sen- tences. Subordinate clauses and parentheti- cal expressions are quite rare.6 Often she uses instead run-on phrases separated by a colon to quicken the pace. Three examples of this usage are noted in the first two sentences of the following paragraph, one of the many in which the primary aim is to create a mood of fear. Los suefios de las noches de terror suelen parecer risibles apenas despunta la claridad del nuevo dia: pero Juliain, al saltar de la cama, no consigui6 vencer la impresi6n del suyo. Pro- seguia el hervor de la imaginaci6n sobreexcitada:</page><page sequence="5">NOVELISTIC TECHNIQUES IN "Los PAZOS DE ULLOA" 7 mir6 por la ventana, y el paisaje le pareci6 tetrico y siniestro: verdad es que entoldaban la b6veda celeste nubarrones de plomo con reflejos lividos, y que el viento, sordo unas veces y sibi- lante otras, doblaba los Arboles con rifagas repen- tinas. El capelln baj6 la escalera de caracol con Animo de decir su misa, que, a causa del mal estado de la capilla sefiorial, acostumbraba cele- brar en la parroquia. Al regresar y acercarse a la entrada de los Pazos, un remolino de hojas secas le envolvi6 los pies, una atm6sfera fria le sobre- cogi6, y la gran huronera de piedra se le pre- sent6 imponente, cefiuda y terrible, con aspecto de prisi6n, como el castillo que habia visto sofiando. El edificio, bajo su toldo de negras nubes, con el ruido temeroso del cierzo que lo fustigaba, era amenazador y siniestro. JuliAn penetr6 en 61 con el alma en un pufio. Cruz6 ripidamente el helado zaguAn, la cavernosa co- cina, y, atravesando los salones solitarios, se apresur6 a refugiarse en la habitaci6n de Nucha, donde acostumbraban servirle el chocolate, por orden de la sefiorita. (pp. 216-17) The mood of foreboding is created not only by the use of themes like "nubarrones" and the wind ("rifagas," "remolino," and "cierzo"), but especially by well-chosen epithets: "el paisaje . . . titrico y siniestro," "reflejos lividos," "edificio . .. amenazador y siniestro," "negras nubes,. "ruido teme- roso," "helado zaguan," "cavernosa cocina," and "salones solitarios." The use of these and similar emotion-stirring epithets here and throughout the novel certainly consti- tutes a stylistic dominant. Especially effective in Pardo Bazin's achieving of a realistic and verisimilar style is her fine representation of the spoken language. She uses the Galician dialect and local and rural expressions, though in such a way that comprehension is not usually impaired. She suggests, rather than repro- duces the dialect, except for a few words, the Castilian meanings of which she is careful to make clear. Such is the case when Bico de Rato (Hocico de Rat6n) in- cludes in a colorful tall tale easily identi- fiable dialectal forms: -. .. Fue un dia de San Silvestre . . . -Andarian las brujas sueltas ... -Si eran meigas o era el trasno, yo no lo se; pero lo mismo que habemos de dar cuenta a Dios Nuestro Sefior de nuestras auciones, me pas6 lo que les voy a contar. .... (p. 227) In another passage Perucho uses dialect and Galician diminutives in -iio: "-Rei- nifia, mona, rulihia, calla, calla, que te he de dar cosas bunitas, bunitas, bunitifias . . iSi no callas viene un coc6n y te come! iVelo, ahi viene! jCalla, soliiio, paloma blanca, rosita!" (p. 317). The most typical and extensive example is Perucho's story, in which the author parenthetically ex- plains that millo is maiz, chosco is tuerto, and uses other dialectal forms set in italics, like presonas, frol, pagarito, cirbole, and porta (pp. 320-21), which are easily under- stood because of the context and the close similarity to Spanish. Also indicative of Pardo Bazan's realistic style is her occasional graphic representa- tion of emotional speech qualities: -Oi-go, siii-seefioor, oi-go . . -tartamude6 la moza, comiendose los sollozos. (p. 74) -Tampoco hay burra-objet6 el cazador. ... -?Que... no... hay... bu... rraaaaA?- articul6, apretando los pufios, D. Pedro.-?Que no . . . la . . . hayyy? A ver, a ver . . . Repiteme eso, en mi cara. (p. 84) Here, as in her use of dialect, Pardo Bazain is moderate and avoids the extremes of Zola or Pereda, who had probably the most naturalistic style among the major Spanish novelists of the 1880's. Pardo Bazain uses a wide range of col- loquial expressions, such as the evidently regional "la carrerita de un can" (p. 8) to indicate a fairly short distance, or the color- fully metaphorical "tocar la guitarra" ("scratching fleas"), which the author ex- plains: "Se oia a los canes tocar la guitarra, espulgarse a toda orquesta ..." (p. 227).7 Phrases like "Se necesita una vara de co- rrea para vivir entre gentes" (p. 68), "toda esa gavilla que hace de mi casa merienda de negros" (p. 77), and "el sefior de los Pazos se Ilevaria el gato al agua" ("he would win the election," p. 278), if not regional are at least rare enough to be striking. Popular comparisons, while pic- turesque, tend to be more standard and even stereotyped. Three occur in the following comments about the child's drunkenness:</page><page sequence="6">8 ROBERT E. LOTT Perucho la tenia. -Como un pellejo-grufi6 el abad. -Como una cuba-murmur6 el marqu6s.-A la cama con 61 en seguida. Que duerma, y mafiana estari mis fresco que una lechuga. (p. 23) Another example: "[Sabel] bailoteando como una descosida" (p. 75). But at times a clich6 comparison is revitalized: "Iba el jinete colorado, no como un pimiento, sino como una fresa, encendimiento propio de personas linfaiticas" (p. 5). The author sometimes uses colloquial euphemisms: "El cacique afiadi6, apretando los pufios: -iMe caso con Dios! Mientras no hunda- mos a Barbacana, no se hard nada en Cebre" (p. 266). There are other colloquial elements, such as proverbs-"mais vale asno vivo que doctor muerto" (p. 39)-and tag phrases-"como usted me ensefia" (pp. 263 and 267) and "con perd6n" (p. 228) or "icon perd6n de las barbas!" (p. 227), of which the latter is used to soften a crude remark, or, as in this case, an unbelievable one. In short, the style effectively utilizes a large variety of colloquial expressive means. They are especially abundant, of course, in the passages written in a lighthearted or jocular vein and which reflect the novel's equally common and successful ironic style. The irony is produced in a number of ways, primarily by the use of playful collo- quial expressions and images: No era tortas y pan pintado la limpieza mate- rial del archivo; sin embargo, la verdadera obra de romanos fue la clasificaci6n. iAqui te quiero! parecian decir los papelotes asi que JuliAn inten- taba separarlos. Un embrollo, una madeja sin cabo, un laberinto sin hilo conductor. No existia faro que pudiese guiar por el pi6lago insondable: ni libros becerros, ni estados, ni nada. (p. 37) -. .. El marqu6s no invent6 la p6lvora ... JuliAn se volvi6.... -Pero . . ., el sefiorito . . ., qu6 tiene que ver el sefiorito.. .? El cura de Naya salt6, a su vez, sin que ninguna mosca le picase, y prorrumpi6 en juvenil carcajada. (p. 69) -iBah! . . . Esos hijos asi, nacidos por detrs de la iglesia. . . . (p. 70) Some of the examples above, as well as the following one, also reveal the realist's typically ironical-critical attitude toward his characters: "Fray Venancio, que s6lo habia recibido tal cual puntapid o pufiada despre- ciativa, no necesit6 mas pasaporte para irse al otro mundo, de puro miedo, en una semana.. ." (p. 41). While realism and irony prevail, one also encounters usages which are not typical of realism, much less of naturalism, such as calling a hunter's pants a "mapamundi de remiendos" (p. 229), or using a Valerian classical-ironical reference, "si Sabel de- seaba retener a aquel fugitivo Eneas, no dio de ello la mais leve sefial . . ." (p. 87), or employing euphemistic images. Also found are generalizations which belie the author's complete impersonality, as in this comment: "Era D. Pedro de los que juzgan muy im- portantes y dignas de comentarse sus pro- pias acciones y mutaciones-achaque propio de egoistas-y han menester tener siempre cerca de si algi'n inferior o subordinado a quien referirla, para que les atribuya tam- bidn valor extraordinario" (p. 104). A major element in Pardo Bazain's real- istic style, as it is indeed in any thoroughly realistic style in the nineteenth century, is the so-called "free indirect style," by which is meant, in brief, the blurring of the con- tours between the characters' thoughts and words and the author's narrative style, a technique which responds to the still deeper and stronger current in the nine- teenth century toward the integration of the spoken language into literary style. Free indirect style marks the midpoint be- tween direct style (quoting) and indirect style (summing up or talking about) and is a tricky and at times startling way to preserve in the narration the flavor and affective values of the spoken language. Or it may be used to reflect the characters' thoughts, thus deepening the psychological portrayal. Additional advantages are that it gives the author a third way to narrate, is more rapid and less tedious, and provides the perfect stylistic vehicle for the author's irony, or better, critical empathy, because he is thus able to treat ironically the</page><page sequence="7">NOVELISTIC TECHNIQUES IN "Los PAZOS DE ULLOA" 9 characters' speech and attitudes even while empathically mimicking them.8 All these features are seen in Los Pazos de Ulloa. Examples of ironical-characteriz- ing usage abound: Hechas asi las amistades, entablaron el sefior de la Lage y su sobrino la imprescindible con- versaci6n referente al viaje, sus causas, incidentes y peripecias. No explicaba muy satisfactoria- mente el sobrino su impensada venida: pch . . . ganas de esinlirse . . . Cansa estar siempre solo . Gusta la variaci6n . . No insisti6 el tio, pensando entre si: -Ya Juli6n me lo contari todo. (p. 93) Y en cuanto a lo que de un pueblo antiguo puede enamorar a un espiritu culto, . . de eso entendia lo mismo don Pedro que de iego, o latin. iPiedras mohosas! Ya le bastaban as e los Pazos. . . A pesar de conocer a Orense y haber estado en Santiago cuando nifio, discurria y fantaseaba a su modo lo que debe ser una ciu- dad moderna: calles anchas, mucha regularidad en las construcciones, todo nuevo y flamante, gran policia, 4qub menos puede ofrecer la civili- zaci6n a sus esclavos? Es cierto que Santiago poesia dos o tres edificios espaciosos, la Catedral, el Consistorio, San Martin ... Pero en ellos existian cosas muy sin raz6n ponderadas, en concepto del marques: por ejemplo, la Gloria de la Catedral. iVaya unos santos mis mal hechos, y unas santas mAs larguiruchas y sin forma humana! iUnas columnas mis raramente esculpidas! (p. 101) The above examples reflect a still cau- tious use of free indirect style: in each case the discursive element is present and the author indicates her intention. But she is bolder in the use of questions, exclamations, and affective values in the depicting of Julian's psychology. A typical example: Volvia JuliAn preocupado a la casa solariega, acusAndose de excesiva simplicidad, por no haber reparado en cosas de tanto bulto. El era sencillo como la paloma; s61lo que en este picaro mundo tambien se necesita ser cauto como la serpiente Ya no podia continuar en los Pazos &amp;C6mo volvia a vivir a cuestas de su madre, sin mis emolumentos que la misa? 4Y c6mo dejaba asi de golpe al sefiorito D. Pedro, que le trataba tan llanamente? 4Y la casa de Ulloa, que necesi- taba un restaurador celoso y adicto? Todo era verdad; pero 4y su deber de sacerdote cat6lico? (p. 71) A major example, also significant in its use of substitutionary reporting, shows Juliain's musings regarding comments his mother had made about Sefior de la Lage's daugh- ters (pp. 106-08). Of greater psychological interest is a passage in which JuliAn de- bates with himself: No, ese guapo no era 61. iBuena misa seria la que dijese, con la cabeza hecha una olla de grillos! ... La cosa era bien clara. Situaci6n: la misma del afio peniiltimo. Tenia que marcharse. . . . A otra parte, pues, con la muisica. S61o que . . . Vaya, hay cosas mis fciles de proyectar que de hacer. .. .Por qu6 le disgus- taba tanto la perspectiva de salir de los Pazos? Bien mirado, 61 era un extrafio en aquella casa. Es decir, eso de extrafio . . . Extrafio, no; pues vivia unido espiritualmente a la familia. ... Sobre todo la niiia, la nifia. El acordarse de la nifia le dej6 como embobado. No podia ex- plicarse a si mismo el gran sacudimiento interior que le causaba pensar que no volveria a cogerla en brazos. i Mire usted que estaba encarifiado con la tal mufieca! Se le ilenaron de ligrimas los ojos. (pp. 203-04) There are two additional important pas- sages, too long to quote, in which Julian's fears and agitation are admirably depicted in a free indirect style, very boldly used (pp. 211-13 and 303-04). The second of these includes a kind of wishful thinking, a short piece of which may be given: Se representaba la escena de la escapatoria. Seria al amanecer. Nucha iria envuelta en muchos abrigos. El cargarfa con la nifia, dormi- dita y arropadisima tambi6n. Por si acaso, Ile- varia en el bolsillo un tarro con leche caliente. Andando bien, Ilegarfan a Cebre en tres horas escasas. Alli se odan hacer sopas. La nena no pasaria hambre. Tomarian en el coche la berlina, el sitio mis c6modo. Cada vuelta de la rueda les alejaria de los tetricos Pazos. (p. 304) From this sampling it is evident that Pardo Bazin uses free indirect style with considerable skill and for a variety of pur- poses, although with some restraint. In the sequel to this novel, she uses it so freely for the characterization of Gabriel that it is but one step from the much discussed interior monologue. If there is a sense of restraint or mitiga- tion in the use of certain stylistic elements and techniques, the same is true of the images, because in this novel the author suggests, but draws back from a full-fledged utilization of, the anthropomorphic and animizing metaphors typical of naturalists like Zola and Blasco Ibaifiez. Among the most effective images are those symbols or</page><page sequence="8">10 ROBERT E. LoTT symbolical passages regarding the deca- dence at the Pazos and corresponding to the laxity and degradation of its inhabi- tants, like the overgrowth of vegetation which has destroyed the orderly, civilized aspects of the Pazos-as in the overrunning of the symmetrical French garden (pp. 30- 32)-and the chaotic state of affairs in the library. Or this serious symbolism may correspond to the fearsomeness of the place (p. 217), to the hell's kitchen scenes, to Julian's and Nucha's fears and hallucina- tions, and to Julian's dream. While a classification of the images in Los Pazos de Ulloa according to proven- ance is not very helpful, it is of interest to note that one group of images is based on the analogy of plants. They may be serious, as in the overgrowth motif, or only half serious as in Julian's thoughts on Primi- tivo and Sabel: "iHorrible familia ilegal, enraizada en el viejo caser6n solariego como las parietarias y yedras en los de- rruidos muros!" (p. 151). Or they may be traditional and openly playful, as in the following passage concerning Perucho: "Pareciale que era providencial el que la sefiorita cuidase a aquel mal retofiio de tronco ruin. Y Nucha entre tanto se diver- tia infinito con su protegido. .... Aspiraba a enderezar aquel arbolito tierno, civilizan- dole a la vez la piel y el espiritu" (p. 157). A similar image: "Parecia que la lefiosa corteza se le iba cayendo poco a poco al marquis, y que su coraz6n bravio y egoista se inmutaba, dejando asomar, como entre las grietas de una pared florecillas parisitas, blandos afectos de esposo y padre" (p. 168). It is much more relevant to classify the images by their functions, such as the symbolical, mood-enhancing ones already mentioned. Another important function is the psychological one. So it is that an image giving Juliain's impression of Sabel and the old hag reveals his religious training: "Mientras hablaba con la frescachona Sabel, la fantasia de un artista podia evocar los cuadros de tentaciones de San Antonio, en que aparecen juntas una asquerosa he- chicera y una mujer hermosa y sensual, con pezufia de cabra" (p. 48). Again we see Julian's attitude in the image used: "La idea . . de quedarse alli, frente a frente con Sabel, como en obscuro pozo habitado por una sabandija, le era intolerable" (p. 277). Two mystical images reflect Julian's contemplative mood as he views a picture of the via crucis in La imitaci6n de Cristo: "Pareciale sentir en los hombros una pesa- dumbre abrumadora y dulcisima a la vez, y una calma honda, como si se encontrase . . sepultado en el fondo del mar, y el agua le rodease por todas partes, sin aho- garle. Entonces leia pairrafos del libro de oro, que se le entraban en el alma a manera de hierro enrojecido en la came" (p. 295). Anthropomorphic images reveal the fearful reaction to the chaotic basement: "La pata de una mesa parecia un brazo momificado, la esfera de un reloj era la faz blanquecina de un muerto, y unas botas ... despertaban . la idea de un hombre asesinado y oculto alli" (p. 223). Immediately follow- ing this passage, the sounds of the storm are animized-thus recalling the legendary "santa compafia" mentioned before (p. 219)-to reflect Juliain's and Nucha's quasi- hallucinatory reaction: "Rugia con cre- ciente ira el viento, y la tronada se habia situado sobre los Pazos, oyindose su es- truendo lo mismo que si corriese por el tejado un escuadr6n de caballos a galope o si un gigante se entretuviese en arrastrar un pefiasco y Ilevarlo a tumbos por encima de las tejas" (p. 224). A large number of the images are ironic or playful, and, of course, are clustered in the lighter passages. A few examples fol- low: De los monumentos de Santiago se atenia el marques a uno de fibrica muy reciente: su prima Rita. (p. 102) Entr6 alli cierta hechicera mAs poderosa que la sehora Maria la Sabia: la politica. .... (p. 247) Las ideas no entran en juego, sino solamente las personas, y en el terreno mIs mezquino: ren- cores, odios, rencillas, lucro miserable, vanidad microbiol6gica.

(p. 282) T HE NOVEL'S MOST STRIKINGLY PLAYFUL IMAGES are seen in the idyllic, almost rococo representation of male rabbits blindly following their sexual instinct to death at the hunters' hands as lovesick suitors pursuing a fantastic Dulcinea. At the same time, this image again discloses the author's euphemistic treatment of a perfectly naturalistic theme: biological determinism, in this case. Sabe [el cazador] que el fantasma que acaba de cruzar ... es la hembra, la Dulcinea perseguida y recuestada por innumerables galanes en la 6poca del celo, . tras de la cual, desalados y hechos almibar, corren por lo menos tres o cuatro machos, deseosos de romnticas aventuras. Y si se deja pasar delante a la dama, ninguno de los nocturnos rondadores se detendra en su carrera loca.... No, no se pararin. . .. Al primer hilito de la hembra .. los fogosos perseguidores se lanzarain de nuevo y con mAs brio, ciegos de amor, con- vulsos de deseo, y el cazador que los acecha los ira tendiendo uno por uno a sus pies, sobre la hierba en que sofiaron tener el lecho nupcial. (pp. 237-38) Most of the images are functional, but a few, like the following ones, are more purely decorative: La aurora, que s6lo tenia apoyado uno de sus rosados dedos en aquel rinc6n del orbe, se atrevi6 a alargar toda la manecita, y un resplan- dor alegre, puro, bafi6 las rocas pizarrosas, haciendolas rebrillar cual brufiida plancha de acero, y entr6 en el cuarto del capellin, comi6n- dose la luz amarilla de los cirios. (p. 187) A pesar de haber el pecado original corrompido toda la camne, aqu6lla que le estaban ensefiando era la cosa mris pura y santa del mundo: un lirio, una azucena de candor. La cabezuela blanca . . . tenia el olor especial que se nota en los nidos de paloma donde hay pichones im- plumes todavia; y.. la boca desdentada y hmeda como coral pAlido recien salido del mar....(pp. 198-99) In Los Pazos de Ulloa there is every indication of a thoroughly realistic narra- tive method and style. But, because of reli- gious and philosophical beliefs, because of the euphemistic treatment of potentially crude or shocking details and situations, and because of restraint in the use of style features and images, Pardo Bazin falls short of full-fledged naturalism. Yet her artistry is not thereby impaired. The themes, settings, and characterizations are believably and incisively presented and the varying stylistic and imagistic nuances correspond perfectly to the shifts in mood, tone, and point of view. NOTES 'See Sherman H. Eoff, The modern Spanish novel (New York, 1961), pp. 109-15. 2The Catholic naturalism of Pardo Bazin (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1957). Robert E. Osborne, in Emilia Pardo Bazan: su vida y sus obras (M6xico, 1964), is essentially in agreement with Brown regarding Pardo Bazfn's naturalism (pp. 69-70), as is Harry L. Kirby, Jr., who studies a little-known essay by her (18'/7) to show both the emphasis she placed on heredity and environ- ment and "her argument against transformism and the animal origin of man" ("Pardo Bazin, Darwinism and La madre naturaleza," Hispania, XLVII [1964], 733-37). 3Eoff, pp. 114 and 119, respectively. To avoid duplication of Eoff's and Brown's work, I shall refrain from further, general dis- cussion of naturalism as related to Pardo Bazin and concentrate on the more technical aspects. It is, nevertheless, desirable to point out two articles which to some extent corroborate my interpretation. Jos6 Blanco Amor, in "Romanticismo y espiritu de clase en Los Pazos de Ulloa," Cuadernos hispanoamericanos, Ntim. 148 (Abril 1962), calls Pardo Bazain "una posromantica situada entre dos edades literarias: el romanticismo muerto y el naturalismo agonizante" (p. 8). He insists on this romantic-naturalistic duality and on a supposed falsification of the characters: "Los de arriba son buenos, los de abajo son malos. La vileza esta en el pueblo; la virtud, en los sefiores" (p. 10). He is likewise critical of her prejudiced portrayal of the liberal doctor, Mixi- mo Juncal, as "un charlatan, superficial, pedante, inconsciente, tonto" (p. 12). Ronald Hilton's study, "Dofia Emilia Pardo Bazfn, Neo-Catholi- cism and Christian socialism," The Americas, xI (1954), 3-18, explains Juncal as a M. Homais type and, more importantly, helps us to place Los Pazos de Ulloa and its sequel on a trajectory, rather closer to the beginning than the end, between Neo-Catholicism and Christian socialism. 4It is useful to compare Pardo Bazin's shifts in point of view with Harry Levin's comments on Flaubert: "He developed the technical device that handbooks term point of view by adapting the rhythms of his style to the movement of his character's thoughts. By limiting what has more precisely been termed the center of consciousness to the orbit of a single character . . . purists could intensify the focus of the novel still further" (The Gates of Horn: A study of five French realists [New York, 1963], p. 252).

Lorr on to discuss this technique in Madame Bovary and its realistic stylistic counterpart, le style indirect libre. 5Los Pazos de Ulloa, Obras completas, m (Madrid n.d. [1891]) p. 219. Subsequent refer- ences will be made in the text. 6In all of this I am at odds with Mary E. Giles. First, in the matter of literary impression- ism, which she knows imperfectly, she means themes or motifs-sun through leaves, colors, light, descriptions-not techniques, in her "Im- pressionist Techniques in Descriptions by Emilia Pardo Bazn," Hispanic Review, xxx (1962), 304-16. In a second article ("Pardo Bazin's Two Styles," Hispania, XLVm [1965], 456-62), she unsuccessfully tries to establish a significant distinction between Pardo Baz~n's early elaborate and complex style and a later, more modernistic and impressionistic one. Not enough passages are treated, nor do her own examples bear out her theory (which is not to say that there may not be grounds for some distinction-it is simply undocumented). 70On Pardo Bazan's language, cf. Carmen Bravo-Villasante, Vida y obra de Emilia Pardo Bazdn (Madrid, 1962), p. 133.
