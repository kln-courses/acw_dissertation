Beginning in October, 1982, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago will hold a major retrospective exhibit of the fiber sculp tures of the Polish artist Magdalena Abakanowicz (b. 1930). As yet I have seen her work only in the photographs, published by Jonathan Brent in TriQuarterly 53 (Winter 1982), of the seated "Backs" installed along the river Vistula near Warsaw, and of the "Heads'' and the astounding round-ripe world of the "Embryology" assembly. Mary Jane Jacob, curator of the Museum of Contemporary Art, credits Abakanowicz with having stimulated the enormous international exper iment with fibers as a sculptural medium in the past two decades?all the more reason to attend to her haunting and seminal work. As haunting for me are the prose vignettes, brief memoirs, and in tense meditations in which Magdalena Abakanowicz projects her pre occupation with touch and explains her past: the mother who was at once stiff and soft, beautiful, clever, dissatisfied at having no son (she was to suffer horribly during the war); the father brave, aristocratic (part Russian, part Pole, part Tartar), historically haunted, distant; and Magdalena herself, fearful of being put under obligation by the adult world. She presents herself as a person to whom public behaviors, in cluding speech as well as the ordonnances of music and movement, were frightening in their obscurity. Characteristically, she responded to cul ture with subliminal offerings. She tells in one vignette how she brought her treasures collected from the woods, fields, and ponds inside their stone manor to constellate themselves before a dark mural of an armored knight with four horses. Slowly her objects came to life. "This took time. ... it turned into a dance. I was inside it." She communes with a natural world in which truths can be "accumulated without control, direction, or pattern." With a long pole, I pushed a wooden canoe into the reeds. Without a thought I became one with the murmurs of the time of day and with this whole world of movement and stillness, growth and decay. There I belonged. With con centration, for hours I looked at the grass and the water. I wanted to sub ordinate myself to them, so that I might understand the mysteries that separated me from them. She collected twigs, bark, pebbles, threads, shrivelled potatoes. Her dearest possession was a pen-knife. She was alone. Time was capacious, roomy; leaves grew slowly, and slowly changed their shape and color. Everything was immensely important. All was at one with me. The country was full of strange powers. Apparitions and inexplicable forces had their laws and spaces. I remember Poludnice [female ghosts said to appear on hot days at noon] and Zytnie Baby [rye hags]. Whether I had ever seen them, I cannot say; in the hamlet peasant women talked about them. At another point in her Portrait (forthcoming as part of the exhibit catalogue from the Museum of Contemporary Art), Abakanowicz ac tually remembers a little man the size of an acorn who scurries out from under a tussock. On another day, this secret and homely apparition: A transparent, large Poludnica was shimmering in the sun, in that terribly hot air in which it seems impossible to breathe. One could think about her, imagine her, but one must not look. With the whole body one felt the danger of being in the open fields at high noon. It becomes clear that the knowledge Magdalena Abakanowicz gained as a child was tactile, emotional, and cosmic?of a sort that retards and attenuates the values if not the skills associated with rational, categori cal, and verbal development. Her superstitions are neither acquired nor chic. Her self-consciousness is transitive and pure. Her use of rhetoric is at once direct and lax, owing to her choice of another extensional realm for living out her thought about self, experience, and the tissue of being. She can and does exist elsewhere than in the literature she can create about herself?a fact we can acknowledge with pleasure only because she has happened to turn the light of words on moments like this (from the prose sketch also called "Embryology," [Minted entire in TriQuarterly 53): I was very little. Crouching over the edge of a marshy pond, I observed tad poles. Enormous, about to be transformed into frogs. They were swarming by the bank. Through the fine membranes covering their distended stomachs one could clearly see the tangle of their guts. They were replete with the proc ess of transformation, sluggish. They were tempting you to reach out for them. When they were pulled out with a stick onto the bank or inadvertently touched, their bulging bellies split and the contents leaked out in a confusion of knots. In a minute flies fell upon them. My heart was beating fast. I sat there shaken by what was happening. One is instantly struck by the difference between Abakanowicz's early vision of "soft" (her word) and vulnerable fecundity, and an essentially self-dramatizing vision like that in Seamus Heaney's "Death of a Naturalist" (1966), a poem about the ominous maturation of frog spawn into obscenely, farting "great slime kings . . . gathered there for ven geance" against the boy who had stolen jars of the "warm thick slobber ... of jellied specks" from the flax-dam. Heaney's poetic constructs are theatrically masculine, projecting as they do tableaux of confrontation and revenge in which the tropes of personification and a mythified alle gory are prominent. As a vernacular Irishman fighting against English literary decorum?a role Alan Shapiro explores at length in an essay forthcoming in Parnassus?Heaney brandishes the kenning, accentual metres, a verbally replete world of textured particulars, and a self-con scious clabbering effect in his diction. Whereas Heaney is undeniably influenced by his country boyhood, Abakanowicz is constantly being invaded anew by earth, childhood, the speechless passage of time in the cycles of the leaf, and the sluggish transparent complexity of animal and plant tissue, of fluids and blood. Heaney writes about a nature so idiosyncratically textured by his de scription of it as to fade before the dazzling language in which it is real ized. Abakanowicz, although not a poet, suggests an experience of na ture closed to those who are, a nature that is prerational, prescientific, prelinguistic, which stands there shimmering with power, danger, and untouched, seducing form. This is the nature Louise Gl?ck aspires to enter, experience, and bring forward to us by allusion. It seems to me that Gl?ck also wishes, like Magdalena Abakanowicz, to empty-out, take attention away from, words; at least the poet wishes to use this act of self-abnegation as a gesture and appearance in her work, which shines with the strain of refusal. To think of Louise GUick's poetry as the aesthetic-linguistic counterpart to the blunt, rapt, tongueless imagination of Abakanowicz moves me very far into Gl?ck's poetry and permits a certain access of sympathy for the poet's deprived, harmed, stammering beings. Even the Polish sculptor's reverence for twigs, fibers, and stones, assembled so as to kindle into life their secret patterns, cast for me real illumination on the American poet's talismans. Gl?ck writes of the sun's "cold plumage"; of the gods walking down the mountain "in their cloaks of feathers"; of the wool scarves of the drowned cjuldren; of their brilliantly colored overcoats; of the sexually exorbitant and enamelled hues of flowers; of light and shade as intentionally woven fabrics; of her little dead sister's "head covered with black feathers." Gl?ck toys in a grim way with the alien quality of one's own skin, so close to being fake fur, hide, or feathers, yet so near to the tender organs and conduits it shelters (heart, eye, genitals, veins). At the same time that the personae of Louise Gl?ck's poems are ab stracted from their physical frame, they are peculiarly vulnerable to the slightest bruise from beyond. Her hints about the anorexia she may have endured as a child would emphasize both impulses, toward empty imperviousness and painful deterioration. This dichotomy of character and experience is in turn reflected in a dichotomy of language. The poet's diction is marked by an adjectival form whereby a Latinate, per haps more dryly abstract term is yoked with a Germanic, more stub bornly concrete term. The now famous example is from "The Drowned Children," where a voice calls to the children from over Gl?ck's shoulder. Whdt are you waiting for come home, come home, lost in the waters, blue and permanent As in the larger descriptive milieu of many, many poems of hers, the com bination of blue and permanent suggests a visual tableau of the frozen will, i ?- ?? SEPTEMBERyOCTOBER 1982 PAGE 37</page><page sequence="2">the iced-over and paralyzed libido. Gl?ck clearly cultivates this intensely visual aspect in order to link the psychological interior with a quasi natural externalized landscape; the link serves to relieve the inevitable claustrophobia of her theme, and to give her an ampler descriptive palette. The adjectives blue and permanent cut and nudge one another, neither by itself particularly resonant or evocative, but together creating an uneasily shifting compound of inter-referential qualities that did not exist in isola tion. This synergy between the two members is also at work even when etymology is not so divergent. "The Drowned Children" has two further examples of idiosyncratic descriptive doubling, "the pond lifts them in its manifold dark arms," "As though they had always beeniblind and weightless" (my emphasis). It may not be merely a post hoc rationaliza tion that would see in "manifold arms" alone a Shiva-like grotesquerie, which the addition of "dark" helps to soften. In the second example, Gl?ck has made explicit the current cultural-poetic dialect of sensibility in which blindness and airiness, vacancy and luminosity are equated. Soon enough we will look back at a poem like this and read the phrase "blind and weightless" as redundant. One saw earlier GKick's 1975 volume The House on Marshland how the yoked-opposites method of description was gathering head: there, the dead waited "lucid and helpless"; a "you" posed above the deer "wounded and dominant"; angels were called "burnished, literal"; the walls of a child's room were "spruce and silence"; and, continuing the noun variant of the yoke-idea, limbs aimed to be free of both "blossom and subterfuge." In her present volume, Descending Figure, a quick selection of the trope shows a screened porch in youth filled with "a gold, magnetic light/' Her little son now plays in cold weather among "the brown, degraded bushes"?a striking denigation. Finally, the sea of yearning and desire is said to be "false" like "all that is fluent and womanly." This last example reinforces the tension twice, first by pair ing two words that are alike in rhythm and degree of softness but dif ferent in derivation (the Latinate fluency with the Germanic womanly), then by alliterating (a force for similitude and parallel) words of oppos ing sentiment and tone (fluent with false). Whereas the phrase "blind and weightless" might be thought predictable in the context of the poetry of the past decade as a whole, Gl?ck's false sounded against her womanly fluent is a case of her own more homegrown and ingrown ob session with ghostly lives. Here falsehood and fluency adjoin one an other just as vulnerability alternates with oblivion and periods of hunger with those of coma. The movement I imply from sin to absolution, deceit to candor, and hunger to death are in truth Louise Gl?ck's own movements and impli cations. For her the preconditions of transcendence are the denial, the flaw, the act of stepping outside the human community in promulgating defiantly aberrant perceptions. In the most powerful poetry of Descend ing Figure, the suite of "Lamentations," which Helen Vendler suggests are about the beginnings of religion, the poet appears to have raised to the level of cult her sense of being watched by the world she thinks. Poems like these are part of a deliberate gnosticism and an organized profanation: THE LOGOS They were both still the woman mournful the man branching into her body. But God was watching Who knew what he wanted? He was god, and a monster. So they waited And the world filled with his radiance, as though he wanted to be understood Far away, in the void that he had shaped, he turned to his angels. Does the deity turn to his angels to speak? to command, praise, or announce? Possibly. But in every situation, familial or divine, the poet only shadows the relation of powerless to powerful?that frozen tableau quality again. We do not, at any rate, hear what God might then have said. His turn functions, more characteristically, as a gesture both of denial (like the dangerous father who in other poems could hurt the daughter if he wanted to) and of sexual preference (this shadowy divin ity turns aside to live with angels as Whitman planned to do with the creatures, in warm animality). When I speculate about the emotion to which "The Logos" directs us, I am reminded how powerfully the language of rising and pooling is made to figure in the book. Here in part one of "Lamentations" the world has filled with radiance as if light were a fluid. In part two of "Lamentations," "A forest rose from the earth," and in part four God again "arose." Womanliness, as we saw earlier, is linked to fluency. The human body is often placed beside water, made analogous to ves sels, pails, and pools. The human face is metonymy for "the mirror in which it appears, floating up to the surface; in turn such a metonymy of face and eyes for mirrors points to a more interesting metohymic trans lation, of mirror into memory or consciousness. Gl?ck's poem "Swans" is a crucial text for these gliding journeys from a physical element to a mental and emotional tissue. The narrative "I'K addresses a married man, presumably craving his separation from his wife. Both wife and female speaker are transfixed by the mysterious dream image of the man summoning bridal swans to "settle on the scaled water"?"scaled" being the dream's term for the rigid, formalized frills of Gliick's own postures, diction, and imagery. The wife is frozen before this scene of dread: I saw her motionless before your gift always the swans glide unmenacing across the rigid blue of the Pacific Ocean, then rise in a single wave, pure white and devouring. This grim denouement in which rise bespeaks the desire for a sweeping away of her enemy, is stylized, as it were painted, hence oddly reduced in significance. Like a hawk mantling over its kill, the poet fans the symbolic wing of a cruel ascendancy over another: she summons that single curling wave. But the movement is smooth, oriental, balletic, and finally not very far removed from the verbal gestures in which Gl?ck usually conveys hope, weariness, joy, or relief. In "Swans," those tags of the stylized stillness of large waters (the odd peach color of the sky "from which the sea withdrew, bearing/its carved boats: your bodies were like that"; "The horizon burned"; and "The sea lay mild as a pool") resemble the poem "Happiness" in their noncommittal, chipped declarative fragmentation, their expression of visual impulse as somatic response, and their faint personifying transfers (in "Swans," "the sea lay mild," in "Happiness," the sunlight pools). Liquefaction is a quietly tenacious image source in each, and must cause us to think that, if this be happiness, it is in few ways preferable to dread: A man and woman lie on a white bed It is morning. I think Soon they will waken. On the bedside table is a vase of lilies; sunlight pools in their throats. I watch him turn to her as though to speak her name but silently, deep in her mouth? At the window ledge, once, twice, a bird calls. And then she stirs; her body fills with his breath. ("Happiness") From this first stanza, in which the fluid of breath and passion rises in the lungs and throat to the mouth, Gl?ck turns in the second stanza to her prevailing associations of liquid with pools at which the questing soul leans to peer. Over the man's shoulder, an ominous Jacobean Sol pointedly keeps his distance from the lovers: I open my eyes; you are watching me. Almost over this room the sun is gliding. Look at your face, you say, holding your own close to me to make a mirror. How calm you are. And the burning wheel passes gently over us. ("Happiness") At the muffled exclamation, "How calm you are," I imagine the eyes, opened reflectors, to fill with tears, to glaze. The gliding and passing of the sun on its effortless keel is cognate with the opening of the gaze, the window/mirror magic between intimates, and the profound {deep, fills, pools) physical reply. But the body and the consciousness are never at ease in these offerings. Passion is always constrained, perception always something both passive and appalled, in the poetry of Gl?ck. Her land scapes, far from encouraging the emergence of some other spirit world, are tortuous and haunting psychological projections?lunar landscapes both hopeless and furious. Louise Gl?ck freely acknowledges the paraly sis of will from which her poetry in both senses can be said to suffer. And pain, the free hand, changes almost nothing. Like the winter wind, it leaves settled forms in the snow. Known, identifiable? except there are no uses for them. ("World Breaking Apart") These are the words of someone who may not be able to continue in the same bleak vein without bowing to that uselessness and embracing hermetic silence. Laura Jensen is clearly applying some of the same methods as Louise Gl?ck: the forcible paring of settings to their lunar minimum; mani pulation of an often helplessly buffeted speaker among frozen particu lars; the mingling of present with past; permeable temporality; the openness of one element (air, water, flesh) to another; and both Gl?ck and Jensen are wont to dwell on states of psychological paralysis. But whereas Gl?ck is brisk, even business-like in approaching her material PAGE 38 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="3">head on, Laura Jenson leaves the impression of having accidentally stumbled upon her fearful and nauseated images of the self: Out on the beach the mussels caught at it, what you overturned; the crabs scattered, running with one glance at some horrible maturity. ("Tapwater") These lines affect by their power of suggestion, directed at the unnam able?a method that lies at the core of all gothic romance. But Jensen also permits the amusing crabs to act their part, all running sideways as if "with one glance" back at what scattered them, the girl on the beach. With the phrase "some horrible maturity," the poet betrays her great weakness for the exaggerated, slightly off-center puff. She writes else where of "unrelenting wings," "tactile evening," "virtuous coracle," and "expedient humanity." The off-centeredness is made more trouble some by a second mannerism, the coy surreal, which in the work of many who have been encouraged to pursue the quirky in their sensibilities produces mere varieties of makeshift. Finally, of course, a cultivated eccentricity is simply another convention, but in extreme or youthful cases one that deprives itself of the order a convention can and should provide. The stanza from "Tapwater" above, despite its small charm, has no stamina for carrying through the suggestion that horror at the thing (a dead animal?) turned over on the beach is actually horror of one's own crime?a deed to which the mind pivots and clings like a mussel, fasten ing itself, sucking. Rather, the associations into which Jensen allows the poem to drift do nothing to support or sustain one another. Suddenly, a bird appears in the speaker's hands that was not there until the crabs scattered; the speaker prays to it, mentions "the others," alludes to on coming death?all eerie little turns entirely wanting in aesthetic or nar rative significance. At the same time, I don't believe that Jensen is trying for a purely verbal accidence of emblem groups. The most successful poems in Memory (hardly for Jensen a cerebral title) are those in which the per ceiving mind pivots feelingly upon an object. One example is "Kite," about the arrangement by age-groups of the aisles in a dime store; an other is "Kitchen," in which each ingredient in the larder is interpreted ("Onions are the same tunes/to their centers," "Milk is a satisfied whis per"); these are mild, coherent, unobjectionable poems. Jensen is also fond of debris, and does not shrink from surface listing: In the span of a month I have touched a horse, drawn a woman in a girdle of half-moons and stars, received some lavender as a present, bought patchouli, rose, and paint thinner, books and s tamps and 25-watt bulbs. ("West Window") But like the prose into which this kind of thing necessarily drifts, her poems of greater ambitions, especially political ones, are diffused into aimless spurts of descriptive energy; from the fifty lines of "Tenor," the portrait of an anti-war mother, the following is the only one where some thing true has been precisely centered in the watching mind: the sky is said to be "deepened by a jet, tiny and high." In the end, one is frus trated by the narrowness of the range of those poems of Laura Jensen to which genuine response is possible. Jack Gilbert may suffer from some of the same dissipations as does Laura Jenson, but he has a less obsessive inwardness, hence is less obscure. Gilbert is the rather interesting figure who won the Yale Younger Poets prize in 1962 and then abdicated his crown, which is to say he quit what was apparently a very successful tour of readings and escaped to Europe, ending up on a small stony island in the Cyclades. The first part of his book is called "1962" to indicate that it is composed of more youthful efforts, which I find less interesting than part two, "Monolithos, 1982," to which I limit my remarks, and in which a less mannered syntax and less clever dramatic attitudes open up the world of the poems to the sympathetic reader. Gilbert is preoccupied by the different quality of light in the Mediter ranean and by the~ omnipresent force of marble. "Sur Ponticello" gives us the witty Medici perspective on the facts of this sun-shot geography in a fine short parable: SUR PONTICELLO Year by year he works himself, replacing youth with stone. But the marble rings with love even more than the fine flesh. Unlike the worsted stocking darned all over with silk thread, which still remains common although it is silk through and through, Gilbert's hero discovers himself defeated, that is vastly improved in amplitude of feel ing by the substitution of marble for firm youthful flesh. The same theme is played more pitifully in "Getting Ready," where the poet in the mode of Thomas Hardy regrets the rise in passion "as the body wanes/' and in the mode of Philip Larkin puzzles over the hot inexplica ble hours of his suffering: What if the heart does not pale as the body wanes, but is like the sun that blazes hotter each day on these immense, perishing fields? He sits there bewildered in a clamp of light In the stillness, the sun grinds him clean. It is almost as if the setting had called the facts of this experience into being. Again, the landscape is given a central admonishing if not causa tive role in the teaching of patience and the imposition of fear. These bright, pointblank landscapes, unlike those of Gl?ck and Jen sen, seem solid, palpable, alive with power over the figures who languish in them. In this respect, in fact, Jack Gilbert is much closer to Abakano wicz than either of the others. He has a reverent fascination for the rub ble of open-air temples and tinkers with a minor pantheon of syncretic half-classicized deities. It is this ironic reverence that is the tenor in "That Tenor of Which the Night Birds Are a Vehicle.'' Rather than an anthropomorphic figure, Gilbert speaks in a comic wayNthrough a bird whose future may be sacrifice (augury). He is Not managing as a bird Struggling through my career, blindly testing the odor of all that whiteness night after night not sure if the old piss-smell is the scent of gods, and knowing even that faint clue is fading as I hesitate. But birds are not known to have highly developed olfactory organs; neither can the poem's context satisfy as to what the speaker would do if he did accurately identify the fast-fading clue. There's more than a hint of fatuity, carelessness, and hasty management that mars the poem's spanning of irony and awe. Still, it gives one approximation of the universe's rough relation to earth in the purposeful geometry con necting "the tranced signaling of nightjars" with the suggestion of square-hewn stones: the birds appear to fly in swiftly precise planes and vectors, while the marbles evoke that furious (or white) cleanness of line the gods are thought to have required for their worship. Stone?its reflective properties, it? edged severity, and its godlike bulk?is a constant in the Greek poems, which are heavily autobio graphical. His marriage is failing, perhaps because they are so isolated; but Gilbert's speaker is himself passive, without occupation or pro gram, troubled in mind, perhaps physically incapacitated (one poem tells us he had a bad fall from a fir tree). Strong connections are always implied between the malaise of the spirit and the properties of the land scape. Here is a dream version of that paralysis of spirit that impinges on, when it is not being impinged upon by, the unpitying locale. In such a place irony ("derision") can be a resource. Note the terms of chiseling (clear, cut, bright,) and the fearful-soft responses: He struggles to get the marble terrace clear in his dreams. Broad steps going down. A balustrade cut into the bright moonlight Love is pouring out and he is crying. Why is the small-headed Artemis so moving, and the Virtues with their pretty breasts? What is he searching for among the banal statues? When he touches the chapped plinths, his spirit twangs Derision protects him less and less. He goes shamelessly among them, trembling and fashioning a place. ("Night After Night") Desire is the fruit of discipline (the little Artemis moves him), but this dream vision as formalized by the poem also says that discipline, habit, and convention (the statues are banal) must be continually broken, in response if not in deed, to make room for new invention, although Gil bert's is unformed and tremulous. "Night After Night" gives a Romantic-mythic exaggeration to the coincidence of marble and statuary both with disturbing female beauty and with some kind of religious feeling. "Remembering My Wife" com bines these elements under the aegis of literature and painting, in a lovely diction: "I imagine Helen in light, not hue. In my dreams,/Nau sicaa is blanched colorless by noon./And Botticelli's Simonetta comes as faint tints of air." While "A Kind of World," a lucid and moving poem, performs the convocation in a plain manner under the rubric of narrative realism unflexed by trope (even by the intrusions of syntax? the poem is composed entirely in nouns and gerunds), as if indifferent to the turmoil which it nevertheless brings harshly and bodily into being: A KIND OF WORLD Things that are themselves. Waves water, the rocks stone. The smell of her arms. Stillness. Windstorms. The long silence again. The well The rabbit Heat Nipples and long thighs. Her heavy bright mane. Plunging water flashing as she washes her body in the sun. "Perfect in whiteness." Light going away every evening like some great importance. Grapes outside the windows. Linda talking less and less. Going down to the sea L SEPTEMBER OCTOBER 1982 PAGE 39</page><page sequence="4">while she sleeps. Standing in the cold water to my mouth just before morning. Linda sayihg late in the day we should eat now or it would be too dark to wash the dishes. She going out quietly afterward to scream into the wind from the ocean. Coming in. Lighting the lamps. Like the work of Louise Gl?ck, although for reasons having to do with off-handed and sidling mannerisms rather than (as in Gl?ck's poetry) because he has struck through to the silence on the other boundary of words, Jack Gilbert's Monolithos poems have reached a point where he must maneuver into new technical terrain to elaborate the promise he has, even in exile continued to exhibit. With The Southern Cross, by Charles Wright, we move into a much richer tropic. To the poetic cosmos we have observed so far, Wright adds two new kinds of environment, civilization as manifest in gem-like labyrinths like Venice, and lush quasi-savage blossoming vege tation of the sort that flourishes in latitudes where the southern cross is prominent in the night sky. Furthermore, Wright could be said to de pend absolutely on place, to work from it, in his crucial journeys, traced in so many poems, from rest to intense engagement with ethereal thres holds, tints of light, floating gestures?"an incandescent space," he says in one poem, "where nothing distinct exists,/And nothing ends, the days sliding like warm milk through the clouds." I quote these lines be cause they make explicit the poet's preference for the hazy, the milky, the upper-atmospheric; these are the trappings of his transcendent states of infancy. I use the term "infancy" advisedly. Charles Wright's apotheoses are characteristically visions of a presexual, light-suffused mist, the matrix of dreams and the medium of serenity and soaring, of effortless float ing, a rising-upwards that is very much more pleasant but far less emo tionally pressing than the sultry risings and impassioned upwellings and poolings in the poetry of Louise Gluck. Whereas she clearly returns to the profound tensions and jealousies of childhood, Wright explores an almost fetal suspended state just prior to birth. The superbly am bitious title poem ends in Pickwick, Tennessee, at the moment the nar rator is born: Somewhere in all that network of rivers and roads and silt-hills A city I'll never remember, its walls the color of pure light, Lies in the August heat of1935, In Tennesseee, the bottom land slowly becoming a lake. It lies in a landscape that keeps my imprint Forever, and stays unchanged, and waits to be filled back in. Someday I'll find it out And enter my old outline as though for the 1st time, And lie down, and tell no one. The desire to return to the softer outline he had at the beginning before experience marked him with choices and errors and the simple banalities of repetition emerges over and over again in Wright's new volume. As he travels backward in time toward his origins, he is also preparing for his death, expressed as a return to infant dependency. Here he has moved as far as Knoxville in 1938: / hope the one with the white wings will come. I.hope the island of reeds is as far away as I think it is. When I get there, I hope they forgive me if the knot I tie is the wrong knot. ("Hawaii Dantesca") One of the voices Wright invokes is Dante's, from those two books of the Comedy whose imagery and exempla are paler and less violent than the Inferno's. As epigram to The Southern Cross, Wright quotes Statius's homage to Vergil from the twenty-first canto of Purgatory, who rue fully admits that his love of the Master had enflamed him to treat a shade as a solid thing. In the excerpt from "Hawaii Dantesca" above, the narrator puts off for the little island of reeds of Purgatory i where Ca to advises Dante to be cleansed. And in the beautiful "Laguna Dan tesca," the poet slips off into the great sea of being of the beginning of the Paradiso, piloting his little bark after Dante's into the intermittent cloud dazzle that Dante describes as lucid, dense, solid, and polished (Par. ?) and in which he sees pale, pearly faces he thinks are mirrored from behind him, so faint are they (Par. ui). One of these belongs to Pic carda Donati,' a nun of the Clares, who having told her story begins (while singing "Ave Maria") to vanish like something heavy falling through deep water. Here is Charles Wright's working of some of these images: / want, like a little boat, to be isolate, slipping across one element Toward the horizon Like a rock, or some other heavy thing, I want to descend through clear water Endlessly, disappearing as she did, Line after leached line, into the lunar deeps. ("Laguna Dantesca") Although Piccarda was not atoning, being already elevated among the blessed even at a low level, Wright's lyrical "I" returns reflexively to the idea of cleansing as he views his projected sinking through "Line after leached line," as if the medium allowed him to filter out the taint of?not wrongdoing or weakness; the realm of this writer is utterly un touched by judgment?but consciousness itself. Wright reads Dante with the same selective lens he uses for Eugenio Montale and for the third great mentor of the current poems, William Blake; that is, he is intrigued by the tissues of their imagery at its softest, and by their treatment of nostalgia, but not by their anagogy. It is a very selective reading of both Dante and Blake that would ignore both allegories and discourses; and without the earnest attention of an elegist like Montale to other human beings, nostalgia becomes senti mental. In Wright, however, the anagoge is always self?one who hap pens to be a sensitive lover of beauty, to be sure; and a maker of elegant artifacts, without question; but occasionally an artist, possibly among false spirits (this I can't judge), with decidedly false professions and poses. The long failed sequence "Homage to Paul Cezanne" so abounds in misjudgements in tone and in tact that the reader is apt to forget that the painter Cezanne is supposed to be central, although there is little in his paintings that the mediumistic dramatizations of these eight poems have touched. Wright posits a community of dead; unlike Dante's or Montale's dead, these are specific neither to history nor to the poet's own life, they are a vague body, with no will or direction, that can be made to function like rain, like color, like darkness, like moods, like clothing, like sounds, like premonition. Hence the dead are the collective noun for lugubrious poetic feeling. Some of the personifications are quite funny: "Spring picks the locks of the wind"; "spaces/In black shoes, their hands clasped"; "The dead are constant in/The white lips of the sea." Some of the stage props the dead must carry around are also awkwardly amusing: "We filagree and we baste./But what do the dead care for the fringe of words,/Safe in their suits of milk?" Sometimes it may be simply a garbled phrasing that mars the myth-making: "under their fingers an unreturnable dirt"; in another poem, "the bears/Amble across the heavens, serene as black coffee." But there is the more gen eral problem of framework and intention raised by the "Homage" and applicable to other poems as well; the poet fails to make his choices of subject, diction, and tone seem always necessary; at times they do not even sound deliberate. On occasion I have considered that Wright as a craftsman with words, tropes, and sentences is without a built-in censor. He inflates his poetics into mere shapeless benevolence. Nothing is judged, nothing rejected, nothing refused admittance to the poem. What William Blake offered in 1789 as a negative representation of timidity: "Ah! Thel is like a wat'ry bow, and like a parting cloud; "Like a reflection in glass; like shadows in the water; "Like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infant's face; "Like the dove's voice; like transient day; like music in the air. "Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun: "I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place?" (The Book of Thel) Charles Wright exports, two centuries later, as a positive and strong representation of life, I think because for him behavior does not count, nor is religion a living possibility. Hence he can devote himself to the composition of emphemeral structures about ephemereal tints and passing, filmy, essentially solitary manifestations: The clouds over Bardolino dragging the sky for the dead Bodies of those who refuse to rise, Their orange robes and flaming bodices trolling across the hills No sound but the wind from anything under the tired, Italian stars . . . And the voice of the waters, starting its ghostly litany. River of bloom-bursts from the moon, of slivers and broken blades from the moon In an always-going-away of glints . . . ("The Southern Cross") The complex alliterations and the mimetic river music in the last three lines above are masterful, and the flow, throughout the passage, of a great sensual appetite projecting bodily presence?this, too, is a power ful and lovely effect. But the idea of trolling bodices is at once awkward and obscure. Perhaps to read Charles Wright is to accommodate oneself uncomplainingly to these flaws, alongside which, in "Virginia Reel" and in "The Southern Cross" (especially the passages about Venice in all seasons), we frequently have descriptive poetry of great visual power and verbal loveliness. Isuggested that Charles Wright may lack a self-censoring mechanism for his poetry; that he needs to apply standards for determining when a metaphor or colloquialism is or is not apropos; that in consequence of failing to do so, and given his interest in ghostly landscapes and a con L 4 PAGE 40 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="5">sciousness entranced, his poems are sometimes apt to be indiscriminately hospitable, undiscerning, childlike. In respect to the lack of a censor on the one hand, the welcoming of the childlike on the other, the next two poets, Mona Van Duyn and Ted Kooser respectively, share some of Wright's leanings. Neither, however, is trying to sound like him, nor to look at a world that resembles his, although Ted Kooser may seem closer in feeling simply because he makes such blithe use of the personi fication and diminutives of fairy tale. He may also suffer from a problem that plagues scores of poets, that of not being able to relinquish a clever trick, of writing the same poem in the same way many times over. For Mr. Kooser, "the same way" means the establishment of a set of equiv alences between the ineffable or liminal and the realistic, using highly literal machinery on the side of the illustration. Then he will prick the vehicle, push a button on the literal machinery somewhere, and start the poem capering off in a new direction, until finally the whole engine, hoarse with new emotion, crosses the last line into white space with great shudders and knocks. "Just Now," for example, is a very recent poem by Ted Kooser from the summer 1982 Georgia Review; it is about the past and memory (the tenor) as a street on which the lamps are lit, one per year (the vehicle). The lamps get smaller as you look back down the street, that is, memory falters, fades, as one tries to focus on one's earliest traces. The lamps stretch away "leading back to the one faint point/at the start, like a star." Thus far is the hypothesis, the given: a compact and unassuming metaphor. Kooser now finely extends the metaphoric possibilities by setting the vehicle in motion. He looks again at the small lamp-circles of time: So many of them are empty now, those circles of roadside and grass. In one, the moth of some feeling still flutters, unspoken, the cold darkness around it enormous. ("Just Now") Into the pre-established metaphoric relation between lamps and years, the poet inserts the little moth of feeling (perhaps an undeclared love, or a mute fear for the future); the background is sufficiently clear and pointed that he can begin to put pressure on it to yield more than a mere vibration in the static scaffolding holding tenor up across vehicle. The moth is traditionally freighted with pathos (recall Gascoigne's "The scorched fly, which once hath 'scaped the flame,/Will hardly come to play again with fire,/Whereby I learn that grievous is the game/Which follows fancy dazzled by desire"); in Kooser's poem, this automatic sym pathetic identification with the moth is sharpened by the attribute of "feeling," by the pitiful fluttering, and by the cold enormous dark that looms against it on all sides. The lyric "I" regrets not persons of the past but feelings about persons, or rather, he pities himself as holder of one-time feelings even as they are about to be extinguished in his limited present attention. "Just now," he says, I could see only so far; further ' on into the present of my life, even this last moth will have died in the frost, and I will have moved beyond this into new emptiness that does not recall it. The poem's last line rises to a great throbbing close as the definition possible in words ceases its operation. In his Hudson Review article of winter 1980, which first brought Ted Kooser to my attention, critic Dana Gioia deftly quotes from the poems in which the diminutive fantasy is most strongly at work. Although they have their charm, Mr. Gioia has done a fine job of representing them and hence I need not. But I would suggest a division among the kinds of Kooser's talent into elfin personification (in poems in which much jumping about, that is mixed metaphor, is common) and more weighty metaphor about/for persons (in poems in which there will tend to be a much more controlled blurring between tenor and vehicle). The very early poem "There Is Always a Little Wind" is a good example of a poem that starts out as the standard sort of Kooser landscape, about the odd prevalence of wind in country cemeteries even when the rest of the country stands under air "still as a barn." Old-maidish, stringy cedars border the tombstones, taking gusts of air into their "aprons" "like sheaves of wheat" (a transition flawed by mixed metaphor, a flaw that might be alleviated by another middle stanza). Despite the weak link, there is still a powerful natural association moving between the breathless still barns (of air) above the countryside in stanza one, and the final stanza in the cemetery, where the barn of air is humming with movement and you can hear above you the warm and regular sweep of wheat being cut and gathered, the wagons creaking, the young men breathing at their work. ("There Is Always a Little Wind") From their breathing exertions, by implication, the little wind over the graveyard has arisen. Furthermore, the exertions emanate from those who are now buried there, or who like the old aunts are aging and about tobe. "Sunday Morning" is the most extended and successful use of the method of building the image up, extrapolating from likeness to unlike ness, then weaving the now-distant country of analogy back into the frame of the present and near-at-hand. As W.K. Wimsatt showed in his two famous essays in the late 1940s, the strategy of importing peripheral implication from the realm of the metaphor back into the logical reality of the present scene is characteristic of Romantic poems like Words worth's "Solitary Reaper" and Coleridge's sonnet "To the River Otter."* The result of the operation seems, says Wimsatt, to lie outside both vehicle and tenor. Ted Kooser opens his celebration of bourgeois apotheosis with.a dove said to be singing by, so to speak, "touching her keyboard." This trope of the delicate woman at the virginals is adum brated between the starker shades of two nature analogies, the "gal axies" of mapl$ seeds and the scattered "whitecaps" of the Sunday paper Now it is June again, one of those leafy Sundays drifting through galaxies of maple seeds. Somewhere, a mourning dove touches her keyboard twice, a lonely F, and then fails silent Here in the house the Sunday papers lie in whitecaps over the living-room floor. ("Sunday Morning") The last likeness (to waves) floats up to our gaze the newspaper page on which are published wedding announcements; these harden from water into glass ("the bridal page, that window of many panes"); this glass then melts to fluid again, both in the sense of suggesting a watery trans parency and in the sense that the lens itself grows tissue-like, soft, moonlit, transformed by affection. The galaxies now wink between star lit clouds; Kooser arranges both these heavenly figures for the pleasure of the young women who "smile t? see the heavens stopped for them": Here in the house the Sunday papers lie in whitecaps over the living-room floor. Among them floats the bridal page, that window of many panes, reflecting, black and white, patches of sky and puffs of starlit cloud becoming faces. On each bright brow the same light falls, the nuptial moon held up just out of sight to the left The brides all lift their eyes and smile to see the heavens stopped for them. And love is everywhere. ("Sunday Morning") Despite the cornball starry-eyed postures of the young brides-to-be in the studios, their expressions reveal something that touches the ob server with the warm reflex of their hopefulness. On this June Sunday there effortlessly arises, in both poet and world, an atmosphere of min gled music, worship, and nervous poignancy; and this atmosphere em braces, in the two nouns in which the dove and church converse, "thank fulness" and "astonishment": And love is everywhere. Cars that have all week lurched and honked with sour commuters are now like smooth canoes packed soft with families. A church bell strides through the green perfume of locust trees and tolls its thankfulness. The mourning dove, to her astonishment, blunders upon a distant call in answer. ("Sunday Morning") Despite the fact that, even here, the poet will jar loose a dusting of mixed metaphors (the bell striding through green perfume is simply infuriating!), he has in the poem as a whole made the banal world sig nify; discovered in the flat the extensive; made subtle the meagre and luridly commercial; and released from the diffuse and disconnected the bravely necessitous. Ted Kooser has also performed that subtlest of homages (in this case, to Stevens's far more rhetorical elegy of faith)? the poem that answers another's without wrangling or huffiness, with humility, while proposing an entirely different Weltanschauung. Mona Van Duyn is a poet both forcefully grim in confronting reality and formally grotesque. There is a quality about her most am bitious work that is perversely unpoetical, as if she were determined to suffer all over again the eclipse of stress by syllable-stress metre, and the emergence of blank verse from the overhanging eaves of rhyme. Thus she will posit an alternating rhyme scheme for pentameter quat rains and then do her best to make what results sound like untutored (not to mention unmetred) prose. The title poem of Letters from a Father shows the poet's parents during their last year (both died in 1980), the mother senile and incontinent, the father ailing and irascible. What brings father and daughter together in their letters now is birdwatching, or rather, bird feeding, to which the father is won over only with strenu ous effort on both their parts: You say you enjoy your feeder, I don't see why you want to spend good money on grain for birds and you say you have a hundred sparrows, I'd buy poison and get rid of their diseases and turds. These packed and battered quatrains are designed to render a gruff rustic's bedrock earnestness, but I do not find the method compelling as poetry. Van Duyn has given us indeed pitiable portraits of her parents, "The Concrete Universal" (1947) and "The Structure of Romantic Nature Imagery" (1949). SEPTEMBER OCTOBER 1982 PAGE 41</page><page sequence="6">and of her irreducibly unromantic childhood (though it may be that she simply remembers the cruel and ambiguous dullness of childhood with a clearer head than the rest of us do). But owing to autobiographical con fidences no reader can help noticing and being moved by, the poet corners us with the same threatening intensity that marked the ancient mariner. It would be inhumane to dismiss the suffering or the persons; but the title poem is not excused by the mimetic fallacy, merely organ ized by it. The blank-verse "Photographs" is less rough, whether because rhyme is no longer under attack, or because the poet-narrator is present in the scene, negotiating the descriptive and historical transitions that give a sense of continuing conscious life and sympathy when the father loses interest in one or another snapshot; the mother is in another sphere throughout. An interesting feature of the poem is what it reveals (or begins to) about the real demon in the daughter's youth: Expressive face I studied all my childhood to learn if I was wrong or right, kept or cast out Best cook in town, best seams tress?not enough. the lovely features never show her "nerves," the long years of dissatisfaction, the walks she took me on when I reachedadolescence and poured my hard ear full of my father's failings. ("Photographs") Van Duyn has also written an elegy for her mother, called "The Stream," which is one of her finest works. Composed in forty-five rapid running couplets, it recounts her last visit with her mother in the nurs ing home the week before her death. The poet doesn't balk at references to "peeing" and "dugs"; in fact she works the least decorous details into the main Freudian symbol patterns of the poem, the mother as the daughter's child, her mature features having shrivelled back against the body, and the diuretic flood of tears that, in the main metaphor of dowsing, is produced by grace from the ground. The mother apparently expressed love only seldom, but does so directly now, at the end of her life, in one of those lucid intervals peculiar to those who are failing fast. "What is love?" the poet asks; "Truly I do not know" Sometimes, perhaps, instead of a great sea, it is a narrow stream running urgently far below ground, held down by rocky layers, the deeds of father and mother, helpless soothsayers of how our life is to be, weighted by clay, the dense pressure of thwarted needs, the replay of old misreadings . . . ("The Stream") Above these hardened layers of possibility and mistake runs "another seeker" in scatterbrained, will-less fashion, moved by a dowsing-wand which bends, then lifts, dips, then straightens, everywhere, saying to the dowser, it is there, it is not there, and the untaught dowser believes, does not believe, and finally simply stands on the ground above, till a sliver of stream finds a crack and makes its way, slowly, too slowly, through rock and earth and clay. Here at my feet I see, after sixty years, the welling water?to which I add these tears. ("The Stream") The upwelling of water betokens expression and release; what was so long thwarted and misread is now sped and numinously transparent. And yet the language never becomes intrusively literary; the guise of naturalness is maintained and, especially here at the end, aggrandized. At the same time as the diction is "natural," the rhythms have rounded more flexibly and formally, like wild-looking vines, about the symmetri cal oak of the heroic pentameters. Technically speaking, she is using the favorite trick of Robert Frost, the folksy sound produced by two slacks in a row (trochaic and anapestic substitution both provide this in an iambic poem), which, instead of sounding rough, quick, or anapestic, be comes with clever handling the regular counterpoint-rhythm to the ab stract binary iambs. The resulting melody is well-suited to a speaker at once unpretentious in style and overbearing in feeling. Although "The Stream" earns my admiration, there is still about it something slightly forced, which does not arise in idler, less embattled poems. For example, "Moose in the Morning, Northern Maine" provides the old tenaciousness of subject (few poets are more dissatisfied with imagism, the languid aper9u, few better disciplined at tracking an im plication down); her totally wacky and off-kilter viewpoint; stemming from this, her skill at amalgamating poems out of widely disparate lan guages but in such a way that, although there is always some oscillation between low and high ("A ton of monarch,/munching, he stands"), the oscillation doesn't sound like a coat of old mythologies. The moose poem invokes old friends, fellow artists, the comedies of rustic discomfort, and the nervous avoidance the poet feels compelled to enact against her own hard-earned and pent-up need to make, while she can, anything and everything into a poem. After flagrantly tagging each danger zone and weak bridge, Van Duyn permits the moose to swim forward: The world is warming and lightening and mist on the pond dissolves into bundles and ribbons. At the end of my dock there comes clear, bared by the gentle burning, a monstrous hulk with thorny head, up to his chest in the water, mist wreathing round him. Grander and grander grows the sun until he gleams, his brown coat glistens, the great rack, five feet wide, throws sparks of light A ton of monarch, munching, he stands spotlit Then slowly, gravely, the great neck lowers head and forty pounds of horn to sip the lake. That is simply riveting free verse, not only wise and fierce, but faintly amused, as Van Duyn's best poems tend to be. I must refer to one last poem, the utterly engaging dissertation on Nero Wolfe's cuisine. Van Duyn like many poets is rather fixated upon the catalogue. What is always refreshing, about her work is that livid glare of self-knowledge: she knows she is tempted by lists and inven tories, linear recitations and the tapeworm of time. So she will turn to those of her avocations and expertises that permit her (as cookery does here) to indulge a weakness for recital as she emblazons it with wit. I recommend "A Reading of Rex Stout." The first poem in Katha Pollitt's Antarctic Traveller, called "Blue Window," is characterized by smooth junctures and easy speech melodies (qualities that help make the beautiful poem also pronounce able); by an effusion of feeling restrained by realism; and by a conscious ness disciplined so as to receive the overtures of the imagination with a calm demeanor. Furthermore, like many of the poems in the book, this is an urban poem, by which I mean neither worldly nor civic. Instead, Pollitt gracefully records the complicated rhythms of a sensibility in vigorated by large orders, architectural vistas, endlessly repeating grids, accidentally pleasing arrangements of lights that have been planted for utility rather than to give a far-off viewer pleasure. And she is, finally, attuned to the last seduction of a great city like New York? the suggestion of social complexity and cultivation that can rise, on oc casion, to the level of social harmony. In one poem the city becomes the metaphor for looking toward the future ("So many wide plazas, so many marble addresses!"); in another, urban elegance (a procession of French schoolgirls like irises; little palaces) is a metaphor for bright, high, clear weather ("I say, Amaze me, amaze me:/these boulevards are streaming./ I move through the light like light"). These urban responses form the implied, half-drawn-in background for many of this poet's most credible movements, like the self-projecting passion of "Blue Window," which begins: That longing you have to be invisible, transparent as glass, thin air that is what moves you certain times to tears watching the evening fill with city lights and the long dusty summer avenues rise weightless through the air and tremble like constellations in a sky so deep and clear you are your one desire, Oh, let me be that blue . . . The poem's second stanza is, then framed in the syntax of contrast and reversal (the other or second self; the contrai?y-to-fact phrasing "you would stream ... but"). Nevertheless, it is in fact this gesture of snap ping out of it or coming to which is illusory, and not the illusion of streaming out the window which is dispelled: It is your other, solitary self that calls you to the window where you stand dreaming in the dusk in an ecstasy of longing while your white apartment full of plants and pictures grows strange with shadows, as though under water. And in another moment you would stream out the window and into the sky like a breath? but it is almost too dark to see. In the next apartment a door is flung open Someone speaks someone's name. In addition to physical-spatial projection into evanescent distance, "Blue Window" also works to render the qualities of bright and dusky light, color, and ?ven the feeling of temperature, in a painterly way. In this Pollitt is like Wallace Stevens, but without his severe metaphysical angle and spareness of scene. Her eye is true and her feeling for com position nice. She includes here a suite of poems on Japanese painting; the last, on Taiga's painting of two old men reminiscing, is especially well done. And her painterly impulse plucks up its own pleasant nerve in this crisp autumnal: L J PAGE 42 THE AMERICAN POETRY REVIEW</page><page sequence="7">REVISIONS The following changes have been made in John Felstiner's essay, 'Translating Celan's Last Poem" which appeared in the July/August 1982 issue of APR: ?On page 24, column 1,12 lines from the bottom, it should read 44 'Todesfuge1 became a popular textbook piece in West Germany, and one teachers' guide advised sticking to the text lest 'student discussion deviate from the work of art to the persecution of the Jews.'

November, and still light stuns the big bay windows on West End Avenue, the park brims over with light like a bowl and on the river a sailboat quivers like a white leaf in the wind. ("November Fifth, Riverside Drive") This urban-scape uses formal groupings and accents at once composi tionally and in the verse patterns. This stanza is actually the inverted sestet of the sonnet, with the short line and several top-heavy enjamb ments contrasting, by almost marring, the pentameters, while the final line, more regular, and sharp in verbal and rhythmic edge, traces the visual accent mark, the distant sail. Pollitt here turns to account a truth known to many Romantic painters and poets alike, that a small vessel far out on the waves is a plangent image of the human soul. We are again reminded of this fact in her uncanny choice of "The Iceberg" for the cover, by the nineteenth-century American luminist Frederick Ed win Church. Katha Pollitt often reminds us that her imagination is supported by a medium that is fluid; this support is double, referring us both to her technical responses to the fluid medium of painting, and to the fluid vehicles of metaphors whose tenors are light, color, or brilliance. Meta phorically, of course, streams and pools are also necessarily the medium through which not merely light but thought, consciousness, and mem ory are borne into the present time. The extent to which the city park "brims over with light like a bowl" is also the extent to which thought is rising to the mind, memories to the recollection, and feeling to the or gans of release. Still upholding the two values of her "medium," the poet makes explicit the bond between art and feeling, a deepening of significance in one arena welling up spontaneously as an intensification in the other. In one of her best poems, "In Memory," Pollitt shifts her terms to ponder the old oxymoron of the mystics, a dark light. Now it is not mere physical light that over-brims the bowl of the park, but a dimming of all hues that fills and thickens the street on which the child skates: Over the years, they yve darkened, like old paintings or wainscotting in a damp house in the country, until now the streets where you roller-skated brim with twilight, your mother drinks morning coffee from a cup of shadows, and out in the garden, the hardest August noon is washed with a tender, retrospective blue? like woodsmoke, or the shade of an unseen lilac. ("In Memory") This dimming of the memory, although a subject hardly exempt from the almost reflexive self-pity that haunts any poet with the urge to write about memory, is not focused on the poet's childhood self, but on the mother with her cup of shadows, whose death has left behind these negative brilliancies, dark rivers of speechless communication. The eclipse of her mother in turn causes shadows to brood over the bright images in which the poet had been wont to forecast her own rise along "a rope of diamonds: permanent, flashing": the way discoloring varnish on a portrait little by little engulfs the ornate background? the overstuffed sofa, the velvet-and-gold festoons framing an elegant vista?but only deepens the calm and serious face. The speaking eyes. "In Memory" is a finely managed elegy, balanced, thoughtful, moving, contributing its luster to a coherent set of inclinations and associations in the rest of the volume, and establishing a high and interesting poetic standard for what we can hope will be decades of variation and growth. Although Worldly Hopes makes no overt announcement of a philo sophical "system," A.R. Ammons is clearly at ease with the jargon of logic and category. Terms like "Augmentations," "Differentials," "Volitions," "Epistemology," and "Subsumption" occur in his titles, and the texts themselves throw off the occasional theoretical nubbin, "replications," "substance," "paradigms." Even more than in shop talk, however, the poems in Ammons's seventeenth volume announce their allegiance to metaphysics in arguing the relation of the poet to himself as pure being, to his creation as the embodiment of being, and to the world as the matter against which his creation is also the reaction or recoil. Images of the natural world are positive, of the human world negative; nature's substances, however dense and enveloping, allow the intangible to be seen; while human existence embrutes and clouds it self in the very exercise of its defining traits, speech and feeling. Thus "Epistemology," a poem that treats emotion as an inevitable distortion of knowing, could just as well be entitled "Ontology," because it then links the distortion with the visible reality of the world. The poem is partitioned and argued much like William Blake's "Poison Tree," which begins, "I was angry with my friend;/I told my wrath, my wrath did end./I was angry with my foe:/I told it now, my wrath did grow." Just as Blake's truism evolves a pictorial tree whose apple of suppressed i wrath poisons the foe, Ammons's truism (the bit untold) grows into a I "posture" so enormous it soon cannot be distinguished from everything that is the case: MFA PROGRAM for WRITERS WARREN WILSON COLLEGE fc 12-day residencies on campus include readings, lectures, workshops, classes and manuscript conferences 6-month non-resident semester study projects in poetry and fiction Semester Faculty STEPHEN DOBYNS LOUISE GL?CK DAVID HUDDLE HEATHER McHUGH MARILYNNE ROBINSON MICHAEL RYAN ELLEN BRYANT VOIGT Residency Guests Rosellen Brown John Casey Robert Hass Stanley Kunitz Thomas Lux Lisel Mueller Steve Orlen Eve Shelnutt Elizabeth Spencer Winter Residency January 2-14, 1983 For more information, please write: Michelle Blake Simons Director, MFA Program Warren Wilson College Box 400 Swannanoa, North Carolina 28778 (704) 298-3325 - I SEPTEMBER/OCTORSR1982 PAGE 43</page><page sequence="8">EPISTEMOLOGY A bit of truth told pops its pip and falls small into its (if bitter) consequence but the bit untold avoided collects about it networks bindings of disguise &amp; going around till, an enormous posture, it can't be identified solved or made to disappear &amp; so by recalcitrance &amp; complication comes to represent the world truly ours. As befits the topic of secrecy, the oral imagery is commanding: bit (bite), told (speak), pip1 (peep, cheep, pipe), pip2 (seed, apple, cf. pippin), and pop (therapeutic verbal explosion, cf. pop off). By echoing the sounds of bit, bitter, its, pip, and pop, the later alliterations of plosives and dentals and the short i's continue to echo the original failure of speech long after the result has obtained. The bit, "by/recalcitrance &amp;/complication," at last matches up to the only world we can recognize. So much for the helpless results of psychology: it creates an unbreath ably stuffed and stuffy atmosphere, cramming the world with objects of fear and aggressive inclination. Ammons responds to these impulses with what he phrases in his ars poetica ''Scribbles/* "grievances of avoidance.'' His prevalent landscapes are those of emptiness, vacuity, and erasure, and the poet himself takes part in the housecleaning. "My endorsing song," he writes in "Calling/' "blocks out/to blot out." The success of poesy is then measured not only by reduction to flattened negativity, but also by kinaesthetic access or transport upwards into another spiritual fabric: "my self-endorsing song, flattened/snaking its way out/reaching to weave into its rise/' Like a huge protean macrame, the poetic creation imaged by Ammons weaves in order to unweave itself; in terms of aesthetic debate, the poem as artifact unravels before the gestures of the poet as singer and solitary perceiver. In keeping with the reverence in which he holds occasion, the poet re solves many of his texts by consuming them.

These metaphors, in context, are stamped with Ammons's own unique signature, combining as they do a kind of heatedness and satyr-like ardor with an equal measure of cool gauzy abstraction. Undermining any wholehearted aesthetic of the sensuous, Ammons is also attracted by the via negativa of the mystic, the hermit, the renouncer. Both of these temperaments, the manic and the entranced, work to define the religious spirit in this brief poem: PROVIDENCE To stay bright as if just thought of earth requires only that nothing stay The poet moderates the one extreme of erasure (the negative way, in substantiality, vacancy) by bracketing it with the other extreme of in vention (mental scintillation, metallic body). Another way to express this bracketing would emphasize how the writer here de-romanticizes the creator's role by removing his props and toys and toils and things. Although together these two gestures?debunking the daedal and buff ing up the ascetic?are at cross purposes, either by itself would be worth less, whether over- or underexpressive of the truth. Thus the mentally brilliant vehicle (a shiny new thought world) has an organic tenor (it is earth who requires), which acts to soften and mystify those formerly clear-cut oppositions. I would also note how Ammons's lineation of the poem reflects the play between divisiveness and mysterious hovering. The way the lines are broken is a very deliberate registering of the constant doubling that occurs in the theme of "Providence," by perching the tiny word-pairs together on the same rungs of their cage, regardless of their grammati cal species. New, short-lived grammatical species are thereby produced. For example, bright as suggests a comparative noun to follow, bright as X, but in fact the syntax pulls bright back to line 1 ("To stay bright") while it casts as forward to its complement in lines 3 and 4 ("as if just thought of"). The split allegiance to syntax versus line creates the hovering counterpoint so crucial, as Charles O. Hartman has shown, to free verse.* "Epistemology," the first Ammons poem quoted above, il lustrates a yet more extreme use of the free-verse line to truncate speech particles from each other. This truncation calls attention to the bracket ing effect of the verse line, so that like briefly embraces unlike ("told pops," "till, an," "solved or made"), as well as calling attention to the "rhyming" effects that keep phrases whole or balance like with like ("and falls/small," "(if bitter)," "but the bit"). On these narrow free verse plateaus, Ammons convenes his subjects, from the frolicsome to the obsure; the lines at which he draws the knot tightest are in roman: what's left from what I was won't turn my way ("Lost &amp; Found) My big round yew can stand a gust into a million presences: too many needles to get through to get through except drift through . . . ("Night Chill") And finally, a locution I can only just glimpse as it fades, about a drop let of water that after plashing down and racing the shallows is at last pleased to eddy aside, nothing of all but nothing's curl of motion spent. ("Design") In a poem like "Design," it seems to me that Ammons celebrates the lawfulness of nature (nothing has been spent) as he indulges his own de light in the intricately fashioned expression of what is fleeting. Unlike Robert Frost, whose sonnet "Design" posits a nature both ghoulish and fatal, Ammons has retracted his claws. But then there is his obeisance to the cosmic winter Romantic transport, "Augmentations in Early March," which is characterized by the eerie cacophany of skreaking and cracking and freezing that one also finds in The Prelude I. 434 ff. (the ice-skating interlude), in "Mont Blanc," 11. 100-120, in Frost's "Birches," and in Howard Nemerov's new "Christmas Storm." Wallace Stevens's mournful jangle is audible here as well. Ammons's trees are Hartman, Free Verse: An Essay on Prosody published last year by Princeton University Press. Intelligent and clear, it is the best book I know on this sub ject. I am indebted to his analytical method throughout the discussion of Ammons.

(" Augmentations in Early March") I am at once made irritable by the hint of the clique, and at the same time charmed by that temporal hitch that points up the imminent mi grations of spring. In the vein of influence I may prefer the more occa sional jeu like "Rainy Morning/' which, while it does not sustain as long as Stevens will the soaring of the imagination, still rescues its small figure from the perceptual ground: RAINY MORNING Sometimes the ridge across the way transluminous emerges above the mist and squares and detached rondures of vapory ground with dairy barns and old trees break out afloat separated in high lyings. This is a poem strikingly American; I cannot imagine a poet of any other nation reaching for just these effects, the casually domestic personifica tion that is yet not childish; the effortlessly lyrical neologism ("trans luminous1'); the quiet syntactic knotting of line 4 (at the first and); and the marvelous substrate of diluvian suggestion. In making us by his sly clarities again mindful of our traditions and cognizant, as we read him, of the skills of verbal attention, A.R. Ammons causes compliments to shine all around.</page></plain_text>
