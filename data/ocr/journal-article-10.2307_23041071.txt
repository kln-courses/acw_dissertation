<plain_text><page sequence="1">Chiron, Melampus and Tisiphone: myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum by R. J. Clare Virgil's description of the Noric plague at the end of Georgics 3 begins with a sequence of powerful and evocative verbs. Once the miseranda tempestas arrives (478-9), its effects are threefold and devastating (3.480-1): et genus omne neci pecudum dedit, omne ferarum, corrupitque lacus, infecit pabula tabo.1 3.480-1. Triadic sequences of verbs occur frequently in Virgil's plague description, to mark moments of special emphasis. For example, the device is used at the opening of each of the two major set pieces: the effects of the plague upon the horse (498-500) and ox (515-17), principal representatives of the animal population.2 The climactic moment of the plague description is also marked by such a sequence: death is personified in the figure of Tisi phone issuing forth from the underworld, driving Disease and Dread before her (3.551-3): saevit et in lucem Stygiis emissa tenebris pallida Tisiphone Morbos agit ante Metumque, inque dies avidum surgens caput altius effert. Virgil has prepared carefully for this cosmic aberration whereby denizens of hell are afforded free range over the supernal regions. In the lead-up to Tisiphone's triumph the various natu ral regions have been shown incapable of saving or protecting their respective charges (541-7): the sea washes up on the edge of the shore the remains of dead marine creatures; a snake is no longer safe even in its lair; air is noxious to the birds, who fall from the sky. But this survey of natural habitats also corresponds to the trad itional mythical divisions of the cosmos.3 And, in the proem to the Georgics, Octavian-as-deity was offered his choice of dominion from just such a range of cosmic regions: the only zone to be avoided was the underworld. Here, at this particular point in the 95</page><page sequence="2">R. J. Clare plague's progress, the subversion of the natural order is com plete and is expressed by the Virgilian imagination as, quite liter ally, a cosmic subversion: the underworld dominates over the other zones. Before Tisiphone may emerge into the light of day, however, one final matter requires to be dealt with. Though inanimate nature is defeated by the force of the plague, thereby condemn ing wildlife to death, it remains theoretically possible that sal vation for those animals which are mankind's special responsi bility (i.e. livestock) may still be won by human ingenuity. For the plague's victory to be complete the defeat of man must needs be emphatically recorded. In the first part of the plague description Virgil depicts a largely passive human reaction to the disaster. The poet concen trates on two specific role-models to make his point. The vates is nonplussed at a very early stage. Inability to conduct a regular sacrifice means that the priest is unable to perform his duties: nec responsa potest consultus reddere vates (491). Likewise the arator, confronted with the death of one of his oxen, is forced to admit defeat, unyoking the bull which is still living and abandoning the plough stuck in the ground (517-9). Thus the inadequacies of both religio and labor have been revealed. Compared to the power of the plague the aphorisms in primis venerare deos and labor omnia vicit, which have dominated the early part of the poem, have nothing to offer. Yet man per sists with the practice of religio and the application of labor. From line 53Iff a more dogged human response to prevailing circum stances evolves, by which the necessary activities of life are not suspended, but rather modified to fit the situation. Sacrificial rites are still performed in honour of Juno, although wild oxen are used to convey her car. Also, because it is no longer feasible to turn the earth with the help of plough and oxen, the farmer makes do with using mattocks, with planting the seed by means of his finger-nails, with dragging along wagons by the strength of his own neck (534-6). These agricultural practices are obviously debased, a cruel parody of efficient farming, but the variety of his improvisation shows that the human agent is not yet without resource. Here is the essence of labor adapted to counter unique circumstances (cf. duris. . . .in rebus 1.146). The effort rep resented by the farmer's response is emphasised by another tri ple sequence of main verbs in successive lines (rimantur 534, infodiunt 535 and trahunt 536). 96</page><page sequence="3">Myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum This desperate struggle to maintain a semblance of normality in human existence is immediately undermined by a vignette highlighting abnormal behaviour in the extreme on the part of the animal population (537-40). We have seen the breakdown of the relationship of cooperation between farmer and oxen. Now the viewpoint shifts to consider a corresponding breakdown in a relationship of antagonism: the distinctions between hunter and hunted are becoming meaningless. Next (541-47) comes the sur vey of natural regions discussed above. Finally, before the appearance of Tisiphone, Virgil offers one more look at man kind's attempts to alleviate the effects of the plague (3.548-50): praeterea iam nec mutari pabula refert, quaesitaeque nocent artes; cessere magistri, Phillyrides Chiron Amythaoniusque Melampus. This represents a catalogue of human failure. To begin with, a change of fodder provided for the animals proves ineffective. The use of the verb mutare is calculated: it was the agricultural goddess Ceres who first introduced farmers to the benefits of 'exchanging' one type of fodder for another (Liber et alma Ceres vestro si munere/Chaoniam pingui glandem mutavit arista, 1.7-8). Now it is of no avail to resort to that strategy. Here also is recorded the failure of the artes. This may be inter preted on more than one level. First, that which was found to be the case earlier on in the plague description (i.e. 509f) is now formally stated: in a purely veterinary sense there are no rem edies to be found for this disease. In other words the artes in question in line 549 are the medicae artes. But, of course, the concept of artes also possesses a wider resonance running through the poem as a whole. The artes are those various skills which mankind brings to bear on any given problem, the build ing-blocks of the Age of Jupiter (1.122, 1.133, 1.145). As was the case with labor, their failure implies that the moral framework justified by the theodicy of book 1 is invalidated. The association of the noun artes with the verb nocent is particularly jarring. In Georgics 1 the theodicy digression derives from an attempt to explain why various pests (119-21 and note in particular nocet, line 121, juxtaposed to pater ipse) impinge upon the success of hard work (labores, 118) and experience (experti, 119). The artes are supposed to tip the balance in the farmer's favour, or at least</page><page sequence="4">R. J. Clare redress the balance, but certainly not turn out to be a source of harm in themselves. The failure of the artes is accompanied by the departure of the magistri, Chiron, son of Philyra and Melampus, son of Amythaon. The importance of this moment has been surprisingly and seriously underestimated by critics. As will be shown below, Virg il's deployment of Chiron and Melampus constitutes an integral part of the significance of the plague episode. Also, the figure of Chiron is crucial to the interpretation of the plague in the overall context of the Georgics and in the context of book 4 in particular. The most obvious reading of Chiron and Melampus is comp lementary to a medical interpretation of quaesitaeque nocent artes: they are "renowned physicians".4 In the best recent commentary on the Georgics Thomas5 engages in strict demythologization of the scene created by Virgil. He comments on line 550 as follows: a poetic way of putting it: not the mythical figures themselves, but their contemporary representatives. Chiron, the son of Cronus and Philyra, is famed for his skill in medicine as early as Homer, and Melampus cured the women of Argos of their madness. The problem with such a reading is that it is too scientific, too rational. It is generally agreed among critics that the aim of Virg il's plague narrative has never been to offer a dispassionate, scientific account of pestilence to the reader.6 On the contrary, the poet's tone is intense and emotional, a mixture of realism and imagination. The mythological content of the plague account is an integral part of this strategy.7 Just as there ought not to be any implied contradiction in accepting that Tisiphone is a symbolic representation of pestilence, yet at the same activat ing all of the artistic and mythological potential offered by the image of a Fury emerging from hell to wreak havoc, in other words reading the scene as if she is present, so too the mythologi cal resonance of Chiron and Melampus must be explored and exploited to the full. Only in this way may we understand the full implications of cessere magistri i.e. when we ask ourselves why the magistri concerned are identified as Chiron and Melampus rather than identified with Chiron and Melampus. To this end a brief survey of previous appearances of Chiron and Melampus in classical literature will be of help.8 Obviously the medical qualifications of the pair must be the starting-point. As Thomas has indicated in his note, the centaur Chiron is 98</page><page sequence="5">Myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum famed for his powers of healing. In Iliad 4 Machaon tends the wounded Menelaus with &lt;J)dpfj.aKa which were handed down to his father by Chiron. Towards the end of Iliad 11 Eurypylus appeals for medical help from Patroclus, knowledge which Patroclus has learned from Achilles, who in his turn was taught by the centaur. At this point in the Iliad Chiron is referred to as SiKaioTcmx; KevTaupwv (832),9 "most righteous of the centaurs". For the purpose of Virgil's Noric plague it is no surprise then that Chiron should be a powerful symbol of healing. There is also his status as a centaur to be considered. Chiron is half-horse, half-man. Throughout book 3 Virgil has consistently employed anthropomorphic language.10 If anyone is likely to be sympath etic to the distress of the animals, it will surely be someone who is part beast himself. Like Chiron, Melampus is an appropriate figure to be fighting the effects of an animal plague. One of his mythical attributes is an ability to understand the language of birds and beasts.11 Also, in Eclogue 6 an allusion is made to the story of the daughters of Proetus, driven mad by Hera and made to believe that they are cows. This madness was eventually cured by Melampus, a tale apparently told in the Hesiodic Catalogue as reconstructed from the note by Probus on Eclogue 6.48.12 But the gift of healing is neither the sole nor indeed the pri mary characteristic associated with these personages. In Chiron's case a much more fundamental mythical attribute is his consist ent and recurring role in Greek literature as a teacher or father surrogate. Virgil makes a calculated reference to the centaur as Phillyrides Chiron. The earliest designation of Chiron in Greek literature as Phillyrides comes in Hesiod's Theogony (1001-2), the context being his bringing up (eTpecj)e) of Medeus, son of Medea and Jason.13 This is but one of a series of Hesiodic references to Chiron fulfilling the role of tutor to a famous mythical figure. In the Catalogue (MerkelbaclVWest fr. 40) Chiron is responsible for the rearing of Jason, while fr. 204.87f refers to his care of Achilles. Pindar in Nemean 3.52-8 presents a litany of Chiron's students (transl. Bowra): Deep-counselling Cheiron Nursed Jason inside his stone dwelling, And Asklapios after him, And taught him the use of medicine with gentle hands. In time he found a wedding For Nereus' bright-bosomed daughter; 99</page><page sequence="6">R. J. Clare He cherished her noble sone for her, and exalted His spirit in all things fitting One of the subject-areas in which Chiron provides instruction for his charges is in the art of medicine. In the passage quoted above Pindar includes Asclepius in the list of Chiron's pupils. Ascelpius is also mentioned in Pythian 3, where the prayer is for the resurrection of Chiron, Chiron who is long dead, Chiron who reared Asclepius (line 5). But the education offered by the centaur also seems to be of a more general, all-embracing kind. Pindar tells us in the excerpt quoted above that in his education of Achilles Chiron engaged in "bracing his spirit with all things fitting" (ev dp^iivoiai Traai av^ou). Xenophon's disquisition On Hunting says that Chiron "had pupils in venery and other noble pursuits" (|ia0T)Ta! Kwriyeaitov Te Kai eTepuv KaXwv14) before going on to name no less than twenty-one famous mythi cal figures who were Chiron's students, in some instances fathers and sons e.g. Peleus and Achilles, Nestor and Antilochus. In the case of Melampus, at a very early stage we come across the idea of knowledge being handed down from one generation to another. At Odyssey 15.225ff the genealogy of the seer Theocly menus is delineated. He is directly descended from Melampus, and it is implied that Theoclymenus' powers of prophecy are hereditary. It is with prophecy that the name of Melampus is most fre quently linked. As well as being an ancestor of Theoclymenus, he appears (without being named) in Odyssey 11, where the story of his attempt to steal the cattle of Iphiclus is narrated. Mel ampus is glossed as a "blameless seer" (navTic; dfujfiwv, 291) and eventually secures his release from imprisonment by "revealing all the oracles" (0eacJ)aTa TrdvT' eiuovTa, 297). The prophetic persona of Melampus is also in evidence in the Hesiodic corpus. A non-surviving poem in three books known as the Melampodia15 seems to have had as its theme the exploits of famous seers e.g. Calchas, Teiresias and (presumably) Melampus himself. Also, a scholium attached to Apollonius Rhodius arg. 1.118 recounts a non-extant part of the Megalai Eoiai, whereby Melampus, who was very dear to Apollo (&lt;j&gt;i\TaTO&lt;; oiv tw 'AttoXXwvl16), acquires his prophetic powers. The scholium further implies that the Iphiclus story was told in Hesiod. Elsewhere, in Pindar's Paean 4,17 there is a reference to Melampus' gift of divination. 100</page><page sequence="7">Myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum Chiron possesses comparable powers of prophecy. A choral ode in the Euripidean play Iphigenia Aulidex® tells of the song of the centaurs at the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, in which Chi ron foretells the military prowess of Achilles. But it is in Pindar's ninth Pythian that Chiron's prophetic powers may best be seen at work. Here, in the most tactful manner possible (43ff), Chiron reveals a prophecy to the god Apollo concerning the future pro gress of the god's love for Cyrene. Such is the wealth and weight of mythological inference lying behind Virgil's deployment of Chiron and Melampus in the Plague of Noricum. Each of them possesses a special affinity with the animal world. Each possesses the power of healing. Each is blessed with a talent for prophecy. Each is associated with the handing on of knowledge or special powers to pupils or descendants. We return now to a more comprehensive examination of Georgics 3.549-50. Before they themselves are named, Chiron and Melampus are accorded the title of magistri, another term of manifold connotations. In the first place a magister is a chief or commander in a military context.19 Second, a magister can be someone who has responsibility in a religious sense.20 A third cluster of meanings pertains to education: a magister is an expert, possessing special knowledge or skill (teacher, instructor, master, tutor, guardian etc).21 Aside from line 549 the term magister occurs three times in Georgics 3. On first two occasions (118,185) it denotes horse trainers, the third time (445) shepherds who cure the disease of scab among sheep. Against the immediate background of book 3, therefore, it would seem legitimate to take magistri in 549 as referring in a general sense to those who are skilled in, and responsible for, the care of animals.22 But the mythological credentials of Chiron and Melampus mean that the aforementioned educational connotations of magister also come into play. The failure of Chiron and Mel ampus is a failure of education per se: The failure of medicine at the end is at the same time the failure of the acquired learning of civilization, 549-50 quaesitaeque nocent artes; cessere magistri/Phillyrides Chiron Amythaoniusque Melampus. Chiron has a reputation as a healer, but a more general status as a great educator and civilizer, above all as the moulder of Achilles' epic spirit. . . .23 101</page><page sequence="8">R. J. Clare To sum up, the fundamental incapacity of nature (in lines 541 47) to protect wild creatures is matched by a commensurate fail ure of man (in lines 548-50) to fulfil his responsibilities in respect of those animals which are his particular care. And, just as the failure of nature was represented in cosmic dimensions, so too is the powerlessness of the human effort deemed to be total. By employing the figures of Chiron and Melampus, Virgil records the final failure of any and all the stratagems which man could conceivably bring to bear. Furthermore, their mythological status as seers coupled with the religious connotations of magister may mean that Virgil intends the withdrawal of Chiron and Mel ampus to be even more highly charged: now there is no possi bility of any communication between gods and men in this situa tion. One is reminded of the earlier debacle at the sacrifice: nec responsa potest consultus reddere vates. . . . Nature abhors a vacuum and Tisiphone is well equipped to flourish amid such natural and intellectual chaos. Another useful approach to the reading of this portion of the plague episode is to follow Virgil's elevation of the Noric plague to the mythical level from line 549ff and examine the possibilities offered by the juxtaposition of Chiron and Melampus to Tisiphone. These practitioners of the artes are pitted against the Fury, who pos sesses (and indeed requires) but one function: the power to con trol the progress of Disease and Dread throughout the earth. The life and death struggle engendered by the plague becomes a battle between the forces of light and the forces of darkness. I employ the military metaphor advisedly, because the Virgilian language used has strong martial overtones. A magister, as we have seen, is a chief or commander and cessere promotes the image of a retreat, of military withdrawal: the commanders (unnamed until 550) yield in the face of the onset of. . . .something else. Like Chiron and Melampus, Tisiphone is also denoted by a military verb (saevit24) before she herself is named, a fact which has not gone unnoticed by Harrison: By using the withdrawal of two mythical heroes of Greek medi cine in this fashion, Virgil opens up the way for the contrasting entry of the Greek Fury, Tisiphone; and the contrast is more effective in Latin than in English, since Latin, with its more flex ible word-order, allows him to give first-word placing to the two contrasted verbs, cessere magistri (549); saevit Tisiphone (551f.).25 Given the above, it may be that line 552 is a debased rendition of a military triumph: pallida Tisiphone Morbos agit ante Metumque. 102</page><page sequence="9">Myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum If this is correct, the end of book 3 becomes still more interesting. The book begins with a Virgil's future poetic tri umph (3.17-18): illi victor ego et Tyrio conspectus in ostro centum quadriiugos agitabo ad flumina currus. and ends with a triumph of an altogether different kind. As I intimated previously, if we move outside the immediate confines of the plague episode and attempt to assess what is taking place at the end of book 3 in the light of wider thematic issues in the Georgics, Chiron immediately becomes a figure of major importance. Early in Georgics 3 oblique reference was made to the occasion of Chiron's conception. Saturn's sexual encounter with the nymph Philyra is interrupted by the arrival of his jealous wife Rhea and the god transforms himself into a horse to make good his escape. Virgil has deliberately para phrased an aition from the Argonautica (2.1231-41. Transl. Rieu):26 By nightfall they were passing the Isle of Philyra. This was where Cronos son of Uranus, deceiving his consort Rhea, lay with Phi lyra daughter of Ocean in the days when he ruled the Titans in Olympus and Zeus was still a child, tended in the Cretan cave by the Curetes of Ida. But Cronos and Philyra were surprised in the very act by the goddess Rhea. Whereupon Crosos leapt out of bed and galloped off in the form of a long-maned stallion, while Philyra in her shame left the place, deserting her old haunts, and came to the long Pelasgian ridges. There she gave birth to the monstrous Cheiron, half horse and half divine, the offspring of a lover in a questionable shape. The Hellenistic poet provides two pieces of information which remain unstated in the Virgilian allusion: he takes the story up to the moment of Chiron's birth, and he also places it in a temporal context: the occasion of Saturn's flirtation with Philyra takes place during the time that the child Zeus is hidden from his mal evolent father in the cave of Dicte (see Georgics 4.149ff). The centaur is, quite literally, born into the age of conflict between Saturn and Jupiter, and it is no accident that Virgil focusses upon the genealogy of Chiron at this juncture. When Chiron appears in the plague episode the poet wishes us to remember at once the identity of the centaur's father. He 103</page><page sequence="10">R. J. Clare ensures, in the most perverse fashion possible, that this will hap pen by giving us the name of Chiron's mother instead, a vital detail missing from the earlier anecdote of 92-4. There is literary precedent for the identification of Saturn with his son Chiron. Lycophron describes Cronus as KevTaupoq,27 simply because he is the father of the centaur. Another possible meaning of lines 549-50 is that both the Age of Jupiter (in the shape of the artes) and Saturnia regna (through the figure of Chiron) are vitiated. Chiron's departure is the sphragis to the parody of Saturnia regna acted out in lines 537-40:28 it makes not a jot of difference that his pedigree is what it is, that he is a centaur, the son of Saturn.29 The plague is inimical to all manifes tations of civilization — in its own uniquely destructive fashion Tisiphone's pestilence makes an irrelevance of the dissonance between the Age of Jupiter and Saturnia regna. The fine distinc tions of book 1 disappear before the hegemony of the Fury. There remains one final mythological nexus to be examined insofar as Chiron's part in the Georgics is concerned, namely the relationship between the centaur and Aristaeus. It is a link which is hinted at by the Virgilian text. Apart from Chiron and Mel ampus only one other named figure in the Georgics is identified as a magister, Aristaeus at 4.283. We have already seen from Pindar that Chiron advises Apollo as to the future of his love for Cyrene. These two are of course to be the parents of Aristaeus.30 But the link is even more pro nounced than that, and it is to Apollonius' Argonautica that we must once again turn. In that epic is narrated in detail the story of the rape of Cyrene by Apollo and the subsequent birth of the child Aristaeus (2.500-519. Transl. Rieu): Folk say that once upon a time there was a shepherdess called Cyrene who used to graze her flocks in the water-meadows of Peneus. She was a virgin and she prized her maidenhood. But one day when she was tending her sheep down by the river, Apollo carried her off from Haemonia and set her down among the nymphs of the land in distant Libya near the Myrtosian Mount. There she bore him a son called Aristaeus, who is remem bered now in the cornlands of Haemonia as the Hunter and the Shepherd. Cyrene herself was left in Libya by Apollo, who in token of his love made her a nymph and huntress with the gift of a long life. But he took his infant son away to be brought up by Cheiron in his cave. When the child had grown up the divine Muses found him a bride, taught him the arts of healing and prophecy, and made him the shepherd of all their flocks that 104</page><page sequence="11">Myth and meaning in Virgil's Plague of Noricum grazed on the Athamantian plain in Phthia, round Mount Othrys and in the valley of the sacred River Apidanus. There came a time, however, when Aristaeus migrated. The Dog-star Sirius was scorching the Minoan Islands from the sky, and the people could find no permanent cure for the trouble till the Archer-King Apollo put it in their heads to send for Aristaeus. Like Medeus, Jason, Achilles, Asclepius and all of the others, Aristaeus is also nurtured (icopeeaGat) by Chiron. As one would expect, both the gifts of healing (aKeaTOpiriy) and of prophecy (GeoTTpomcn;) are duly bestowed upon him, though as the endow ment of the Muses rather than directly from Chiron. Most intriguing of all, however, is the occasion pointed up by Apollon ius upon which the former art is put to the test. Aristaeus is summoned by the inhabitants of the Minoan isles as a defender against plague (XotpoO dXe^rp-fjpa).31 There seems little doubt but that the second half of Georgics 4 stands in some sort of opposition to the latter part of Georgics 3. In general terms the dialectic may be expressed quite simply: the third book of the poem culminates in relentless images of death, but the fourth book goes beyond death to a resurrection. The advent of the Noric plague is instantiated by a religious sacrifice which founders, whereas Aristaeus' quest to reanimate his hive concludes with the invention of a new religious observance, the ritual of bugonia. As we have seen, the Noric plague from the very outset imposes silence upon the figure of the vales, but the key element of Aristaeus' eventual success involves forcing a vates to speak. These are the most obvious oppositions between the two epi sodes, but yet both scenarios evolve in the first instance from the effects of a morbus (3.478 and 4.318), the crucial issue in each case being whether this morbus may be cured. Another way of expressing the difference between the events of the plague of Noricum and the story of the bugonia is to point out that the master fails in book 3, while the student succeeds in book 4. Virgil contrasts the efforts of the magister of book 4 with those of the magistri of book 3, one of whom is Aristaeus' erstwhile guardian. In effect Aristaeus replays the challenge faced by Chi ron but with entirely opposite results. Each of them contends with the reality of death and an adversary from the underworld. Tisiphone drives morbi before her in her devastating advance, while the numen of Orpheus is the driving force behind the morbus which ravages Aristaeus' hive. The correspondence 105</page><page sequence="12">R. J. Clare between Tisiphone and Orpheus in this regard is quite specific: Tisiphone's saevit at 3.551 is matched by saevit used in respect of Orpheus at 4.456. Prior to the beginning of the Aristaeus epyllion proper, the poet obliquely reminds us of the previous impotence of Chiron. Included in the list of remedies for the diseases which afflict beehives is the herb centaury {grave olentia centaurea, 270), a herb so-called because of its associations with the centaur Chiron.32 Only eleven lines later the limitations of this and all of the other would-be cures are pointed up. If the entire hive dies, the response of the bee-keeper must be more imaginative (4.281-4): Sed si quem proles subito defecerit omnis nec genus unde novae stirpis revocetur habebit, tempus et Arcadii memoranda inventa magistri pandere. . . . Chiron's contribution, when called upon in the fight against the plague, proves deleterious: quaesitaque nocent artes. Aristaeus, on the other hand, puts forward no lore of his own, but displays a willingness to seek out new learning33 from others (4.448-9): deum praecepta secuti venimus hinc lassis quaesitum oracula rebus. Virgil's didactic masterpiece concludes with a reaffirmation of the worth of active learning,34 a message which is lent all the more emphasis by the depiction at the end of book 3 of the inadequacy of human knowledge. In the phrase cessere magistri is encapsulated not only the failure of knowledge, but also a know ledge of failure. This paves the way for Aristaeus' subsequent recuperation of the process of learning. Notes 1.
