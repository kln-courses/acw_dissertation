<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERN LANGUAGE JOURNAL It is with this in mind that Adams takes great pains, in the second major section of his book, to provide readers with as wide a perspective as possible on Machiavelli's life and thought. To this end, extensive passages-most of which are translated by the editor himself--are selected from such works as The Dis- courses, The Legation to Cesare Borgia, and others, in order to elaborate on Machiavelli's views of man and society. Each of these selections is in turn equipped with a short but useful introduction in which a further attempt is made at delineating some of the themes of the works, as well as their significance in regard to The Prince. Even the very brief section dedicated to "Machiavelli the Poet" succeeds in some measure in clearing the way for a literary insight into certain aspects of Renaissance life and history. In- deed, had there been some space allotted for Machia- velli the dramatist, it would certainly have strengthened an undoubtedly interesting approach to the study of a writer's moral and intellectual per- sonality. However, gaps like this are more than amply bridged by other merits of Adams' work, such as his skillful and extensive use of footnotes which-it is re- freshing to discover-are never superfluous or cum- bersome, despite the large amount of information they often contain. In fact, the footnotes, in these first two sections serve a double purpose: not only do they offer comments and criticisms, but they also furnish a rich historical background to those parts of the volume which immediately follow. The third and last major division of the edition consists of a well-selected collection of critical writings which all focus on Machiavelli the theorist and moralist. The authors in question are all interna- tionally known specialists whose writings, whether they be in the form of articles or chapters from books, are all of quite recent publication, if one excludes F. Gilbert's contribution which dates back to 1939. Although it represents a broad spectrum of methods and critical approaches, this is not a collection lack- ing in continuity or cohesiveness, for it is heavily weighted in favor of those authors who are inclined toward a fuller appreciation of the modern quality of Machiavelli's social and political thought. A similar criterion is also applied in the last section of the book, or "Peripherica" as it is called, where numerous epi- grams, maxims, and observations are reproduced as a means of offering a final glimpse at Machiavelli's place in the history of modern nations. Adams' own essay on "The Interior Prince, or Machiavelli Mythologized" makes a strong case for Machiavelli's legacy and relevance to the contemporary scene. In fact, his defense of a writer whom he considers to be too frequently maligned might even be overly stated for a critical edition of this nature. Other reservations may be added to those already mentioned, not the least of which is the one arising from the bibliographi- cal section of the book, which is far too brief for the vast area of scholarship that it attempts to cover. But whatever objections one might have regarding this or that aspect of the volume, there is no denying its seriousness and high level of achievement. Ad- mittedly, parts of Adams' work might give rise to a few doubts, but none of them would ever reach the point of jeopardizing the overall effect of this most stimulating edition. ANTHONY VERNA University of Toronto D'ANNUNZIO. Alcyone: A Selection. Edited and Introduced with Notes and Vocabulary by J. R. Woodhouse. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1978. Pp. 164. f2.75, paper. Italian textbook publishing in Great Britain is monopolized by the Manchester University Press. Its general editor is Professor Kathleen Speight. The editor of Alcyone, D'Annunzio's masterpiece, and the seventeenth of the series is a lecturer in Italian at Ox- ford University. Together with Maia and Elettra it forms the third book of the original triad entitled Laudi del cielo, del mare, della terra e degli eroi published in 1903-04. The poems of the first two deal primarily with heroic themes, whereas in Alcyone it is idyllic themes that predominate. With an occasional exception, the poems have their settings in and are inspired by the Tuscan countryside where D'Annunzio resided during the summer of 1902. There, as he tells us in the open- ing poem in his collection, "La tregua," he went to find rest from his arduous labors and to escape the darts of the critics of his writings and castigators of his free-living habits. The Nature which surrounded him so profoundly moved him that he immersed himself within it, becoming one with its various manifes- tations. Much of Maia (based on or motivated by D'An- nunzio's trip to Greece in 1895) was written concur- rently with Alcyone. He was most impressed with the Greece of yore and particularly with its myths. His narrative teems with mythical episodes and allusions. He insists that they . . . foggiati di terra, d'aria, d'acqua, e fuoco, e di passione furente sono il tuo popolo vivo. (vv. 3126-29) The same myths also reappear frequently in A lcyone as the subject matter of individual poems and in a new environment, among them the centaur ("Morte del cervo"), Daedalus and Icarus ("Ditirambo IV"), Daphne ("L'oleandro"), Pan ("Ditirambo I" and "Fanciullo"), the triton ("Tritone"). There can be little doubt that the predilection for myths that D'Annunzio displays in Maia was transferred to Alcyone and that this stimulated him to create new myths of his own, the sea nymph Undulna and the wood nymph Versilia, for instance. 314</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS "La pioggia nel pineto" is the most popular of the poems and universally rated as his best. The pine grove, as the poet and his companion Erminione stroll through it, is filled with the notes of the cicadas and frogs and the rustle of the pines, myrtles, and junipers. Their sylvan music is provided with orches- tration by means of a masterly choice of words, rhythms and cadences turning the whole lyric into a beautiful verbal symphony. Before the rain is over, both humans are magically transformed into arbores- cent creations. Here we have another type of myth-it might be described as a naturalization -the inverse of anthropomorphism, it, too, common in classical mythology (cf. the metamorphosis of Niobe into a stone and Daphne into a laurel). Approximately one half of the poems are repro- duced either fully or partially. Had its editor re- printed the entire collection, 303 pages in the 1939 Vittoriale degli italiani volume, its length would ob- viously have eliminated it as a classroom text. Overall, however, representation is adequate; only a bare minimum of outstandingly significant or favorite pieces are excluded. The twenty-page introduction consists of two parts, the first being a chronological-biographical exposi- tion leading up to the appearance of Alcyone. The second part contrasts and compares Maia and Elettra with it. Emphasis is placed on D'Annunzio's musi- cality and his use of many types of metrical forms and rhetorical devices. It is these experiments that have helped to make him the most influential poet in con- temporary Italy. For him, his summer sojourn in Tuscany "was a time of beauty. . . . Pleasure in that beauty is in itself sufficient reason for reading the book, but to the sensitive soul, D'Annunzio has a further appeal. He revivifies the sentiments of magic which are found in nature, and reintroduces his readers, with fresh spontaneity, to mysteries 'fashioned from earth, air, fire and water, and fer- mented with passion,' upon which our own age is turning its back but which still lie at the heart of our European cultural heritage" (p. 20). With reference to musicality, incidentally, it may be added that all of his poems are permeated by it. In Alcyone, as Ver- laine had done before him, D'Annunzio uses "versi- fied music" to evoke his sensations. A "Bio-Bibliographical Note" conveniently com- plements the data in Professor Woodhouse's introduc- tion and extends it to 1937. In the "Select Bibliog- raphy" we might note that Forcella's repertoire has been reprinted by Ben Franklin (New York, 1973). A word-for-word checking in a dozen poems has convinced me that the English equivalents of the Italian originals in the vocabulary section come as close to preciseness as equivalents can be. The notes are carefully chosen and illuminating. For certain poems, borrowings and echoes from other writers are indicated here and there. In "Ditirambo IV," where D'Annunzio presents himself as a modern Icarus, the composition is cited as a reworking of material in Ovid's Metamorphoses VIII. This is essen- tially correct. However, neither he nor any of the other annotators, as far as I can ascertain, hint that its real stimulus was very likely Tansillo's famous Icarus sonnet: "Amor m'impenna l'ale . ." (Here, too, the son of Daedalus personifies the poet.) The evidence is visible in the closing quatrain. Compare Icaro, Icaro, anch'io nel profondo Mare precipiti, anch'io v'inabissi la mia virtu, ma in eterno in eterno il nome mio resti al Mare profondo! with Tansillo's Che s'altri cui disio simil compunse die nome eterno al mar col suo morire ove l'ardite penne il sol disgiunse, il mondo ancor di te potra ben dire, questi aspir6 a le stelle e s'ei non giunse la vita venne men, non gia l'ardire. The notes on all of the pieces are further prefaced by brief aesthetic appreciations and other pertinent in- formation. Meters employed in them are also regis- tered. This facilitates the reader's approach to them. Besides providing us with a model edition of a text, Professor Woodhouse has for the first time made it possible for students of Italian in the English-speaking world to enjoy the poetry of D'Annunzio, a privilege which most students have hitherto been denied. JOSEPH G. FUCILLA Northwestern University TRETTEL, FLAVIO AND LILIA DANNENBERG. Le feste del calendario. San Francisco: Italia Mia, 1977. Pp. 59. Lefeste del calendario is something of a novelty in the area of Italian textbooks. The authors present a panorama of many of the holidays and festivals of Italy. In the introductory note they explain that the first part, Primo Corso, is intended for beginning stu- dents and the second part, Secondo Corso, for the more advanced students. Each part is divided into twelve sections, one for each month, from September to August, so as to parallel the academic calendar it- self. The selections, varying in length from a few lines to a full page, are written in an Italian which is gener- ally correct apart from a few expressions that are mis- used: "alla scuola" instead of "a scuola"; or "nella tua casa" instead of "a casa tua." A vocabulary list and a series of questions round out the format of each section. In many instances a reading in the Secondo Corso elaborates on a similar one in the Primo Corso. This arrangement of content can be pedagogically advan- tageous, but it should be pointed out that in Lefeste del calendario the stepped approach to grammar and syntax which we are led to expect is at best illusory. Such will be evident from the passages on St. 315</page></plain_text>
