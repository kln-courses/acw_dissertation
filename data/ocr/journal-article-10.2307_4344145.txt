<plain_text><page sequence="1">IN THE JOURNALS This column is intended primarily for teachers of Latin in secondary schools. New investigations and evaluations of the lives and works of Caesar, Cicero, and Vergil, and information concerning the Rome of their era, constantly appear in classical periodicals, American and European. Unfortunately, too frequently these valuable studies are unknown or inaccessible to teachers and interested stu- dents. CW plans to summarize each month certain articles which seem pertinent to classroom use. Obvioutsly sutch summaries will present, rather than criticize. Readers are urged, of course, to consult, when possible, the periodicals In which the original articles were published. Richard M. Haywood, "Let's Run Down to Baiae," Archaeology 11 (1958) 200-205, takes the reader on a tour of the Iatalian seaside town of Baiae, a plush riviera resort where Romans flocked to enjoy the magnificent natur al set- F O R E I G N BOOKS &amp; PERIODICALS on Classical Languages &amp; Literature Current or Out-of-Print OUR SERVICE MEANS: No worrying about how and where to obtain foreign publications.

Today, the remains of Baiae stretch along the shore for half a mile. They are by no means as impressive, archaeologically, as Pompeii, with the latter's uniquely preserved streets and houses. None the less, writes Professor Haywood, we know more about the luxurious life of Baiae than we do of middle class Pompeii; the writers of the early empire were interested in the more fashionable resort, and have left us a richer sense of its atmosphere than excavation could furnish. As early as the mid first century B.C., the town seems to have been known as a resort of the fast set. Cicero was accused publicly, by a political enemy, of having been seen there, and he thought it advisable to reply in this fashion: "This stern and gloomy statesman will not even let a middle-aged man go down to his own villa when the Senate is not sitting and go over to Baiae to take the waters for his health." But the curative springs were probably not Baiae's major enticement. Its apartment hotels and villas, its baths and amusements attracted those who could afford to pay the bill. Paint- ings and rich tapestries adorned the buildings: shops were stocked with fine or exotic goods. The holidayer could divert himself with scenic carriage rides along the shore, or go rowing with his favorite young lady on nearby lakes. For a large party, a barge, manned by slaves, could be hired to idle over the lovely bay. In brief, the luxuries and extravagances of the early empire seem to have found a show place here. There were some, however, who did not appreciate the liveliness, or the shadier aspects, of the gay resort. Seneca, after having been summoned to a conference at Baiae by Nero, wrote to a friend: "Drunks wandering along the beach, reeling about, singing choruses in the middle of the night! Orchestras every- where!" The philosopher concludes simply: "The place does not have a healthy atmosphere." * * * Another bimillenary celebration has been observed, this time in honor of Ovid, the Augus- tan poet and unofficial arbiter rerum urbanarum, whose works are currently enjoying a remark- able revival in popularity. T. F. Higham, who has for some years been concerned with the presentation of honorary degrees at Oxford, has found that this wayward poet of the early empire was not only skilled but prophetic, since</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL WORLD 159 his poetry can be most useful to the public ora- tor today ("Ovid and Modern Times," Greece and Rome 5 [1958]. 13-15). Ovid's verses, some- times prefaced by Professor Higham's Latin, offer such quotations, happily adaptable to the academic citation, as the following: THE UNITED NATIONS "Summum illud gentium concilium, cui iure liceat, more Iani antiquorum, de se praedicare me penes UNum vasti custodia mundi" Fasti 1.119. SCHIZOPHRENIA "Secta bipertito cum mens discurrit utroque" Rem. Am. 443. EDUCATION OF WOMEN "Si existat ab inferis Ovidius, non lam profecto can- ere possit: Sunt tamen et doctae, rarissima turba, puellae" Ars Am. 2.281 TELEVISION "Intuetur populus domesticas illas scaenas, unde quod est usquam, quamvis regionibus absit, inspicitur, penetratque cavas vox omnis ad auris" Met. 12.41-2. In more serious vein, W. S. Maguiness, in the same issue of G&amp;R, presents (pp. 2-12) an appreciation of the poet's character and person- ality.1 * * * Problems in early Roman history are re-ex- amined by Plinio Fraccaro, "The History of Rome in the Regal Period," Journal of Roman Studies 47 (1957) 59-65. He concludes that the historian must be fully aware of the difficulty of properly evaluating the historicity of such tra- ditional accounts as those contained in the early books of Livy, but does not go to the extreme of discounting all such traditions as the pure fab- rications of a later era. Instead, he assumes that they may contain a residue of fact which had been preserved by oral transmission, or, more likely, by inscriptions lost to us, but avail- able to the early Roman historians. Thus it cannot be proved that Romulus and other kings are merely legendary figures. "We should, there- fore, allow these kings to keep their place in the history which we recount." * * * Robert Schilling, "Les origines de la Venus romaine," Latomus 17 (1958) 3-26, discusses the origins of the Roman goddess, and connects the derivation of her name with veneror and the divine venia. Only with the development of anthropomorphism (and partly under the influ- ence of the Greek Aphrodite) did Venus assumr her erotic attributes, commonly associated with her by the student of high Roman mythology.
