<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Philosophical Quarterly Volume 23, Number 2, April 1986 CAUSATION AND EXPERIMENTATION Daniel M. Hausman What makes p a cause-factor relative to the effect factor g is, I shall maintain, the fact that by man? ipulating p, i.e. by producing changes in it 'at will' as we say, we could bring about changes in g.1 'T'HE causal relation appears to be asymmetric, -^ and indeed the differences between causes and effects are far from trivial. Someone who hoped to reduce smoking by curing lung cancer would be badly confused. Someone who tried to prevent Mrs. O'Leary's cow from knocking over the lantern by putting out the Great Chicago Fire would be mad. The difference between causes and effects seems obvious, but it is not easy to state in any general and informative way what this difference is. One obvious part of this difference is that one can use causes to manipulate their effects, but not vice versa. I shall make use of this "fact" of manipula bility to defend an analysis of the difference between causes and effects in terms of the relative independence of causes with respect to their effects. The problem of understanding the differences between causes and effects is the problem of causal asymmetry or causal priority. It is part of the problem of understanding what it is for one indi? vidual event to be a cause of another individual event. I shall not distinguish causes and causal conditions, but shall call both "causes." The criteria by which one determines which of the various causes and causal conditions is the salient cause are not relevant to the general problem of distin? guishing causes from effects. One wants both to understand what it is for the individual event, X, to be causally prior to the individual event, F, and, on the basis of this understanding, to comprehend what it is for X's to be causally prior (in specified circumstances) to Y's. "XV are events "resembl? ing" X, that is, events of the same kind or belonging to the extension of the same relevant predicate as X. 4T's" similarly are events of the same kind as Y. The "in specified circumstances" clause is needed because in some circumstances X's may be causes of Fs, while in others y s cause X's. For example, in different circumstances changes in the pressure on a gas can be causes or effects of changes in its temperature. Causal generalizations carry tacit or explicit reference to background circumstances. Individual causal claims do not require such qual? ification.2 Although I take the entities that the causal rela? tion relates to be events, I shall not present or presuppose any particular analysis of events. Indeed, to simplify the exposition and to bring my discussion closer to the language and concerns of scientists, I shall most often speak of causal rela? tions among "variables" or, in the terminology of the opening quotation, among cause or effect "fac? tors." Thus I shall talk as scientists commonly do of, for example, a gas's temperature as (causally) "depending" in specified circumstances on its pres? sure.3 The problem of causal asymmetry can be formulated as the problem of analyzing the causal priority of one variable to another. It is in this form that the problem usually arises for scientists such as economists. I shall refer to variables or causal factors with lower case letters, x, y, z, and so forth. The term "variable" is unfortunately ambiguous. The causal relations I am concerned with obtain among determinables or factors in the world, not among the symbols which denote such determina? bles or factors. The best known solution to the problem of causal asymmetry is Hume's, and it still has many defen? ders.4 According to Hume, the difference between cause and effect lies in their order in time: causes precede their effects. Hume's account of causal priority is appealingly simple, but it is rejected by many, since it rules out not only the existence of simultaneous or backwards causation, but their log? ical possibility as well. One also wonders how those who insist merely on the temporal precedence of causes can account for the fact that causes explain 143</page><page sequence="2">144 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY their effects, but not vice versa, for the apparent importance of causal directionality in decision making or for the apparent necessitation of effects by their causes.5 But no other account of causal priority is accepted by more than a handful of phi? losophers. Although there is little agreement about how to solve the problem of causal asymmetry, there is currently some consensus about how to approach it. Several recent discussions of causal priority have followed Mackie in regarding the singular state? ment, "X causes Y" as true just in case X and Y are causally connected and X is causally prior to Y.6 Given this approach, one can regard a biconditional of the form "X causes Y if and only if X and Y are causally connected and..." as an attempt at an account of causal priority that would become a full theory of causation only after the notion of a causal connection is spelled out. One is, as it were, fac? toring the causal relation into two parts: a symmet? rical relation of causal connection and an asymmet? rical relation of causal priority. From this perspec? tive, for example, one can regard Hume as analyzing causal connections in terms of spatial contiguity and constant conjunction and as analyzing causal priority in terms of the temporal precedence of cause to effect. If one can provide a satisfactory analysis of both causal priority and causal connection, one will thereby have provided an analysis of what it is for one event to be a cause or a causal condition of another. Notice that philosophers are seeking an analysis of causality, not merely a true statement of the form "X causes Y if and only if X and Y are causally connected and...." Yet many philosophers would deny that there are, strictly speaking, any analyses. Following Quine, they question whether the dis? tinction between analytic and synthetic statements (between statements about meanings and state? ments about the world) can be sustained.7 In their view, every consistent causal claim would state something about the world and something about what causation is. But one should not be too much influenced by general qualms about the analytic synthetic distinction. People still offer and make use of statements that function much as pure analyses (if they existed) would. Even though it is not analytically true that a body's momentum equals the product of its mass times its velocity, there is world of difference between this claim and the assertion that a falling stone gains momentum (which is not to say that people might not sometimes learn more about momentum from assertions about falling stones). There are, however, specific grounds to doubt whether one can provide the same sort of quasi analysis of causation that one can provide for momentum. Causation is such a ubiquitous and fundamental relation, and causal concepts are so basic to our thinking that one wonders what more fundamental analysans can be found. I suspect that all analyses of causation will be circular to some extent. But one would like to have as informative and non-circular a theory of causation as is possible. A crucial difference between causes and effects that deserves careful philosophical attention is that causes may be used to manipulate their effects, but not vice versa. If whenever one "wiggles" x, y wiggles, too, but not vice versa, one concludes that x is a cause of y, or that y depends on x. This fact is utterly familiar, of course. Indeed it grounds the bulk of our causal knowledge. But only a few philosophers have recognized its importance for the analysis of causal priority; and these philoso? phers have jumped to premature conclusions. Those philosophers and scientists most im? pressed by the facts of manipulability have attempted to find an analysis of causal asymmetry in those facts themselves. Examples are philoso? phers such as Colling wood, Gasking, von Wright and Freundlich and econometricians such as Orcutt.8 Guy Orcutt maintains for example, ".. .we see that the statement that..^ is a cause of z2, is just a convenient way of saying that if you pick an action which controls zl5 you will also have an action which controls z2."9 Stripped of its sub? tleties, the manipulability theory maintains that in specified circumstances y depends on x if and only if actions or interventions that affect x affect y, while acts or interventions that affect y leave x unaffected. The second clause is needed in order to secure the asymmetry of the causal relation.10 Tomato output depends on the amount of fertilizer (in specified conditions) if and only if one influ? ences one's tomato harvest by fertilizing one's gar? den.</page><page sequence="3">CAUSATION AND EXPERIMENTATION 145 Since the major concern of manipulability theorists has been the problem of causal asym? metry,11 I shall pass over assertions or implications concerning the notion of a causal connection12 and consider manipulability theory only as a theory of causal priority. What distinguishes causes and effects, according to the manipulability theorists, is that causes are as it were levers for moving effects. The practical importance of manipulability and of human ability to act do not, of course, establish their analytical credentials. And in fact the man? ipulability theory is a very bad theory of causal priority. It faces at least four serious difficulties. First, at least as formulated above, it is false. It is not true that x causes y if and only if interventions which affect x affect y, but not vice versa, since there are asymmetric causal relations among factors that humans are unable to affect. Even though humans cannot control what happens on the sun, it can still be the case that fusion reactions there produce light and heat on the earth. Qualifications are thus needed. But apart from such difficulties, which have been patched up over the years, the manipulability theory is narrowly circular, unjustifiably anthropomor? phic, and it makes causal inferences on the basis of passive observation needlessly problematic. The circularity is evident: To affect a variable is to have a causal influence on it. If one does not already understand what causation is, and if one does not already know that one's interventions cause the alterations and are not caused by them, the man? ipulability theory will tell one nothing. One can, as von Wright has, assert that the relation between actions and their "results" is a logical, rather than a causal one.13 But one may always convert refuta? tions into philosophical mysteries. In this case, as this paper will show, such mystery-making is uncalled for. Circularity does not itself render a statement invalid, although it may render it uninteresting or epistemically unhelpful. Furthermore, one cannot dismiss even a proposed analysis of causal priority because of its circularity since, as I noted before, there are grounds to doubt that any true analysis of causation or causal priority is possible.14 But circularity that is as narrow and obvious as in the case of manipulability theory is not only unsettling in itself, but it affects the epistemological signifi? cance of the theory as well. One needs to know that one's actions cause the changes one observes and are not caused by them, before one can begin to draw causal conclusions from the results of apparent manipulations.15 The anthropomorphism of the manipulability theory is also disturbing. Are causal asymmetries dependent on human actions and perspectives, or are they objective facts? Manipulability theory leads one too readily with too little argument to the former view. Finally, as I shall argue below, manipulability theorists are forced to assimilate causal inferences based on the statistical analysis of observations to causal inferences based on the results of experiments. This assimilation is both cumbersome and unreasonable. In the rest of this paper I shall substantiate these criticisms by showing how a harder look at the facts of manipula? bility leads to a superior theory of causal asym? metry. Let us then examine more carefully these "facts" of manipulability. Any precise formulation is unlikely to capture our vague pre-theoretical under? standing perfectly, but one can come close. Her? mann Wold states the facts of manipulability as follows: "if the experiment reveals that an observed variable varies systematically as the controlled vari? ables are allowed to vary, this relationship is a type case of a causal relation."16 Philosophical defenders of manipulability theory formulate the facts of man? ipulability in much the same way. According to the passage from von Wright quoted above at the beginning of this paper, x is a cause of y if and only if "we could bring about changes in" y "by producing changes in" x. Gasking's formulation, which is quoted and endorsed by Freundlich is vir? tually identical.17 As a first approximation y is caus? ally dependent on x if and only if actions which affect x in the particular circumstances affect y and not vice versa. To "bring about" some event or to "affect" some factor is, in the ordinary under? standing of these terms, to be a cause or causal condition of an event or factor. But the quantification in both clauses of the last formulation, as in many accounts of the facts of manipulability remains vague. Should one assert</page><page sequence="4">146 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY that x causes y if and only if there is some way of affecting x in the circumstances that affects y, but not vice versa, or that whenever one affects x in the particular circumstances one affects y (but not vice versa)! Von Wright's talk of producing changes "at will," Wold's talk of "systematic" vari? ation suggest that one should insist upon the latter or on some probabilistic variant of the latter. Indeed if causation is transitive and x causes y, then it must the case that interventions which exert a causal influence on x exert a causal influence on y. But note that it does not follow that y does not depend on x if, in specified circumstances, changes in x are not accompanied by changes in y.18 There may be some threshold such that a small change in the value of x leads to no change at all in the value of y. Or it might be the case that one's inter? vention has both an indirect causal relation to y via x and a direct causal relation to y which exactly cancel out. An intervention may still be a cause or causal condition of the value of y, even though it does not result in any change in that value. This claim may seem puzzling because of the role of experimentation in learning about causal relations. To infer that x causes y from causal relations among interventions, jc, and y, one needs observed vari? ations in x and y accompanying one's interventions. But there will in general be no uniform relation between interventions and changes. One would like to have a simple truth condition relating "jc influ? ences y" directly to observed changes. But there is no such truth condition. The connection between the claim that y depends on x and observations is at best a counterfactual connection. Similarly, one must clarify the quantification in the "vice versa" clause. Should one assert that there is some way of affecting y that does not affect jc, or that whenever one affects y, jc, is unaffected. The latter is unsatisfactory, since whenever one affects y by means of jc, jc is obviously affected. Perhaps one wants to say that whenever one affects y, except via jc, then jc is unaffected. But this clause is also too strong, jc may be a cause of y even though an intervention that affects y also has an independent effect on jc. The most straight-forward way to formulate the second clause of the manipula? bility principle is the first alternative. There must be some way of affecting y that does not affect jc. A "way" must be a kind of action. One needs a reproducible effect. The fact that some particular action token affects y but not jc establishes very little. I shall take interventions to be kinds of actions. Given the above clarification, the facts of man? ipulability, which I shall call "the manipulability principle" can be stated as follows: (MP) In specified circumstances, y depends on jc (jc is cause of y) if and only if (a) jc and y are causally connected, (b) all interventions which influence jc influ? ence y, and (c) some intervention which influences y does not influence jc. If one wished to discuss causal relations among events directly rather than talking in terms of causal relations among variables or factors, (MP) would require restatement. The first clause, that jc and y be causally connected, may not always be men? tioned explicitly, but causality demands causal con? nection. Causal connections, which I shall not attempt to analyze in this paper, are reliably indicated by observed regularities or correlations. Even though the existence of an observed regularity or correla? tion is neither necessary nor sufficient for the exist? ence of a causal connection, the close relations between causal connections and observed reg? ularities or correlations still give one some indepen? dent grip or "purchase" on the notion of causal connection. Given that grasp of the notion, we discover (leaving aside the problematic notion of mutual dependence) that causal connections come in only three varieties:19 (CC) In specified circumstances jc is causally con? nected to y if and only if (a) y causally depends on jc or (b) jc causally depends on y or (c) jc and y have a common cause only. Note that (CC) is not a definition or analysis of the notion of a causal connection, but an empirical generalization. Causal connections appear to be instances or consequences of laws and their analysis is bound up with the analysis of laws. But the empirical indicators of causal connections give us</page><page sequence="5">CAUSATION AND EXPERIMENTATION 147 enough of a grasp on the notion that we may make use of it. And when we do use it, we discover (CC). Since "affecting" a variable is causally influencing it, it will not be obvious on the basis of observations whether one is truly affecting a variable. It might, for example, be that whenever one apparently determines the value of jc that both jc and one's actions are causally connected only as effects of some common cause. One needs to know that one is actually manipulating the factors that one appears to be. As Martin Bunzl put the point: "For unless we can differentiate between cases of doing and undergoing, appeals to 'doing' will hardly offer a reliable indicator of causal rela? tions."20 One reason why human ability to act and to intervene is of such enormous practical impor? tance is that experimenters may be reasonably sure that that they are doing rather than undergoing. We are often convinced that our actions are not them? selves caused by the changes we observe in the variables or by other causes of those changes, and we can take precautions to insure that we are indeed intervening, or in Bunzl's language, "doing." Inter? vention seems to be a good way to generate events that we believe to be causes only. This presupposition concerning interventions should be made explicit. The best way to formulate it is as follows: (D) If any intervention is causally connected to a variable whose causal relations one is inves? tigating, then the intervention exerts a causal influence on that variable. I have called this claim (D) for "Determining." (D) is, as everybody knows, not always true. It is a boundary condition on the applicability of the man? ipulability principle, not in any way a true or plaus? ible assertion about the world. When (D) is not true, we may mistakenly believe that our actions are causally influencing the variables we are study? ing, when in fact our actions are determined by those variables or by other independent determin? ants of them. One sorts experimental subjects ran? domly into experimental and control groups to guard against violations of (D). If our sorting of rats, for example, were caused by some observable correlate or consequence of their propensity to develop bladder cancer, our administration of sac charm might turn out to be an effect of this pre? existing propensity. Since (D) is violated, we would then be unjustified in concluding that the adminis? tration of saccharin is a cause of bladder cancer. In performing experiments to determine causal order, one not only assumes that (D) is true, but one often takes precautions to make sure that (D) is true. Experimental testing of causal priority is not always possible nor are its results always reliable, even when (D) is true. It could happen that when one intervened and affected x, y was affected, even though y did not depend on jc. Our particular actions might in each case have determined a value of y directly or through some other intermediary than through their effect on jc. Although our ability to act is of enormous importance in learning about causal relations, causal relations are themselves objective. If it were to turn out that in specified circumstances a variation in jc were accompanied by a variation in y only when the variation in jc were brought about by human action, one would no longer be confident that the variation in jc caused the variation in y. Note that variations in y may depend jointly on jc and on some particular kind of human action.21 A certain drug might only work when it is administered by a confident and distin? guished-looking professional in a white coat, even though a placebo similarly administered is ineffec? tive. But this possibility is consistent with the assumption that if all interventions which affect jc affect y, then everything which affects jc affects y. What one has here is merely a case where jc and one particular kind of human action jointly cause y. When one asserts that jc is a cause of y, one not only believes that in the appropriate circumstances jc can invariably be used as a "lever" to bring about y, but that in those circumstances variations in jc, no matter what their source, will be accompanied by variations in y.22 To infer that jc is a cause of y on the basis of the results of one's interventions, one must assume that human intervention or action in general is not essential to the relation between jc andy. The contrapositive of this assumption is the fol? lowing (which I have called (O) for "Objectivity") (O) If in the specified circumstances there is some variable that affects y but not jc, then some intervention will affect y, but not jc.23</page><page sequence="6">148 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY (O) states that if there is something that affects y but not jc, then some intervention will do the trick. Of course this claim is not always true. Just consider all those situations where we are unable to intervene at all. Like (D), (O) is an implicit assumption one relies on in drawing inferences concerning causal priority from the results of attempted manipula? tions, not an acceptable general thesis about the world. Unlike (D), however, which is implicit in our conception of an intervention, (O) is implicit in our inference from the results of interventions to causal conclusions. Whether y depends on jc must not depend on which intervention one happens to have performed or even on the limits of physi? cally possible interventions. To assert (O) is to repudiate or at least severely qualify the anthropomorphism of the manipulability theorists. Action is crucial in ascertaining causal relations, not because action is constitutive of causal asymmetry, but because we can act at will and can usually safely assume that our actions are causes and not effects of the observed variations. Indeed, if action were essential to the relation between jc and y, one would be puzzled and uncer? tain whether jc causes y. If one can show that there is some account of causal asymmetry that explains the facts of man? ipulability and avoids the limitations of manipula? bility theory, then no reason remains to regard the manipulability principle (as important as it may be in practice) as itself an analysis of causation. For example, those who accept a Humean view of cau? sation might attempt to explain why causes may be used as levers to move their effects but not vice versa, by insisting that causes precede their effects and by arguing that it is possible to affect the future, but not the past. But even if Hume was correct and causes always precede their effects, there may be other general differences between causes and effects which are interesting in their own right and which contribute to our knowledge of causal asymmetry. Implicit in the facts of manipulability is just such a difference. Given (D), (O), (CC) and the transitivity of causa? tion, I prove in the appendix that the manipulability principle entails and is entailed by the following truth condition for "jc causes y": (CP) In specified circumstances, jc causes y if and only if (a) jc and y are causally connected, (b) every factor causally connected to jc is causally connected to y and (c) some factor is causally connected to y but not to jc. For example, in specified circumstances, the vol? tage in a circuit exerts a causal influence on the amount of current that flows in the circuit. Every variable causally connected to the voltage in the circumstances (for example the chemical composi? tion of the battery) is causally connected to the amount of current. But some factor (for example, the diameter of the wire) is causally connected to the amount of current, but not to the voltage. According to (CP), causal asymmetry is an asym? metry of connectedness: causes link together their effects, but not vice versa. Among the various causes of any given event, there is a measure of independence that does not obtain among the various effects of an event.24 I shall not attempt a general exposition of (CP) here, because I have already written an essay articulating and defending it. The basic link between (CP) and (MP) is the lemma, which fol? lows from (CC) and the transitivity of causation, that when something is causally connected to y, but not to jc, it must be a cause of y. Given (O) there must then be some intervention that causes y, but not jc. (D) is essential to the inference from the premise that some intervention causes y but not jc to the conclusion that something is causally con? nected to y but not to jc. The other steps in the proof are relatively trivial. In demonstrating, given (CC), (D), (O), and the transitivity of causation, that (CP) and (MP) entail one another, one has, I think, both a conclusive criticism of manipulability theories of causal asym? metry and a powerful argument for the correctness of (CP). In the limited circumstances in which man? ipulability is possible and causal inferences based on its results are reliable, the manipulability prin? ciple is entailed by (CP). Thus, accepting (CP), and the assumptions one makes in experimenting and in drawing inferences from the results of experimentation, (MP) is redundant. It contains no information concerning causation beyond what is</page><page sequence="7">CAUSATION AND EXPERIMENTATION 149 already asserted by (CP). No reason remains to regard the practical importance of manipulability as an argument for a manipulability theory of causal asymmetry. Nor should one cling to the manipulability theory of causal asymmetry because of doubts about the validity of (CP). (CP) not only explains why (MP) works where it does, but it is also entailed by (MP) in the limited circumstances circumscribed by (D) and (O). If one accepts (CC) and the transitivity of causation, one cannot reject (CP) without rejecting (MP) or one of the assumptions one must make in employing (MP). (CP) thus inherits the plausibility of the manipulability principle, while overcoming the circularity and the parochial and anthropomorphic character of manipulability theories. Since (CP) mentions only causal connec? tions, which may be indicated by observed reg? ularities or associations (or analyzed in terms of laws) without immediate knowledge of causal priorities, it opens the narrow circle of manipula? bility theories and permits one to make a more informative general claim about causal asymmetry. Since (CP) is independent of any notion of an inter? vention or of any of the limitations on interventions, it is much more general than manipulability theories, and it permits one to avoid the anthropomorphic puzzles considered by philoso? phers such as von Wright. (CP) also enables one to make better sense of systematic causal inferences made without the benefit of experimental results. Consider what a manipulability theorist has to say about such reasoning: Orcutt, for example, attempts to assimi? late causal inferences on the basis of time series data to causal inferences on the basis of experi? mental results by arguing that sometimes one can "indirectly observe" actions in such data or that one can apply general principles (like the temporal priority of cause to effect) which humans have established in the course of attempted manipula? tions.25 Suppose, to use Orcutt's hypothetical exam? ple, one found "time series exhibiting well defined, well spaced, and irregularly occurring pips." Orcutt argues that "Common pips on the two series would support the belief in some connection between them. Extra pips on one but not the other would be compatible with causality running from the vari able without the extra pips to the variable with extra pips but not vice versa. Extra pips on both series would be compatible with a common cause but no direct causal link, and so on."26 In Orcutt's view one draws such conclusions by reasoning that since there are no extra pips on, let us say, series 1, then we could manipulate the second variable by manipulating the first. But, as the extra pips on the second series show, we could not necessarily control the first variable by controlling the second. It is, however, awkward to refer to possible actions here, and, once one accepts (CP), there is no need to do so. Given (CP), the causal inference is direct and precise. Since all the pips on the first series are linked with pips on the second, but not vice versa, all the exogenous factors or causes which affect the first variable affect the second, while some causes of the second are not causes of the first. Given (CP), such ideal data establishes pre? cisely that the first variable causes the second. If (CP) were not generally correct, at least in the domain in which human action and intervention is possible, then it would not be true that one could use causes to manipulate their effects and not vice versa. Given the assumptions one makes in per? forming interventions and in drawing causal infer? ences from their results, (CP) not only explains the "facts" of manipulability, but it is entailed by those facts. What distinguishes causes from effects is the connectedness of effects and the independence of causes. This argument for my account of causal asym? metry can be strengthened in one further way. One criticism of most theories of causal asymmetry is that even if they enable one to distinguish causes and effects correctly, they fail to capture what is at the heart of the distinction. One is inclined to say that even if, as Hume maintained, causes do always precede their effects, this difference in time is not of the right "character." Hume still owes us some account of the "effectiveness" of causes or the sense in which causes make their effects happen, but not vice versa. Similarly one might object that even if the effects of an event are causally connected to one another, while not all of its causes are, this difference cannot lie at the heart of the difference between causes and effects. Ted Honderich makes exactly this criticism of David Sanford's analysis</page><page sequence="8">150 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY of causal asymmetry, which bears a close resemblance to (CP).27 The manipulability principle, in contrast, seems to strike close to the heart of the distinction between causes and effects. The fact that causes can be used to manipulate their effects, but not vice versa seems to capture a good deal of the notion that causes are "effective" and that they necessitate their effects. Indeed I would like to suggest that the notions of the effectiveness of a cause and the necessitation of an effect by its cause are metaphysical expres? sions or exaggerations of the fact that we can make effects happen by means of their causes. If this is so, then the equivalence (in the proper cir? cumstances) between (CP) and (MP) shows some? thing surprising. At first sight it appears to be at most mere happenstance that effects of a common cause are linked, while there is some measure of independence among the causes of a given effect. But the conditional logical equivalence between (CP) and (MP) shows that what one might call "the objective effectiveness of causes" is in fact just their relative independence. It would be nice if my analysis of causal asymmetry were obviously of the right character?if it were obvious that it goes to the essence of causal priority. But there is no reason why it should be obvious when one has correctly analyzed some aspect of a relation. And indeed if effectiveness is, as I have suggested, an anthropomorphic notion, then no objective account of causal priority could be obviously of the right character. The asymmetry of connectedness or independence is the significant, objective differ? ence between causes and effects that appears to us as the effectiveness of causes and the necessitation of effects. The conditional logical equivalence between (CP) and (MP) coupled with the hypothesis that effectiveness is at root an anthropomorphic notion gives one strong reason to believe that (CP) not merely happens to distinguish causes and effects correctly, but that it correctly analyzes the priority of causes to their effects. Manipulability theories of causal asymmetry are not only in need of manifold qualifications, nar? rowly circular and unduly anthropomorphic, but, given (CP), they are redundant. (CP) captures the basic asymmetry upon which the facts of manipula? bility depend in a much more general way. In testing to see whether jc causes y, experimental interventions or attempted manipulations provide crucial data. When properly qualified the manipula? bility principle remains of the utmost importance in testing causal claims, but manipulability by itself is inadequate as an analysis of causal asymmetry. Causal asymmetry is an asymmetry of indepen? dence or connectedness.28 Carnegie-Mellon University Received January 15, 1985 APPENDIX: PROOFS I shall in the appendix discuss causal relations among "factors" or "variables," jc, y, z, etc. Changes in these are events. As discussed in the text, claims about causal relations among variables must contain a reference to some specified background conditions. To keep the proofs relatively uncluttered, this unav? oidable reference to specified background circumstances will be left implicit. Abbreviations: x ce y: "In specified circumstances, factor jc is causally connected to factor y" jc causes y: "In specified circumstances factor jc is a cause of factor y or has a causal influence on factory" a is an act: "a is in the specified circumstances a kind of act of intervening with respect to factors jc, y,..." General Premises: (T) If jc causes y and y causes z, then jc causes z. (CC) jc ce y if and only if jc causes y causes jc or jc and y have a common cause. (D) If a is an act and z is any factor, if a cc z, then a causes z.

Proof: If z is causally connected to jc, then jc causes z or z causes x or there is some factor w that causes z and jc [by (CC)]. In each case (CC) and (T) establish that z ce y. Lemma 2: Given (T), (CC), and (O), if jc ce y and something is causally connected to y, but not to jc, then some act is a cause of y, but not of jc. Proof: Let w be causally connected to y, but not to jc. Then, by Lemma 1, it is not the case the y causes w. So either w causes y or there is some z that causes y and w. In the latter case, z cannot be causally connected to jc or, by Lemma 1 again, so would w. Thus in either case there is some cause of y that is not a cause of jc. By (O) there is thus some act which causes y but not x.

(MP) x causes y if and only if (a) *ccy, (b) all acts which affect jc affect y and (c) some acts which affect y do not affect jc. Theorem 1: Given (T), (CC), and (D) and (O), (CP) entails (MP). Part A: 1. If jc causes y, then jc ce y, everything causally connected to jc is causally connected to y, and something is causally connected to y, but not to jc. (CP) 2. If jc causes y, then all causes of jc are causes of y. (T) 3. If jc ce y and something is causally connected to y, but not to jc, then some act causes y, but not jc. 2) 4. Ifjccausesy, then jcccy and every act which causes jc causes y, and some act causesy, but not jc. (1,2,3) PartB: 1. If jc ce y and everything causally connected to jc is causally connected to y and something is causally connected to y, but not to jc, then jc causes y. (CP) 2. If jc ce y and every act which is a cause of jc is a cause of y, then everything causally connected to jc is causally connected to y. (Lemma 2) 3. If a is an act which causes y, but not jc, then a is causally connected to y, but not to jc. (D) 4. Ifxccy, every act which causes jc causesy, and some act causesy, butnotjc, then jc causesy. (1,2,3) Thus, given (CP) (which consists of premises A-l and B-l), one can deduce (MP) (which consists of conclusions A-4 and B-4). Theorem 2: Given (T), (CC), (D) and (O), (MP) entails (CP). Part A: 1. If jc causes y, then jc cc y, all acts which cause x cause y, and some act causes y but not jc. (MP) 2. If jc causes y, then everything causally connected to jc is causally connected to y.

Indeed in Gasking's view in "Causation and Recipes," Mind, vol. 64 (1955), p. 485, we would not regard jc as a cause of y if the relation did not depend on the circumstance. For rather different reasons (see my account of causal priority, (CP), later in the text), I agree. 3. See H. Simon and N.

Hume does provide a psychological account of the necessary connection between cause and effect in terms of the "customary transition of the imagination from one object to its usual attendant,..." from An Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1955), p. 86. But although one might construct a Humean account of the asymmetrical necessitation of an effect by a cause (an enterprise with which I have some sympathy), Hume's relation of necessary connection and his "customary transition of the imagination" are completely symmetrical. 6.

The sentence that follows reads, "But, as is apparent from the above, the converse may or may not be true." Orcutt denies the converse because, like Gasking, he recognizes that whether one event affects another depends on the background circumstances. Relativized to some specific background, Orcutt would agree that zx is a cause of z2 if and only (/""if you pick an action which controls Zj, you will also have an action which controls z2" and not vice versa. 10.

Some defenders of manipulability theory have argued that it does not attempt a reductive analysis of causation. Instead, it supposedly offers "an analysis [sic] of causation in terms of the general means of checking, or testing, for the existence of the causal relation between states." Y.

Freundlich, "The Causation Recipe." 18.1 owe this point to I. J. Good and Deborah Mayo, who may well not agree with the way I have formulated it. 19. One can add mutual dependence to (CC) without affecting the relationship between (MP) and (CP). See footnote 4 of my "Causal Priority," Nous, vol. 18 (1984), pp. 277.1 am oversimplifying here, as I did in "Causal Priority." Distant causal connections become undetectable, and only a true believer would accept an analysis of them in terms of laws. A more complex account would rely on two notions of causal connection: immediate causal connection and local causal connection. They are definable and distinguishable roughly in terms of the complexity of the laws and statements of initial conditions needed to deduce a statement of one event from a statement of the other. If one admits probabilistic causation, the "deduce" in the last sentence needs weakening. One should then restate (CP): (CP') jc is a local cause of y if and only if (a) x and y are locally causally connected, (b) everything immediately causally connected to x is locally causally connected to y, and (c) something is immediately causally connected to y and not locally causally connected to x. Local causation is not transitive, but causation (which may involve a chain of local causes) is. The conditional equivalence between (CP) and a restated version of (MP) can still be proven. 20. "A Note on Doing," p. 629; see also J. Mackie, "Review of Causality and Determinism," Journal of Philosophy, vol. 73 (1976), p. 216. 21. I owe this point to David Sanford. 22. See von Wright, Causality and Determinism, p. 49. 23. Notice that (O) prevents the second clause of (MP) from being too easily satisfied and the third clause from being unsatisfiable. If no interventions that affect x or y are possible, it will turn out trivially that all interventions that affect x will affect y and vice versa. But one should not use (MP) in this case to conclude that x does not depend on y and that y does not depend on jc. If there are no interventions that affect x or y, then (unless x and y are uncaused), one cannot assume that if all acts which affect x affect y, then everything which affects x affects y, nor that if some variable affects y but not jc, then some act affects y but not jc. 24. In my "Causal Priority," I develop and defend (CP) at length as a truth condition for the singular causal statement, "X is a cause (or a causal condition) of y." (CP) and (MP) can easily be restated as a truth conditions for causal generalizations, but without introducing counterfactuals (MP) cannot be restated as a truth condition for singular causal statements. Individual events are affected by many different causes, but rarely by any act. I should also point out that, although probably a defender of manipulability theory, Freundlich in "The Causation Recipe" clearly notices and emphasizes the fact that causes link together their effects (p. 479).</page><page sequence="12">154 AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY 25.
