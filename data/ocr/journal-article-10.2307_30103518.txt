<plain_text><page sequence="1">FUNERARY MONUMENTS OF THE GATTELUSI AT MYTILENE IN the 19O8-9 volume of BSA, F. W. Hasluck published inscriptions and carved stones connected with the Frankish dynasty of the Gattelusi on Lesbos. Many of them come from the capital of the duchy at Mytilene, and most of them are now immured in the Ottoman walls of the Kastro. Although some were recognized by Hasluck, most of the stones are the disiecta membra of funerary monuments of members of the dynasty, ranging in date over about a century (1355-1462). These stones have attracted little attention since Hasluck, but recent excavations in the Kastro by the Canadian Archaeological Institute have stimulated interest in the Gattelusan monuments. This article seeks to republish these monuments, and places them within the context of the Frankish and Byzantine funerary repertoire of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries in Greece and the Aegean.1 HISTORICAL INTRODUCTION The duchy of Lesbos was founded by Francesco I Gattelusi (1355-84), a scion of a Genoese merchant family who arrived in the Levant around 1350 to make his fortune, accompanied by galleys and mercenaries. On the island of Tenedos he met the Byzantine Emperor John V Palaiologos, then embroiled in a civil war with the rival emperor, John VI Kan- tekouzenos. Francesco agreed to help the legitimate emperor win the war if he could receive the hand of the emperor's sister, Maria Palaiologina, and the island of Lesbos. Thus, following the triumph of John V, Francesco founded his duchy on Lesbos, and his dynasty upon an imperial marriage (FIG. I). Much pride was taken in this illustrious match by his descendants, who added the Palaiologan monograms to their armorial bearings. Mytilene became the capital of the new duchy, where Francesco, then the emperor's suzerain, constructed the first Kastro. Over the next century the Gattelusi lords added new possessions to their dominions. A collateral branch of the family became lords of Ainos (modern Enez) in Thrace ( 384), and also received the islands of Samothrace and Imbros. The reigns of Jacopo I (1403/04-28) and Dorino I (1428-45) saw the zenith of Gattelusan power, with the acquisition of the islands of Thasos and Lemnos and the important emporium of Phocaea near Smyrna. Dynastic rivalries and overambition, however, led to the downfall of the dynasty for refusing to pay tribute to the Sultan; and the violent usurpation of Nicolo II precipitated an Ottoman assault. In 1462 the city of Mytilene fell to the forces of Sultan Mehmet II the Conqueror, and the last Gattelusan lord was summarily executed.2 I am most grateful to Hector Williams for inviting me to carry out this study. The monuments were studied at Mytilene in May 199o. Many thanks also to Richard Anderson for inking the drawings. Special abbreviations: Hasluck = F. W.

THE BURIAL CHURCH OF ST JOHN THE BAPTIST AND THE GATTELUSAN TOMBS The princely and royal houses of the Frankish Levant were as assiduous in their preparations for burial and commemoration as their western counterparts, and the founders of the new Latin dynasties took care to establish burial churches. Guy I, founder of the de la Roche dynasty of the dukes of Athens and Thebes, selected the former Byzantine monastery of Daphni outside Athens as the burial-place of his house (I205- 131 ).3 Nerio I, founder of the Acciaiuoli dynasty of dukes, wished to establish a new dynastic burial-place, and chose the Parthenon (then the Latin cathedral), which lay close to the ducal residence on the Acropolis.4 In the principality of Achaia the burial-place of the ruling house of Villehardouin was the church of St James at Andravida.5 The Lusignan house of Cyprus were buried in the Royal Monastery of St Domenic, on the outskirts of Nicosia.6 As in the contemporary West, the reasons for these burial churches were both spiritual and dynastic. The clergy and monks at these churches were to offer up masses of intercession to alleviate the sins of the deceased. Nerio I Acciaiuoli, for example, specified in his will that twenty priests were to sing masses day and night for the repose of his soul.7 On the political level, an impressive array of tombs provided a powerful statement of 3Miller 19o8, 70-I; 219; 227; 233.

This had particular importance in the Latin Levant, where a Latin minority ruled a dispossessed Orthodox majority. Francesco I was quick to follow suit, and founded the church of St John the Baptist in Mytilene to receive the mortal remains of himself and his successors. Here, he and Maria were buried in tombs that they had already prepared before their deaths.8 The church is no longer standing, nor is its location known from literary sources, but a church was excavated in the Kastro in 1986-7. Although its remains were robbed to their foundations and further obscured by the nineteenth-century mosque built on the nave, its plan can be reconstructed (FIG. 2). It consisted of a long, rectangular nave, with a single shallow apse at the east end and a narthex at the west which is more massively built than the nave, perhaps suggesting that it supported a bell-tower. Although the nave may have been divided into aisles by columns or piers (none are preserved), there need not have been any internal arcades. Another distinctive feature is the use of buttresses on the exterior walls of the nave and narthex. The addition of a minaret foundation on the north-east corner (enclosing the buttresses) indicates that the church was in use when it was converted into a mosque, following the Ottoman conquest in I462.9 This plan is very different to that of a Middle Byzantine church, and it lacks the 8 Miller 1921, 319; Dennis (n. 2). 9 C. and H.

IVISON diakonikon and prothesis apses of the Byzantine rite, perhaps suggesting that it is a Latin church. The plan has no direct parallel amongst the Frankish churches of Greece, but the elongated, rectangular nave with its buttresses is reminiscent of that of the Cistercian church of Zaraka at Symphalia.'o The Kastro was originally built by Francesco I as the residence of the Gattelusan dukes," and the presence of a church in its bailey is not unexpected in view of the locations of other chapels within the walls of Frankish castles in the Levant. The castle of St Peter at Halikarnassos (est. 1415), the castle of William II de Villehardouin at Mistra (est. 1249), the Frankish castle on the Larissa at Argos (rebuilt in the thirteenth century), and the castle of Chastel Pelerin (Ahtlit) in Palestine (destroyed in 1291) all had chapels or churches within them.'2 This contextual evidence strongly suggests that the Mytilene church was the Kastral and therefore the ducal chapel, practising the Latin rite between 1355 and 1462. This conclusion leads to the still unanswered question: can this church be identified as that of St John the Baptist? Simple, east-west oriented pit inhumations, and cists revetted with field-stones and spolia, were found in the narthex and outside the apse.'3 All date to the period of use of the church, and some exhibit a characteristic feature of medieval Latin burials, in which the body would be laid unprotected in the grave pit, extended and supine, but the head would be forced into an unnatural upright position by an earth or stone pillow and then wedged between field-stones or spolia to prevent it moving. Another stone might also be placed beneath the chin to keep the jaw in place. Often only the head area would then be protected, with a tile or slab.

A large Gattelusan sarcophagus (I) does stand beside the Mytilene church, however, though not in its original position. It is not impossible, given its location, that this church is indeed the burial church of the Gattelusi, whose tombs were removed upon its conversion into a mosque after I462.19 CATALOGUE: THE TOMBS I.

The sarcophagus was carved on one front only; the interior, back, and short ends are still roughly tooled with pick and claw-chisel (FIG. 3). The Roman curved skirting runs around the back and short ends, but was cut away at the front by the Frankish mason. This lack of concern for the back and sides indicates that the intended setting for the sarcophagus was an arched tomb-niche or 'arcosolium'. The front, which is broken, is carved in high relief and divided into two parts (FIG. 4). The left side represents the overlapping scale pattern (sometimes described as shells) of the Gattelusi, with a total of seven courses of scales arranged alternately as four scales, and three and two half-scales, per course (FIG. 5). The right-hand side is divided by a cross into four panels, each containing a letter of the Palaiologan acronym BBBB, for 3(aotheLXg) B(aOthaiv) B(aoolCtEOwv) B(actoLXEooiL) (FIG. 6).20 The carved front is broken and the central portion is now missing. The width of this break is 0.98 m at its widest point. The reasons for the breakage are clear when one examines the sarcophagus closely. The front chosen by the medieval mason is convex, and its wall is not of the same thickness throughout. The wall of the rim is o.18-0.20 m thick, while at the bottom of the break the wall thickness is only 0.075 m (FIG. 7). This miscalculation led to the breaking of the panel and the abandonment of the work. The mason was over halfway through carving the front when the panel broke; the BBBB side was completed, but the scales were only half-done and had to be abandoned after the disaster. Courses 1-2 from the bottom were carved, and although the third course of scales had already been carved out in outline (ordinatio), cutting ceased in mid-course; courses 18 Soloi (late i3th-I4th cent.): J. des Gagniers and T.

This is the only tomb fragment that can be examined in the round, and its size and cuttings identify it as the front of a pseudo-sarcophagus. Pseudo-sarcophagi were constructed of slabs slotted into an arcosolium niche, and usually consisted of a slab and a lid. The front of the slab is largely occupied by a recessed panel almost as high as the slab. At the corners of the front and side edges of the slab, some 0.075 m is cut away to a depth of I cm and deliberately roughened ('anathyrosis') to provide a good grip in the slots of the arcosolium side walls, or in a baluster or corner-post. The upper surface edge of the slab is some 0o.135 m thick, and has three square dowel sockets. That on the left side is almost entirely destroyed, but is situated some o.m7 m from the left edge of the slab. That on the right is preserved, and measures 0.045 x 0.05 m. The third dowel (0.035 x 0.045 m) is not at the centre of the slab but some o.8I m from the right edge. The entire surface of the upper edge has anathyrosis for the application of mortar. These dowels must have been used to fix the lid of the pseudo-sarcophagus, which would have been slotted into the side and back walls of the niche. The irregularity of their positions may suggest that the lid was made up of two cover slabs of unequal size. The recessed sculptured panel on this front is in very shallow relief, and its background is roughly tooled, perhaps to receive an encaustic inlay in the champlev6 technique found on other sculptures of the period.22 At the centre of the panel is a spade-shaped shield divided into three zones. On the lower left, is the Gattelusan scales device, while on the lower right is a single-headed eagle, in profile walking to sinister, with wings extended and wearing a three-peaked crown. In the third compartment above is a Latin cross dividing the four reclining betas of the Palaeologan acronym, as found on I. The betas are of unusual length and flatness, their stems extended to separate the curves. On either side of the shield is a supporter in the form of a lion rampant; both are walking towards the shield with a paw raised towards it. Both extend their tongues, and are wearing crowns bearing three fleur-de-lis peaks. 3. Pseudo-sarcophagus front (FIG. 9). Hasluck, no. 7.

A brief comparison of the tombs of the Gattelusi with those of their contemporaries reveals that although their tomb types were well established in the Frankish funerary repertoire, they did absorb some Byzantine influences. The fragments of the Gattelusan tombs fall into two groups, monolithic sarcophagi and pseudo-sarcophagus slabs, both to be inserted into arcosolium niches. No lids have yet been identified for either group. Turning first to the sarcophagi, it must be noted that monolithic sarcophagi do occur in the funerary repertoire of the Latin Levant, but are rarely of such size. Monolithic antique sarcophagi, most of which were undecorated, were used by the thirteenth-century de la Roche dukes of Athens and Thebes. Only one known example had been recarved.24 In this respect the Franks were also following the Byzantine custom of reusing and recarving antique sarcophagi, examples of which can be seen amongst the twelfth- and thirteenth- century tomb ensembles at Myra and Ephesus.25 The pseudo-sarcophagus fronts with their armorial bearings are most closely compar- able with those of their Genoese contemporaries in the Levant and in Genoa. Two of the Gattelusan panels (2-3), are alike in their general shape - both are remarkably short in stature in relation to their length - but the cuttings on 2 show that they were slotted into the side walls of arcosolium niches. The niches they occupied must have contained low pseudo-sarcophagi. In any case, the burial would not have been above ground in the 24 G.

After d'Alessio (n. 26), 137, no. 81 (mus. inv. 2839). pseudo-sarcophagus, but in a compartment beneath floor-level. Both the Gattelusan examples are closely comparable in size and design to a front from the Dominican church of SS Paolo e Domenico in the Genoese colony of Galata by Constantinople (dated to the fourteenth or fifteenth century; FIG. 12). The panel measures 1.43 m in length and has a height of 0.49 m, and is also divided up into recessed panels containing coats of arms.26 Other similar fronts are to be found at SS Paolo e Domenico, but not of the same dimensions and with different motifs.27 Although no other fragments relating to the tombs can be identified, it is likely that the original appearance of the Gattelusi niches resembled those reconstructed from fragments at Galata. These tombs could have carved arched canopies or archivolts above them to frame the niche (sometimes elaborately carved with vegetable and rinceau motifs), which could carry further heraldic devices.28 These tombs were heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine tomb architecture, for the archivolt still in situ at SS Paolo e Domenico bears such a striking resemblance to tomb archivolts at the Chora monastery in Constantinople that it was certainly inspired, if not carved, by a Byzantine mason. If the Gattelusan tombs followed their Byzantine models, then the back of the arcosolium recess would have been filled with a formal composition executed in fresco or mosaic. This usually represented the deceased in an attitude of prayer, being introduced to or blessed by a divine personage. These paintings could also extend to the soffits of the arch above.29 Such niches however, could be quite shallow in depth, to judge from those still in situ at SS Paolo e Domenico.30 Later thirteenth-century arcosolia recently discovered at Corinth demonstrate that they could also be quite low, and this may have been the intended setting for those fronts that were short in stature.31 26"E.

IVISON Attribution None of the Gattelusan tombs have an inscription identifying the owner. In the mid- nineteenth century Conze mentioned a sarcophagus lid (now lost) with a Latin inscription ending in the words fecit hedificari;32 but no lids with epitaphs survive today. We are thus entirely dependent upon the attribution of the heraldic devices upon the sarcophagi, drawing upon heraldic building inscriptions of the dynasty (FIG. I). Some members of the family can be excluded immediately from discussion. Dorino II (1455-6) fled to Naxos after the fall of Ainos to the Turks in 1456, and the date of his death (probably after the fall of Mytilene in 1462), is unknown.33 We can also discount the last lord of Mytilene, Nicolo II (1458-62), who was strangled on the orders of Sultan Mehmet II after the fall of the duchy.34 Nicolo had murdered his brother Domenico (1445-58) in order to usurp the state, and whether he gave him a proper burial is unknown. As regards the Ainos branch of the family, there is no reference to a burial church at Ainos, so it is possible that these lords were buried with the rest of the family at Mytilene. Of all the slabs, 3 is the most elaborate and distinctive. The appearance of the double-headed imperial eagle with a Gattelusan shield upon its breast is of particular significance, for it is mainly associated with one member of the dynasty, Dorino I (1428-45). This device appears upon a building inscription of Dorino at Phocaea (dated I423-4).5 Otherwise it appears only upon the coins of Dorino.3 3 may thus be attributed with some certainty to Dorino I. The appearance of the Byzantine imperial eagle coincides with the last feeble phase and final extinction of the empire, and may thus be an act of dynastic aggrandisement (without fear of impotent imperial wrath) on the part of Dorino, under whom the Gattelusan domains reached their greatest extent. 2 also bears a distinctive coat of arms. The Gattelusan scales and walking eagle are known on the earliest inscriptions of Francesco I and Nicolo I of Ainos,37 and appear on the coins of Francesco.38 The walking eagle seems to change the direction of its walk, however, between the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. On the arms of Francesco it walks to the right,39 but on the arms of Nicolo it marches to the left.40 By the fifteenth century this movement is reversed: on inscriptions of Dorino I of Mytilene the eagle walks to the left (3), while on the inscriptions of Palamede of Ainos the eagle now walks to the right.41 Turning, however, to the BBBB acronym, which is impaled in chief,42 (Hasluck i908-9, FIG. 14), we learn that it is also part of the arms of Palamede, lord of Ainos from 1409 to 1455, which are found on three inscriptions of the same design from Thasos, Samothrace, and Ainos.43 It is therefore possible that 2 belongs to Palamede, although the walking eagle (which was also part of his arms) is walking to the left. The similarity in design of 4 to 3 has already been noted, and so it should be assigned to a member of the family of the fifteenth century whose death was not far removed from that of Dorino I (1445). 32 Hasluck 265. 33 Hasluck 253. 34 Tsamalis 3.

Pseudo-sarcophagus front of Francesco Pastera, from SS Paolo e Domenico at Galata. After d'Alessio (n. 26), 144, no. 86 (mus. inv. 2897). The shield on 5 is of little help for identification, for although the spade-shaped shield appears on the coins of Francesco I and II,44 it is also present upon the inscriptions of all members of the family. The front, however, is of a design unlike any other, for it is a composite piece and has a simplicity more suggestive of the incipient Renaissance than of the Gothic style seen on the other stones. Pseudo-sarcophagus fronts with arms or emblemata at the centres of recessed framed panels appear at SS Paolo e Domenico at Galata in the fifteenth century (FIG. I3).45 Our 5 and 6 may therefore be attributed either to Domenico (d. 1458) or to an unknown member of the dynasty who died in the mid-fifteenth century. Finally, we return to I, the broken and unfinished sarcophagus. The question of whether it was mended and ever used has already been mentioned. For whom was it originally intended? It is the largest of the tombs, and is ancient. It also most prominently bears the Palaiologan BBBB and the Gattelusan scales. Hasluck suggested that it may have been intended for Francesco I and Maria Palaiologina.46 Certainly, such a grandiose tomb would befit the founder of a dynasty with imperial connections. Whether, of course, Francesco and his Byzantine bride were ever buried within it cannot now be answered. British School at Athens ERIC A.
