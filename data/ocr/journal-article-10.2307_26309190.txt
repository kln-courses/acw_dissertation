"A solid contribution to Maya archaeological research for students and professional archaeologists." —Barbara Fash, Peabody Museum 172 pp., $55.00 cloth Ancient Maya Life in the Far West Bajo Social and Environmental Change in the Wetlands of Belize Julie L. Kunen Traces the intertwined histories of upland settlements and low-lying bajos among the ancient Maya as they developed from the Late Preclassic period until the area's abandonment around AD 850. Kunen argues that differences in access to resources resulted in highly patterned settlement remains and that community members who acquired the best and most diverse resources maintained an elevated social status. Her integration of three lines of evidence—settlement system, agricultural system, and ancient environment—breaks new ground in landscape research and in the study of Maya non elite domestic organization.
