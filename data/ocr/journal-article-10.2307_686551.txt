<plain_text><page sequence="1">Philosophy and Scientific Realism. ByJ.J. C. Smart. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London, 1963. Pp. viii - 16o. 25s. SPECTATORS of the' revolution in philosophy' will often have wondered how long it would be before the revolutionaries grew dissatisfied with the limita- tions placed on them by the linguistic approach to their subject, and this book is interesting as the testament of one who has moved from a neo-Witt- gensteinian conception of philosophy towards regarding philosophy as an attempt to acquire a synoptic view of the world-to think comprehensively as well as clearly. Not surprisingly the book concentrates on issues on the borderline between philosophy and science, for it is those with an interest in science who are most easily irked by restrictions on the scope of philosophy. 358</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS Professor Smart can hardly be expected, however, to adumbrate a compre- hensive world-view in 160 pages, and so this book is chiefly concerned in attacking 'anthropomorphic or near-anthropomorphic strains of thought in philosophy' which hinder the development of the mechanistic views which he himself holds. The first of these targets is phenomenalism, both in its traditional form which ' in a sense puts this great world of nature " inside sentience "' (p. s15) and in its application to electrons and protons where it attempts to' deny the full-blooded reality of the sub-microscopic world'. Smart's rejection of the former, and of the more extreme logical construction version of the latter, though adequate, is brief and conventional; more interesting is his discussion of the view that 'electrons are real' simply means that the concept of electron, like for example that of lines of force, occurs in a well-established theory. Besides criticising such a view as an inadequate explanation and a bar to further research, he gives a helpful analysis of'real' and attempts to deal with difficulties in the straightforward realist interpretation of quantum mechanics, e.g. the two-slit phenomenon. One would need to be a physicist properly to assess the adequacy of this attempt, but it seems plausible and well documented. After some brief, if controversial, remarks on the difference between the physical and the biological sciences, Smart passes to his next target, the view that secondary qualities, especially colour, exist in nature as we perceive them. This chapter is a slightly altered version of his article in Philosophy I96I. Rejecting the ordinary views, he points out how slight the correspondence is between colour qualia and physical properties, even on the orthodox tri- chromatic theories and especially on the evidence of Land's experiments. He then goes on to advocate ' a positive philosophical theory of colour'; this is essentially behaviouristic-colour experiences are not denied but are regarded as of little importance. In this Smart seems to make it easier for himself by a dubious switch from colours in the sense of qualia (qualities or sense-data) to colour concepts. Since concepts may be regarded as essentially linked to classification and classifying is obviously behaviour, I doubt if the older views about colours as qualities or sense-data are really affected by this. Even more controversial is his next step, the attempt to maintain (i) that sensations (or experiences generally) and brain processes are identical, and (ii) that man is simply a physical mechanism and that all apparently non- mechanistic occurrences in man (conscious experiences and free choice) could be reproduced in a suitably constructed machine. A good deal of this has already appeared in his articles, and he is here chiefly concerned with rebutting objections to his position. Some of these, especially to (ii), are very technical, e.g. the argument from Gidel, though more straightforward criticisms are also discussed. Smart makes some good points, but one is still left with the feeling that he does not really appreciate the simple tradi- tional difficulties in his position ; consequently he does little to mitigate the 359</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS basic implausibility-how things apparently so remarkably different as conscious experiences and brain processes can possibly be the same. (It is not just that we do not mean brain processes by ' experience ', but that what we mean by' experience' is entirely unlike what we mean by' brain processes '; Smart's remedy of revising our language would still leave' dangling' what we now mean by 'experience '.) If this kind of Identity Theory is to be made acceptable at all it needs to be introduced by examination of aspects, i.e. by considering how different points of view or methods of observation can make the same thing look entirely different. Insensitivity on this point also leads Smart to answer the question ' what sort of brain process is identified with experiences?' by 'those which can be . . . causal conditions of our uttering those introspective reports which we classify as reports of immediate experience' (p. o103). If his theory is really to advance beyond this un- helpful triviality and to become scientific, i.e. open to refutation, some independent neurological characterisation of brain processes will be required (in terms of location, electroencephalograms etc.). One would also like to know why on Smart's view consciousness ever arose ; if human beings are just machines why did anything so apparently unmechanistic as consciousness and the intuition (or illusion) of free will ever arise? It seems odd that a machine can operate better by convincing itself that it is not one. A further point here is that if Smart's view were ever shown to be correct the connotation of' mechanism' would be so altered from its current, even electrically extended, form that the thesis ' man is a mechanism' would lose its sting; indeed since every organism and every conventional machine would be a mechanism the word would become as colourless as' entity '. Smart also pursues his attack on philosophical romanticism to theories of space and time, but gives only a sketchy discussion. In general his book is filled with interesting points and is very well documented. My overall impression is one of dissatisfaction, however ; the book is over condensed and episodic-its author flits from point to point refuting X and agreeing with Y, to whose discussion the reader is referred. Consequently it fails to provide a convincing and fully integrated statement of Smart's positive philosophy; it is more a series of comments from a mechanistic point of view on recent writings than an attempt to develop such a view from scratch and to examine fully its implications.
