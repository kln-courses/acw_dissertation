Hayles notes that although Haraway has moved away from the cyborg in her own work, the political issues that drove the Manifesto are more pressing than ever, and it "remains remarkably prescient in many of M§ Af 1 MFS Modern Fiction Studies,Volume 57, number 2, Summer 2011.

REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, FETAL ICONS, AND GENETIC FREAKS: SHELLEY JACKSON'S PATCHWORK GIRL AND THE LIMITS AND POSSIBILITIES OF DONNA haraway's CYBORG Heather Latimer</page><page sequence="2">Latimer 319 its concerns" (159). Taking Hayles's assessment as its starting point, this article will use Haraway's work on the cyborg as a platform from which to trace some of the intersections between reproductive tech nologies, the posthuman, and hypertext technologies over the last twenty years, especially as these issues interact in Shelley Jackson's influential Patchwork Girl. I argue in this essay that the rapid growth in new technologies that spurred Haraway's work on cyborgs in the 1980s and 1990s arose in part from reproductive concerns and that these technologies and their associated politics continue to shape debates in America on issues such as fetal therapy/repair, cloning, and stem cell research.1 I look especially at how reproductive technologies relate to posthu man theories on the cyborg in the image of the sonographic fetus. As Marilyn Maness Mehaffy notes in "Fetal Attractions: The Limit of Cyborg Theory," the sonographic fetus is in many ways the ultimate cyborg in that it is "created" in a space of virtuality that "straddles the conventional boundary between an organic body and a digital text" (181). The fetus, however, is rarely read publicly as a byprod uct of technology or imagined as a cyborg; it is instead often taken for granted as an independent and natural subject. This is because the actual fetus, inside a woman's body, has become virtually inter changeable with its free-floating image through the mass circulation of fetal pictures in abortion politics and in the media more gener ally. Harkening back to the famous 1956 cover of Life Magazine that originally introduced the ultrasound picture to pop culture, the image of the free-floating fetus has become so commonplace that it now indicates "an independent fetal subject with interests and rights of its own," often imaginable only at "the expense of pregnant women who are rendered invisible." Even though we know that we can only "see" the fetus by looking at a digital picture of sound waves passed through a pregnant woman's body, the way these pictures are used, talked of, and imagined, construct the fetus as independent of this body. This, combined with pro-life campaigns to institute fetal per sonhood as a legal category, has made the free-floating fetus into a "two-dimensional icon" synonymous with personhood (Valerius 129). The potential the fetus has to disrupt the digital/organic border as a cyborg, consequently, is contained through the erasure of the tech nology that makes the fetus visible in the first place. The fetus can therefore be said to act as a limit to how posthuman theories affect reproductive technologies in that it actually reinscribes stable mean ings to the human/machine dualism the cyborg is said to disrupt. Shelley Jackson's hypertext, Patchwork Girl, offers a cyborgian reading of reproductive technologies that challenges the dominant discourse of fetal imaging. In a retelling of one of the most famous</page><page sequence="3">320 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies stories of assisted reproduction, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, it em braces another type of cyborg, the reproductive freak or monster. Patchwork Girl's main character is Victor Frankenstein's aborted second creation, the female monster, whom he violently tears up mid-construction in order to stop the possibility of her spawning a "race of daemons," as he puts it (190). Jackson's narrative shows us Shelley herself sewing the monster back together after Victor has destroyed her, and then engaging in a love affair with this "patchwork girl" before the monster sets out for America to start her own story and life. The narrative imagines a concept of reproduction outside of heterosexuality; Shelley not only "births" the patchwork girl through an activity often associated with women's work—sewing—but also single-handedly parents her while becoming her lover as well. The story also posits a concept of new reproductive technologies outside the norm by not only having the monster be physically dispropor tioned and deformed, but also carry the memories, characteristics, and genetic traits of all the people she is made up from, including Mary. The patchwork girl is therefore a cyborg who contrasts the naturalized subjectivity evoked by the fetal image, both by hav ing a birth outside the confines of the heterosexual matrix and by embracing the potential horrors of reproductive technologies. The story facilitates and undermines current preoccupations with all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are actually in place to catch and prevent; however, these genetic flaws are viewed as playful attributes in the story. Patchwork Girl represents the dis ruptive potential of Haraway's cyborg in connection to reproduction in a way that popular media and politics have failed to embrace in the sonographic image of the fetus. Fetal Cyborgs In the Manifesto Haraway theorizes the connections between feminism, technology, and social movements popular in the 1980s, such as ecofeminism and identity politics: "to build an ironic politi cal myth faithful to feminism, socialism, and materialism" ("Cyborg" 149). She starts by outlining the ways cyborgs, as cybernetic organ isms, fuse together the organic and the technological and therefore transgress the fundamental boundaries that have structured our world and how we make sense of it. As Haraway details, the Mani festo is an "argument for pleasure" in these transgressions and "for responsibility" in the building of these boundaries. She describes the cyborg as having "no truck with bisexuality, pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labour, or other seduction to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of the powers of the parts in a higher unity"</page><page sequence="4">Latimer 321 (150). Resistant to any totalizing narrative, the cyborg appears in three places: "precisely where the boundary between human and animal is transgressed"; in the leaky diction "between animal-human (organism) and machine" (152); and in "the boundary between physi cal and non-physical" (153). In transgressing these three borders the cyborg offers an example of a subject who is not afraid of "partial identities and contradictory standpoints." As Haraway explains, the "political struggle" the concept of the cyborg offers is "to see from both perspectives at once because each reveals both domination and possibilities unimaginable from the other vantage point" (154). The usefulness of the cyborg metaphor, then, is in this multiplicity. In embracing the cyborg's multiplicity Haraway is able to take an image popular in military-technological discourse at the time she is writing and appropriate it for feminist ends.2 She argues against feminists who want to resist new communication, information, and biological technologies because of how they are connected to and funded by capitalist and military goals. Haraway urges feminists to stay critically engaged with these technologies so that they can remain open to their possibilities and monitor their application. She states: "we cannot go back ideologically or materially" ("Cyborg" 162) and we must acknowledge that "communications technologies and biotechnologies are the crucial tools recrafting our bodies. These tools embody and enforce new social relations for women world wide" (164). One area where Haraway sees these new tools affecting women's bodies is through reproductive technologies. Just as they are now, feminists at the time were divided over how reproductive technologies changed social relations, and this is one area where the cyborg metaphor was particularly apt. In the rest of this section, I will briefly outline how new reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), cloning, and fetal monitoring and repair coalesce with Haraway's theories on the cyborg, especially in the figure of the fetus. This will serve as an introduction to some of the ways that re productive technologies connect not only with Haraway's theory, but also with the abortion debate and with feminist interest in reproduc tion more generally. In arguing that new reproductive technologies act as a limit to the possibilities of the cyborg subject, what follows will also serve as an introduction to Jackson's text, which expands these limits in its literary representations of the same technologies. Haraway states in "Fetus: The Virtual Speculum in the New World Order," that the sonogram "is literally a pedagogy for learning to see who exists in the world" (177). She continues: "the visual image of the fetus is like the DNA double helix—not just a signifier of life but also offered as the-thing-in-itself. . . . [It] is a technoscientific sac rament" (178). As Mehaffy argues, through this process of seeing</page><page sequence="5">322 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies the fetus as "the-thing-in-itself," the fetus has come to represent a postmodern version of the Enlightenment-humanist individual (183). Its image indicates an independent fetal subject with interests and rights of its own that are often imaginable only at the expense of pregnant women. Even though we know the fetus is inside a woman's body, it is publicly envisioned as both independent of this body and as independent of the sonographic equipment used to read this body. We know that fetal images are depictions, yet the sonogram invokes a documentary-like access to fetuses that makes it easy to ignore this, which in turn can limit the authority and agency of pregnant women. Mehaffy argues that the media's use of fetal images still "strategically invokes authority to ultrasound technologies which supersedes this knowledge" (181). Other feminists have come to similar conclusions. In "Fetal Cyborgs and Technomoms on the Reproductive Frontier," Monica J. Casper suggests that our social, political, and technical landscapes are characterized by a proliferation of technofetuses and other fetal cyborgs. Casper not only looks at ultrasound images, but also at procedures such as fetal repair and surgery to argue that women who undergo these procedures, often with profound consequences on their own bodies, also become cyborgs, or what she calls techno moms: pregnant women are just as culturally constructed as their fetuses. Like Mehaffy, Casper wonders if Haraway's framework is able to accommodate the cyborgs created through new reproductive technologies. She argues: "fetal cyborgs may indeed be 'monstrous and illegitimate1, but whether they also serve as sites for 'resistance and recoupling' (Haraway 1985; 154) and if so, for whom, remains to be seen" (185). Valerie Hartouni broadens this point by arguing that, in general, most reproductive technologies over the last thirty years have been unable to radically change social structures. As she explains, they have instead been assimilated into the "order of nature" and brought into the service of precisely those institutions, relations, and relationships or ways of life they once seemed destined to raze (114). She states: "as in the telling of most genealogical tales, then, where the monstrous was once spied roaming, mothers, fathers, and families now comfortably reside" (116). This is similar to Sarah Franklin's argument about the everydayness of IVF. She argues it is "the normality, even the ordinariness, of IVF that in turn gives us the everyday cyborg embryo, which, previously having been perceived as something of an oddity, now feels at home in the living room" ("Cyborg Embryo" 177). Franklin is not necessarily critical of this turn, and notes that IVF has opened up whole new modes of everyday kin ships. Hartouni, however, argues that new reproductive technologies alone will not change kinship structures unless social technologies</page><page sequence="6">Latimer 323 change as well: "the distinction between social technologies and new reproductive ones is formal at best: not only are individuals being re produced, but so too are the social relations that organize and render them recognizable as such (both to themselves and others)" (119). Hartouni ultimately finds, like Mehaffy and Casper, that technologizing fetuses may serve to make them seem more "naturally" human, as they become socially figured as independent subjects and patients. While the fetus has always been embodied, it may have become more naturalized by the very technologies that could have made it resistant to naturalization altogether. The technologies that make seeing the fetus possible may work to distance it from the preg nant woman's body. This distance, in turn, covers over the fact that these technologies are often deeply connected to other reproductive practices such as abortion (itself often figured as the antithesis of pregnancy). For instance, abortion is implicit in the testing of new reproductive technologies such as amniocentesis or embryo transfer, yet these technologies play a role in efforts to restrict abortion rights by positing the fetus in opposition to the pregnant woman (Balsamo 37). This is similar to how lesbian and gay families, poor women, and single men are restricted from accessing technologies such as IVF, which could make it easier for them to start families. It is not only that the sonographic fetus is publically represented as an Enlightenment individual, as Mehaffy argues, but also that the very technologies that help us see and imagine the fetal subject as natural are used to regulate who counts naturally as a mother or a family, and this often shapes the reproductive choices they are allowed to make. If Haraway's cyborg is important precisely because it resists categoriza tion as either technological or natural, then through the use of fetal imaging the sonographic fetus has become a boundary to this theory. As these examples show, the potential the fetus has to disrupt the digital/organic border as a cyborg is contained through the erasure of the technology that makes it visible in the first place. It therefore acts as a limit to how posthuman theories affect reproductive tech nologies in that it is a cyborg which is often used to reinscribe stable meanings to the human/machine dualism they supposedly disrupt. Frankenstein's Kin If the sonographic image of the fetus acts as a limit to the disruptive potential of the cyborg, then another technology, such as writing, may be better able to denaturalize the fetus/human/cyborg continuum by providing a more subversive place for imagining this potential. In "Reproducing the Posthuman Body: Ectogenetic Fetus,</page><page sequence="7">324 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies Surrogate Mother, Pregnant Man," Susan M. Squier argues that literary representations of reproductive technologies are producing the conditions for the posthuman. Looking at the profound influence reproductive technologies have on how we imagine ourselves and our communities, she states: "Whether the result will be the eman cipation from certain fixed and historically oppressive constructions, the cementing of a new, even more oppressive set of social relations or—as is the most likely—both at different times, depends not on the reproductive technologies themselves, but on the social and cultural conditions of their use" (113-14). The "social and cultural condi tions" Squier considers are fictional representations of reproduction from the Romantic era to the postmodern, and she argues these texts play a crucial role in setting the social and cultural boundary conditions for reproductive technologies and their use. She states: "literary figurations of the reproductive body have always been open to a wide range of meanings, because literature functions as one of the institutions through which human beings are shaped." I reference Squier here as a way to return to my analysis of Jackson's text, as I agree with Squier that literature plays an important role in how we understand our cultural and social experiences of reproduction. I am also fascinated by Squier's argument that the creation of a metaphoric break between mother and fetus, which allowed for the cooption of female procreative power through the literary image of male birth, began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (115). If Squier is right, then we can trace a connection not only between Shelley's novel and Jackson's hypertext, but also between Shelley's novel and current representations of reproductive technologies. Frankenstein is a good example of the "wide range of meanings" Squier talks about. This is one of the reasons the novel continues to have such a pull with readers: it investigates what it means to be human in the most primal sense. Jackson takes up this investigation in her rewriting of Shelley's monster, creating a whole new storyline for Victor's unfinished female creation. In "Making Monsters: Mary Shelley's Frankenstein," Judith Halberstam discusses the exhaustive readings done of Shelley's text and notes that "Frankenstein's monster has attained mythic status both with the popular imagination and the critical project of literary history" (29). She continues: "by his very composition he [the monster] can never be only one thing, never represent only a singular anxiety" (36). While Halberstam is certainly correct, what I want to concentrate on here is how the monster con nects to the reproductive politics of Jackson's text. I want to take up Halberstam's argument that the novel is not about the making of a monster but "really about the making of a human" (38), to further argue that what drives Victor's fear in the novel, that his monster will</page><page sequence="8">Latimer 325 procreate, is exploited in Jackson's text in order to confront modern fears about reproductive technologies. As many Frankenstein critics note, these modern fears are already connected to Shelley's time in that our current criticisms of science and technology echo Roman ticism's criticism of Enlightenment.3 Shelley's novel gestures to a paradox similar to the one underlying contemporary reproductive debates; just as the novel was written at a time when what it meant to be a "man" was rapidly changing through the industrial revolution, our own political situation questions what it means to be a "human" in the wake of new scientific and reproductive technologies. Ernest Larsen suggests, for instance, that it is "the enlightened rational pa triarchal system as personified by Frankenstein that itself produces monstrosity" (238). Victor wants to remove reproduction from the living (woman's) body and create life from the scientific instruments of his laboratory, to find the secrets of life that "had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world" (Shelley 80). This can be read as the real monstrosity in the novel, as this desire to overcome the limits of the mind leads to a creature that is the opposite of Victor's intentions in that it is all body. Victor's desire to ward off death and control life can therefore be read as a caricature of the Enlightenment individual who wants to guarantee autonomy and privilege mind over the body. Enlightenment discourse about the mind/body split, which often focuses on the potential terror of a body out of control, continues to inform current debates over reproductive issues such as cloning and genetics. Larsen goes so far as to suggest this connection can even be seen in the graphic nature of pro-life protesters, who not only show pictures of fetal body parts at protests, but also argue against stem cell research in the name of protecting the world from the possibility of Franken-babies. He states that Shelley's caricature of male pregnancy "in which a man gives birth to a living, breathing, speaking, eight-foot abortion" (238) can be credited with giving birth to the image of the aborted "fetus as monster, the fetus as revivified corpse, the fetus as a pile of used body parts" (238-39). Some might argue against Larsen's assertion that Shelley's text can be linked to the horror we experience when we view pro-life posters of fetal tissue. There certainly is a connection between monstrosity, reproduction, and feelings of anxiety, however, and this is the link Jackson develops in her representation of a cyborg. Patchwork Girl not only evokes the terrifying monstrosity of Victor's messy laboratory birth, but it also embraces this monstrosity in celebrating the technologies that made the patchwork girl's messy creation possible. Jackson's cyborg exploits Victor's fear of monstrous procreation, and the Enlighten ment ideals that drive this fear, by exploiting the dualisms that drive</page><page sequence="9">326 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies these fears in definitions of reproduction, technology, and the body. Through this exploitation the patchwork girl not only works against the monstrous subjectivity ascribed to Victor's creation, but also against the naturalized subjectivity that the image of the fetus evokes. That is, Jackson's text embraces a different type of cyborg than the one most commonly associated with new reproductive technologies, both old and new. It rewrites Frankenstein's reproductive politics, and it represents the disruptive potential of Haraway's cyborg in connection to reproduction in a way that popular media and politics have failed to embrace in the sonographic image of the fetus. Patchwork Girl Patchwork Girl's thematic focus on the connections between monstrosity, subjectivity, and new reproductive technologies is ap parent from its very first page, when readers, or users, open the hypertext to find a picture of a scared and naked female body sewn together with a single dotted line. This first image acts as a meta phor for the hypertext, which plays with the (dotted) line between human and monster, text and body, reader and writer. Readers enter the text by clicking on this body and following its "limbs" or links to different sections of the text. These include, among others, "body of text," which contains the monster's story and theoretical musings; "graveyard," which tells the stories of the creatures and corpses used to make the monster's body; and "journal," which records Mary's interactions with the monster. Readers not only encounter the patchwork girl's story by clicking on these links, but also Jackson's thoughts, other fragmented narratives, and extensive quotations from Shelley's novel and theorists such as Jacques Derrida, Hélène Cixous, and Haraway, among others. As Christopher Keep tells us in "Growing Intimate with Monsters: Shelley Jackson's Patchwork Girl and the Gothic Nature of Hypertext," because of this narrative structure, "the corpse buried here is also the corpus, the material form of a creature that disturbs conventional distinctions between animal and inanimate, the authentic and the inauthentic, the born and the manufactured" (1). In this way Patchwork Girl highlights the technologies, reproductive and otherwise, that always make text/ body itself an assemblage. Part of highlighting how the text/body is an assemblage in Patchwork Girl revolves around rewriting one of Frankenstein's more disturbing scenes: the abortion of the female monster. In Shelley's novel, Victor's male monster, shunned from society and unbearably lonely, begs and blackmails Victor into creating a mate for him so that he can live life with one who is just "as deformed and horrible"</page><page sequence="10">Latimer 327 as he and who "would not deny herself to" him (Shelley 168). Vic tor agrees to make the monster a mate, but is suspicious his next creation will disgust him just as much as his first. As he assembles the female monster he begins to imagine that she could mate with the male monster and "make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror" (190). He becomes so terrified at the thought of her procreating that he tears her to pieces mid-assembly and aborts his creation while the male monster watches in astonishment and grief.4 Jackson picks up the female monster's story at this exact instant and brings her to life in all her aborted glory. In Jackson's text, however, the monster is in control. In the link called "her," Jackson states: "I told her [Mary] to abort me, raze me from her book; I did not want what he wanted. I laughed when my parts lay scattered on the floor, scattered as the bodies from which I had been sprung, discontinuous as I myself rejoice to be. I danced in front of the disassembly."5 This passage encapsulates the tone of Jackson's text, with its joy in rupture and discontinuity, and it is one of many where the monster laughs at the abject messiness of her birth and her body. Part male, part female, part animal, 175 years old, and "razed" up through hypertext technology, the patch work girl is a different type of cyborg than discussed thus far; she is a reproductive freak whose story only comes into being through hypertext and who embraces her flaws at every turn of the story. For instance, her multiple body parts and memories mean she has access to multiple personalities, both male and female. She is also frequently mistaken as a transsexual and gawked at for being unusually large. As opposed to other fictional cyborgs, who are often unable to cross the "gendered boundary between male and female" because it is so "heavily guarded despite new technologized ways to rewrite the physical body" (Balsamo 9), the patchwork girl subverts naturalized markers of gender in this appearance. She therefore embodies many of the imagined potential horrors of reproduction and reproductive technologies in that she is a cyborg who is queer, disproportioned, and visibly scarred.6 She both facilitates and undermines preoccupa tions with the benefits and dangers of reproductive technologies by embracing all of the monstrosities that reproductive/fetal screenings are imagined to "catch" and one day prevent. Here, however, these genetic flaws are viewed as playful attributes in the story. One of the ways the story posits a concept of new reproductive technologies outside the norm is by having the monster aware of how her birth was assisted. The monster knows that she is an as semblage of body parts rather than a unified self because she carries memories of her own creation as well as those she is made up from: "the different creatures from whose parts she is made retain their</page><page sequence="11">328 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies distinctive personalities" (Hayles, "Flickering" 24). For instance, in the link called "tongue" the monster states "my tongue belonged to Susannah, who talked more than she ate, and ate more than the baker and butcher combined." Attributing her taste to Susannah's tongue, her mirth to Margaret's lips, and her affectionate nature to Richard's liver, the monster draws attention to her assembled body in a way that plays with modern ideas about genetics; she carries the emotions and memories of those whose organs have been transplanted into her while also developing her own distinct personality. This works to undo what Hartouni argues is often the appeal of studying genetics or genome mapping: the idea that genes are "a self-evident guarantee of individual originality and authenticity as well as of cultural diver sity." The patchwork girl's multiple subjectivities make any retreat to ideals of originality or authenticity impossible as her unique genetic makeup allows her to carry these other personalities and traits while also maintaining her own agency. As she tells us in the "mementos" link, her body parts will remember her one day too: "I will still act, dispersed as I am, catalyzing group actions, tics, a stitch in the side. My erstwhile foot, returned to its owner, will know the tango." Unlike actual studies of genetics, then, which often redefine "us as geneti cally distinct individuals . . . [while] rather ironically, rendering] us genetically determined" (118), the patchwork girl's multiplicity opens up endless genetic possibilities and connections; she can draw on the strengths of those whom she is made from when need be and make them part of her always-shifting, always-birthing self. The patchwork girl has had many parents and many births, and the hypertext's multiple storylines remove reproduction from a hetero sexual matrix and place it in a distinctly feminine and queer setting. Mary not only births the patchwork girl through sewing her, but also parents her while also becoming her lover. In the link "sewn," Mary states that she had sewn her monster until "the tiny black stitches wavered into script and I began to feel I was writing." Mary becomes unaware of whether she is writing or sewing the monster's body. This theme of sewing together body, text, and meaning continues as Mary confesses she is both fearful of and erotically attracted to her creation, and she and the monster make love through several links named "turned," "weight," and "her, me." These sexual and familial transgressions accumulate when Mary and the monster trade pieces of skin in a symbolic gesture of their maternal/sexual relationship. This trade works in direct "contrast to the relations between the male monster and Victor Frankenstein" (Hayles, "Flickering" 34) by creating a primal scene between creator and creature that stands in opposition to the violence of Shelley's novel's original abortion. As the monster describes this experience of exchanging skins in the link "join," she</page><page sequence="12">Latimer 329 explains that Mary picks a piece of skin that Percy "will likely never miss," while she picks a scar—"a place where disparate things joined in a way that was my own." She states: "I sliced off a disc of scar tissue . . . and slid it off the point of the knife onto the raw spot on her leg; she took the knife and laid her piece on me." Eagerly con taminating herselfand her body by adding the monster's skin (taken from another's skin of course) to her body, Mary is happy to leave a mark on herself that makes her, like her creature, monstrous, and draws attention to her own compound form. This joyful exchange of skin also changes the monster: through adding Mary's skin she also partly becomes Mary and therefore learns to love herself. She states in the link "us," "The graft took, the bit of skin still a living pink, and so I remember when I was Mary, and how I loved a monster, and became one. I bring you my story, which is ours." Mixing together words, skin, and memory, this joining of mon ster/human, creator/creature, mother/child is a joyful exchange that deliberately disrupts traditional kinship structures. It directly confronts one of the main fears circulating around new reproduc tive technologies: that technologies such as cloning could disrupt the linear sequencing of generations. As Hartouni argues, because kinship structures are "conventionally regarded not as a social or discursive technology, but as a 'natural' and naturally ordered set of arrangements and relationships," one of the more disturbing ideas to opponents of cloning is "the possibility that who we call 'mother' we could also call 'sister'" (123). Patchwork Girl embraces this possibility by making the monster not only child, but also lover, in a manner that disturbs the definitions of these two terms themselves and opens up the possibility for imagining a mother/child relationship that is erotic without being incestuous, both technological and natural. The multiple trajectories of Patchwork Girl transform the stabil ity of the text so that the reader, like the patchwork girl, is always emerging; disruptive activities and ruptures in narrative are not only encouraged but are also insignificant. Chronology is broken and the past and present are presented in a seemingly unlimited number of ways so that a new sense of being in space and time is created within the text and within the user. This new sense of being is further height ened by the text's constant references to the patchwork girl's body. As Balsamo notes, cyborg bodies "cannot be conceived as belonging wholly to either culture or nature. . . . [T]hey not only subvert the certainty of what counts as nature, but as Haraway lays out, they also subvert the certainty of the 'textualization of everything' by pointing to the lived relations of domination that ground cultural reading(s)" (33). A large part of how this subversion of "the textualization of everything" takes place in Patchwork Girl is through the hypertext</page><page sequence="13">330 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies technology, as readers are constantly confronted with the part they play in creating the patchwork girl's story. Reading here is not just a process of interpretation, "it is rather a physical activity. . .. Jackson shows us that electronic texts do not so much passively respond to the interests and choices of the reader as interact dialectically with her" (Keep 4). This means readers of Patchwork Girl encounter a type of cyborg subjectivity themselves since they are intertwined with the technology that controls the story's creation; they sew their own monster and their own monstrous text while recognizing that their desire to interact with the monster spurs their choices and decides their links. The technology therefore mingles "the subjec tivity we attribute to characters, authors, and ourselves as readers, with the non-anthropomorphic actions of the computer program" (Hayles, "Flickering" 51). Functioning as a metaphor for the ability to live different and sometimes contradictory narratives Patchwork Girl's hypertextuaiity (like the monster's body and the reader's body) is impure, improper, and disorienting. This blurs the lines between human and monster, text and body, reader and writer—a blurring that drastically alters the original version of subjectivity portrayed in Shelley's novel. The ideal image of the unique individual in full possession of himself is radically undermined in Jackson's hypertext as readers encounter a narrative structure that challenges idealized concepts of a unified or autonomous text while thematically chal lenging definitions of monstrosity and reproduction. The patchwork girl is able to break down the integrity of the human body in the manner outlined by Haraway because she is a "creature in a post-gender world" that "has no origin story in the Western sense" ("Cyborg" 150). This lack of origins extends not only to how she connects to other bodies, but also animals, and even to particles. For instance, in a link named "self swarm" she states, "I am made up of a multiplicity of anonymous particles, and have no absolute boundaries. I am a swarm." Seeing the body as fantastical and imaginative, we are also told in "bio" that "the body as seen by biology is chimerical" and in "identities" that "we find ourselves to be cyborgs, hybrids, mosaics, chimeras."7 These instances offer examples in the text of seeing the body as free from totalizing dis courses in the way that Haraway outlines. Not only is the patchwork girl an assemblage of bodies and fluid subjectivities, she also con nects to other inanimate objects. This not only "normalize[s] the subject-as-assemblage, but also present[s] the subject-as-unity as a grotesque impossibility" (Hayles, "Flickering" 29), as the body is multiple, non-physical, and flowing. Yet the body here is not seen as belonging wholly to the fantastical either. The patchwork girl not only subverts what counts as natural through this multiplicity, but</page><page sequence="14">Latimer 331 she also subverts the postmodern fantasy that everything is open to textualization. She suggests the body is a constructed text, yet reminds us of the times she is outcasted or scorned for that body, thereby pointing "to the lived relations of domination that ground cultural reading(s)" (Balsamo 33). In this way the patchwork girl highlights all the technologies—reproductive, cultural, biological, cybernetic, and hypertextual—that construct the body. She chal lenges definitions of monstrosity by constantly referring to the state of her deformed and genetically modified body, expressed through a narrative structure that is itself neither unified nor autonomous. This offers a counter-narrative to the naturalized subjectivity that is often ascribed to the fetal cyborg, while also undermining the monstrous subjectivity ascribed to Victor's monster. Political Considerations I want to conclude by returning to an area of Haraway's essay often overlooked. The first section of "A Cyborg Manifesto," describ ing what a cyborg "is," is obviously the one most often taken up by theorists. The rest of Haraway's essay, however, makes several argu ments about the state of feminism and socialism. Haraway claims that the cyborg is an essential category in understanding the continuing struggle among feminists to fight gender oppression. These other sections are vital for understanding her goal in making the cyborg part of what she saw as a new mode of thinking, and they are the most relevant pieces of the essay today. As she states, "the cyborg is a disassembled and reassembled, postmodern collective and personal self. This is the self feminists must code" (163). She further asserts "there are great riches for feminists in explicitly embracing the pos sibilities inherent in the breakdown of clean distinctions between or ganism and machine and similar distinctions structuring the Western self" (174). One of these distinctions is gender, and Haraway goes so far as to suggest, at the height of radical feminism no less, that "gender might not be global identity after all, even if it has profound historical breadth and depth" (180). Asking readers to consider the idea that the cyborg might be the subject who can "suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves" (181), Haraway insists it is not only that the cyborg has the potential to disrupt dualisms, but also that these disruptions could lead to a breakdown in the "logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals" (Balsamo 33). In hoping for a "monstrous world without gender" (Haraway, "Cyborg" 181), Haraway's cyborg is not only about liber</page><page sequence="15">332 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies ating the subject from its material confines, but also about finding new ways to understand the body itself. The fetal cyborg has not been able to help us see our way out of the maze in the way Haraway outlines. In fact, the fetal cyborg's subversiveness has been undermined by its image, so that it no longer exposes dualisms but helps erase them. Thought of as "autonomous, self-regarding, and more or less self-sufficient" (Hartouni 126), fetal subjectivity is portrayed in new reproductive technologies as "a self evident fact of nature or a sexed, stable, noncontingent value" (125). In contrast, Jackson's fictional portrayal challenges the self-evident appeal of the fetal cyborg and does make some of the suggestions Haraway outlines. Unfortunately, the affect of this challenge does not reverberate in the political and public domain with the same in fluence: Patchwork Girl's hypertext technology is already becoming old fashioned, and its intended audience is quite small. As opposed to the ways that the fetal icon circulates, or to the predominance of cyborg images in general, Jackson's cyborg has a smaller cultural impact for these reasons, regardless of Jackson's clever appropriation of Shelley's famous text. Compared to the fetal cyborg, therefore, the political impact of Jackson's text is marginal despite its interven tions into both literary studies and reproductive politics. However, this does not take away from the text's significance as an example of the subversive potential of fictional representations of cyborgs. What Patchwork Girl lacks in direct political power it gains as a model for the potential creative texts have to engage the images and fantasies sustaining reproductive politics. The way the fetal image is popularly constructed limits the subversive potential cyborg theory has in connection to reproduc tive technologies. This is why we need to seek out representations of cyborgs, and of reproductive technologies, where the machine/ human dualism is not only disrupted, but broken down, such as in Jackson's hypertext. Like Haraway's work, Jackson's text points to a specific moment in literary history and cultural theory that continues to affect how we think about the connections between reproduction, technology, and the body. Hayles argues that as valuable as Har away's cyborg has been, we now need new figures to help us theorize the ways that technology is changing our world ("Unfinished" 160). I argue, however, that whereas the figure of the cyborg may have run its course in some areas of the media or politics, such as in the instance of the fetal cyborg, the way it is explored in fictional texts is relevant and useful for making sense of current connections between posthuman theories and reproductive technologies. As long as we continue to talk about and understand new and assisted reproductive technologies—such as stem ceil research or cloning—through liter</page><page sequence="16">Latimer 333 ary allusions to "Franken-babies" or clichéd apocalyptic narratives, fictional representations of cyborgs will play an essential role in the social and cultural conditions of how reproductive technologies are imagined, talked of, and used. It is possible that it is only through fictional texts that we will continue to find the cyborgs that are able to undo the naturalized subjectivity that the image of the fetus cur rently evokes. Notes I would like to thank Peter Dickinson and Margaret Linley for thoughtful comments on earlier versions of this article, as well as the anonymous reviewers at MFS. A special thanks to Margaret as well for introducing me to Jackson's hypertext. 1. Consider, for instance, the controversy over "Dolly the sheep" or the 1995 "Dickey Amendment," and the continued controversy in the US over stem cell research and cloning. Despite the March 9, 2009, executive order from President Obama removing the restriction against federal funding of stem cell research, the Dickey Amendment remains an obstacle for federally-funded researchers. See Franklin {Dolly Mixtures), Ganchoff, Green, Maienschien, Sparrow, and Squier. 2. Writing at the end of the Cold War, Haraway was responding to technological pushes such as Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars" program. See Fitzgerald, for instance. 3. Jay Clayton and a host of other Frankenstein theorists have noted that there is a strong connection between the Romantic period and our own when it comes to critiques of the effects of technology and science as well as of Enlightenment discourses in general. Clayton actually argues that the novel is both anti-Enlightenment and anti Romantic (128). 4. Halberstam argues that it is because Victor connects monstrosity with maternity that he is unable to create a female monster as a companion for his male monster. Halberstam cites the differences between Victor's feelings when creating the male monster (ego-driven delight and rapture) and the female monster (disgust and fear) and states that it is the idea of building a womb that stops Victor from finishing his second creation. Although Victor is able to create a male monster out of corpses and animal parts with ease, he is conversely disgusted at creating a female subject that would essentially be "all body." Victor becomes paralyzed by the "material horror" of the fe male monster and the idea of "female genitals enrages and terrifies the scientist [so much] that he tears her limb from limb and scatters her flesh upon the ground" (47).</page><page sequence="17">334 Shelley Jackson and Reproductive Technologies 5. Laura Shackelford makes the excellent point that in quoting a single text box "one cannot do justice to the movements between lexias and interrelations these movements reveal" (78). As the text has a seemingly unlimited amount of pathways, the meaning of each textual box changes depending on the path of links one followed to get there and where they go next. 6. For instance, one could argue she evokes all of the fear surrounding the "gay gene" controversy. See Simon Levay's Queer Science for more on this controversy in the US. 7. Jackson is paying homage to Haraway here, as this is a rewriting of her words. Works Cited Balsamo, Anne. Technologies of the Gendered Body: Reading Cyborg Women. Durham: Duke UP, 1996.
