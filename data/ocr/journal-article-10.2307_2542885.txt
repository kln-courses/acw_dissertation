<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sixteenth Century Journal XXV/2 (1994) Structuring Protestant Scriptural Space in Sixteenth-Century Catholic France Catharine Randall (Coats) Barnard College at Columbia University Calvinist architects of the period prior to and during the Edict of Nantes experi- enced constraint and repression concerning their doctrinal observance and expres- sion. These architects worked for Catholic patrons. In fact, nearly all the architectes du roi, official architects for the king, were confessional Calvinists, who executed com- missions for Catholics. These architects consequently experienced tension concern- ing how to convey their beliefs in a system which did not espouse them. As a result, they devised coded structures which worked iconographically to subvert the Catholic state. That is, the ornamental scheme of the structures was legible on one level, but would convey to the scripturally literate Calvinist a different message from that on the surface. In this program, they were influenced by the spatial concerns and struc- turing program of the ideal city of God as delineated in Calvin's Institutes. One such architect who closely implemented some of Calvin's strategies was Bernard Palissy, a Calvinist potter, constructor of gardens, builder of structures, and author of geologi- cal and architectural texts, most notably the Recepte veritable. The Recepte veritable, or "true recipe," suggests how the fallen world may be restructured in accordance with scriptural mandates, thus bringing the world into line with Calvinist rather than Catholic expectations. CALVINIST WRITERS HELD SCRIPTURE UP OVER AGAINST ROME, claiming the Roman ecclesiastical body to be "deformed," a wayward construction which did not implement the dictates of God's Word. Protestants made this claim as a result of the psychological and spatial constraint they experienced. During the oscillation of power bases circa 1560-1570, France remained territorially a Catholic country; there was no sure space for Protestants. The marginalized Protestants, contained within a political space and discourse which condemned their religious observance, had to "go underground" with their beliefs.Yet, paradoxically, the primary articu- lators of aesthetic expression in Catholic France during this period were artists of the Protestant confession.1 These Calvinist architects who worked for the Catholic hierarchy, executing official architectural commissions, nevertheless continued to write documents and to devise structures which, while apparently aligned with official strictures, in fact called for the reformation of the overarching order. Through their official function, they lobbied for a Protestant scriptural space. A 1Janine Garrison, L'Edit de Nantes et sa revocation (Paris: Editions du Seuil, 1985); esp. 29-37. 341</page><page sequence="2">342 Sixteenth Century Journal XXV / 2 (1994) Calvinist structural aesthetics resulted-one which camouflaged and redefined space in a subversive theological sense.2 This structural aesthetics is extrapolated from John Calvin's discussion of space in the Institution de la religion chrestienne.3 Indeed, Calvin has been called a "church Architect," and "an architect of reconstruction."4 In 1532, a date at which sectarian hostilities were beginning to flare up intermittently (as in the Affaire des Placards), yet were not consistently incendiary, Calvin still hoped to work around existing spatial allocation to find a place for Protestantism within France.5 Yet Calvin also already sensed the spatial constraints that would soon officially hinder his doctrinal observance. He wrote from a position of self-imposed exile in Strasburg, and completed the document in Switzerland. 6 The Institution's structure is antithetical, antithesis itself being a spatializing rhetorical device in which con- trary categories are arrayed and measured against each other.7 The book serves as a structuring tool in redefining a portion of Catholic-occupied space in France: "seeing that the fury of certain evil men had so risen in your Kingdom that it had left no space for any holy doctrine, it seemed that I should press my book into ser- vice [of our cause]."8 The Institution delineates the blueprint for a new structure, that of the Calvin- ist church. Despite the attempt of the Catholic hierarchy to assign negative space to Calvin ("they believe it should be chased out even beyond the earth and the sea"), Calvin situates Protestant doctrine in the redeemed space described by his text: "I have herein contained a summary of that very doctrine." Calvin condemns Cathol- icism as an unwarranted spatial aggression; Catholics "overstep the limits" of scrip- turally licensed behavior. Calvin aims at restructuring the space that he reclaims from Catholicism: "everything has fallen into ruin such ... that it is necessary to reestablish order."9 Calvinist architects devise and implement a coded hidden agenda in their con- structions, strictly construing scripture as Calvin had advised, producing icono- graphically complex works which can be interpreted on at least two registers. One level of meaning is visual; it is therefore acceptable to Catholic authorities.The sec- 2Such a program of subversive structuring can be found in the works of most Post-Tridentine Cal- vinist architects. I examine these in a manuscript in progress entitled "The (Dis)ordering of Power: Cal- vinist Stuctures and the Catholic State." 3Ford Lewis Battles, "Introduction," in Calin's Institutes (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1979), pro- vides a table that resembles an architectural blueprint; it describes the relationships among the contents of the chapters of the Instituiton; see esp. 16. 4R.

During his career, he planned and supervised gardens, grottoes, and buildings in his role as king's architect; however, the structures he describes here remain entexted. Thus, their subversive strength can only be tested within the space of the text.The text functions as an entryway for the reader to the structure of faith. Con- sequently, the Recepte demands a textual architectural participation, to shape and construct a Protestant adherence. In the first structure, Palissy reacts to religious persecution by envisioning a garden mined by a substratum of cavelike cells. These alveolae are protected spaces in which the believer may meditate on the divine. The garden exists in the inner hollow of a mountain; an interior structure, hidden in grottoes, it literalizes Calvin's call for a focus on the "inner man" and the reformation of his heart. Such an internal realignment restructures the soul and ignores the external world.11 The garden and grottoes can be read as texts; they contain mosaics, citations and maxims, narrating "the hieroglyph of a life according to God."12 Portions of scripture as well as symbols compose an emblematic image evocative of right wor- ship, one that visually challenges the deceptive emphasis of Catholicism which construes image alone, that scripturally sanctioned image, as truth. 13 Palissy's Protestant structure is generated by, and is in relation to, the word. Palissy recalls Calvin's structuring technique in, for example, Des scandales, where the entire work is based on selections from scripture which Calvin cites in the final part of the book. He does not incorporate scripture textually, but rather quotes solid blocks of thematically related scripture (devoid of links effected by human commentary) as pillars upholding his textual edifice. A different textual treatment working to the same effect is found in Calvin's Institution, where biblical passages are cited both as motivating factors for Calvin's doctrinal discussions and as sup- ports for his theses. Palissy combines these two models of scriptural processing in the Recepte. His garden structures do not explicitly interweave with the scriptural quotations which label them. Palissy's reader must explicate the connections between scripture and Recepte. In describing the scene of inspiration preliminary to his construction, Palissy proceeds, as does Calvin in the Institution, by inscribing himself directly and inter- actively into the scriptural text. Palissy's garden originates in his response to the declamation of Psalm 104.The Psalm functions as the foundation, in a literal sense, 10Pierre Bourdieu, Lalguiage and Symbolic Powver (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1991). 1Lefebvre, Production, 33. 12Frank Lestringant, "Le Prince et le potier," Nouvelle revue dul seizieme siecle (1985): 3, 11. 13A similar distinction is that between "sacramentals"-superstitious rites derived from Catholic ritual-and the few sacraments recognized by Calvin.</page><page sequence="4">344 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXV / 2 (1994) of the garden: "I want to erect my garden on Psalm 104, where the Prophet describes the marvelous works of the Lord."14 Palissy employs deictics, or locational phrases, to point out spatial coordinates in the biblical passage (e.g., "where the Prophet describes"). Psalm 104 portrays God as "sovereign architect and builder," blessed for having "established its dwell- ing" and "founded the earth upon its bases." Palissy replicates the structure of God's creation. God ordains that waters will flow to mountains, following a fixed route. Palissy's emphasis on the waters which irrigate the area illuminates his rationale for the garden. Each source that flows through a "cabinet" produces "a hundred tribu- taries" which then reconverge in the central room (136, 147). The manifold streams of water figure the dissemination of the divine Word, as Palissy's structure places similar emphasis on the components of water and Word.15 Finally, Palissy's structure fashions a place for the Holy Spirit, the ruach or wind of scripture. A stream bisects the garden, then circles a small islet, producing a wind tunnel (153). The central space of the garden's grid thus includes the symbol of inspiration, the animated Word. In Genesis, God divided space, and spoke the world into creation. In Psalm 104, God provides in detail for creation; Palissy catalogs each of these elements: grain, water, wine, cattle, birds.16 The Psalmist's praise of divine structures closes with a condemnation of those who do not participate in them.To enter into these structures, therefore, implies redemption, regeneration, and sinlessness. Palissy's spiritual program reworks secular models as well. However, while admiring Vitruvius, Palissy rejects most of what worldly models have to offer (208-9). He contrasts such architects with God. Palissy confers a spiritual stamp on those elements which he does borrow from secular models. He hopes thereby to realize God's kingdom on earth. Biblical and architectural intertexts, inspiration, and artifice create in Palissy's garden what Gerard Genette has termed an "archi- text": an entexted structure, and a structured text, which calls for guided reading and interpretation within a privileged place. Religious persecution renders such a space problematic and precious; like Calvin, Palissy acknowledges the difficulty of finding adequate space in which to build: "Some enemies of virtue ... say that the design for this garden is but a dream ... no one would be able to find an appropriate place [for it]" (44). He finds that space only within the reader: the text "fallen into the hands of" the reader takes shape through the reading act, which mimes the Alpha and the Omega of all creation: "I assure you that you will only find in this book things which will 14Bernard Palissy, La Recepte veritable, ed. Keith Cameron (Geneva: Droz, 1988). All page refer- ences in the text are to this edition. 15Calvin, Institution, 1:23, speaks of the significance of water, describing a movement of water continued by tributaries. 16Calvin, Institution, 4:290-91, meditates on the structuring of creation: "God created them for us and destined them for us; he created them for our well-being ... he created meats ... clothing ... that which was right and fitting for grasses, trees, and fruits .. other metals and stones."</page><page sequence="5">Structuring Protestant Scriptural Space in Catholic France 345 profit you ... those things which at the beginning seemed to you impossible, you will at the end find ... easy to believe" (52). The Institution mandates the correctly aligned construction of religious obser- vance. In response, the title of the Recepte veritable alerts the reader to the existence of an appropriate articulation and application of such a structure. An interchange between man and God occurs in the Recepte: the reader, figuring the Calvinist Everyman, inserts himself into Palissy's (sacred) space, and in so doing, is "received by God." Randle Cotgrave's Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (1611) lists the second meaning of recepte as "a receiving, taking, accepting, admitting."17 This "reception" figures salvation within the space of the text. Similarities with the Garden of Eden highlight the personalized aspect of what Palissy insistently calls "my garden." The cruciform garden recalls the Christ who informs it, although it does not mimetically recreate the Passion, as would a Cath- olic structure. It moves beyond the Passion; Christ now indwells the believer's heart. Contemporary landscape designers consciously strove to recreate the Garden of Eden, requiring, for instance, sowers to plant an entire garden in a single day, duplicating the one day of the Lord's work on that particular facet of creation.18 Palissy's garden, however, is not exclusively horticultural, but is also architectural: it contains buildings which interrupt undivided perspective, attesting to the impossi- bility of ever reattaining the coherence of Paradise.These disruptive buildings stand as testimony of the fallen nature of the world. They also contain its remedy: they provide instructive spaces for meditation on how to conform oneself to scripture. The garden provides a meeting place for the symbolic interpenetration of metaphysical and terrestrial spheres, and the potential recuperation of the latter. For instance, each of the four arms of the garden's format terminates in a "cabinet." Four more "cabinets" stud the crossbars of the garden.The stroller through Palissy's garden, then, continually enters into and emerges from structures. These construc- tions deny him participation in a prelapsarian nature, while they also propose a strategy for obviating the consequences of the Fall. The "cabinet," as Palissy con- ceives it, prefigures the museum or scientific showcase of the Encyclopedists; here, the "cabinet" contains aspects of creation upon which experiments will be effected to attempt to lift nature out of its postlapsarian contamination and redeem it spiri- tually. In addition, Palissy refers to his own "cabinet" or "study," thus inscribing his own personal, safe space within the space of the text. His description of his "cabi- net," where in meticulously labeled glass cases he collates geologic specimens is both the miniature version of the "cabinets" contained in his garden text, as well as a paradigm for how to interpret those garden structures. His "cabinet" epitomizes the attempt to take pieces of creation and to reinstate order upon them by puzzling out the narrative of their relationships. In his garden, Palissy enacts the same pro- gram on a larger scale; he seeks to lift deformed humanity back into the order of creation mandated by scripture. From this new order, a new creation will ensue: 17Randle Cotgrave, A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues (London: Dent, 1611). 18John Prest, The Garden of Eden: The Botanic Garden and the Re-Creation of Paradise (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990), 24.</page><page sequence="6">346 Sixteenth Century Journal XXV / 2 (1994) each "cabinet" stands along a water conduit; the entire garden partakes of a moun- tain water source, centralizing in its structure the living waters of baptism. In delineating his structure, Palissy makes a pilgrimage through it, embodying the construction in the act of reading. Interior spaces, theaters which situate the self within scripturally determined space, honeycomb the structure. Each "cabinet" is furnished with niches and seats built into the walls.The walls are ornamented with hand-lettered verses from scripture. "Along the frieze some old-fashioned letters will be inscribed:'.. God takes pleasure in nothing, except in the man in whom Wisdom dwells"' (129). The structure actualizes the indwelling of wisdom in a restructuring of the human body and soul; the "cabinet" is imploded, resituated within the believer ("in the man in whom Wisdom dwells"). Seats await the reader who will stroll through sacred space. Stopping inside the "cabinets" to rest, the reader becomes part of the decor.The reader is written back into the structure of scripture, because he serves as the focal point, or ultimate referent, of the biblical quotations which encircle his head in a panoramic pattern.The reader is thus a component of a scrip- tural emblem (word, image, gloss) within the structure: he constitutes the image upon which God's word comments and which Palissy's phrases gloss. Each chamber of Palissy's construction showcases sculpture, as well as an unusual form of wall ornament; melted enamels blur together, suggesting "figures and ideas." Palissy's structure here recalls Plato's cave, in which a higher reality is dimly apprehended. Palissy states that his viewer will enter, and behold himself in the brilliant reflection of the enameled walls, at first mistaking himself for part of the decor, one statue among many (130). In the Institution Calvin uses the term miroir to explain the functioning of the sacraments.19 The mirrorlike sacrament conveys an "external sign," a guarantor of election. Thus, within Palissy's redemptive structure, humanity perceives itself changed into a sign of a higher reality. The theme of resurrection completes the theme of election; white pebbles, as mentioned in the book of Rev- elation, and as construed by Calvinists as a sign of elect status, stud the walls of the second "cabinet" (143). This careful construction is actually calculated to deconstruct itself. Palissy's ultimate aim is not that of any concrete edifice, but rather that of a provisional form, the paradigm of a process, which will enact the reformation of the created order (and will then no longer be necessary). Disguised under hillocks, his garden pavilions project trompe-loeil images; they do not have the shape or semblance of buildings constructed by human artifice. They prefigure the restoration of natural order and harmony, and the concomitant elision of divisive aspects of humanity. Similarly, the representational component of Palissy's structures, their sculpted decoration, proceeds from form to chaos to deformity, and finally to amorphous- ness, recalling the theological schema of world-a world marked by sin, the elim- ination of the world, and its creation anew. Within the edifice, Palissy dissolves the 19Calvin, Institution, 3:201: "In calling them mirrors ... the sacraments bring us clear promises, and in addition to their words, show them to us as though they were paintings."</page><page sequence="7">Structuring Protestant Scriptural Space in Catholic France 347 distortion of humanity. First, he sculpts Archimboldo-like portraits and statues, in which recognizable human features are replaced with recuperable (because unim- plicated in humanity's evils) natural elements. Next, Palissy designs sculptures in which formerly discernible features blur into the air, facilitating their transmutation into organic form and substance. The grotto reabsorbs man, recasts him within the scriptural mold, and integrates him into the salvific structure. The face of that form is eaten away by the air; it has for eyes two shells, the hollows of which [suggest] the orbits of the eyes ... eaten by the air and filled with foam ... nevertheless this form still retains some shape like to human form. (251) The movement toward organicity is not entirely effective, however; aspects of humanity obstinately persist. Finally, Palissy implements his third technique: from the remnant of humanity he creates an artificed construction encoded in his own sense: he will redeem humanity by overlayering it with a different iconography. While his structures look natural (grottoes, fountains, caves), artifice increasingly characterizes Palissy's constructions. For his re-creation can only proceed within a modified, controlled nature juxtaposed with a theological model. Palissy's structure resumes the drama of sin and salvation, picturing the human first as a "Terme": a pillarlike armless statue, which may, for Palissy, represent man, truncated, after the Fall. He then evokes humanity as a brutalized mass, misshapen and hideous, epito- mizing man's sinful nature ("not competently sculpted, but as though someone were mocking them in shaping them, and battering them out with great blows of a hammer" (132). Palissy subsequently portrays the dissolution of fallen humanity: "twisted, humped ... lacking any appearance or form of sculpted artistry" (133). The grotesque character of Palissy's tortured, twisted, encrusted constructions defies interpretation, prohibiting the reader from relying on terrestrial reality: nature's ornateness only limns the void below the ornament. Geoffrey Harpham notes that "grotesqueries both require and defeat definition ... they stand at a mar- ginal consciousness ... calling into question the adequacy of our ways of organiz- ing the world."20 Palissy's structures stand as liminal markers of the passage from human reliance on appearance, since, for the Calvinist, appearances are sinful and misleading. This monstrous composite nevertheless will result in reconstruction. As structure, with rearranged and reassigned meaning, man can stand for his salvation.21 Incorporation in the structure relegitimizes humanity as well as nature. Changed anew, reformed, scriptural conformity characterizes humanity in Palissy's structures: "These things had proved so effective, that the people had changed their ways of acting, even their expressions" (201). Nature is similarly scripturally realigned. Anthropomorphic trees compose one "cabinet": the trees possess "heads" and "legs." Grafted and cultivated in speaking shapes, the trees are re-formed by Palissy as structural components in a new cre- ation. The trees hold letters, fragments of words, and signs. Just so the figure of the 20Geoffrey Harpham, On the Grotesqule (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982), 43. 21Palissy's automata also function as models of salvation's effects and process.</page><page sequence="8">348 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXV / 2 (1994) lecteur/promeneur situates itself in a pattern of readership within the garden the- aters inscribed with scriptural citations. Palissy's writing, from which his structure originates, is scripturally modeled; he distinguishes it from secular writing. Profane letters, self-aggrandizement, and human pride are all ephemeral because not structured on right religious obser- vance: "[There are] a great number of various coats of arms, letters and devices, but these things last only briefly, and must constantly be refurbished" (139).In the space of his text, where he is free to describe scriptural structuring, Palissy implicitly con- demns those secular works which he himself has planned, supervised, and con- structed. He thereby subverts his cooperation with Catholic authorities. Ecouen's interior of enameled frescoes, the devises on Anet's walls,22 are now of no signifi- cance because they do not derive from a scriptural scenario; they show no salvific sign. Scripture here moves out of a habitual architectural site ("will emerge from the ... cornice"), a locus now void, without purpose ("the frieze will remain empty"), to resituate itself within recuperated nature. The frieze will remain empty, and to adorn the frieze I will simply bend some branches which will emerge from the ... cornice ... I will have each one hold an old-fashioned letter ... in writing there will be ... a passage taken from the Book ofWisdom. (141) Secular building is thereby destabilized. Nature becomes the sole repository of bib- lical truth. Palissy's subterranean structure now moves upward into the light (it is "open to daylight," "diaphanous" -142-43), postulating a resurrection through structure. An outward thrust seconds this upward movement, demonstrating the Calvinist attempt to reclaim space:"I want to erect my garden in a place where there will be a field nearby, so that sometimes one could walk out of the garden into the field" (127). Frank Lestringant analyzes the garden's role as "representing henceforth more an horizon than a specific endpoint, a line of transgression rather than a defined space."23 Palissy's constructions create "Chinese boxes" of structure within structure: the reader enters the "cabinet" to be reconfigured by and in it, yet he in turn becomes that structure which will house wisdom and which will conform itself to God's word. This imbricated schema mimics the scriptural construction of the edifices, for if scripture shapes the structure, that structure's blueprint exists already in scrip- ture. Palissy's interlocutor in the text asks him, "Where do you think it possible to find a suitable place for your design?" (159). Palissy responds24 that such a space can be found in many places (loci) of scripture (161). He conflates the Bible with his Recepte.They occupy the same space. 22W. H.Ward, ed., French Chateaux and Gardens in the Sixteenth Century (London, 1809), 18, 34. 23Lestringant, "Le Prince," 22. 24Palissy also represents himself via the interlocutor labeled Responsce in this dialogue.</page><page sequence="9">Structuring Protestant Scriptural Space in Catholic France 349 Scriptural quotations constitute a network of situational loci.The first citation, "God takes no pleasure in anything, but in the man in whom Wisdom dwells" (129), extends the structure of the building by making man, too, an architectural site: wisdom will occupy the space of the rightly disposed heart. The stroller/ walker's attention to scripture will produce a transference between interiority and exteriority which imitates the interrelation of garden and grotto in Palissy's design: through a play of shining surfaces, several representations contained in the garden seem to show forth that which is in fact found outside. Another citation suggests a pilgrimage towards stabilized significance:"Wisdom does not live in a body marked by sin, nor in an evil-disposed soul" (132).The search for a place "in which to live" underscores the need for the architecture of salvation, demonstrating that man himself must become a structure articulated in and through scripture. Scripturally modeled structures and spaces provide the theater for the enact- ment of salvation in the text of this Calvinist architect. Palissy does not hesitate to privilege his book, linking reading with reformation; both his text and the biblical text structure a sacred architecture. He describes the establishment of the Reformed church at Saintes, where he lived and worked, as erected upon scripture: One Sunday he gathered together 9 or 10 people ... he had chosen some passages from the Old and New Testaments, and written them down ... he read them .....That was the beginning of the Reformed Church at Saintes. (197). As in the garden "cabinets," reading effects the translation of humanity from secular to sacred space, and initiates the propaedeutic restructuring necessary for salvation. However, as Palissy draws up his plans he realizes that at least a portion of humanity cannot be rehabilitated. He enters the realm of history (the section of the book in which he describes an idealized fortress entitled "History") and abandons that of eschatology, by acknowledging the need for a secular fortress to shelter Cal- vinists. Compelling the reader to attend to word, Palissy refuses to include an illustra- tion of his structure in the book. Rather, the proof must be constituted within the reader. The reader must be changed, restructured, reformed, just as Palissy was inspired by his audition of the Psalm to create a scriptural structure. The reader becomes internally such a scriptural structure, even as the focus of the book now moves to that of secular shelters. Once again Palissy shows that the salvific space for which he yearns is in fact found within the believer's heart. Palissy infinitely defers the procress of actual representation; having described his garden in text, he proposes to concretize its aims in yet another structure, a city of refuge for persecuted Protestants: and then I began to imagine another beautiful painting which would rep- resent the passages which the Prophet describes in that Psalm, but soon after I changed my mind, since pictures only last a short time. And I thought to find a suitable place to erect a garden according to the design</page><page sequence="10">350 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXV / 2 (1994) ... I could afterwards construct an amphitheater as refuge to receive Christians exiled in times of persecution. (58). Yet, Palissy never represents this structure either, but only describes it, as he concludes his text with an imaginative, that is, spiritual and spiritualized ("figured within my spirit") architecture which leads always beyond itself to the divine. The structuring attempt shifts into the atemporal Eternal (which Calvin also describes as a space25), perpetuating the notion of a salvific structure, preserving it from the damage and eventual destruction which befalls representation. The significance of these structures never achieving physical realization is that as idealized and unactualized structures, they form a space of textual commentary. The constructions in Palissy's text thus serve two functions. First, they indict his- tory: Catholic abuses are seen as blocking God's plan for Creation. Second, they offer one zone free from the consequences of the Fall: that of the text itself. Palissy places the fortress in proximity to the garden. His blueprint details his Reformed understanding of history: structure and space represent paradise, the Fall and the remnant (the beleaguered fortress of the Calvinist faithful). Enclosed within text, Palissy's structures describe a further text which comments on salvation history. At the same time, these structures maintain a space for the preservation of persecuted Protestants. Palissy's structures subvert Catholic order in two ways. Their purpose is not only to reform ideology, but to protect Protestants, physically. Palissy persuades the king of the merit of his structures by conferring on them a secular value: he pro- poses his "city of refuge" as a model for military defense: If the king wanted to construct a fortress town anywhere in his kingdom, I could give him a ... model of such a town which would be the most unassailable possible. (217) This offer veils a challenge.The city Palissy offers to the king is "unassailable," even by the king himself. The ironic offer thus establishes the opposition between secu- lar state and spiritual structure, civitas homini and civitas dei. Lestringant notes that Palissy's garden and fortress constitute physical markers of the king's failure to observe his promises of religious toleration. According to Lestringant, Palissy's gar- den "reserves within the heart of the Kingdom a sort of protected space for true believers."26 The Recepte thus actualizes both biblical mandates and secular, political promises. It is the ultimate realization of Word/word, even when, because of his- torical circumstances, that word has been reneged upon. Palissy sketches a second theological morphology of sacred space.The impreg- nability of the fortress, formed, like the garden, on organic prototypes derived from nature, causes us to read history backwards, as though salvation were already attained, and nature and humanity already redeemed. Palissy does not take scripture directly as his prototype for the fortress. Instead, conceding obstacles to his plan of 25Calvin, Institution, 3:166. 26Lestringant, "Le Prince," 12.</page><page sequence="11">Structuring Protestant Scriptural Space in Catholic France 351 prelapsarian conformity to God's will, he resorts to patterns proposed by nature. Nature, once brought into the salvific space of Palissy's garden, now functions as a srriptural authority at second hand.27 Palissy selects the shell of a crustacean called the pourpre as his prototype, because "God granted them the ability to know how to make their own houses, constructed ... according to Geometry and Architecture" (212). Nature, albeit distorted by humanity, possesses God-given attributes which persist and which legitimize it as an alternative source of authority. The spiral form of the shellfish provides an admirable plan for a defensible city. Palissy contradicts the standard Cal- vinist reading of the labyrinth of the world,28 the maze as emblem of the soul trapped in deceitful, fallen nature. Instead, the natural spiral becomes for Palissy a salubrious, protective space. However, as with his fortress, Palissy's fortress evolves from natural to artificial construction. He finds that a spiral will hamper the city's cannon, so he adapts it using right angles (216). Palissy permits himself to alter nature, making nature but one more tool among the frequently listed architectural implements employed in the salvific structuring process:"This is why I then decided to imitate the industri- ousness of this shellfish, but only insofar as it served my purposes" (216). Palissy's emphasis on straight lines in his blueprint reiterates his previous use of the ruler and mason's level in building his garden structures: "I began by marking the outline of the first street, near the square, by continuing to turn around it, in a square shape ... following the shellfish's shell ... by straight lines" (216). Palissy has already associated waywardness and waviness with Catholic deformity. Earlier, pretending to dissect the cranium of a Catholic bishop, Palissy notes that within this man "his head ... had no straight line or even measure in any of its parts ... the madness which was in that head altered all measurements" (176-77).The structures Catho- lics produce are therefore equally skewed. Palissy reinstates the Protestant straight line, which recalls Augustine's plumbline image of the alignment of the believer with God. In the garden and in the fortress, Palissy concretizes Psalm 104, his "pattern." He asks that his reader imitate the structuring attempt, instructing that"I didn't tell you that by means of the blueprint and picture, you could judge the effect of the entire work, but rather that even with the blueprint and picture, it was still neces- sary to make a model of the structure" (221).The text compels the reader to per- form a structuring act which, following Palissy's program, will erect upon a textual prototype (Psalm/Recepte), a structure of faith (Recepte/reader's text).The process of physical and literacy construction in Palissy's text is imbued with a theological approach to, and interpretation of, the world. He reads, and depicts his reader in the process of reading. Locations decorated with biblical verses not only display the significance of each citation, but also surround the reader with scripture transform- 27PierreViret, Metaoworposes chrestiesmes (1561), taught that such "lecons" could be found in nature. 28Huston Diehl, "The Protestant Emblem of the Labyrinth," Jotrnal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies (1986): 1:22.</page><page sequence="12">352 Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXV / 2 (1994) ing the body of the reader into legible surface, imprinted with the Word, shaping a membrane or transition between the world and the heavens. The insertion of the reader represents the incorporation of any reader of the Recepte, including us in the soteric narrative. Post-Tridentine architects such as Palissy answer Catholic intimidation with structures of subversion. Some of these structures are actual. Others are inscribed within texts, observing the Calvinist paradigm of consulting the Word to know the truth. The Recepte effects a confrontation of man and God through a Calvinist theological grid. Palissy's constructions are characterized by their similarities to the spatial pre- occupations manifest in Calvin's Institution. They are also typified by a tension between abstract architecture and concrete construction. Such tension epitomizes the lack of space for the implementation of the Calvinist program in the world, and the opening onto the metaphysical realm of the structure's orientation. Palissy is influenced by his reading of Psalms, and the Book ofWisdom. Both motivate him to structure humanity anew.The progression from word to person to structure which Palissy's text follows imitates the process of redemption in the book of Revelation, which proceeds with the same elements, in the same way.The read- ing of this text creates an architecture of subversion which indicts Catholic terres- trial domination as illusory and damned.</page></plain_text>
