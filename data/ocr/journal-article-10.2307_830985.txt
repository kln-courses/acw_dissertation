<plain_text><page sequence="1">Texture as a Sign in Classic and Early Romantic Music By JANET M. LEVY F ALL THE VARIABLES of a composition, texture is at once the most surface and the most complex. Insofar as it is surface, it seems largely to have been taken for granted; its effects are, after all, so immediate and palpable.' And insofar as it is complex, its analysis has seen little refinement-surely nothing akin to the vocabulary and concepts we have for dealing with melody, harmony, and rhythm. Probably because texture is in many ways the most elusive parameter (once we get beyond customary classifications such as "homophony" or "polyphony"), its role in the delineation of structure and process in Classic and early Romantic music has gone relatively unexplored.2 Yet, simply using ordinary modes of discourse, it is possible to explore certain aspects of texture's role in the syntax of particular movements and, especially, its capacity to function as a sign-both for where we are in a piece and for what may or may not happen next.3 Texture is, of course, an auxiliary variable. Dependent on melody, harmony, and rhythm, and affected by orchestration, register, and so I One indication of the degree to which texture is thought of as the most immediately accessible variable of music is the number of music appreciation texts that begin with aspects of texture and sound, for example, Jean S. Bamberger and Howard Brofsky, The Art ofListening: Developing Musical Perception (New York, 1975). 2 There are some exceptions, such as Wallace Berry, Structural Functions In Music (Englewood Cliffs, 1976), Chap. 2; Frank E. Lorince, Jr., "A Study of Musical Texture in Relation to Sonata-Form As Evidenced in Selected Keyboard Sonatas from C.P.E. Bach Through Beethoven" (Ph.D. diss., Eastman School of Music, Univ. of Rochester, 1966); Orin Moe, "Texture in the String Quartets of Haydn to 1787" (Ph.D. diss., Univ. of California at Santa Barbara, 1970); and Leonard G. Ratner, "Texture, a Rhetorical Element in Beethoven's Quartets," Israel Studies in Musicology, II (1980), 51-62. The points of view represented all differ from one another and from those presented here. 3 Monroe Beardsley gives a useful general definition of "sign": "In its broadest sense, in which it can be applied to words, gestures, and semaphore signals as well as markers that direct our way to exits and rest rooms, the word 'sign' denotes any object or event that stands for something else, or leads us to take account in some way of something besides itself" (Aesthetics: Problems in the Philosophy of Criticism [New York, 1958], p. 332).</page><page sequence="2">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 483 on, it involves the total activity of the component parts in any segment of a composition. Although it cannot exist independently, texture can make the functional and sign relationships created by the other variables more evident and fully effective. The role of texture is in some ways analogous to that of tone of voice or inflection in ordinary speech-a role that is necessary but never sufficient for conveying meaning. Thus, although the discussion will often isolate the role of texture, texture, by definition, can never be the only agent that shapes function.4 The focus of this essay will be on just a few types of conventionalized signs that cut across the repertory of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century music. But I begin with some common- sense matters about the way texture may function as a sign. CONTEXTUAL SIGNS The sign aspects of texture may reside simply in particular sets of associations or idiosyncratic relationships established between or among textures within a given piece. I shall refer to this type of sign- one that arises from contextual treatment within a piece-as a "contextual sign." Most of us are familiar, for example, with so-called false recapitulations in Classic sonata form-as in the first movements of Haydn's Symphony No. 102 (m. 185) and Mozart's Symphony No. 41, the "Jupiter" (m. 161). In both of these examples, after preparatory motions for recapitulation, the melodic material of the opening of the Allegro returns in the "wrong" key. Neither composer relies only on our abilities to recognize that the tonality is wrong. Each reinforces the "false" aspects of false recapitulation by means of texture, instrumentation, and dynamics different from those of the opening statement. The texture in such contexts would be considered one concomitant indication, clue, or sign that we ought not to believe this to be the "real" recapitulation. For a more detailed illustration of how contextual signs may work I turn to the first movement of Haydn's String Quartet in C, Op. 74, No. I. Not only is the opening statement (following the two introductory chords) well-defined by melody and harmony but also, importantly, it is given much of its characteristic stamp by the drum bass accompaniment in the cello (see Example Ia). Supporting the upper three parts harmonically, and furnishing a level of pulse, the drum bass acts as a ground against which the other voices are heard. 4 And, needless to say, a texture under consideration may have functions other than those I discuss.</page><page sequence="3">484 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY (That is, the relationship of the upper parts to the drum bass is analogous to that of a figure against a ground in visual perception.) Typically in this style, a restatement in the same textural arrangement (see mm. i I, and, in V, 3 1) reinforces our association of the opening texture with stability and presentation. A new textural version of the alla breve material occurs for the first time at measure 42, a purely chordal treatment of the opening material of the movement. The absence of the drum bass is conspicuous, as is the concomitant loss of pulse and harmonic underpinning; the chords are now more mobile parallel six-threes (Example I b). And we take this distinctive, primarily textural deviation as a sign that the phrase thus begun will not be another presentation-as in fact it is not.s Particularly because a suggestion of the drum bass occurs in measure 41 (Violin 2) and simply stops at measure 42, the destabilization of the opening material is marked for attention.6 The relative instability provided by this change of texture is intensified in the very next measure (m. 43) by the appearance of a little countersubject (Violin I) against the previously autonomous opening material. The "question" raised by the removal of the accompaniment pattern and by the contrapuntal and harmonic instability at this point in the second key area gives weight to the restoration of stability at the beginning of the closing area (m. 45). The new texture from measure 42 to measure 45 itself suggests further instability of a contrapuntal type, a suggestion borne out a number of times in the development and in several ways shortly after the beginning of the recapitulation. Indeed, from here on (with two exceptions, to be mentioned) Haydn uses this new treat- ment of the opening material-i.e., the alla breve gesture minus the drum bass-to mark the beginning of each unstable passage in the movement. Within its first four measures, the opening of the development exemplifies in close juxtaposition a distinction between our reading of texture as a sign of presentation, on the one hand, and as a sign of immediate or impending instability, on the other (see Example i c). To begin with, in measures 55-56 Haydn takes the textural deviation of measure 42 several steps further by reducing that texture to a unison that maximizes the harmonic ambiguity of the line. If our understand- 5 The halting or removal of a palpable pulse from a gesture that previously had one may well be characteristic of a whole class of signs that seem to read "not presentation" or "prepare for instability." That is, though this kind of sign is understood contextually, it may also be a member of a class of conventionalized signs. 6 Cf. the parallel moment in the recapitulation (mm. i 18-i 9) where the alla breve gesture is not preceded by a suggestion of the drum bass; the effect is less marked.</page><page sequence="4">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 485 Example i Haydn, String Quartet in C, Op. 74, No. i, i (a) mm. 1-7 Allegro moderato Vln.

In contrast, however, the moment we hear the original textural setting of the opening material (m. 57), with its characteristic drum-bass accompaniment, we are cued to listen to this sequential motion not simply as a continuation of the same sequential event begun in measure 55-as we would if melody, harmony, and the rhythm of the upper voices alone were taken into account-but as the beginning of a presentation within the context of development. In other words, the reappearance of the drum-bass texture here is crucial to our apprehension of the passage as a beginning as well as a continuation, and as a presentation of relative stability within an area of general instability. That presentation is the nature of this passage (mm. 57-64) is supported by what happens at measure 6 I, a graft of a new little tune with accompaniment, firmly in E-flat major. Indeed, this passage (beginning at m. 57) turns out to be the only relatively stable presentation of the opening thematic materi- al of the piece in the entire development. Subsequent passages that</page><page sequence="6">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 487 begin with the opening material in its "deviant" arrangement (as at mm. 65, 71, 84) are all comparatively less stable. As suggested earlier, the texture at measure 43 (as well as similar textures in the development) hinted at the possibility of further contrapuntal-even fugal-procedure. Fugal texture does not, how- ever, occur in the development, where we might expect it. It is saved for a more surprising moment: a stretto fugato is troped into the recapitulation, at measure oS5, shortly after its beginning (see Exam- ple Id). Contrapuntal moments in the exposition and development (for example, at mm. 43, 66, 72, 85) have subtly prepared us, and somehow, perhaps because of the small scale of these previous contrapuntal forays, the fugato passage so soon after the beginning of the recapitulation does not seem a serious threat to formal propriety. (Ordinarily a fugato exposition would have preceded the other, more fragmentary contrapuntal passages. Haydn's wit is at last to introduce this little fugato exposition after all the earlier moments.) Finally, in combination with signs in other parameters, the texture of the last presentation of the opening material (mm. 149-52 in Example Ie) tells us clearly that this is the final presentation. Of course we know we are near the end of the movement. But, occurring after strong cadential harmony, and all solidly in the tonic, this forte unison version of the beginning of the tune, stamped-out and martial, with double-stopping in viola and cello, virtually precludes further presentation. Because the tensions inherent in the earlier versions of the material-tensions between a harmonized melody and a drum- bass accompaniment, or within the six-three version of the material- are now dissolved in the unanimity and overriding authority of a unison line in the tonic, we are sure there will be no other forays. (Suppose there were a drum bass here instead!) The unison is also the point of entry for one last witticism: it facilitates Haydn's taking the chromatic motion of the second and third measures of the original tune (compare mm. 3-4 with I50-52) further into a kind of spoof on all the prior passing chromaticism.7 This example illustrates how texture may function as a sign- directing us to syntax and form-by virtue of its contextual use within a piece. What seems involved in such signifying is a simple mode of association (notably by identity) over a musical distance, or a recogni- tion of deviation from a characteristic (in this case, and often, initial) presentation of thematic material. There are likely to be many kinds 7 The efficiency of a unison texture for play on chromatic lines is discussed below, pp. 526-27.</page><page sequence="7">488 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY within the class of "contextual signs" but this example will, I hope, suggest lines along which inquiry might profitably proceed. CONVENTIONALIZED SIGNS The Andante also found favour, but particularly the last Allegro, because, having observed that all last as well as first Allegros begin here with all the instruments playing together and generally unisono, I began mine with two violins only, piano for the first eight bars-followed instantly by a forte; the audience, as I expected, said "hush" at the soft beginning and when they heard the forte began at once to clap their hands.8 This is what Mozart wrote to his father from Paris about the last movement of his Symphony No. 31 in D, K. 297 (3ooa), the "Paris" Symphony. His obvious pride in writing a successful anti-unison, in strategic and teasing defiance of what Parisians expected at the beginning of last movements, attests to one kind of textural/dynamic orchestral convention he must have observed in their music. For final allegros, Parisians liked (and those composing for Paris provided them with) rousing unison beginnings or, at least, grand tuttis in rhythmic unison: in our terms, bold calls to attention, "Stop, look, and listen" signs. But the conventionalized uses of certain types of textures may also have far more particular and, I think, significant roles in syntax. They may cue or instruct us quite specifically about how to comprehend both simultaneous and subsequent musical events.9 In order to discuss some of the ways in which texture may be said to function as a conventionalized sign, I have chosen three types whose basic constitu- tion is unambiguous. All three fall within the general class of "homophony." They are: (i) homophonic with stock accompaniment pattern such as an Alberti bass; (2) solo (a literal solo line, not solo as in solo versus tutti); and (3) unison passages (including the octave doubling commonly subsumed in this category). They will be consid- ered in that order. 8 The Letters of Mozart and His Family, trans. and ed. Emily Anderson, II (New York, 1966), 558. 9 Indeed, the texture Mozart did write at the beginning of the finale of the "Paris" Symphony led Saint-Foix to remark: "Only the finale . . , opening, piano, with the two violins announcing a fugato, greatly heightens the whole of the symphony; and this anticipation of the fugato is not wholly deceptive, for the second subject is ranged in a series of imitations . . ." (Georges de Saint-Foix, Tie Symphonies of Mozart, trans. Leslie Orrey [London, 1947], pp. 64-65). Saint-Foix thus made quite specific inferences on the basis of the opening texture of the finale.</page><page sequence="8">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 489 ACCOMPANIMENT PATTERNS AS SIGNS The beginning of a conventionally figured and regularly measured accompaniment pattern, such as an Alberti bass, is a sign that we will hear a presentational passage-probably a full statement, such as a stable phrase-group or period, or perhaps the close of a bar form.' Consider the familiar and uncomplicated first movement of the Sonatina in G traditionally ascribed to Beethoven (Example 2).11 The Example 2 Beethoven (?), Sonatina in G, i, mm. i-8 Moderato 60" ir change from an unfigured homophonic accompaniment (mm. 1-4) to a conventional Alberti bass pattern (m. 5) is an instantaneous instruc- tion to perform and/or to take in what follows as a more fully formed statement than what we have heard so far. The beginning of the accompaniment pattern makes it highly probable that motion will coalesce into a longer unit of musical action; and so it does. The sign value of the beginning of the accompaniment pattern is particularly evident here since the melody in measure 5 is identical with that in measure I. Because of the cues for stability given by the appearance of the Alberti bass, we understand the nature of the passage the moment it begins (beats I and 2), even before we hear the harmonic motion to 10 "Bar form" is used here as aab or aa'b, with proportions I + I + 2, on any level of structure. 11 For the doubtful attribution to Beethoven see Thayer's Life of Beethoven, ed. Elliott Forbes, rev. ed. (Princeton, 1967), p. 131.</page><page sequence="9">490 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY V7/IV. Moreover, the beginning of a regular accompaniment pattern cues us to what we will not hear. The passage is not likely to be the beginning of a transition, for example, or even of a phrase-group that is complementary to the first, with two-measure units matching measures 1-2 and 3-4. A similar sort of sign mechanism guides us in a far more sophisticated example of a bar form, the opening of Mozart's String Quartet in F, K. 590 (Example 3). Here texture significantly under- scores the unusual phrase construction of the opening. For despite the symmetrical lengths (3 + 3 measures) and complementary harmonic motion of the two opening phrases, the non-matched textures (and dynamics) emphasize an eccentric internal construction. Measure 7, melodically identical to measure I but texturally identical to measure 4 (and the solo aspect of measures 4 and 7 calls attention to itself), creates additional, if momentary, uncertainty. Will action now be similar to that in the second phrase, a return to the material of Example 3 Mozart, String Quartet in F, K. 59o, i, mm. 1-12 Allegro moderato 4 Vlns. Vln. i I. tatI ' , d ,do .

The appearance of the regular repeated-note accompaniment pattern on beats I and 2 of measure 8 quickly dispels the uncertainty; these two beats of accom- paniment are enough to assure us that this time we will hear a more stable, more fully-formed line. Importantly, along with the move to V7/IV, the entrance of the accompaniment pattern gives us the sense that the piece is finally getting under way.12 The accompaniment (together with the harmony) cues us even before the melody changes (cf. mm. I and 2).13 And, typically, as with the G-major Sonatina example, this third phrase becomes the consolidating member in the bar form, here a construction of 3 + 3 + 6 measures. There is a kind of double psychic economy provided by our recognition of this kind of textural sign. First, we are "told," by the appearance of the Alberti or other familiar pattern, that stability is likely to reign--at least until closure or until other signs contravene this one. Because for the moment there is no question of what the passage is, we can relax and simply experience its unfolding.14 Second, some of the perceptual work is, so to speak, done for us. The 12 The sense of "true beginning" (of the musical discourse) is often conveyed by the establishment of an accompaniment pattern after a less stable or less natural texture (for this repertory). See below, pp. 507-508, 524-25. Another, and quite different example is found in the opening of Haydn's String Quartet in F, Op. 74, No. 2. The first eight measures are a unison (see p. 509 and n. 48 below). Not until the conventionalized accompaniment comes in at measure 9 are we sure that the sonata form proper has really begun. This seems to be confirmed by the placement of the repeat sign before measure 9. 13 The role of an accompaniment as an advance notice is perhaps weightier still when, as in the first movement of Haydn's String Quartet in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, No. 4, the opening motive of the movement, already heard eleven times in about twice as many measures, is also to begin the main tune for the second key area (m. 28). And just a beat-and-a-half of accompaniment pattern prepares us this time to listen to the familiar motive as part of a tune, rather than once again as the beginning of a motivic construction, such as characterized the first key area (and had not so far crystallized into a tuneful period). In a very different, a dramatic, context in Verdi's IIl trovatore, Act I, Scene 2, the appearance of an accompaniment cues us in advance as to how to listen to the very first notes of Leonora's "Come d'aurato sogno" (before her first aria). One-and-a-half measures before we would know from the rising major sixth of the melody, we are told by the appearance of a highly conventionalized accompaniment pattern (in flutes and clarinets) to change the way in which we have been listening to the recitative. The accompaniment helps to frame Leonora's world of remembered experience, her "golden dream." 14 It would seem no accident that such textures occur frequently at the beginning of the characteristic passage or profile tune for the second key area in sonata form movements. The move to the contrasting key has been accomplished and such conventionalized textures are among the important signs that we may now listen in a different fashion; we can expect a tuneful, or at least stable, presentation.</page><page sequence="11">492 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY Alberti bass (or other regular) pattern provides a kind of palpable motor action that measures or marks off time regularly for us; the palpability of meter is in inverse proportion to the amount of effort the performer/listener must expend. (The constancy of harmonic specifi- cation is, of course, also a factor in the psychic economy.) Further, for the performer there would seem to be a connection between the initiation of a regular motor activity and the impulse to continue it: it is possible that the greater the regularity the greater the performer's kinesthetic need for continuation.Is The importance of the conventionalized accompaniment pattern not merely as an opening instruction but as a continuing one, where there might be a possibility for misinterpreting the nature of a passage without the accompaniment, is illustrated in Example 4, from Mo- zart's Piano Sonata in A minor, K. 310o (3ood). Imagine-to take but one set of possibilities-a simple F-major chord on the first beat of measure 8 and a dominant seventh chord on the first beat of measure 9, instead of the Alberti bass. We might easily have understood measures 8 and 9 as either a continuation of the erratic quality of movement (the "sensibility style") of the first eight measures or as the beginning of a transition. Here, even more than in the G-major sonatina, the accompaniment is crucial in establishing the nature of the passage from the outset: it is a melody.'6 Furthermore, the continuation of the regular accompaniment is an assurance that any internal contrasts, or seeming disruptions, are to be understood as part of the same melody.'7 15 A corollary, if this is correct, would be that the cut-off or interruption of a highly patterned, regular accompaniment would be a source of tension. See below, PP. 494-96. 16 Particularly in his keyboard sonatas Mozart may use a conventionalized accompaniment for much of the period that ends in departure from the home key. When the period begins it is understood as presentational, largely because of the accompaniment pattern combined with harmonic stability. Retrospectively, because of harmonic motion, we understand that it has also been a transition. The force of the accompaniment pattern may be such that the presentational character carries through the passage despite the harmonic change. And the continuity thus created may be related to our sense of Mozart's lyricism. 17 Indeed, the Alberti bass may have been one solution to problems of continuity that Alberti and his contemporaries encountered. Their motivic processes were short- winded or bogged down; they were not convincingly welded to move forward (for Alberti himself see William S. Newman, The Sonata in the Classic Era [Chapel Hill, 1963], p. 183). Perhaps one reason for the Alberti bass pattern was to provide momentum and impose continuity (and perhaps to bestow a "singing" character) where there might have been uncertainty if one heard only the melody line with a variety of less uniform textures.</page><page sequence="12">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 493 Example 4 Mozart, Piano Sonata in A minor, K. 3o10 (3ood), ii, mm. 1-4, 8-Io, 12-14 Andante cantabile con espressione 4 A[ . 1 1 "= I " f,, P... f ccresc.

Particularly in a very slow tempo, the establishment of a conven- tional accompaniment pattern with a well-defined pulse in the context of a relatively slow harmonic rhythm tells us that a melody will take shape or emerge. Chopin's character pieces in a slow tempo are rich in passages where a regular figured accompaniment tells us that what might otherwise have seemed introductory, improvisatory, recitative- like is in fact to be understood as the main line of discourse. How, for</page><page sequence="13">494 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY example, would we apprehend what the right hand plays in measures 3 and 4 of Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. I had the accompaniment not been well-established? (See Example 5.) Chopin's accompaniments assure us that a slowly unfolding and often hesitant or uncertain-seeming line of tones is, indeed, part of a melodic statement, a presentation and not an introduction or transi- tion. 18 Example 5 Chopin, Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. t, mm. i-6 Larghetto = 42 sotto voce legato 6 6 6 *%A* ... 7 -1r 1r1 7 j i Because of our basic association of highly conventionalized accom- paniment patterns with relatively sustained presentation and stability, an abrupt denial or break in the continuation of such patterns is likely to be striking. A passage from Donizetti's Anna Bolena, Act II, scene "8 Even in fast tempi Chopin's accompaniments can be crucial in telling us when the main discourse is beginning. A good example is the opening of his "Minute" Waltz in D flat, Op. 64, No. i, where an introductory gesture, a lead-in, is transformed into a true beginning by the appearance of an accompaniment pattern beneath it (cf. mm. 1-4 with mm. 5 ff.). An exceptional example of the power of a regular accompaniment established as a "ground" is the beklemmt section of the Cavatina in Beethoven's String Quartet in B flat, Op. 130. The accompanimental background (beginning m. 40) makes clear that we should listen to "voice" even here where the first violin line is so broken and moves so erratically. The accompaniment instructs us, so to speak, to make the effort to connect the broken line. For only in imagining the "line" as connected can we know how broken, how anguished the voice is. My husband, Leonard B. Meyer, called this</page><page sequence="14">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 495 1, illustrates the point (see Example 6). 19Jane Seymour implores her mistress Anne Boleyn to confess infidelity rather than face death at the hands of Henry VIII. At the point of the excerpt Jane has not yet brought herself to reveal that it is she whom Henry has destined to replace Anne as his queen. When Jane bursts out, "Regina! oh ciel! oh ciel! cedete. . ." a stereotyped accompaniment pattern of a type that most typically occurs in formal arias or duets (or, at least, lyric statements of some scope) signals stability and a well-shaped line. It does so immediately, on "Regina," before melody and harmony make clear the nature of the passage. Example 6 Donizetti, Anna Bolena, Act ii, Sc. i Adagio Anna Giovanna tu con-si-gliar me puo - i!

Yet the strength of our association of such accompaniment patterns with sustained presentational statements makes an abrupt break dramatically effective.20 Here, underlined by the absence of any accompaniment at I , the premature break epitomizes Jane's distraught state: the conflict between her devotion to Anne and her relationship with Henry. It is as if Jane were about to bare her soul but suddenly drew back. A continuation of impassioned recitative (in the manner of "E infamia e morte") in place of the Andante could not so poignantly-or so plainly--convey the difficulty of the communi- cation. To say that Donizetti employed such an accompanied passage simply for the sake of variety would surely be to miss the point. For a fleeting suggestion of aria calls to mind the dimensions of expression that occur in set numbers-dimensions that, for dramatic reasons, cannot yet be fulfilled. I have been considering the sign functions of certain highly conventionalized and regular figured accompaniment patterns in Western music of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. But my hypothesis may have wider application-to musics of East as well as West. For it appears that in many musics the establishment of a well-shaped accompaniment pattern is what first conveys the sense that a new and formal segment-a melodic statement or presenta- tion-has begun.21 It seems possible, then, that the association of 20 Needless to say, our expectations as to the length of a passage that begins with a conventionalized accompaniment such as an Alberti bass will depend on the implied dimensions or scale of the piece as well as on context. Any relatively premature break from such a pattern will, then, be an agent of tension. 21 For example, according to Arnold Bake, in classical Indian music "the accompanying drum comes in fully only when the actual composition begins" and this is in contrast to an "unaccompanied prelude in free time [that] may last for an hour or more" ("The Music of India," The New Oxford History of Music, I: Ancient and Oriental Music, ed. Egon Wellesz [London, i957], 215). In a typical contemporary raga improvisation, as soon as the tabla player begins his regular rhythm the listener is cued for a particular kind of formal presentation (even though such presentation, as a dialogue, is subject to the give-and-take of the performers). From this point of view, a description of events at the opening of Schubert's "Trout" Quintet and of those in some Indian pieces might have significant similar- ities. In the "Trout" Quintet, the first twenty-five measures are in an improvisatory vein and it is not until the appearance of the regular accompaniment figure in measure 26 that, at least with our retrospective knowledge, we assume the sonata movement "proper" to begin. The establishment of the regular accompaniment pattern also confirms our perhaps provisional earlier understanding of the first twenty-five measures as having been somewhat preludial or introductory in character. The cardinal role of the accompaniment pattern as a sign is underlined by the fact that the melody line in measures 3 and 27 is identical. Yet how differently we apprehend each.</page><page sequence="16">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 497 formal presentation with the appearance of a clear accompaniment pattern may be both non-arbitrary and cross-cultural. One of the most alluring-if also most elusive-aspects of this inquiry is the relation between the semantic (referential) significance of textures and their syntactic usage. And although many textural conventions in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are culture-bound, it seems that, more than in other parameters, some conventions of textural usage may be rooted in primordial aspects of human experience. Or, put another way, certain natural connotations affect-even infect-syntactic usage. In solo and unison textures the overlap between the semantic and syntactic function is often highly revealing. SOLOS Wherever there is the real possibility for solo versus group action, a solo in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries almost always either is, leads to, or implies a beginning;22 a beginning in the sense of point of departure or initiator of action on some level of musical structure-for example, the level of a phrase, a period, a large section within a form. This is not to deny the existence of exceptions (and I shall address myself to a few shortly); yet most can be construed as those welcome exceptions that seem to prove the rule. For if we go beyond the conventions of musical style to the likely roots of such conventions in what may well be essential aspects of human behavior, my premise regarding solos as signs begins to appear more plausible. From responsorial chant in Jewish and Christian rites, to cheer- leading and political rallies, it is an individual's statement that initiates an action; a group joins or responds. Indeed, in most individual versus group situations in Western culture this relationship is virtually automatic.

S. Bach. It also excludes the solo section of a concerto when the soloist is accompanying himself or being accompanied by others. In sum, I intend "solo" quite literally to mean a single performing voice in a single line.</page><page sequence="17">498 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY ing and commenting chorus-it is the individual who leads the action.23 Similarly in opera; significant dramatic and musical actions are not generally begun by choruses or ensembles but by individuals. We tend to identify a solo line with an individual human voice.24 And often it is not merely that a solo line is taken as a symbolic mime of the social habits of men but it is quite literally taken as if it were the voice of a human being. We may even breathe and move our vocal cords as if we were singing. Rooted in basic aspects of human behavior, the conventionalized roles of solos seem to be non-arbitrary in both origin and nature. The solo line behaves as a group leader frequently in Classic and early Romantic music. The solo may rather literally serve to "con- duct" the action to a beginning of a major segment in a formal structure.25 This role is particularly vivid-rather graphically so-in rondo movements which, by their very definition, involve rounding up the group for refrain or for moving on to a new episode. In most rondo examples melodic and harmonic signs-normally a dominant pedal-will have indicated return or change for some time before the solo lead-back appears. And the sound of such harmonic preparation may indeed carry through in our ears, even while the texture in fact becomes that of a solo. But it is the solo per se that will often provide the decisive or clinching indication of imminence.26 Often it behaves as an extended upbeat, and the sudden reduction of texture- 23 The Greek chorus itself has a leader, the coryphaeus, who often leads in a solo- response choral dialogue. Wye T. Allanbrook reminded me of this and, in addition, made a number of valuable suggestions from which this study has benefited. 24 The best general discussion I know on the subject of a listener's identification with a musical line or lines is in Edward T. Cone, The Composer's Voice (Berkeley, 1974). See especially Chap. 6, "Participation and Identification." Of course there are instrumental solos that are highly idiomatic for the particular instrument and with which we would be hard put to identify kinesthetically-certain complex patterning such as one finds in some of the Paganini Caprices, for example- but then, I think, we listen quite differently. We listen for perfection of execution, and we often criticize such passages for being "mechanical" or "empty" or we object that they are "showy." It may be that we revel in the virtuosity of a performance when we cannot completely or thoroughly identify; perhaps this is one reason why the virtuoso is popularly considered a breed apart. 25 Indeed, some seem precisely to focus on pulse and pace of action-gestures that seem physically to behave as a conductor would. 26 The carry-over of the sound of harmonic preparation and the frequent use of melodic spin-off from the immediately preceding motion maintain continuity. The maximal contrast provided by the usually sudden thinning-out or contraction of the texture to a single line is an important aspect of the articulation-an articulation that is itself a sign of another, and usually more important one, the actual beginning of a refrain or episode.</page><page sequence="18">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 499 particularly the absence of a bass-heightens the instability. Exam- ples are numerous and readers will doubtless think of their own.

At times, as in the first movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in F, Op. 18, No. I, measures 55-57, the upbeat is unstable in its own internal construction, and the solo 27 Also in the same movement, see measures 143-45, 277-79.

XV, No. 15 (mm. 60-65, 122-31). Because temporal brevity is normal for rondo lead-backs, the exceptionally long solo lead- backs in the Mozart K. 503 and Haydn Trio examples are especially playful and amusing in their very extent. At times an entire section of an orchestra may function in the same way when the other parts drop out. See, for example, the rondo finale of Haydn's Symphony No. 97 in C, mm.

At other times, as in the first movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto in D, K. 537, the "Coronation," the rather deliberate beat-marking (includ- ing a sf stress on the second beat) is more like the conductor's preparing the group for the "real" beginning (see Example 8). In this case, it is a preparation for what turns out to be the profile, or characteristic, tune for the second key area.28 Example 8 Mozart, Piano Concerto in D, K. 537, i, mm 32-39 [Allegro] j2 Vln. I W.W. + Str. 'l+a. C Vc. + Cb. In leading in, a solo may also delay a beginning. For instance, in the first movement of his Serenade in C minor, K. 388 (384a), Mozart signals the delay of the second key-area tune when a solo line in the oboe echoes a tutti close on the dominant of the impending new key (see Example 9). The solo here transforms an end into a lead-in or beginning. It keeps the structure open and delays the presentation of the second key-area tune for two measures. (Once again, note that the Alberti bass accompaniment immediately ratifies our sense that the characteristic area in the second key really begins where it does and not two measures before.)29 28 That Mozart thought of this lead-in in the first violin section alone as a "solo" seems borne out by his writing a literal solo for the keyboard at the corresponding moment in the exposition, mm. 161-62. For another example see the first movement of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C minor, Op. 37 (cf. mm. 16o-63 with 336-39). 29 Many times in Classic sonata forms the second key is reached before the characteristic tune.

In addition, it is likely (perhaps the result of a fundamental aspect of perception) that once we have heard a group, a solo will seem an incomplete texture. And something that is incomplete cannot satisfactorily function as a consolidation of events for ending.30 For both these reasons, solos will tend to emphasize non-closure, to keep musical periods open.31 Consider the role of measure 63 in Mozart's Divertimento in D, K. 334 (320b) (Example io). The phrase beginning at measure 58 is surely one beat away from tonic close by the end of measure 60. The first denial of closure is unprepared and occurs with the repetition of measures 58-59 at measures 61-62. But the sudden disappearance of the lower parts at measure 63, which begins as an octave replica of 30 General principles related to this point are discussed in Leonard B. Meyer, Emotion and Meaning in Music (Chicago, 1956), especially Chap. 4 and Chap. 5, PP. 185-96. 11 In some sense, all cadenzas (though not all precisely solos in the strict way I have been using the term here) conventionally work this way.</page><page sequence="21">502 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY measure 60, and which, like measure 60, might have led to a close, is a clear sign that once again the period will not end on schedule. Measure 64 could, after all, have followed directly from measure 62.32 The solo measure at once exaggerates and, partly, creates the delay. And, at the same time, in its very solo-ness-self-reflectively, so to speak--it cues us to its own role in delaying the end of the musical period.

CL- - - ,f One of the changes Beethoven makes in revising the first move- ment of his String Quartet in F, Op. 18, No. I, would seem to provide interesting support for my view of the function of the solo as a sign of beginning. 33 In the first version of the quartet, both measures 5 and 13 are written as solos (and are identical melodically and dynamically); in prospect, their functions are not clearly differentiated (see Example I ia). In revising the movement, Beethoven specifies the harmony in measure 5 (see Example I b). The result is not only that the second four measures of the movement are themselves more integrated but also that they are heard unequivocally as part of an 32 Measure 65 might also have followed from measure 62 but surely closure would have been much weaker without the gestures of measures 63-64. 33 The revisions are from the complete first version of the movement to the complete second version, the one that has come down to us as "the" Op. I8, No. I. For a fuller discussion of this, see Janet M. Levy, Beethoven's Compositional Choices: The Two Versions of Opus 18, No. i, First Movement (Philadelphia, 1982).</page><page sequence="22">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 503 ongoing statement begun at measure i-that is, measure 5 is bound more closely with its successive measures at the same time that measures 5-8 are immediately understood as part of the unit of eight measures. The solo treatment of measure 13 now clearly differentiates that measure from measure 5 and, importantly, cues us for the beginning of a new kind of patterning, a sequence from measures I3-20. By comparison, in the first version, when we hear measure 13 we have no way of knowing that it is the beginning of something different from what occurred at measure 5; that, too, was a solo. In other words, Beethoven's saving the solo for measure 13 in the revised version may be understood partly as an underlining of the "beginning-ness" of measure 13.

Combined with the marked registral and dynamic break on the 34 This example suggests that, in addition to simultaneous and subsequent signs, there are some signs that work retrospectively.</page><page sequence="24">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 505 high d in the viola line, the solo texture instructs us to revise our notions of "who," so to speak, is the protagonist at this point: not, after all, the opening theme, as we had thought, but the solo passage beginning on the high d. It provides the main idea for a series of statements (a kind of accompanied dialogue in which, once again, we find that the accompaniment confirms that this is presentation) that move through a cycle of dominants to the relative minor. In sum, the sudden solo texture lets us know that the music at measure 70, not that at measure 68, is the proper beginning of a passage. The role of a solo texture in defining the beginnings of fugues, fugatos, canons, and the like is doubtless the most familiar. And blatant denials of such textural implications can be very pointed and witty. The first movement of Haydn's String Quartet in G, Op. 76, No. I is an instructive example (Example 13).

But by keeping a solo texture, Haydn makes sure that we make no mistake. The cello drops out. There is no counterline, as would be characteristic of a fugal or even a fugato exposition. To have a second solo here is eccentric. And there is still another kind of wit, dependent on the earlier textural cue: in some sense, the reciprocal phrase in the viola forms a kind of consequent to the first phrase (as antecedent) in the cello, a formal relationship antithetical to the character and implica- tions of the opening.38 Paradoxically, even negative examples seem to confirm the work- ing hypothesis about solos. And perhaps the ultimate negative examples are solos presented in a row. In the second movement, the Scherzando, of Beethoven's String Quartet in F, Op. 59, No. I, for example, it is not only because of the melodic/harmonic peculiarities of the opening but also because of their nakedness as solos, that the beginning of the movement seems so bizarre (mm. 1-16); the solos all in a row surely expose and emphasize the otherwise dissociated quality of the opening of the movement. The same may be said of the celebrated moment at the beginning of the coda of the alla Tedesca movement in Beethoven's String Quartet in B flat, Op. 130, where the main tune is heard backwards in hocket-like fashion. Our disorientation is a function mainly of our recognition of the backwards order of the tune; but it is also the quality of its being pieced together nied (first by the cello, then by the viola), as if it were the beginning of a fugue, is very comic and at the same time most original." 36 See Warren Kirkendale, Fugue and Fugato in Rococo and Classical Chamber Music (Durham, 1979), pp. 98--Ioo. Kirkendale also writes that the beginning of this quartet is "in the manner of a fugato" (p. xxvii, n. io). 37 This despite the fact that one may not expect a fugal first movement in Haydn's string quartets. The statistics of style are not the only determinant of our expecta- tions. In this example, our understanding of the specific nature of measures 3-6 takes precedence over our knowledge of Haydn's previous practice. 38 At the beginnings of both the development and recapitulation Haydn again plays with our expectations that a fugue or fugato may materialize. But only the fugal spirit implied by the beginning of the movement is realized. The stretto effect, beginning with the upbeat to measure 144-a sequence of six patterns of descending thirds jammed together in a row-is virtually a mockery of the fugue that never materializes.</page><page sequence="26">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 507 again-backwards---while not at all integrated by harmony and a "normal" texture. Surely, all these solos (and those in Op. 59, No. I, second movement as well) are not lead-ins or beginnings. And yet, measure after measure we must overcome our inclination to hear a solo as a lead-in or beginning. Or are they beginnings? And if so, which is the real one? The discontinuity seems connected to the discrepancy between what is and what might or ought to have been. At a certain point (or more precisely, not so certain a point) perhaps we simply suspend our belief in the reality of the behavior of these solos. So many solos in a row appear so abnormal in this style that we must simply "wait and see" what will happen. UNISONS39 There is no single premise for the role of unison passages as syntactic signs. Yet few other textures call as much attention to themselves. And surely no other type of texture seems so laden with semantic significance, with referential connotations. These semantic connotations everywhere suffuse--and, it seems to me, partly deter- mine-syntax. Even more than with solos, the conventions of syntac- tic usage appear to be deeply rooted in primordial aspects of human experience. Probably the single most pervasive quality of a unison passage is its aura of authoritative control. For unanimity-as in the crowd singing together in unison-is basically contrary to our sense of the individuality of human beings. It does not appear to occur in nature, to happen naturally.40 It must, in some sense, be organized, preor- dained-imposed. On the one hand, it is an authority given by human ritual or ceremony-as in the intoning of chant, patriotic and work songs, heraldic fanfares. On the other hand, it is an authority that seems to rest in compulsions that inhabit the deepest reaches of the psyche (innate evil, wickedness) or in forces outside man's nature (the demonic, the supernatural). Gluck's chorus of the Furies in Act II of Orfeo ed Euridice epitomizes one of the semantic roles of unison texture as a special effect for a special situation. The unison chorus (the orchestra is not, 39 Taken to mean a passage, usually longer than what is commonly thought of as a motive, and in any case never just an intervallic/harmonic unison of one beat. I include octave doublings in this classification. 40 According to Walter Wiora (The Four Ages ofMusic, trans. M. D. Herter Norton [New York, 19651, p. 89) the unison symbolized Christian unanimity in the early history of the Church.</page><page sequence="27">508 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY however, in unison with the chorus) is a powerful agent in the initial portrayal of the Furies as inhuman, unyielding, relentless-in the opening strophes of the first two choruses, as well as in the Furies' "no's" in response to Orpheus' pleadings. Alfred Einstein writes of the "terrifying 'no!' that seems invincible."41 The Furies' unison is that of a chorus of compellers. But when they are mollified, when their resistance begins to yield and they find themselves sympathizing with Orpheus, the unison texture of the first strophe is supplanted by a harmonized one. Harmony is humanizing. The Furies' yielding of a path to Orpheus is connoted by the yielding of the unison. There is an interesting parallel in Verdi's Otello. The motive that introduces and later reaffirms lago's "Credo" is in unison, the association of unison with ominous implacability and malevolence very clear.42 And, as in the Gluck example, when lago abandons his adamant stance-in Verdi's music with the thought of death as an end-the same motive recurs harmonized. It is striking that when a unison passage is discussed by writers on music, its texture is not merely noted; it is usually characterized. Thus, far more often than, say, with a melody and accompaniment, or other types of homophonic textures, a unison passage is described with adjectives like "hollow," "ominous," "powerful," "stark," "bru- tal," "roaring." The descriptive adjectives are often anthropomorphic. We read, for instance, of "horn signals intoned in unison by the tutti,"43 of "screaming unisons in the winds,"44 of "striding unisons,"45 and even of "ardent unisons.'"46 Tovey's well-known characterization (after Liszt) of the second movement of Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto, comparing the harmonized piano passages to Orpheus 4' Alfred Einstein, Gluck, trans. Eric Blom (London, 1936), p. 73. 42 Another clear instance of Verdi's association of evil with a unison texture occurs in Falstaf, Act III, scene i. When Falstaff intones his comments on the wickedness of the world ("Nasty world," "villainous world") Verdi interjects a unison motive in the woodwinds. As is often the case in Mozart's operas, the instrumental music "choreographs" the text. 43 Georg Feder, "Similarities in the Works of Haydn," Studies in Eighteenth-Century Music, ed. H. C.

The force of such unisons inheres partly, I suspect, in our relish for that perfect synchrony, that total unanimity demanded by a well- performed unison. As with an exquisitely synchronized corps de ballet or a flawlessly executed military formation, we respond to the absolute precision of alignment and of uniform movement. Of course not all heraldic unisons are opening fanfares. Unisons are often used to announce or to mark other structural moments or to rouse us from a kind of musical action to which we may have grown accustomed. That a unison passage was regarded not only as some- thing special but as one way of rousing an audience in the eighteenth century is clearly indicated by remarks of C.P.E. Bach in his Essay on the True Art of Playing Keyboard Instruments: 47 Donald Francis Tovey, Essays in Musical Analysis, III: Concertos (London, 1936), 80-8 I. 48 There is an interesting difference in the way that I think we understand the beginnings of these two Haydn examples. In the Symphony No. 97, we believe the unison vivace opening to be the proper beginning of the exposition, partly because a slow introduction has preceded it, partly because of the very clear rhythmic definition of the fanfare. But in the quartet example it is likely that by the fifth measure we question whether the fanfare is to be taken as an announcement that lies "outside" the movement proper-i.e., as introductory--or as the main discourse. The four measures of tonic followed by four measures of dominant are not well defined rhythmically-there is little feeling of upbeat moving to downbeat. Because of the lack of genuine harmonic motion within four-measure units, as well as the lack of rhythmic definition, somewhere in the middle of this fanfare we know it is not the real beginning of the form. 49 These are, of course, only a tiny sampling of the hundreds of such fanfares that could be listed. For unison openings in minor keys, see below, pp. 521-25. Other types of bold unison openings in the major exist, too--e.g., that of Mozart's "Haffner" Symphony where the announcement is based not on the triad but on the octave, descending stepwise from tonic to fifth.</page><page sequence="29">5 10 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY Imagine a situation: A composer works industriously .... At a certain point he feels that his audience must be roused with something different. He searches enthusiastically for a passage whose splendor and majesty shall be pronounced and striking. He decides to discard the beauty of harmony for a while; the passage shall be played in unison.50 The effectiveness of such unisons is demonstrated most clearly when other parameters remain constant, as in Example 14, from the first movement of Haydn's String Quartet in G minor, Op. 74, No. 3. In this short yet vivid example, a unison announces and marks the beginning of the development. The melodic/rhythmic identity of the end of the exposition with the beginning of the development makes the strong contrast in texture, over a minimal time, maximally significant here. This is particularly so because the type of action at the beginning of the development continues in a manner similar to that at the end of the exposition. (Perhaps the unison that opens the development prepares us, too, for the impending reappearance of the striking opening material of the movement, also a unison.)

Combined with the half-step motion (b to c) in the tune, the unison at measure 83 is a critical element in the immediate shattering of both the stability and mood of the genial sing- song closing tune of the exposition. Indeed, the unison facilitates the chromatic motion that creates harmonic instability. Compare mea- sures 76-79, the second presentation of the tune, with measures 83-86 (especially 83-84). The tune has quite literally lost its footing-its accompaniment pattern-and, as a result, its balance, too!

Haydn has, so to speak, taken us over the "rough road" into Part II of the form.52 A more heavily freighted use of texture as a sign is the abruptly introduced unison that virtually commandeers the action less than half-way through the development of the first movement of Beetho- ven's String Quartet in F, Op. 135 (see Example 16, m. 80). Of all the variables of the moment, it is primarily the sudden, one-measure forte unison treatment of the initial gesture of the first tune in the first key area (cf. mm. 4-5; at m. 80 the dominant harmony, V of B 6, is essentially continued from the preceding measure) that rudely jolts our attention to the false recapitulation that begins (in B flat) in the very next measure.

The unison motion allows for looking no other way; it is (as in the Haydn example) as if the listener were grabbed and forced in a single direction. In a special sense, I think, the composer has taken the reins; there is a kind of tyrannical routing of our listening. 52 In the Finale of his Symphony No. 40 in G minor, K. 550, Mozart takes this kind of unison function at the beginning of the development to a higher power. And the unison has a seemingly self-contradictory double function: it is surely one ingredient in the dramatic disorientation of the passage, but at the same time it commandingly orients us to that very disorientation.</page><page sequence="32">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 513 contrast to the preceding (as well as following) action, and Beethoven gives us no other warning or preparation. We are forced, on very short notice, to re-orient our listening. This may be the ultimate in the pre- emptive authority of a unison with the greatest temporal economy.53 A unison gesture may also serve to announce tonal locus at a number of important structural junctures along the way of a single piece, as in the development of the first movement of Mozart's Piano Quartet in E Flat, K. 493 (Example 17). Not only does a pronounced unison treatment of the opening of the second key-area tune (from m. 30)54 mark the beginning of the development, but the same gesture guides us through a tour of keys by assertive announcements within the development (as at mm. 96, io6, iio, 114, 124, 126).55 (This kind of musical sign is a little like those we get along a thruway, as we Example 17 Mozart, Piano Quartet in E Flat, K. 493, i, mm. 94-10o; mm. 105-12 [Allegro] 96 V Vc. f I 11 For a study in contrast with this passage in Op. 135, see the finale of the String Quartet in B flat, Op. 130, where Beethoven employs a seventeen-measure-long unison before the false recapitulation. s4 The beginning of this tune is identical with the lead-in, or transition, to it (except in scoring) at measures 28-29. Mozart utilizes the double meaning of this gesture in the development. " The same sort of use of unison textures to mark changes of key in development sections, and to dramatize structural articulations of other kinds, is found in the late eighteenth-century repertory of quatuors concertants written for Paris and aimed primarily at amateur players and listeners. It seems likely that, in this repertory, such unisons also served to orient a listener, or, especially, a player who was "lost." The important point, however, is that the use of unison as a syntactic marker during a piece is not limited to works of the most sophisticated composers. See Janet M. Levy, "The Quatuor Concertant in Paris in the Latter Half of the Eighteenth-Century" (Ph.D. diss., Stanford Univ., i97i), pp. 269-72.</page><page sequence="33">514 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY 611--Vc.- - -OIE rhO amp :W . 6- - 1 F - I!I l at6 Vln. 9p W49 -:= -c A-.

But there are instances, as in the rondo Finale of Schubert's Piano Trio in B Flat, Op. 99 (Example I8), when the initial impact of a unison is so forceful that even when the gesture is substantially transformed and placed in widely different contexts, it retains an important part of its original character and function. More specifically, on its first appearances, the unison gesture at measures 52-55 and 64-67 is a sign for a change in tonal locus. When subsequently it occurs in very different guises its original heraldic character and function stick in our memories and influence our listening. Schubert marks the beginning of numerous excursions from the rondo refrain with the gesture (and modified versions of it) shown in Example I8a (mm. 52-55). A sudden contrast in forte unison, beginning alla breve, and braking the previous pulse and metric/ rhythmic patterning, this gesture quickly turns to, and ends in, another key, the relative minor; the forte unison is important among the elements of contrast that indelibly set the original nature of the gesture. And so, when the gesture turns up not in unison but in canonic imitation (for instance, mm. 76-88 in Ex. 18b and 140-52), or in a context of repetitive insistence on non-movement harmonically, or in a coloristic harmonic see-saw in a remote key, it is at least partly the original behavior of the gesture that contributes to making its new, transformed uses so restive, so colorful, even teasing.

In each case the gesture ends up not in arrival at the indicated "place," but in movement beyond it-to another, a different, temporary tonal center. There is yet another kind of play on-perhaps a mockery of-the initially established sign when, at measure 234 (Ex. i8d), the gesture (modified, however, to move by step in its third measure) ends up precisely where it began, tonally speaking. This turn of events is particularly amusing because the four-measure perch on the solo repeated note, f (mm. 230-33), surely readies us for movement. Still another contradiction of the originally established meaning is the quasi-ostinato use of the gesture in the 32 section (mm. 250-58 in Ex. I8e). Stubborn non-movement of the gesture that originally seemed fashioned for movement makes us smile.s6 In addition to heralding certain kinds of change or announcing locus, there are some unisons that seem specifically to herald other unisons. The overture to Mozart's Idomeneo provides a clear example (Example 19). As is typical of many opera overtures, the development section is cursory. It is characterized by a quasi-sequential treatment 56 The discussion of Example 18 points up the intricate connection that often exists between conventionalized and contextual signs. Here an established conven- tionalized sign also functions contextually. The contextual play with a conventional- ized sign (as it is initially presented) is an important aspect of the rhetoric of this movement.</page><page sequence="37">518 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY of the gesture in the winds in measure 85, heard in overlapping dialogue with a sequential, stepwise motion in the strings, all over a dominant pedal. At measures 90-92 the rupture of this texture and its sudden replacement by the striking unison (first strings and bassoon, then tutti winds and strings), afortissimo treatment of the gesture from measure 85, reminds us of the beginning of the piece. Indeed, the only other bold unison had been the French-overture-style fanfare that opened the overture. The unison at measures 90-93 is a harbinger of return--the return of another, the opening, unison of the piece.

In any case, this example illustrates that unisons may function as signs of other signs."5 More common than unisons that refer to other unisons-a special class-are unisons used more simply as auxiliary signs of close. These are usually gatherings of strands of action and have the effect of consolidation. Or, quite oppositely, depending on context, the effect may be one of dissolution or a "clearing out" into a single line, chord, or even a single structural tone. In the Classic and Romantic repertories there are numerous instances of unisons used as confirming signs for closes, particularly for the closes of first key areas or expositions in sonata-form move- ments. An excerpt from the first movement of Beethoven's String Quintet in C, Op. 29, shows one of these, in which the unison, as a kind of consolidation and intensification of preceding melodic and rhythmic action and sound, signals the close of the exposition (Example 20).58 At the close of another exposition, that of the first Example 20 Beethoven, String Quintet in C, Op. 29, i, end of exposition (mm. 91-95) [Allegro moderato] VIns. ff ff "fdecresc.

See, for example, the Presto second movement of Sammartini's Notturno No. 2 in D (close of first key area) and the first movement of Haydn's String Quartet in F, Op. 74, No. 2 (close of exposition).</page><page sequence="39">520 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY movement of Beethoven's String Quartet in B Flat, Op. 130, unison scale-patterning prepares us for the repetition of the exposition or the continuation to Part II by forcibly reconcentrating the action in a middle-low register, a normal register for repetition or continuation in this movement, after the wide splay of contrary motion that had built up to the cadence (on G flat).s9 The use of unison for closing is most dramatic in a polyphonic context precisely because several independent strands are abruptly brought under the authority of--rather literally channeled into-one. To step back in time from the principal repertory under consider- ation, the first movement of Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 provides a striking group of instances of peremptory harnessing of polyphonic action by unisons employed strategically at cadential points (mm. 7-8, 57-58, 135-36, and, partially, 45-46).60 Particularly in a polyphonic context, the unison is at one end of the textural-sound continuum. And the consistency with which Bach used the unison for cadences in this movement strongly suggests that he considered it a reining-in element. In all of these examples, as well as in many others, the unison both underlines and ratifies what we know from other parameters. It is perhaps like what happens when a passenger checks the posted sign as the train pulls into a station. The stop will doubtless have been announced by the conductor; the passenger may even know the order of stops (and so can infer the particular stop). Yet he is likely still to check the painted sign at the station in order to ratify what he knows. A unison has double value as a close because it maintains the strength of the tutti while as a single line it can also form a smooth transition to a solo beginning. In Example 2 from the first movement of Schubert's String Quartet in G, Op. 161, measures Io6-o09 are at once both a consolidating close (of a second, long presentation of the characteristic passage of the second key area) and also a kind of clearing-out to a single tone on which Schubert pivots to a new key area. And the single-linedness of the unison provides a smooth 59 Another, if less boldly dramatic, example of a unison "representing" the reassembly of characters after a splay of melodic motion occurs at the close of the exposition in Beethoven's String Quartet in C minor, Op. i8, No. 4, first movement, measures 70-77. The intriguing aspect of this unison, pianissimo, is its conspiratorial character; surely this must be related to the mimetic qualities of a pianissimo unison-- in a conspiracy men act together as one and in secrecy. 60 Vivaldi frequently uses a unison in a similar manner, sometimes as a punctuat- ing tutti ritornello.</page><page sequence="40">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 5 2 1 transition to the solo beginning of another presentation of the characteristic second key-area tune, in another key (B flat).61 Example 2 1 Schubert, String Quartet in G, Op. 161, D. 887, i, mm. 105-i i [Allegro molto moderato] Vlns.

Both the authority and the metahuman qualities of minor unisons are uncommonly bold and unmistakable. And the connection between the minor unison passage and expressive character in a composition seems at least implicitly to have been recognized. We read, for example, "and the wild command that opens the first movement, unisono . .. remaining 61 In another context see Beethoven's String Quartet Op. 18, No. I, first movement, the end of the first key area into the beginning of the second key area.

And in yet a different context, see the second movement, the Scherzando, of his String Quartet Op. 59, No. I (mm. 62-68), where a unison prepares the first big return of the solo opening idea of the movement. For the reverse--a solo preparing a unison--see the rondo finale of Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" String Quartet (mm. 309-17 and 646-5 I), where a solo at once suggests and leads to the unison refrain of the rondo.</page><page sequence="41">522 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY threateningly in the background .... "62 And: "This sonata is start- ling in its emotional tension and ripeness. From the very opening, with its hollow unison, we are spellbound by the tragic force of the music."63 The "wild command" that opens Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor, K. 478, might profitably be thought of as a minor mode analogue to the heraldic fanfare unison openings in the major key, but, of course, with very different affective character-a threatening control, as Einstein suggests, rather than stable, affirmative, heraldic authority.64 The "hollow unison" opening of Mozart's Sonata in E minor for Violin and Piano, K. 304 (300c), is quite another story; it provides a telling example and a focus for several matters to be considered (Example 22). This is not a terse "wild command" but rather a full- blown, twelve-measure statement-an eight-measure period, plus a four-measure motive-group that ends on a half cadence. Its affective character is unmistakably on the dark side of the emotional continu- um.6s As with all the examples in this essay, many elements contribute to affect-to the "tragic force," as Blom puts it. But in this example, the melodic and rhythmic means seem strikingly elementary for such expressive power. It is the presence of a unison for the entire twelve-measure opening-an uncommon extent for an opening state- ment in the minor-and its combination with a piano dynamic level for the first eight measures, that is unusual and of special interest here (see Example 22a). We recognize at once that several instrumental parts--or agents- are present; but they had been joined, as if in a single dramatic 62 Alfred Einstein, Mozart: His Character, His Work, trans. Arthur Mendel and Nathan Broder (London, 1945), pp. 264-65, discussing Mozart's Piano Quartet in G minor, K. 478. 63 Eric Blom in The Mozart Companion, ed. Louis Biancolli (New York, 1954), p. 533, discussing Mozart's Sonata for Violin and Piano in E minor, K. 304 (300c). 6 Other annunciatory commands-analogous to the "wild command" of the opening of Mozart's G-minor Piano Quartet-are illustrated by the opening of Beethoven's Piano Concerto in C minor and the opening of Haydn's String Quartet in F-sharp minor, Op. 50, No. 4. Another interesting example in this general connection is the introduction to Act II (the monastery of St. Just) of Verdi's Don Carlos, a piano unison in F-sharp minor, performed by four horns. The ominous quality of this music is only quietly asserted, but there is an undertone that seems insidious, menacing. Needless to say, the affect comes from the activity in all the parameters and not from the unison per se, but it is mostly the horns' unison that suggests the controlling character of the Church. 65 Comparing the Counts in Verdi's II trovatore and Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, Julian Budden writes of "the classical device of a heavy unison to express negative emotion" (The Operas of Verdi, II [New York, I979], 81).</page><page sequence="42">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 523 Example 22 Mozart, Sonata for Violin and Piano in E minor, K. 304 (300c), i (a) mm. 1-15 Allegro 5 hua. -,  " I , ' I I .

There is, in short, no ground from which to "view" the melody. Everything has been subjugated and absorbed into the one character (the unison line). Perhaps this mime of a dreaded human experience- total emptiness and solitariness, as if there were no one else in the universe to relate to-accounts for some of the "hollow" character described by Blom. The hushed piano dynamic for the first eight-measure statement increases the sense of suppressed energy that we experience in the passage. For it is most natural that the expression of a unison by different instruments be loud and forceful (as in the examples referred to on p. 509, the majestic fanfares). The piano, combined with a unison line, creates a double containment: the controlling authority of the unison and the suppression of a normal dynamic. Two things are, so to speak, unnatural. After the reined-in affect of the first eight-measure period, there is an eery cast created by the stormy forte contrast of the second part of the melody--the sequential motive-group in measures 9-I2. Perhaps in its more normal dynamic for a unison, as well as in its stormy character, it is a preparation for entry (m. 13) into a more human-a less empty, less anonymous-world. One of the elements of enchain- ment in the "double containment" has been lifted; expression is becoming gradually more natural. For a listener identifying with the unison line qua character, there is a certain relief when, at measure I 3, an accompaniment-at once responsorial and supportive-enters. Although not as sustained or intense, because the Sturm und Drang unison statement occurs only in the piano part (for the first eight measures), the same sort of thing happens in the opening of Beetho- 66 In this connection see Cone, The Composer's Voice, pp. 103-10o4 on the subject of how we hear a single melody line when it is orchestrally doubled or sectionally reinforced.</page><page sequence="44">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 525 ven's Sonata for Violin and Piano in C minor, Op. 3o, No. 2. Here, too, when a regularly patterned accompaniment appears, together with the new sound of the violin (m. 9), we know we have entered a more natural, nonarbitrary world. In both the Mozart and Beethoven sonatas, the accompaniment patterns themselves are, of course, arbitrary, but not so the principle underlying their use: it is more natural to have a line with a regular accompaniment pattern than to have individual parts of a chamber ensemble performing the same line in unison. With the appearance of the accompaniment in both sonatas we have, at least temporarily, left an alien world. As the preceding discussion suggests, purely syntactic explana- tions for lengthy unisons, especially in the minor, are difficult to advance. The mode for understanding such unisons may indeed be largely extra-musical; perhaps there can be no syntactic explanation for sustained unison presence. This may even be so for some less sustained statements in the minor, such as frequently appear in the Sturm und Drang symphonies of Haydn (for example, the first and fourth movements of his Symphony No. 44 in E minor) and in other works of this type, such as the finale of Mozart's early Symphony in G minor, No. 25. The recapitulation of the first movement of Mozart's Violin and Piano Sonata in E minor calls attention to an interesting aspect of the relation between conventionalized and contextual signs (Example 22b). The beginning of the recapitulation is rather elusive because of several violations of normal recall at the moment of tonic return. Not only is the order of material reversed (with the forte motive-group, from m. 8, coming first) but, importantly, the recall of the opening theme in the tonic begins as a solo (m. ii 3)--a conspicuous deviation from the imprint of the original unison presentation, which would have been more normal for the return.67 Neither the motive-group quote in the tonic at measure io8 (with its ending on V) nor the solo beginning of the most salient part of the first key-area melody satisfies our sense of return. As a denial of the expected unison, the solo texture at measure 13 warns us that "something is up." Partly it prepares us for the ensuing disruption of stable harmony; what follows is, indeed, an invasion of stability, this time from below, by an augmented sixth chordal drum 67 This, I think, despite the fact that the second, and less stable part of the opening statement occurred first at measures io8-i 2; and because of our memory of the original order, this may have suggested the return of the material that had originally followed it--the material that had occurred accompanied at measure 13 in the exposition.</page><page sequence="45">526 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY bass; this harmonized drum bass is an escalation of the sort of thing that happened shortly after the beginning of the development.68 (Stable recall is postponed until the rhyme with material from measures 20ff., essentially the material that closed the first key area in the exposition.) A solo is altogether less controlled and predictable than a unison; virtually anything can happen to, or against, it. To take previous metaphors a step further: a solo, "speaking" as a lone individual, is felt to be more vulnerable than a unison sounding as the utterance of a group. Relatively speaking, a unison is impervious to invasion and, in this style, normally concludes (on some hierarchic level) before textural change occurs. This is not as often the case with a solo. In the Mozart example something is done to the solo. (One can scarcely imagine, say, a harmonic accompaniment in measure I 14 had measure 112-13 been a unison.) A maximum projection of syntactic ambiguity--of line, or rhythm, or both--is also closely affiliated with minor unisons. Such ambiguity is, of course, itself an aspect of expressive character. Because of the relatively greater frequency of chromaticism in minor, intensification of ambiguity by unison textures tends to happen more often in the minor than the major. Two striking instances are the opening of the development section of the last movement of Mozart's Symphony No. 40 in G minor and the opening of the first movement of his Piano Concerto in C minor, K. 491. But ambiguity occurs in the major, too, as in the opening of Mozart's String Quartet in E flat, K. 428, or the opening of Beethoven's "Grosse Fuge" String Quartet. The absence of chord specification in each instance both insures and underlines whatever ambiguity is present as the result of other parameters. Further, the unison requires and enforces--demands--a tempo- rary acceptance of the ambiguity; as mentioned earlier, a unison in this style is normally impervious to invasion or modification until it has run its course--completed a unit of action on some hierarchic level of structure. Similarly, the unison facilitates and puts in boldface the possibili- ties for unusual or extravagant grammar. This is the case with 68 The solo texture at measure I 3 does not seem to be simply a response to a need for contrast with the preceding unison, for Mozart did not bother with such contrast in the exposition. Even if it were, however, the point about the sign value of this moment holds.</page><page sequence="46">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 527 chromatic lines that go "too far"-as, for example, the chromatic move to D flat as V of G flat in the first movement of Beethoven's String Quartet Op. i30 (mm. 5 1-53), the last unison motion in the first movement of Haydn's String Quartet Op. 74, No. I (shown in Ex. i), or the Presto transformation of the unison gesture from measure 52, to begin the coda (m. 611), in the finale of Schubert's Piano Trio in B flat.69 If rhythm is unstable or ambiguous, the unison also maximizes those qualities. For example, the uncertainty as to where the down- beat really is at the opening of the Scherzo of Beethoven's String Quartet in A minor, Op. 132 (Example 23) is unrelieved by any indications from other parts.70 (Surely, a, as the first structural tone, is a potential downbeat; the slurs, directing the player to perform the meter, contribute to the ambiguity.) For similar reasons, the unison opening of Part II in the Scherzo of Beethoven's String Quartet in E flat, Op. 127 (mm. 36-40) maximizes the melodic/metric ambiguity; it puts in boldface the instability present as a result of non-congruent action in primary parameters. In such instances, the neutrality of presentation in unison is rather like the straight-faced comic's refusal to express fully the meaning of his action. Something is held back. But the neutrality ultimately intensifies the meaning of his communica- tion. Example 23 Beethoven, String Quartet in A minor, Op. I32, ii, mm. 1-6 Allegro ma non tanto ?f f T 69 Other treatments of the unison gesture are discussed on pp. 513-17 and shown in Example I8 (the Presto version is not included there). 70 Even with some indication from another part, a unison may strengthen ambiguity. In the first movement of Haydn's Symphony No. 92 in G, for example, despite a pedal tone on the downbeat (mm. 65-69), a unison treatment of a hemiola pattern maximizes propulsion toward the second key area.</page><page sequence="47">528 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY A sudden neutrality of this type would also seem to be part of Beethoven's initially noncommittal stance toward the meaning of the gesture (mm. 10-14) shown in Example 24 from the first movement of his String Quartet in F, Op. 135.71 The neutrality of this unison texture insists upon the non-fit of melody with prevailing meter--calls attention, that is, to the metric displacement of the melody, as well as to a melodic character totally different from anything that has preceded or will follow. In its immediate context the gesture is unassimilated, and the unison is an important element in our puzzle- ment about its nature and ultimate function. We are forced to suspend it in memory until subsequent events clarify its significance. Example 24 Beethoven, String Quartet in F, Op. 135, i, mm. 8-i6 [Allegretto] I0 ----- resc. .---re-c.------------ :'B _ r= , - 'e0-0010 Related to the power of the unison to intensify ambiguity is its power to deny full harmonic definition. By virtue of its association with the ceremonial, the unison can prompt us temporarily to suspend belief in the "reality" of a passage, to take that passage as if in quotes, 71 Joseph Kerman, The Quartets of Beethoven (New York, 1967), pp. 355-57, dubs this theme a "cantus firmus" and Leonard Ratner (in a class on Beethoven's string quartets) called it a "commedia dell'arte character." That both characterized this material, if in seemingly contradictory ways, further corroborates points made earlier (see above, pp. 508-509) about the tendency to account for unison passages with metaphors or other extra-musical aids.</page><page sequence="48">TEXTURE AS A SIGN 529 or in some way not part of the main action--as a ceremonial or theatrical episode "outside" the realm of the real events of the piece. For example, in the first movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 in A the unison in measures 136-41 (together with a somewhat slowed surface and harmonic rhythm) tells us not to take very seriously the threat to the stability of E major that occurs with the sudden deflection to C so soon after the beginning of the second key area (Example 25). Harmonized, that deflection might have seemed very real, but the protracted unison instructs us to take in the passage not as a genuine harmonic locus but rather as a tone. It is not a true modulation but a kind of extended deceptive cadence on the level of key areas, even though C major does not actually make its entry as a deceptive cadence but has been hastily set up as a temporary tonic by its own dominant (m. 135). The unison is crucial to the appropriate Example 25 Beethoven, Symphony No. 7, Op. 92, i, mm. 134-42 [Vivace] (Tpt. and Timp. omitted) 136 W.W. + Hn. f Vlns. I + 2 (Vln. I + 2) Vla (Vla.) Bsn. + Hn.

By the end of this passage Beethoven confirms our interpretation: he explicitly reduces the texture to the single tone c in order to leave this "mistaken" place. The c is treated as a seventh in vii7 of E, the proper tonic, and we return to the "real world" of the piece. The example from Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 illustrates one way in which a unison may threaten or disrupt the world that we inhabit as imaginary participants in the unfolding of a musical drama or discourse. Under normal circumstances, when we participate in the events of a composition we are free to identify with the lines, groupings, etc., variously, as if with characters in a play or story. And though the performer, and especially the composer, leads us, as participating listeners, we are free to assume the roles we choose.72 But when we experience a unison passage we are, like the lines themselves, subjugated to the compelling authority of the one line that is given to all. Because there is only a single group action, there is no choice. We are forced to abandon our connections with individual dramatic personae and to enter the shared, authoritarian world of the unison passage. Such unanimity, as noted earlier, appears unnatural. And yet, taken on a next higher level-from more of a god's-eye view, so to speak-the world of ritual can itself be understood as natural. Clifford Geertz writes: "The world as lived and the world as imagined, fused under the agency of a single set of symbolic forms, turns out to be the same world. . . ."73 Is it perhaps our experience of that fusion that makes some unisons so powerful, even, at times, bone-chilling in their evocation of a collective past? But talk of the evocation of a collective past verges on the indefinite and the diversionary-away from musical experience. Quite to the contrary, my subject has been the definite directives-the signs-that certain textures provide for listeners (and, of course, performers-as- listeners). Far from being diversionary, referential connotations of textures, whether culture-bound or cross-cultural, help us to under- stand functional relations-the syntax-of compositions. Far from leading us away, such connotations may serve as instantaneous conduits to syntax. This has been shown in numerous examples of unisons and solos. Contrastingly, the more conventionalized the 72 I am particularly indebted here to Cone's discussion of the nature of our participation in a musical composition in The Composer's Voice.

Further inquiry is likely to bring to light other textures that can be interpreted as syntactic signs; and it seems probable that textural types similar to those explored here can be identified and fruitfully studied in the music of other epochs and cultures.
