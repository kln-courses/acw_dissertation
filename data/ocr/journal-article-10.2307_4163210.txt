<plain_text><page sequence="1">LIFE OF THE PIGEON. By Alexander F. Skutch, illus. by Dana Gardner. Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca, New York. 1991:130 pp., 24 color plates with caption figs., 29 text figures, 4 tables. $49.95.-Alexander Skutch has few peers as an observer of the life of birds. With more than 20 books to his credit, he also has few peers as a prolific communicator of his obser- vations. In "Life of the Pigeon," as in his previous books, "Life of the Tanager," and "Life of the Woodpecker," Skutch teams up with artist Dana Gardner to produce a book that is both readable and educational. Skutch combines his personal knowledge of pigeons that he has watched near his Costa Rican home with a masterful summary of the published literature on columbids of the world. After a brief introduction to the family Columbidae with its nearly 300 species, Skutch provides a chapter-by-chapter accounting of the main elements of their behavioral ecology. Consistent with Skutch's interests, reproductive aspects-from courtship to the rate of re- production-take up the bulk of the book. The final brief chapters discuss pigeon-human relations, homing pigeons, navigation, and a fascinating descnrption of the various races of pigeons kept by Charles Darwin. A bibliography and an index follow the text. Skutch's writing style is unusual, to say the least. Each chapter is a nonstop narrative, unimpeded by headings or breaks of any sort. Within each chapter, there is little discernable pattern to the arrangement of topics and facts about the various species that illustrate those topics. Anecdotes are thrown in along with data, mixing trivia with important information. Although acknowledgements are given to authors of major studies, no distinction is made between Skutch's personal observations and those of other naturalists. For example, in a discussion of foraging behavior, Skutch notes that Galapagos Doves (Zenaida galapagoensis) dig with their bills. Then it is stated, "A Galapagos Dove continued for many minutes to dig beneath an opuntia bush . . ." (p. 13). It is unclear whether Skutch had seen this himself or is reporting on something he read. It is also unclear why this observation even merits repeating. Despite these difficulties in presenting scientific information in a popular style, the book is very readable. The text flows well. At the end of each chapter, the reader will have a feel for how doves and pigeons eat and drink, nest, navigate or whatever the topic may be. I found no errors in the text, although poorly substantiated information such as the assertion of life-long pairbonds among permanently resident Mourning Doves (Zenaida macroura) is presented as fact (p. 22). Also, the illustration of the Tooth-billed Pigeon (Didunculus strigirostris) perpetuates the fallacy that this species is a ground-dweller. Skutch's well-known species-selectionist views and slight anthropomorphism surface at times, but can easily be ignored without detracting from the information content. The two dozen plates by Dana Gardner dispel any notion that pigeons are drab, dull birds. A sampling of the showier pigeons around the world emphasizes the diversity of plumages and sizes within the basic body format. Gardner's images are vivid, but many of the shapes</page><page sequence="2">ORNITHOLOGICAL LITERATURE 567 look like cardboard cut-outs against a bare background. The beautiful painting of a pair of Victoria Crowned Pigeons (Goura victoria) in their natural habitat, which graces the book jacket, is an exception but still does not illustrate the behavior of the birds. The doves and pigeons of the world are a fascinating lot. Alexander Skutch, aided by Dana Gardner, captures the essence of their life and presents it in an easily digestible form. Although scientists may be exasperated by some of the elements of the presentation, any student of birds will be enlightened and entertained by reading "Life of the Pigeon." -DAVID E.
