<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Jane  M i l l e r Tucson ,  A r i z ona Like her colleague Richard Shelton, Jane Miller lives across the valley  from the gorgeous Santa Catalina Mountains, which ring the eastern  landscape outside Tucson, Arizona. It’s been nearly twenty years since  my wife and I left Arizona, so before I knock on Miller’s front door, I stand  there and soak in some of the endless and bathing sunlight. It’s cool  today, in the seventies, but I know what it’s like here. In a few weeks it’ll  be 110 in the shade, and by then we’ll be many miles down the road. Miller greets me at the door in the midst of this little daydream and  invites me in. We look around her stunning and large adobe home and  then sit in her great room: Mexican tile, twelve-foot windows, a piano that  Jane is learning to play. She tells me a little bit about hiking the trails in and around this  hillside house. I ask about the local wildlife (spiders, snakes, and such),  and she admits that she’s skittish about the snakes and sees a variety of  these desert creatures regularly enough. She tells me about a recent party  they had here where visitors from elsewhere came across a scorpion out  on the back patio; and I spend the next several minutes watching around  my feet for something speedy and small. ~~~~~~ Do you think place has played a role in what you write? Yes. I’ve moved around a lot, from Provincetown Bay to Tomales Bay  and all points in between; and topography, weather, the bustle of the  marketplace, the presence of a border here between southern Arizona  and Mexico—all these manifestations feed my imagination. Reality  and the imagination, it seems to me, have an inexplicably successful  marriage. I like to walk as much as I can. The fi rst thing I do is set out  every morning. It’s a meditation. Not that I then set about describing  impressions; I’m not naturalistic in the way I write. I like to leap and  make associations and unusual, even unrealistic, connections. I prefer  the expressionism that results, and which, for me, makes a heightened  reality. For example, on a very hot day here in the desert, when I’m out  walking, all the dirt and cacti and gravel are a moonscape. Cacti don’t  really blow in the wind. There’s a feeling of stopped time that has advised  me about exploding, expanding a moment in poetry and prose. I’m sure  132 </page> <page sequence="2"> Jane Miller  133 this is quite different from the action of, say, a fl at Floridian landscape.  So, form—diction, syntax—is a kind of dreamscape of the terrain. And  then, of course, subjects rise up as matter-of-factly, and as forcefully,  as islands appear to someone sailing a ship. Who could live in this place  and not be aware, for example, of Mexicans trying to cross into this  country every day, many without enough water, and against all odds?  Are there specifi c places that may have had an even more direct effect on  your process? When I’m happy and have been able to make a place home, I feel  free to write. I don’t write very well when I’m miserable, and the feel  of a place, with its friendly or unfriendly trees, coyotes with nerves  on edge—it can all get rather anthropomorphic—defi nitely affects my  internal weather. I remember the wonderful trails of Humboldt County (California)  with spongy soil. I felt buoyant, really, and that no doubt got projected  onto the page. And the place was glowing in mist. Thinking of those  days, I am certain that the landscape and the spirit of the place had a  huge effect on the thinking I do.  Experiencing a wavy landscape—heat waves, ocean waves—creates  a certain harmonic peace for me, which may have led to my long, clausal  sentence structure. And, of course, it’s no surprise that the desert, with  its exposed lumpy ocean fl oor, offers a wonderful metaphor, wonderful  encouragement, for writing. You know the old story of the nomad on a  quest for an oasis? Is what is out there a mirage? What’s reality?  When you were painting, did you fi nd that elements of that endeavor had  companions in your work as a poet? Absolutely. It served as ballast to my tendency to perceive of the world  as super-amped. That is, things could be as simple as the blue table,  the red hat, the green chair. The world gets complicated soon enough by  language. My poetry gets complicated very quickly. I think in associative  ways and expressionistic  ways, so before I know it, I’m  off and running. This reminds  me of that—reminds me of  that. But having to portray  the world in color was a kind  of relief. A way to keep a place  simple. Spare. But I gave up  painting because, in fact,  the world does need to be  represented in its layers, in its  thickness, and I wasn’t able to  </page> <page sequence="3"> 134 Poets on Place achieve that in oil. Still, I’m grateful for what, in many ways, was an  idyllic time. You’ve been in Arizona since the late 1980s. Is it a tough place to live,  given the rocky and somewhat inhospitable landscape? Certainly there are a lot of snakes, and I’m very cautious about  them. I had a recent encounter with one while I was recycling my trash,  and it was a formidable experience. My blood drained out and ran into  my shoes! And the landscape is formidable because of what you can and can’t  touch. If you’re used to lying down in the grass or feeling the sweet  leaves of the almond tree—forget about it. It’s not a very welcoming  landscape. Do you feel any responsibility or obligation to capture anything about this  place where you live? I feel a heavy responsibility. I don’t know if “capture” is the right  word though. I’m not an environmentalist or a scientist; there’s a lot  I don’t understand. But I spent some years researching the efforts to  create the bomb out in New Mexico, when I was writing a book that  worked that theme a bit. Driving around the remote Southwest can no  longer be a naive experience of strange beauty—it turns out that the  ground underneath is ticking. Toxins have been leaking into the earth  for sixty-odd years. I became obsessed with nuclear waste material and  its effect on the landscape here, not to mention the human population.  So I spent some time getting involved in politics in that way. I was  outspoken without being terribly knowledgeable. And then I realized that  it wasn’t really my job; I wasn’t trained. However, I was thinking about  what evil is, and the question has stayed in my work at the metaphoric  level. Poets have vivid imaginations and can imagine the very worst of  what must be going on.  I would describe myself as a writer who is forced into the real world  every day. And I think we absolutely have an obligation not only to  describe what we see but also to rail against any further deception. It’s  just not enough to say, “Things are a mess.” We have to prevent them  from getting worse. That’s a challenge. And I don’t have a blueprint for  how to do that. But, as a teacher, I feel that I have to participate in a  conversation about the responsibilities of the poet to the world. It’s not  about the sounds of the words we use, even as they echo sounds in  nature. It’s not about recreating pictures “of a lost world.” That’s only  the beginning.  </page> </plain_text>
