<plain_text><page sequence="1">Autopsies of Faith in Kierkegaard's Philosophiske Smuler Peter Fenves ".... ene, nasten med det menneskelige Sprog mod mig.. . ." "... alone, almost with human language against me . . ." S0ren Kierkegaard Point of View for My Work as an Author "I can put my own life on line, I can in all seriousness jest [i alAlvor spoge] with my own life-not with another's."'' Thus Johannes Cli- macus closes the Preface to Philosophiske Smuler and cuts off all communication with his fellow human beings: jest and seriousness become the modes of being through which he, in his isolation, re- lates to his own life, and this self-relation is determined in lan- guage as the interrogative mood. He has put his life into question. On the title page, just below his name, as an addendum to and perhaps as a clarification of its strange formality, Climacus poses to himself a set of questions, whose final member-"can an eternal happiness be built on historical knowledge?" (173)-demands an answer that will not fall prey to jest and that therefore does not need a mark of seriousness. He cannot even hope to deliver an answer to this question as long as his language is determined by the play of jest interspersed with marks of seriousness, and until Climacus can learn a language that does without jest and that does not therefore need to mark the onset of seriousness, his relation to his own life will always be in question. To jest in all seriousness is to question the jest (at spbrge spbgen); to question the conception of language as jest (sprog som speg), and indeed the conception that jest is endemic to language; to question whether word play-</page><page sequence="2">M L N 1063 spirge, spbg, sprog-and thus the word that falls prey to such play constitutes the essence of language; to question whether the inter- rogative mood determines the mode of being through which one relates to oneself in language. To jest in all seriousness is to ques- tion whether language itself, and not that questionable language, whose seriousness can never be sustained, has indeed come into being; to question how one relates to oneself in this other lan- guage; and finally to question whether language without jest (sprog uden spbg), if it has come into being, has not already been slain in jest and, by virtue of the word play that begins to define Climacus' discourse, whether it has henceforth turned into a spectre (sprog som spogelse). Clirnacus' proposal to jest in all seriousness in sum demands an index of seriousness that does not in turn fall prey to jest, and he closes the Preface by locating just such an index in the thought of death. Once the thought of death is lost, the jest-the serious jest, whose rules are unfathomable, whose consequences incalculable- turns into either a hopeless mockery or an unendurable burden: "I have only my life, and I promptly put it into play whenever a diffi- culty appears. Then it is easy to dance, for the thought of death is a good dancing partner, my dancing partner" (178). A resume of the occasion that gives rise to this dance: a moment of difficulty emerges, life is on the line, and the jest begins in earnest. But how does such a difficulty (vanskelighed) arise? Did not Socrates insist that all difficulties are self-imposed, hence only illusory difficulties -problemata and hypotheses that a man who does not yet know himself throws out in his temporary confusion, destined to be overcome in the procession of self-knowledge? A difficulty is, under the Socratic interpretation, simply illusory, since the indi- vidual beset by a difficulty confounds its source when he refuses to see that insofar as he brings it forward, it is his difficulty and hence not an impediment to his ongoing project.2 The man who dances with Socrates can never trip, or, so asserts Climacus when he beings to outline his "Project of Thought." But the difficulty that makes the game serious cannot be merely an illusory difficulty, and the only difficulty that occasions a game played in earnest would be a difficulty completely removed from the provenance of problemata and hypotheses projected by human beings. It would not be possible for a self-imposed difficulty to reach beyond man's conceptual grasp, and with this proposition, Climacus asserts, Soc- rates rests satisfied: "a man cannot possibly seek what he knows,</page><page sequence="3">1064 PETER FENVES and, just as impossibly, he cannot seek what he does not know, for what he knows he cannot seek, since he knows it, and what he does not know he cannot seek, because, after all, he does not even know what he is supposed to seek. Socrates thinks through the difficulty in the doctrine of that all learning and seeking are but recollec- tion" (179). By thinking the difficulty through, Socrates abandons the thought of death-"it becomes a demonstration for the im- mortality of the soul" (180)-and he begins to dance with his fellow humans-"for even if a divine point of departure is ever given, between man and man this remains the true relationship" (180). If a man recognizes that it is his own project that produces the difficulty, the game never has occasion to become serious, or, in what amounts to the same, seriousness is never sustained within the game. When Socrates thinks death, he thinks it through and thereby misses it. So, in order to pose a difficulty that thought cannot penetrate, Climacus must pose what he himself cannot pose; he, in other words, must not pose the difficulty. It must come from elsewhere. And yet, the attempt to locate this elsewhere is as contradictory an exercise as the proposal that one pose a diffi- culty that no man, by definition, can pose. For to locate it is eo ipso to locate it within one's conceptual field, that is, within oneself. The difficulty, therefore, cannot be located, but some compulsion propels Climacus further: he must discover its source, for if he relents in his effort, the source may multiply into many sources, the difficulty may branch off into many difficulties, the dance into an interminable sequence of dances and his death may be legion, each a result of the various autopsies he is about to perform. The source of the difficulty is as yet unclear, and as long as this source remains obscure, there can be no proposition about the source, no proposition that makes sense of the source and thus no solution to the problem Climacus proposes. Insofar as every prop- osition is brought forward by a human being, no proposition can escape the position prescribed by Socrates: propositions result from man's pro-positioning, and hence no problem that is in prin- ciple unsolvable can arise. Now the proposition, according to the tradition inaugurated by the Greeks and formalized in Aristotle, has been the privileged locus of truth. The Organon, as the reposi- tory of the tools Socrates employed, begins with the contrasts be- tween mere signification (GnpxtvtlK), rhetorical discourse, and the proposition itself (dno'6cavclc)-that discourse "in which the true and the false reign."3 If the Socratic position is unavoidable, the</page><page sequence="4">M L N 1065 proposition must be considered that form of discourse which, by asserting something about an object and by concomitantly making sense of that object, secures access to truth. So, when Climacus sets the Fragments into motion with a "Propositio," he at once begins to speak about something, to make sense of something and to seek entrance into the realm of truth. Or, at least, he signals that his discourse remains within the provenance of the distinction be- tween truth and falsehood: Propositio: The question is posed by the unknowing one, who does not even know what has given him occasion [Anledning] to ask it thus [at han sporge saaledes]. (179) Yet, it seems, no proposition comes forward: only a question has been asked, whose specific terms remain hidden; we only read of the circumstances that surround the enunciation. No one knows whence the question came. Now this difficulty is simply unthink- able from Socrates' global perspective. The question that initiates his inquiry-"To what extent can the truth be learned? With this question we shall begin. It was a Socratic question" (179)-must proceed from an individual soul. Significant questions only emerge from man's inner self, and since "the condition and the question contain the conditioned and the answer" (184), the mes- sage transmitted by the true proposition that corresponds to the given question always remains within one's own power to grasp. The circumstances of the question mean nothing-such a proposi- tion summarizes the Socratic position: "Thus the truth is not intro- duced into the individual from without but was within him" (180). The circumstances within which the question arises recede into in- significance once the true proposition is clearly ascertained. So the interrogator is only a mid-wife, who does not enter into a familiar relationship with the truthful answer, and the occasion (anledning) of its asking is completely insignificant in comparison to the re- sponse. The eternal validity of the response, moreover, testifies to the oblivion within which the thought of death has fallen: If I were to imagine myself meeting Socrates, Prodicus or the servant- girl in another life, then here again neither of them could be more to me than an occasion [Anledning], as Socrates fearlessly expressed by</page><page sequence="5">1066 PETER FENVES saying that even in the underworld he proposed merely to ask ques- tions; for the ultimate thought of all questioning is that the man asked must himself possess the truth and acquire it by himself. (183) So the first alteration of the Socratic position and the alteration from which everything else follows demands the relinquishment of "the thought of all questioning," insofar as the question finds its source within the self. Any attempt to locate the source runs the risk of succumbing to an illusion, and the possiblity of illusion, in contrast to the Socratic security that an illusion which thought is not able to dispel simply cannot arise, is the most extreme danger that Climacus faces in his attempt to bypass the resources of the Socratic question. If the man who poses the question could recog- nize its source, then that source would prove to be himself, and hence the resources of the Socratic question would once again prove overwhelming. But if the source of the qeustion were in principle unknowable, if it in truth arose from an ignorance that is not merely the negative mode of knowledge, then the Socratic po- sition would not prove ineluctable. The Socratic question turns inward upon itself and turn into an inquiry into the source of its own performance. By asking "To what extant can the truth be learned?" Socrates presupposes a pedagogical process and thus a distinction between the teacher and the student-a distinction that further reflection, conducted from Socrates' position, cancels upon the realization that there can be no essential difference between the teacher and the student. Without essential difference-without, to speak with Aristotle, difference in essence-the teacher and the student must occupy the same relationship toward the truth. The Socratic question thus transforms itself into a proposition about the source of the one who speaks and thus about the essence of the interrogator. The capacity to differentiate the essence of the speaker from accidents that accompany his speech becomes the decisive problem, and as long as one neglects the possibility that there may be difference in essence-absolute difference-then the problem is solved and re- solved in every truthful response. A proposition thus presupposes a primordial positing of its source-the declaration that the speaker is human and that there are no essential differences among human beings. The two moments in Socratic questions: (a) the truth is eternal and so any particular enunciation of it is "so</page><page sequence="6">M L N 1067 incorporated with it that I cannot, so to speak, find it, even if I sought it" (183); (b) the source of the enunciation is always deter- mined to be human, and since there are no essential differences between human beings, each individual finds himself in exactly the same relationship to the truth. The eternity of truth, which over- shadows any performance of it, and the essential similitude of all performers, which negates all consideration of the performer's ac- cidental characteristics, are the two turns in the explication of the Socratic question. Climacus now casts Socrates aside. His "Project of Thought" requires that he relinquish both of these reflective moments: (a) the truth is not eternal but is rather the eternal, and so its enunciation is an event that carries "decisive significance" (afgjrrende Betydning)" (183); (b) the source of the enunciation is as yet undetermined, and so the possibility of difference in essence cannot be so wholly neglected. Because truth and falsehood are no longer assigned to propositions but rather to the speakers them- selves, it now seems as if language, along with the Socratic ques- tion, has been cast aside. And if Socrates's position can indeed se- cure the absorption of language into apophantic discourse, Cli- macus' project would have nothing to do with language and would soon have to do without language altogether. But the exhaustion of language in the proposition is perhaps the first illusion Climacus must confront. Propositional discourse has always had an ambiguous nature: since a proposition is both lin- guistic and non-linguistic-both assertion and meaning-the transitions between the two, the convention by which one is tied to the other, indeed the transubstantiation of one into the other, have perhaps always been the most vexing Socratic problems; it is pre- cisely the problem the difficulty encountered in an idealization whose temporal conditions do not pass into the idealized object. Now Climacus' project of positing an event of decisive significance is, in contrast, the thesis that language arrives in time and that this language, from which propositional discourse ultimately derives and toward which it always tends, is irreducibly temporal. Cli- macus, in other words, takes time seriously. So his project, far from being a step outside of language, is prompted by the possi- bility that language-and not an already constituted medium of meanings-comes into being.4 The "Project of Thought" thus turns in upon itself and asks how it could have come into being, how Climacus could have learned the language now at his disposal, and the Socratic solution-the doctrine of recollection-pre-</page><page sequence="7">1068 PETER FENVES cludes the possibility that language, and not just various expres- sions used to augment an already constituted language, is ever in fact learned. So Socrates must be cast aside. The one who learns language cannot recall anything, precisely because he cannot call upon anything at all. At this point, however, another philosophical proposal seems to fill in the gaps left by the Socratic account. In continuity with his early carrier as a perhaps the only modern thinker who made a serious effort to doubt everything-an un- successful story partially recorded injohannes Climacus eller De Om- nibus Dubitandum Est-Climacus could have concentrated his in- quiry upon a specific phrase and indeed the first phrase one en- counters which, Descartes affirms, "is necessarily true every time it is uttered by me."5 Climacus could, in other words, have asked for the conditions of possibility of uttering this astounding sentence- ego sum-and thereupon pointed out how we can come to assert it. But in Philosophiske Smuler Climacus turns to its negation and asks how one could learn to say non sum, the initial premise being that whoever has not learned to speak in this way has not in truth learned language. Climacus then insists that in order for a man to learn to say non sum in all seriousness, the teacher must not only prompt the student to recognize that such is the case but must above all offer him the condition under which this sentence can be spoken at all. To teach is thus to bestow: "In the moment, a man becomes aware that he was born, for his previous state [Fore- gaaende], to which he is not to appeal, was indeed one of 'not to be'" (190). But could one not respond to Climacus' proposal by affirming that "I do not exist"-and thus language (sprog)-is now only used in the service of jest (spog)? This particular juxtaposition of words, one might argue, means nothing. And at this point, an unnamed voice interrupts Climacus to point out that his entire project has indeed become just such a jest: "This, as you see, is my project! But perhaps someone will say: 'this is the most ridiculous of all projects [.. .] You are like the man who in the afternoon exhibited for a fee that in the forenoon anyone could see free of charge" (190-91). Climacus' proposal, it seems, is merely the re- hearsal of words everyone recalls having heard-words that seem to make sense but since the particular circumstances within which they were learned recedes upon reflection, these words can only be counted as jest, disconnected phrases that have never in fact informed the serious interactions that define communal life. Cli- macus does not contest the unnamed voice but rather insists upon</page><page sequence="8">M L N 1069 its acuteness: everyone has heard this jest, this phrase, but no one can recall having invented them or indeed ever having learned them: "Is it not curious that something like this exists, about which everyone who know it also knows that he has not invented it, and this 'Go to the next house' does not halt and cannot be halted, even though one were to go to everybody? Yet this oddity enthralls me exceedingly, for it tests the correctness of the hypothesis and dem- onstrates it" (191). The echo enthralls Climacus precisely because he cannot recall having learned to say non sum, nor can he image how anyone could have taught it to him or made it up: It would indeed be unreasonable to require that a person discover at day break [opdage] all by himself that he does not exist. But this transi- tion is precisely the transition of rebirth from not existing to existing. Whether he understands it later certainly makes no difference ... (191) The discovery at day break that one does not exist does not lend itself to an understanding that could do without the utterance non sum. To question the conception of language as jest-at spbrge sprog som spbg-is the most exact title of Climacus' project, and non sum marks the very difficulty that nourishes the conception of lan- guage as jest. It is not, of course, that non sum is more difficult to say than sum or that the discovery, the day break initiated in the utterances could conform to any rigorous calendar, but it appears as though ego sum could, once expressed, do without language in the persistence of thought-"the statement 'I am, I exist' is neces- sarily true every time it is uttered by me or conceived in my mind"6-and this illusion lets the articulation of ego non sum fall into the category of mere jest. But when the latter utterance is indeed spoken in the seriousness of discovery, at the moment of day break, not only has the Socratic question been left behind but the conception of language and its learning upon which that ques- tion depends no longer stakes out an inevitable position. But if Climacus insists that the phrase "I do not exist" be spoken in all seriousness, is he not relying precisely upon that distinction between saying and meaning that underlies the conception of sprog as spyg? For one can certainly say non sum and yet not mean it, and since language has no indubitable mark of seriousness-a mark that is not at once exposed to jest-the call to seriousness seems to demand a flight from language towards extra-linguistic intentions, ascertained motivations, typical behavior, and so forth. Now Cli-</page><page sequence="9">1070 PETER FENVES macus does not offer a detailed treatment of the concept of seri- ousness, but in the Introduction to the Concept of Anxiety, which may also serve as the introduction to Philosophical Fragments, seri- ousness is given a thorough treatment. Seriousness is said to be a response, and indeed that singular voicing which conditions every response; it is that mood (stemning) which answers (svarer) to sin.7 Language that arrives in time and that is irreducibly temporal is not at first apophantic discourse but rather pathetic voicing: a stemning in the stemne of that single individual who answers to the singularity of sin. But the word sin may perhaps prejudice the issue. In the absence of a detailed elucidation of sin in the The Concept of Anxiety, its counterpart in Philosophical Fragments will have to suffice: seriousness, according to this substitution whose systematicity must be examined, is that voicing which answers to absolute difference. In Philosophical Fragments, moreover, Climacus offers a counterpart to the concept of seriousness as an answer to absolute difference: it is the concept of sorg-care or sorrow-and it is the difference that inhabits the very notion of sorg that lays out the distinction between the one who teaches language and the one who learns it: And just as that royal sorrow [Sorg] is found only in a royal soul and most human languages [Menneskers Sprog] do not name it at all, likewise all human language is so self-loving that it does not intimate such sorrow. (196)8 Sorg-seriousness before absolute difference-cannot maintain a secure mark in propositional discourse, and so it seems to with- draw completely from human language, especially when the prop- osition is thought to define the essence of language. But this with- drawal is the illusion from which all other illusions find their source. For sorg is not sorrow over a determinate object defined in apophantic discourse; it does not depend upon prior acts of de- nomination and predication, and, in particular, it never presup- poses a primordial positing of the speaker whose essence is deter- mined to be human. Seriousness, as that sprog which has come into being, is rather sorrow over absolute difference, and the source of this language differs in essence from the human being. The source, therefore, is not human. At this moment, the Aris- totelian Organon as the instrument of propositional discourse, pro-</page><page sequence="10">M L N 1071 vides the grid through which the source receives a preliminary definition. The expression to ouK 6vOpooc ("the not human") serves in fact as Aristotle's example of an ovozta d6pltcov ("indefi- nite nominal phrase").9 Since the phrase only specifies what is not, it will always fail to refer something in particular. But for Climacus this non-determination indicates that the Socratic inquiry and its formal organization in the Aristotelian Organon have been left be- hind. In the "Propositio" the question emerges from the "un- known one" whose voice remains undetermined; the source of the question is simply without delimitation. It could come from any- where except man. Yet this exception provides a first indication of the direction towards which the tale (digt) of language's coming into being might orient itself. Although the attempt to locate the source must be carried out without the resources of the Organon and thus without the aid of propositional discourse, it is only be- cause Climacus dares another proposition that he can even set out on his attempt to articulate such a digt: But in order to get started, let us state a daring proposition [dristig Proposition]: let us assume that we know what a human being is. In this we do indeed have the criterion [Criterium] of truth, which all Greek philosophy sought, or doubted, or postulated, or brought to fruition. (205) This proposition is particularly risky, because it assumes a kind of self-knowledge that was radically unavailable to Socrates. The par- adox of his thought, according to Climacus, is that he, who knew more about the human being than any other man, still wondered whether he himself was in essence a man or a monster (Phaedrus, 229e). By holding forth the criterion of truth, which allows one to determine the essence of the speaker, the individual's knowledge of himself is utterly shaken and the decision to speak is no longer even his decision. The track of the "unknown something," who forms the criterion and therefore makes the decision, leads to the nomination of the god: But what is this unknown against which the understanding [Forstanden] in its paradoxical passion collides and which even disturbs man and his self-knowledge? It is the unknown [det Ubekjendte]. But it is not a human being, insofar as he knows man or whatever else he knows. So let us call this unknown something: the god. It is nothing more than a name we give to it. (207)</page><page sequence="11">1072 PETER FENVES Every stage of the "Project of Thought" involves a similar decision and a similar nomination; Climacus would reach a point of arrest and then add "let us call this . . ." In no other case, however, does he add the proviso that he has introduced "nothing more than a name" into the discussion and then shortly thereafter alter "name" to "concept" (208), thereby pointing towards the work of concep- tualization carried out in every human project. At this point the "non-human" can receive no predicate and has no extension. No proposition that has any determinate sense can be formed with it. What happens when propositional discourse is thus disturbed, when its synthetic function breaks down, its criteria are so thor- oughly shaken? When nothing is said-because no predicates can be formed-the undefined phrase stands as the indistinguishable mark of the limit to sense (forstand). No position stands before this limit, so at this abysmal point, the understanding (forstanden) en- counters its opposite: What, then, is the unknown? It is the limit that is continually arrived at, and therefore when the category of motion is replaced by the category of rest it is the different, the absolutely different [det absolut Forskjellige]. But it is absolutely different in which there is no distinguishing mark [Kjendetegn]. Defined or determined [Bestemmet] as the absolutely dif- ferent, it seems to be at the point of being disclosed, but not so, because the understanding [Forstanden] cannot even think the absolutely dif- ferent; it cannot negate itself but uses itself for that purpose and conse- quently thinks the difference in itself, which it thinks by itself. It cannot absolutely transcend itself and therefore thinks as above itself only the sublimity that it thinks by itself. (212) If the understanding thinks through the absolute difference, its care and sorrow turn into a negligent assurance of proper differ- entiation, whose self-affirmation comes out in the attribution of sublimity and the experience of the sublime. Such negligence shrinks away from the serious, that is, from the grave question. The only way in which the limit to the understanding can be re- spected is through a vigilant sheltering of the absolute difference. But it is not an easy matter to shelter the absolute difference, for it-if indeed reference should be made with a singular pronoun -cannot be distinguished. Once again we run across the diffi- culty: to stand before (forstand, propositio) the absolute difference precludes the possibility that one could recognize one's forward</page><page sequence="12">M L N 1073 position; to think the absolutely other of the understanding and not to think it through demands the abandonment of definition and determinate articulation. Mere appellation, indefinite designation that affords no predication, is in truth all that the thought of the absolute difference, the thought of strict nonsense and, hence, the thought of death can together propose. But when the difficulty emerges neither the Socratic solution-"Socrates thinks the diffi- culty through. . ." (18)-nor Climacus' anonymous project-mere appellation that soon turns into conceptualization-prove suffi- cient. For even to speak of the thought of the absolute difference presupposes the capacity to differentiate absolute difference from itself: this absolute difference must be distinguishable from that absolute difference, and this thought must be distinguishable from that (or some other) thought which, since it relinquishes the para- doxical passion that drives thought to seek its own demise, is not even a thought of the absolute difference. The thought of the abso- lute difference cannot be a thought among others, a thought that one merely entertains or a thought one decides to think. However weak a demonstrative "the" may be, it still serves to demonstrate, and in the act of demonstration, it speaks of the absolutely other and thereby makes sense of the absolutely other of sense. So "The Project of Thought" not only cannot be Climacus' project, it cannot even be a project of thought, that is, thought's project. The definite article-det bestemte kendeord-includes the two moments which the thought of the absolute difference can never accommo- date: the moment of definition and the moment of determinate articulation. The absolute difference goes unmarked, without a kendeord, and yet it still seems to let something-the-stand before it. Strictly speaking-and what else is propositional discourse?- the thought of the absolute difference is completely insignificant. The the will never make a whit of sense. 10 And if Climacus himself is not to fall into complete babble, he must break with the entire philosophical tradition and declare: thought is thoroughly re- moved from the understanding; it includes no synthetic function; propositions are not expressive of thought, and thought is not a synthetic activity that somehow gives rise to propositions but rather is that care for and sorrow over the absolute difference. The Organon must be thrown aside in order to make room for the thought of the absolute difference-indefinable demonstration or indeterminate articulation-and yet the attempt to displace the Organon opens the thought of the absolute difference to a multi-</page><page sequence="13">1074 PETER FENVES tude of confused figurations. The understanding, in combination with the power of imagination, breaks up the utterly indeter- minate articulation of the unknown and scatters it with rhetorical flourish, just as the Jews were scattered after the destruction of the Temple: Unless the unknown (the god) is not merely the limit, then the one thought about the difference (den ene Tanke om det Forskjellige) is con- fused with the many ideas about the differences. The unknown is then in 6tayntopd, and the understanding has an attractive selection from what is available and what imagination can think up (the monstrous, the ridiculous, etc.). (212) The diaspora-surely the strangest possible designation for a mo- ment Climacus later identifies as the characteristic activity of pagan imagination (213)- follows from the dispersion of the single thought of the absolute difference, or, in an even simpler formula- tion, from the relinquishment of conceptual thought and its para- doxical passion. By discarding the synthetic function of proposi- tional discourse, a swarm of figurations comes to occupy that for- ward place which, however paradoxical it may seem, stands opposite the absolutely other. The dispersion thus results from a foreclosure of the diligent devotion to the process of thinking through the concept and manifesting that thought in apophantic discourse. Instead of holding fast to the problem at hand in the earnest work of articulation, the understanding attempts to grasp too quickly its limit and thereby precipitates the dispersal of the mere limiting concept and finds itself faced with multifarious ob- jects of possible cognition. Thus, on the one hand, the abstention from the work of understanding ignites the outpouring of mul- tiple monstrosities, and on the other hand, the decision to hold onto the unknown as mere limiting concept in the elaboration of the understanding presupposes that the limit, never having been attained, is still always about to be grasped. The dispersion thus transforms itself into a temporal unfolding, wherein each moment is about to become the moment that unites the contradictory predi- cates attached to the unknown. The fullness of time, when the temporal encounters the eternal, is constantly projected onto the future as the future, and the future receives definition insofar as the moment is always about to come: "Or," Climacus writes as he sketches the "dialectic of the moment" and explains the scandal</page><page sequence="14">M L N 1075 that the Jews attribute to the announcement that the moment has come (when they perhaps only attribute the scandal to the an- nouncement and the dispersion of announcements), "the moment is supposed to be constantly about to come; one looks for it, and the moment is supposed to be worth looking for, but since the paradox has made the understanding absurd, what the understanding con- siders worth looking for is no distinguishing mark [Kjendetegn]" (218). Although the temporalization of the 6icynopa in the on- going proposal that the moment is always about to come forestalls the catastrophic dispersion of the absolute difference into multiple figurations of many differences, such a temporalization cannot shelter the absolute difference in language: it has nothing to say, no tale to recount, no digt of the coming into being of language and thus no language in which it, at a moment's notice, can speak. And if the paradox and thus language-"I do not exist"-has in- deed come into being, such a proposal cannot be serious, careful, blessed with sorrow. If Climacus can indeed speak, if his sprog is not merely a spbg but also the sorg that is language learned in time, then this proposal to temporalize the dispersal is indeed without distinction. Climacus withdraws the absolute difference from the dispersion that is time by proposing that it arrive in time. It-if "it" is indeed singular-is only singular insofar as it arrives at one moment and arrives as the moment. Now the organs of sensation are not ade- quate to recognize this moment; nor are the principles and axioms laid out in the Organon appropriate for the apprehension of an historical moment, since they are concerned only with rules indif- ferent to time. Aristotle's argument in De Interpretatione, moreover, is so radicalized that it no longer makes sense to say that the past and present in contrast to the future are somehow necessary, and insofar as necessity remains an indispensable aspect of the very concept of knowledge (erkendjen), it no longer makes sense to assert that one can acquire historical knowledge. Historicity rather dis- closes itself only in purview of the constant annihilation of possi- bility into actuality, an annihilation whose apprehension requires an organ that both responds to the momentary and organizes it within the general scattering that makes up time: "It is clear, then, that the organ [Organet] for the historical must be formed in like- ness to this, must have within itself the corresponding something by which in its certitude it continually annuls the incertitude that corresponds [svarer] to the uncertainty of coming into existence-</page><page sequence="15">1076 PETER FENVES a double uncertainty: the nothingness of non-being and the anni- hilated possibility, which is also the annihilation of every other pos- sibility" (245). Belief or faith is this organ-"Now Tro has precisely the required constitution" (245). Tro, like all organs, indicates both the condition of needing an organ (and hence the absence of, say, an intellectual intuition) and the activity of organizing. Both con- dition and realization, both passive and active, faith functions as that apparatus by virtue of which the diversity of sources sounds one note-the synthetic moment that does without thought. Faith, then, is the sense of primordial unification, the conditio sine qua non for organizing the diverse array of emissions into a coherent pat- tern. But to consider faith an organ, to think of it as providing even a minimum of coherence is surely to miss entirely the point of Climacus' project. Although he often speaks of faith on analogy with cognative organs-"the eyes of Faith," "the ears of Faith" (233-34)-and even describes it is as an organ whose structure rests on an analogous relationship to its "object" (244), he insists that neither faith nor belief are "forms of knowledge" (227, 247); the analogy that imposes a connection between it and its erstwhile "object" is simply &amp;Xoyoc. And even as he writes the faith has an "object" and thereby indicates that it, as an organ, provides a crite- rion of coherence by means of which disparate perspectives turn into a single objective sense, he undermines the very notion of ob- jectivity when he assigns the "object" contradictory predicates. In accordance with his fierce retention of the pillar of the Organon- the Aristotelian principle of non-contradiction-against its recent Hegelian assault (270),11 Climacus rejects the object as an object of knowledge, since it is the unification of contradictories-"that happy passion we call faith, whose object is the paradox, but the paradox unites the contradictories and is the historical made eternal" (227)-and yet if it is not an object of knowledge, no one has the right to consider an object in the first place.12 So faith is both a form of knowledge and yet does not assume the form of knowledge; it both provides a criterion for unification and refuses the principle criterion of all thought. It, like the paradox-the un- known, the god, or whatever else one might call it-cannot be thought through, and so every attempt to predicate it leads to the limit of thought and the parameters of the Organon. Thus, Cli- macus affirms, faith is as unknowable as the unknown and "as par- adoxical as the paradox" (230). As an organ, it can only turn in wonder upon itself and in pausa (244) contemplate from its sin-</page><page sequence="16">M L N 1077 gular position the miracle it can contemplate anything at all-that singular "something" to which man can find no other access. It organizes no other sense than the sense of its own organization, and so, in contrast to every mode of knowledge, this organ can only perceive one thing and it can only perceive it once. The mo- ment, the unification of contradictories as advent of the absolute difference, is the very instant, the only instant, of its operation: the blink (bieblik, Augenblick) within which the organ perceives itself and perceives the extirpation of its perception. The paradox of faith is therefore entirely different from the paradoxes encoun- tered in understanding: whereas the understanding is paradoxical only in its attempt to stand before itself-that is, only in that at- tempt which registers dispersion as temporal difference aMd which finds, at the end of time, as its limit, a necessarily contradictory proposition-faith is paradoxicality incarnate: there is neither a stipulation nor even a promise that at some moment in the future it will encounter its own undoing. For faith is only about itself and it only makes sense of itself. Its self-reflexivity then comes to propo- sitional discourse as the self-referential proposition, the self-ac- knowledged stumbling block to the Greek Organon-: "I do not exist." To speak thus in all seriousness is to speak of oneself and yet to have no one of whom to speak. Faith, in speaking of itself, must be its own definitive object, but in order to be so, it must abandon itself as a determinate object. Hence, when Climacus begins to explore the analogy with the sense organs, he moves from the rather banal analogy-man "receives the condition from the god, and so beholds his glory with the eys of faith" (233)-to the paradoxical formulation, "he is contemporary as a believer, in the autopsy of faith (i Troens A u t o p s i). But in this autopsy every noncontemporary (in the immediate sense) becomes a contempo- rary" (233, italics retained). Faith sees with its own eyes, sees itself, and sees itself with its own eyes on the eve of its own death. It must see itself and yet cannot see itself, for the moment of sight is the moment of death: its knowledge turns into the knowledge of death, its thought into the thought of death.'3 It is therefore no surprise that faith has no desire to see: whoever undergoes the autopsy of faith wishes that the sole object "worth looking for" (218) take its leave. Climacus closes the story with a death sentence and a coroner's report: "But this immediate contemporaneity is merely an occasion [Anledning], and this cannot be more strongly expressed than that the disciple, if he understands himself, must</page><page sequence="17">1078 PETER FENVES therefore wish that it be terminated by the departure of the god from the earth" (266-67). In this departure, which is not quite a 6tcynopd, although, like all dispersions, it is accompanied by a monstrous distortion of the organs, faith remains absolutely sin- gular, never dissipating in the death it records nor disrupting the singular organization of its object. The autopsy, in order to main- tain its paradoxical vision, must always deliver in the moment of decisive significance the same verdict, and yet no one-no man by definition-can attest to the coherence of the verdict or the sense of its message, a coherence the very notion of autopsy seems to demand. The community of faith does not share in a message. It shares an organ. Direct communication, whether in the form of a verdict, subpenea (86), report or proposal withdraws in favor of a com- pletely different type of sense, and so language once again seems to fall by the wayside, since this altered sensibility affords no KcL-ryopEtv, no predication: there is no a priori cognition, no antici- pation of perception and thus no prediction. Whereas a proposi- tion refers to something-is about a definite object-and makes sense of that object, faith refers and yet has nothing to which it can refer. It is merely that singular syntactic arrangement in which two individuals are juxtaposed: "faith is sense for coming into exis- tence [Tro er Sands for Tilblivelse]" (248). Sense for does not make sense of anything. It merely sets into position, but it does not set into position two already constituted objects, for the one who says "I do not exist" cannot speak of himself as though he were a deter- minate object, and coming into existence (tilblivelse), conceived as an event that excludes all calculation and precludes all judgment (subsumption of particular under universal and the concomitant attribution of significance to the object) is not an object; "it" cannot even be expressed by "is", for even if the phrase "coming to exis- tence" can be objectified and thus make an illusory appearance as a substance, coming into existence cannot be conceived as already subsisting (subject, OnOK?t1E'vov). Tro stands poised to dance, but the only permissible partner is the paradoxical thought of absolute senselessness. Does it then follow that once this pose is struck, all meaning, predication and catagorization are thereby abandoned? Are not both the "propositio" andforstand just as severely implicated in the "for" relationship, that is, in the very notion of relationship (for-</page><page sequence="18">M L N 1079 hold), the absolution from which would be the definition of eternity and the very dream of idealization? "Sense for" becomes more than mere pose at the moment for receives a sense and in this way reaches beyond its merely syntactical forhold. When "sense for" is pared down to its singular occurrence (forekomst), it is endowed with sense and thus revived from its syntactical death: faith now holds a moment before. Climacus not only draws toward the purely positional, de jure meaningless and singular relationship but also projects and thus predicates the sense of faith. The moment of de- cisive significance comes to the fore before the autopsy of faith, and by coming into existence before, it can now be spoken of:-"the moment is before." Language has indeed come into being, and the tale of its advent-the digt whose only remaining proposal is "the moment came before"-becomes its singular shelter: Let us now return to our tale [Digt] and to our assumption that the god has been [. . .] It is still an historical fact and only for [for] faith. Faith is here taken in the direct and direct and everyday sense [Betydning] as the relationship to the historical; but secondly faith must be taken also in the entirely eminent sense [i ganske eminent Forstand], the sense in which the word can come to the fore [forekomme] only once, that is, many times, but in only one relationship [Forhold]. (250, italics retained) The digt whose learning requires no recollection preserves lan- guage cares for the absolute difference in posting message that the moment passed on. Although no man by definition can have access to the sense of this message, although the sense is not even its own, since it is always only on loan, still the sense that the moment passed on can be passed along. The word that corresponds to this digt, that establishes the continuity between forstand and sands for in the radical discontinuity between non sum and sum, is the nearly pointless thus (saaledes). The believer, Climacus assets, "no longer has a mere immediacy before him [for sig], nor does he confront a necessary coming into existence, but only the thus of coming into existence" (249, italics and bold retained). Thus is not the elision of a complete proposition. It is rather the very posing of the always incomplete and incomprehensible proposition "the moment came before ..." The absolute historical fact comes for the believer, for- ward to the believer and before the believer in the singular sense of faith. The one who has a sense for coming into existence says "thus"-the absolute difference came in time-and this enuncia- tion, by making sense in belief, making up the sense of belief, and</page><page sequence="19">1080 PETER FENVES making belief sense before the absolute historical fact, renounces the Socratic conception of sprog as spbg. Thus, therefore, is not one word among others. It is the very digt that in its concentration shelters language once learned. Its expli- cation in propositional discourse is therefore limitless. But Cli- macus insists that such explication can never dispense with the force that is concentrated in thus, and he even offers a means by which one can measure of this force. It is offense: the greater the offense, the more global the scandal, the more force has been pre- served. In every grave articulation the risk of offense is intensified, whereas every attempt to mitigate offence through negligent con- centration on extraneous matters results in the "acoustical illusion" which gives the impression that the absolute positing of the thus can somehow facilitate transposition into corresponding proposi- tions direcly comprehensible by all disinterested rational agents (215-221). And philosophy for Climacus is defined precisely as this curious echo, since in seeking to remove offence it gets carried along in a forceless language whose very pointlessness seems its mark of pride: [F]or the believer (and only he, after all, is a disciple) continually has the autospy of faith; he does not see with the eyes of others and sees only the same as every believer sees-with the eyes of faith. What, then, can a contemporary do for someone who comes later? (a) He can tell someone who comes later that he himself has believed this fact [Factum]; this is not properly [egentligen] a communication at all (that there is no immediate contemporaneity and that the fact is based upon a contradiction express this) but merely an occasion. If I say that this or that occurred, I speak historically; but if I say "I believe and have be- lieved that this happened, although it is folly to the understanding and an offense to the human heart," I have in the very same moment done every- thing to prevent anyone else from making up his mind in immediate continuity with me and to decline all partnership, because every single human being must comport himself in exactly the same way. (b) In this form, he can tell the content of the fact, a content that is still only for faith (for Troen), in quite the same sense as colors are only for sight and sound for hearing. In this form, he is able to do it; in any other form, he is only talking nonsense and perhaps inveigles the one who comes later to determine himself in continuity with chatter [at bestemme sig i Conti- nuitet med Snakken]. (264-65) Chatter is not at first nonsense; rather it is that forceless forstand which is devoid of the power to pose before the absolute differ-</page><page sequence="20">M L N 1081 ence. However earnest it may present itself, however seriously it may be taken, it is still always caught in a language that not only falls prey to jest but whose very essence is spbg. And insofar as its various propositions make sense of that which withdraws from propositional discourse, snak does indeed cease to make sense, and since snak still preserves a trace of the thus in its speechlessness before the absolute difference, it retains a peculiar and indeed dangerous power: it can appear to determine everything in conti- nuity with itself and thus result in, on the one hand, Socratic recol- lection and, on the other hand, the Cartesian cogito. Once snak takes over, faith-"I do not exist"-is always deferred; it always misses the fullness of time and therein renounces through negli- gence the offer of fulfillment. Philosophiske Smuler-"Crumbs of Philosophy"-thus deserves its carefully chosen title: Climacus, whose step-by-step continuity of thought finds its most character- istic expression in his very name, only offers and can only consume A Philosophical Snack. 14 "The difficulty is in perceiving that one cannot ask such a ques- tion" (252). The question to which Climacus refers-"the question of the disciple at second hand"-closes the Philosophical Fragments and at the same time closes the very process of raising and re- sponding to questions. For everything in Climacus' project in the end bears upon this question, upon the very possibility of pro- posing this as a question without falling into a "stupidity" so pro- nounced that it would forfeit "the right to charge one with stu- pidity who is sensible (forstandig] enough not to be able to answer it" (252). The difficulty then lies in abandoning not only one par- ticular question but the very devotion to the process of raising and answering questions-the maieutic movement whose eminent ex- emplary is Socrates. "The question of the disciple at second hand" is simply the question of the source, transmission and tradition of sense. Climacus must, above all, renounce self-questioning and the interrogative mood, which is simply another name for anxiety, since it presupposes that persistent possibility of self-determina- tion which faith "in the eminent sense" upsets. When Climacus asks, "should we not perhaps first consider whether the above question is as legitimate as it lies near at hand?" (252), he questions the jest that purports to bring the "second hand" near to hand and the pedagogical process that appears to commence with ignorance and distance from the truth and to culminate in knowledge and</page><page sequence="21">1082 PETER FENVES proximity to truth. This utter inability to question further, taken as the very limit of sense, is what Climacus calls "understanding one- self," and the recognition that the question does not conceal knowledge but rather neglects the absolute difference he calls "knowledge."' 5 The unnamed voice that always accompanies Cli- macus' project responds to such a paradoxical proposal by misun- derstanding it: "For if the question cannot be asked, then the answer causes us no trouble, and the difficulty has become a remarkable easy matter."- "This does not follow, for suppose the difficulty consisted in perceiving that one cannot ask a question thus [sporge saaledes]; was this perhaps the meaning [Meningen] you expressed in our last conversation (Chapter IV) when you said that you had understood me, all the consequences of what I said, although I as yet had not completely understood myself?" (252) The difficulty that imposes death as the only partner with whom Climacus may dance is at once the position wherein no more ques- tions are to be posed and the strange forwardness of his unnamed interlocutor. How could the nameless interlocutor get ahead of Climacus? And how could his mening, which he articulates and yet does not understand, both prompt and preempt the question of the disciple at second hand, that is, the question of questions? In the Preface, just before Climacus faces the difficulty that forces him to dance with death, he delcares that he cannot afford to have a mening (178), but the interlocutor, who is no better disposed than Climacus, can afford it precisely becuase he borrows it before- hand. It is this strange temporal distortion in the course of meaning, perhaps even an echo in the maieutic course of under- standing itself, that we must trace if we are to understand how Climacus proposes to pass out of the interrogative mood, to bypass the understanding and thus to care for the absolute difference. So let us turn to the passage to which Climacus refers. It is a passage in which the opposition not only between the disciple at first hand and the disciple at second hand but also the opposition between the organ of faith and the Organon of propositional dis- course have been put into relief. After explaining that the asser- tion "I do not know you," when spoken by the teacher to the pupil, does not mean, for instance, "I cannot identify you" but is rather an action whose function is to dismiss a still reluctant student, Cli- macus explains to the unnamed voice that "someone who comes</page><page sequence="22">M L N 1083 later must receive the condition from the god himself and cannot receive it at second hand, because if that were the case, the second hand would have to be the god himself, and in that case there is no question of a second hand" (232). The single hand of the god, in other words, suffices. And this image of the single hand seems to satisfy Climacus' interlocutor, who immediately proffers his deci- sive mening: "Now that you say it, I certainly do see it" (233). But once saying constitutes seeing, the possibility of the 6tucytopa, and its multiple monstrosities once again emerge. To see the single hand of the god is perhaps to assign the absolute difference a very specific and, one might add, anthropomorphic difference. So Cli- macus continues, unsatisfied with his apparent triumph over his anonymous opponent. He arrives at the first articulation of "the autopsy of faith" (233) and still continues, as though he were in a hurry on his way to a fateful dance: If someone who comes later goes on retelling [fable] extravagantly about the glory of being a contemporary (in the sense of immediacy) and is continually wanting to be away, then we must let him go, but if you watch him you will easily see by his walk that and by the path he has turned onto that he is not on the way to the terror of the paradox but is bounding away like a dancing teacher in order to reach the imperial wedding on time [ ...]-Only in one respect could I be tempted to re- gard the contemporary (in the sense of immediacy) as more fortunate than someone who comes later. If we assume that centuries elapsed between the event and the life of the one who come later, then there presumably will have been a great deal of chatter [megen Snak] among men about this thing [om denne Ting], so much loose chatter that the untrue and confused rumors that the contemporary (in the sense of immediacy) had to put up with did not make the possibility of the right relationship nearly as difficult [vanskelig], all the more so because in all human probability the centuries-old echo, like the echo in some of our churches, would not only have riddled faith with slogans but would have slain it in and turned it into a slogan [ikke blot vilde slaae Sladder paa Troen, men slaae den hen i Sladder]. This could not happen in the first generation, when faith must have appeared in all its originality, by op- position [Modsetning] easy to distinguish from its other. (234) The difficulty-the grave difficulty that puts Climacus' life into question-is no longer there. Without opposition, there is not a singular difficulty but rather a multitude of difficulties, each of which depart from the simple historical fact that the story must be</page><page sequence="23">1084 PETER FENVES told. And once opposition comes into relief, faith is thereby slain and turned into a slogan. Not only has all opposition to faith van- ished, but the very opposition between the faithful enunciation thus and the snak that defines philosophy gives way to their mutual confusion or jesting supersession in slogans. For Sladder super- sedes faith and chatter in a forgetting-not in a recollection-and in dispersal-not in self-determination-whose combined force comes from the simple historical fact that the tale must be told again and again. The autopsy of faith now reads-: slain in and turned into a slogan. With this autopsy, not only does the question of the disciple at the second hand once again emerge but also the question of the disciple at the third hand, at the fourth hand ad infinitum. The tale of the coming into being of language and of its passing on, from hand to hand, cannot be sorted into the simple opposition-the very model of simplicity-source and echo. For the source is always inhabited by its echo at the moment language comes into being and thus the digt that shelters language already carries its own autopsy: "faith-thus-does not exist." Spoken in all serious- ness before the absolute difference non sum reverberates with the sound of a primordially slain language turned into a slogan. "The historical fact that the god has been in human form is the head matter [Hovedsagen], and the other historical details are not even as important as they would be if the subject were a human being in- stead of the god. Lawyers say that a capital crime [a crime that concerns the head] consumes all the lesser ones-so also with faith" (265-66). But no, they are not finally consumed. They re- verberate, and Climacus' compulsion to locate a single source cor- responds to the apprehension:-the head cannot be severed from the body without . . . the thought of death. And to respond to this emergency with the assertion that the contemporary is only an oc- casion does as little good as Socrates' insistence that "the moment of occasion [Anledning] is but a jest [Spog], like a bastard title that does not belong essentially [vaesentlig] to the book" (218). For if the bastard title-Philosophiske Smuler-does not indeed belong to the book, if the jest-the title, the name and the explication of the name in the question of an eternal happiness-encroaches upon the seriousness of the matter, then the occasion is not simply an occasion and the jest it is not simply a jest (spog) but rather a multi- tude of those spectres (spbgelser) which William Afham, the fore- most expert in matters of remembrance and recalling, tells us in-</page><page sequence="24">M L N 1085 habit that uncanny moment of discovery known as daybreak.'6 The single difficulty then falls prey to their contagious jests, spiteful jokes and heartless mockery. 17 The slain body of faith thus stands before its own eyes, and the verdict it delivers is not that of death, of a single death, but rather the far more befuddled verdict of chronic illness. This illness, which, to Climacus' great misfor- tune, is not unto death, poses numerous difficulties, interminable problems. But these difficulties never coalesce into a single diffi- culty: the sole partner with whom Climacus during his solitary rev- erie could dance. The Johns Hopkins University NOTES 1 S0ren Kierkegaard, Philosophiske Smuler in Samlede Vaerker, ed. A. B. Drach- mann,J. L. Heiberg, H. 0. Lange (Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1901-06), IV, 178; hereafter SV. Philosophical Fragments and Johannes Climacus, trans. Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1985), p. 8. Translations are modified; the page numbers in the text refer to the fourth volume of the Danish edition. 2 Climacus never ceases to identify the individual by "he"-a gesture that is far from innocent, as Sylviana Agacinski has attempted to demonstrate in ApartW: conception et morts de Saren Kierkegaard (Paris: Aubier-Flammarion, 1977). 3 Aristotle, De Interpretatione, 4, 17al-8; cf. Metaphysics (theta, 10), 1051b3. The reader of Philosophiske Smuler should always keep in mind that Climacus' first priority is to replace the Aristotelian Organon and, in particular, to revise De Interpretatione on two counts: (1) truth will not be at the disposal of propositions; and (2) the problem of the relationship between apophantic discourse and time as it is played out in Aristotle's famous example of a future contingency-a sea-battle will take place tomorrow or it will not take place- is to be reworked in the section entitled "Interlude: Is the Past More Necessary than the Future? Or Has the Possible, by Having Become Actual, Become More Necessary than It Was?" (235-88). Aristotle's attribution of necessity to that which has come into existence is not, however, the most important point of contrast between De In- terpretatione and Philosophiske Smuler; it serves rather to bring out how the problem of future contingencies rests upon a prior decision concerning the es- sence of language. In keeping with the concentration on apophansis, Aristotle writes: "It makes no difference whether some one has or has not made the contradictory statements. For it is clear that things are thus [oirToc] whether or not the affirmation or denial has been uttered. For it is not because of the affirmation of denial that something happens" (18b26-39). Consider a case in which an admiral declares "there will be a sea-battle tomorrow!" or even the simple exclamation thus, and one gets a sense of Climacus' effort to wrestle language away from its traditional grounding in apophansis. 4 It might then be supposed that Climacus is rearticulating the opening of the Gospel of John. But this is not necessarily the case. When Anti-Climacus re- works Climacus' "Project of Thought" in Training in Christianity, Christ does not</page><page sequence="25">1086 PETER FENVES figure as 6 X6yoc (John, 1: 1) but rather as crwtciov vivtX&amp;cy6i vov (Luke, 2: 34). All of Kierkegaard's work could perhaps be read as the interaction between these two passages. The entire section of Training in Christianity entitled "The Man-God is Sign [Tegn]" should be cited in this context, but I will limit myself to a few remarks: "A communication which is the unity ofjest and earnest is such a sign of contradiction. . . . When one sees into [the sign] as in a mirror and one gets to see oneself, or the sign of contradiction, see into the depths of one's heart while one is gazing into the contradiction" (SV, XII, 116-110; Training in Christianity, trans. W. Lowrie [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1972], pp. 125-26). In this sign we find the "autopsy of faith" about which we will have more to say below. 5 Oeuvres de Descartes, ed. Charles Adams and Paul Tannery (Paris: Vrin, 1964-), VII, 25; Meditations on First Philosophy, trans. Donald A. Cress (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1979), p. 17. The statement "I do not exist" is, of course, the counter- part to the Cartesian cogito, the subject of the incomplete and unpublishedJo- hannes Climacus eller De Omnibus Dubitandum Est (In Soren Kierkegaards Papirer, ed. P. A. Heiberg, V. Kuhr, and E. Torsting, 2 edition, ed. N. Thulstrup [Copen- hagen: Gyldendal, 1968-70], IV [B 1], 103-150). The relationship between this work and Philosophical Fragments is extremely complex, but two points are worth noting here: (1) both works undertake to tell how one learns language, but whereas Philosophical Fragments inquires into how one learns to say "I do not exist," Johannes Climacus retells the story of how Johannes comes to say cogito, sum (and it breaks off just before he is able to utter this momentous statement); (2) Johannes Climacus is therefore the mirror image of Philosophical Fragments, since "the absolute fact," wherein the eternal meets the temporal, is not posed as the God-Man but rather as the articulation of the cogito. Universal doubt is in modern philosophy the event of decisive significance, but in seeking to repeat it, the follower, Johannes himself, recedes into complete insignificance (and, once again, at the moment of repetition Johannes Climacus breaks off). 6 Oeuvres de Descartes, VII, 25; Meditations on First Philosophy, p. 17. 7 See Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety, ed. and trans. Reider Thomte and Al- bert B. Anderson [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980], pp. 14-15; SV, IV, 286-87. The Concept of Anxiety and Philosophical Fragments form a single text, whose joint title could perhaps be "Notes on Language Learning." They were published within a week of each other, and its seems as though the Introduction was to be appended to both words. Whereas Philosophical Fragments concerns itself with how one learns the specific phrase non sum, the Concept of Anxiety treats precisely those words that have vexed philosophical understanding since Descartes: words that purport to express affects, moods, passions, and feeling in general, since they do not refer to objects but rather, given the Cartersian model, to states of the subject, they seem utterly impossible to learn; they cannot be taught. And it is this difficulty that underlies Vigilius Haufniensis' concentra- tion on the most "subjective" mood of all-Angest. Perhaps the only previous consideration of this problem can be found in the transcendental deduction to the Kritik der Urteilskraft (para. 36-39). In a footnote to the Concept of Anxiety, one finds a sentence that goes a long way in elucidating the Fragments: "But this much is certain, that it will not do to represent man himself as the inventor of language" (SV, IV, 318; The Concept of Anxiety, p. 47). And in a notebook entry contemporaneous to both works one finds the problem brought to fruition: "If anyone wishing to convince [Overeensstemmelse] me should say 'consistent with the preceding you, of course, could say, "It [the serpent?] is language," ' I would answer, 'I did not say that'" (Papirer, V [B 53], 113; The Concept of Anxiety, p. 185). For some of the problems associated with seriousness in Kierkegaard, see</page><page sequence="26">M L N 1087 Michael Theunissen, Der Begriff Ernst bei Soren Kierkegaard (Freiburg: Albert, 1958). 8 The relationship between Climacus' sorg and Heidegger's Sorge has not, so far as I know, been explored (see Sein und Zeit [Tibingen: Niemeyer, 1979], pp. 191-200). Although Heidegger points toward certain theological conceptions of Sorge-Saint Augustine's in particular-he seems oblivious to Kierkegaard's contribution, and since Kierkegaard associates this ontological determination of the human being with sexual difference in both Philosophical Fragments and The Concept of Irony, Heidegger's refusal even to cite Kierkegaard on this point calls for a far-reaching explanation (and the fact that he read Kierkegaard in Danish is of little consequence since Sorg was alternatively translated as Sorge and as Bekimmernis, the latter of which was the word Heidegger chose for his earliest efforts in the anlaysis of Dasein). The further objection that Climacus' sorg is primarily presented in Heidegger's terms as Fiirsorge diminishes in force upon the perusal of this important yet undeveloped paragraph of Sein und Zeit: "Ihr gegenuber besteht die Moglichkeit einer Fursorge, die fur den Anderen nicht so sehr einspringt, als daB sie ihm in seinem existenziellen Seinkonnen vorauss- pringt, nicht um ihm die "Sorge" abzunehmen, sondern erst eigentlich als solche zuruchzugeben. Diese Fursorge, die wesentlich die eigentliche Sorge-das heiBt die Existenz des Anderen betrifft und nicht ein Was, das er besorgt, ver- hilft dem Anderen dazu, in seiner Sorge sich durchsichtig und fur sie frei zu werden" (122). 9 De Interpretatione, 2, 16a30-34. One should keep in mind another manifestation of the "not human" that seems always in the background: Odysseus' responds to the monster Polyphemos with the famous words oiOTLc &amp;LoC 'y' 6vuiu, "my name is no one" (Odyssey, IX, 366). 10 Howard Hong and Emanuel Hirsh have noted that the word Guden ("the God") is "an extraordinary Danish expression" and he quite rightly points toward its Socratic and Platonic provenance (see Philosophical Fragments, trans. David Swenson, intro. Neils Thulstrup, trans. revised Howard Hong [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1967], pp. ix-xii). 11 That Kierkegaard consistently holds to the principle of non-contradiction and thus, in at least one sense, to the Greek Organon has vexed many Hegelian in- terpreters of his work (Lukacs, Marcuse, Adorno): it seems to them as though Kierkegaard resigned himself to the limitations of Kantian Verstand (the ulti- mate sin) and thus refused to enter into Vernunft, where such a principle no longer functions as a principle of thought; his failure to accept Vernunft invari- ably explains his political opinions and his irredeemable Schwermut. Now, the reply most often proffered by Kierkegaard's supporters is that he indeed holds to man's finitude, to fact that he is conditioned and hence to the principle of non-contradiction. But until finitude is explained such an answer is indeed fraudulent. One must pay close attention to how, for example, Aristotle treated the principle in the Metaphysics, gamma, 1006a12-25: it is above all the prerequi- site for apophantic discourse in general, understood as the prediction of a sub- stance; see the superb treatment by Elizabeth Anscombe in Three Philosophers (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1973), pp. 39-43. 12 Climacus makes an interesting gesture at the end of the work. He invokes the Kantian distinction between Denken and Erkennen. For both Climacus and Kant, it is possible to think an object even if it can have no phenomenal explication and thus cannot be cognized: "thought is free to occupy itself therewith as with the strangest proposal possible," so long as it does not "contain a self-contradic- tion" (263-64). Thus, Kant can think (that is, conceptualize) an object that has absolutely no relationship (Beziehung) to our sensibility but he cannot claim to</page><page sequence="27">1088 PETER FENVES know such an object. The clearest explanation of this distinction can perhaps be found in the "Transzendentale Deduktion" to the second edition of the Kritik der reinen Vernunft (para. 22; B 146-48). It is clear that the distinction between Erkennen and Denken depends upon the retention of the principle of non-con- tradiction, for it is the principle of conceptualization itself. It should be further noted that in the Introduction to The Concept of Anxiety, Kant, unlike Socrates, Descartes, Schelling, Hegel and his many followers is perhaps absolved of thinking through the difficulty (SV, IV, 283; Concept of Anxiety, 11), and since the effort to think through the difficulty rather than pause in wonder-anxiety (244) characterizes metaphysics as such, it is questionable whether Kant should be, as he often is in Kierkegaard studies, put in the same class as those who used his work as a spring-board for further development. 13 Climacus occasionally returns to the word autopsy in the Postscript when he dis- cusses Lessing's wonderful capacities as a scholar: "all honor to learning and scholarship, all praise to the one who controls the material with the sureness of knowledge, with the reliability of autopsy. But the dialectical is still the living power of the problem" (SV, VII, 3; Concluding Unscientific Postscript, trans. D. F. Swenson and W. Lowrie [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1968], p. 15; Swenson and Lowrie leave out the word "autopsy"). One should note that "au- topsy" is here opposed to life and that it is equivalent to the examination of something dead. The course of the sense of "autopsy" from "seeing for oneself" to "examining the body" and finally to "necropsy" is not well charted, but a short history of it can be found in Henry Alan Skinner, The Origin of Medical Terms (Baltimore: William &amp; Wilkins, 1949), p. 45. 14 One might therefore compare Climacus' snack with Hegel's philosophical meal, as it is brought out in Werner Hamacher, Pleroma, in G. W. F. Hegel, Der Geist der Christentums: Schriften 1796-1800 (Frankfurt am Main: Ullstein, 1978), pp. 70-71 and passim. On the controversy over the translation of Philosophiske Smuler as Philosophical Fragments, see the discussion between Swenson and Lowrie re- printed in David F. Swenson, Something about Kierkegaard, ed. Lillian M. Swenson (Minneapolis: Augsburg Publishing House, 1945), pp. 207-09. Kierkegaard's most extended treatment of snak can be found in En literair Anmeldelse, SV, VII, 91-93; Two Ages, ed. and trans. H. V. Hong and E. H. Hong (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 97-100. Although Kierkegaard is men- tioned only once in Benjamin's work on the German Trauerspiel, he comes at the end to clarify the senselessness-the non-sense-of evil: "Bezogen auf die Tiefe des Subjektiven ist [das Wissen um Gut und Bosen] im Grunde nur Wissen vom Bosen. Es ist 'Geschwatz' in dem tiefen Sinne, in welchem Kierke- gaard dies Wort gefaflt hat. Als der Triumph der Subjetivitat und Anbrach einer Willkiirherrschaft uber Dinge ist Ursprung aller allegorischen Betrach- tung jenes Wissen" (Walter Benjamin, Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels, ed. R Tiedemann [Frankfurt a. M.: Suhrkamp, 1978], p. 209). That each step in Cli- macus' philosophical presentation should say something else, speak the other itself, is not a mere whim but rather proceeds from the Geschwdtz in which phi- losophy finds its definition. . 15 It is not insignificant that Climacus' closure of the question finds, so far as I have been able to detect, its only precursor in Augustine. The discussion be- tween Augustine and Evodius in the dialogue entitled De libero arbitrio ends abruptly when the question of sin and with it the question of the question- anxiety before sin-makes an apperance. In the section devoted to the demon- stration that "The Will Is the Radical Cause of All Evil," Augustine turns to Evodius, who seems to be unaware of the concept of will altogether and raises the final and most radical question: "Will there be any end to your questions, when you really should want no more than to know the root of the question?"</page><page sequence="28">M L N 1089 (On Free Choice of the Will, trans. A. S. Benjamin and L. H. Hackstaff [Indianap- olis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1964], p. 125). 16 The opening section of Studies on Life's Way entitled "'In vino veritas' A Re- membrance told by William Afham" concludes with the question whether the truth brought out by the wine-and veritas here is to be understood first as discovery, op-dage and hence as primordial daybreak-was meant in jest or in seriousness. At the moment this question arises, William Afham notes: "a noc- turnal party beheld by morning illumination, in the midst of a smiling natural environment, makes an almost unheimlich impression. One begins to think of spectres [Sp0gelser] which are surprised by the break of day" (Studies on Life's Way, trans. Walter Lowrie [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1940], p. 89; SV, VI, 79). 17 Climacus insists the god is no to be soiled with mockery: "[t]he god did not, however, take the form of a servant in order to mock human beings; his aim, therefore, cannot be to walk past through the world in such a way that not one single human being would come to know it. Presumably he will allow something about himself to be understood .. ." (222). Yet an echo is nothing but such mockery, if we are to trust the young esthete who wrote in Enten-Eller: "Must my spirit then ever remain tongue-tied, must I always babble? What I need is a voice as penetraating as the eye of Lynceus, as terrifying as the sigh of giants, as persistent as the sound of nature, as full of derision as a frosty wind-gust, as malicious as Echo's heartless mockery . . ." (SV, I, 8; EitherlOr, trans. David F. Swenson, Lillian M. Swenson, and Howard A. Johnson [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1959], I, 23). Kierkegaard was at times entranced by the idea of Echo; see the important notebook entry of 2 December, 1837, which pro- vides the nucleus for both Philosophical Fragments and The Concept of Anxiety (Pa- pirer I [A 333], pp. 147-50; partially translated in The Concept of Irony, trans. and intro. Lee M. Capel [Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1965], 22-24). On the concept of echo, see Nelly Viallaneix, Ecoute, Kierkegaard (Paris: Editions de Cerf, 1979), I, 73-87.</page></plain_text>
