Quivron Abstract: In an article published in 2008 in Paléorient, a series of arguments have been listed which would allow dating the last phase of Period III and Period IV at Shahr-i Sokhta in the course of the second half of the 3rd millennium and the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC. This would imply that the sites of the Helmand system, Shahr-i Sokhta and Mundigak, have interacted with the Indus civilization. This article offers an opportunity to go through the main questions concerning the chronology of the Indo -Iranian regions. Then, we review the arguments used by the authors to sustain that the sites of the "Helmand" system at the time of Shahr-i Sokhta, Periods III-IV, and the Indus civilization would be contemporaneous. On the basis of the data provided in particular by sites at the western border of the Indus valley and from Makran, we examine the validity of the comparative elements between Shahr-i Sokhta and the Indus civilization. Résumé: Dans un article publié en 2008 dans Paléorient, une série d'arguments a été présentée pour dater la phase finale de la période III et la période IV de Shahr-i Sokhta au cours de la seconde moitié du IIIe millénaire et au tout début du IIe millénaire av. J.-C. Une telle datation pourrait impliquer de possibles interactions entre les sites du système de VHelmand (Shahr-i Sokhta et Mundigak) et la civilisation de V Indus. Cet article nous conduit tout d'abord à un examen d'ensemble des questions chronologiques à l'échelle des régions indo-iraniennes. Nous passons ensuite en revue les éléments utilisés par les auteurs de l'article précédent pour soutenir une contemporanéité entre les sites de V Helmand aux périodes III et IV de Shahr-i Sokhta et la civilisation de l' Indus. Puis, en nous fondant notamment sur la séquence des sites de la bordure occidentale de la vallée de l' Indus et du Makran, nous examinons le bien- fondé de ces rapprochements proposés entre Shahr-i Sokhta et les sites de la civilisation de l' Indus.

INTRODUCTION In an article published in 2008 in the journal Paléorient , E. Cortesi, M. Tosi, A. Lazzari and M. Vidale1 have pre- sented - based mainly upon the data provided by the site of Shahr-i Sokhta (Sistān, Iran) - a review of the principal phe- nomena of cultural interactions between the sites of the differ- ent regions situated from the east of the Iranian plateau to the Indus valley. But the main purpose of the article was to present new arguments to show that the great urban civilization of the Indus valley, which occurred between 2500 and 1900 BC, has coincided with the phenomena of urbanism defined by M. Tosi as the "Helmand civilization ",2 during the final phase of Period III and during Period IV of Shahr-i Sokhta, and by extension with the last part of Mundigak Period IV.3 This article offers the opportunity to go through the argu- ments presented by our Italian colleagues who maintain that some of the data collected at Shahr-i Sokhta in the latest peri- ods of occupation "discussed together with finds from (...) Mundigak (Kandahar, Afghanistan)"4 could indicate that these sites were still occupied during the whole time of the Indus civilization. With due respect for the pioneering work accom- plished by the Italian mission at Shahr-i Sokhta, we would like 1. Cortesi et al., 2008: 5-35. 2. Lamberg-Karlovsky and Tosi, 1973: 26. 3.

Since the Italian excavations at Shahr-i Sokhta in the 1970's, information concerning the archaeology of the Indo- Iranian regions (fig. 1) has grown considerably. In several articles,5 we have already presented a series of arguments questioning the chronology of the latest occupation of this site from the sequence of the Kachi-Bolan region. Besides, the chronological sequence of Shahr-i Sokhta defined by the Italian archaeologists has recently been revised on the basis of calibrated 14C dating6 and the resumption of excavations in the graveyard by an Iranian team directed by S.M.S. Sajjadi since 19977 have provided new data that allow further comparisons with the neighbouring regions. For Balochistan there is now a large amount of evidence yielded by sites of the Kachi-Bolan region, such as Mehrgarh and Nausharo.8 The research work of the French mission in Makran, in particular at Miri Qalat and Shahi Tump,9 has also shown the dynamism of south- western Pakistani Balochistan in the 4th and 3rd millennia BC and provided a more reliable chronological sequence whereas the only known reference for the region was the relatively lim- ited excavations of B. De Cardi at Bampur,10 on the Iranian 5. Jarrige, 1993 and 1996. 6.

For the Indus valley, besides the relatively old excavations at Amri and Kot Diji, the resumption of inves- tigation in 1986 at Harappa by the Harappa Archaeological Research Project, today co-directed by R.H. Meadow and J.M. Kenoyer, constitutes a solid basis to explain the internal sequence of the Indus civilization.16 Insofar as the authors of the article refer several times to Period 3C at Harappa, we must remind that since the exca- vation at Amri, conducted by J.-M. Casal in 1961-62, 17 the Indus civilization has been divided into three main periods which date approximately to between 2500 and 1900/1800 BC (Amri IIIA, HIB, UIC). Harappa excavations have confirmed this sequence with Periods 3A, 3B and 3C. This division is consistent with the "Harappan" sequence defined at Nausharo, with Periods II, III and IV.18 It is striking to observe how the Indus civilization evolved in a very coherent way over a vast territory during its first two periods, while the third one, at the end of the 3rd millennium BC, is characterized by the appear- ance of regional variants and external elements due to (among other factors) the settling of groups whose cultural assemblage is obviously related to the Oxus civilization, or as it is also called, to the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex. At Nausharo, the presence of a well-attested "Oxus" compo- nent in the Indus material of Period IV remains nevertheless a minority, although the funerary objects collected in the con- temporary graveyard of Mehrgarh (zone MR.8) were mainly of "Oxus" type.19 Since some confusion has occurred,20 it is important to emphasize that the MR.8 graveyard that consti- tutes Period VIII in the general sequence of the site, does not directly follow the Period VIIC occupation. Between the end of Period VIIC, probably a little before 2600 BC, and Period VIII, at the very end of the 3rd millennium, there is a long break of four or five centuries corresponding to Periods ID, II and III of Nausharo. 11. We have also to mention the recent investigation carried out by an Iranian team at Bampur (Sajjadi, 2005). However, the chronology defined by De Cardi is still relevant today. 12. The authors acknowledge R. Besenval and V. Marcon, founder and cur- rently at the head of the French mission in Makran, to have kindly pro- vided these data. 13. Considering Miri Qalat Period IV, it is important to notice that the late dating of the two samples from the Indus levels (to which our Italian colleagues systematically refer), placed in a chronological bracket cor- responding to 2200-2100 BC, is in contradiction with the fact that the "Harappan" pottery of Miri Qalat is stylistically relevant to the first main period of the Indus civilization (corresponding to Period II at Nausharo). Without the intention of opening a new debate on the chronological sequence of Miri Qalat, it is difficult to accept a break of four centuries at least between Periods IIIc and IV of Miri Qalat, whereas the stratigraphy and the local pottery that persists during the "Indus" period show strong elements of continuity between these two periods. 14.

Quivron "INTERACTIONS SPHERES IN THE INDO- IRANI AN BORDERLANDS": THE REVISED CULTURAL SEQUENCE OF PROTOHISTORIC SITES IN BALOCHISTAN The discovery of Shahr-i Sokhta and the work undertaken at this site contributed to breaking the relative isolation of the pio- neer site of Mundigak, excavated in the 1950s in the Kandahar region (Southern Afghanistan).21 It became an essential basis for new studies on the interactions and trade between the sites belonging to the hydrographie system of the Helmand River and the neighbouring regions during the 4th and 3rd millennia BC. The article published in 1973 in East and West by C.C. Lamberg- Karlovsky and M. Tosi is the result of these comparative studies and marks an important stage in the archaeology of the Indo- Iranian regions.22 Discoveries at Shahr-i Sokhta Period I of a proto-Elamite tablet, of seals and impressions belonging to the "Mesopotamian koinè of the Jemdet Nasr Period",23 of a few potsherds with suspension lugs, probably a local version of jars in the style of Jemdet Nasr. ; indicate links with Tepe Yahya I VC and several other sites of the Iranian plateau. However, the absence of proto-Elamite elements at Mundigak has been noted, in spite of obvious parallels between Mundigak III and Shahr-i Sokhta I, at the end of the 4th and at the very beginning of the 3rd millennium BC. Nevertheless, a fragment of a poly- chrome jar with perforated lug had been found by Casal in a house from Mundigak Period III.6, contemporary to Period I of Shahr-i Sokhta.24 This potsherd, not documented by Casal and kept today in Musée Guimet, is comparable to the models of the Jemdet Nasr Period.25 But for most of specialists,26 another important link was the presence of pottery at Mundigak III and Shahr-i Sokhta I, close by their painted motifs to the Geoksyur-Namazga III ceramic style in southern Turkmenistan and to the Quetta-Damb Sadaat II and III style in Balochistan. As a consequence, almost until today, models assigning a major role to influ- ences from southern Central Asia, particularly those of the Geoksyur-Namazga HI complex, became prevalent to explain the appearance in Balochistan of painted pottery styles with geometric stepped motifs. In the mid 1970s, the discovery of a long chrono-cultural sequence in the Kachi-Bolan region has provided solid data for a new examination of archaeological phenomena in the Indo-Iranian regions.27 This sequence starts with an ace- ramic Neolithic period at Mehrgarh, which probably began at the end of the 8th millennium BC, till the Indus occupations at Nausharo covering the second half of the 3rd millennium BC and the late Bronze Age / Iron Age occupations at Pirak during the 2nd and 1st millennia BC.28 We have also to take into account the very important contribution of archaeologi- cal research in Pakistani Makran, with the excavations at Miri Qalat and Shahi Tump and the surface collecting carried out on many sites in the Dasht Plain, mainly dated to the 4th and 3rd millennia BC.29 These data, based on solid stratigraphie evi- dence, have enabled a more precise analysis of the phenomena defined as "the Helmand civilisation " and of its relations with Balochistan and the Indus valley. The appearance, probably a little before 6000 BC, of a coarse chaff-tempered pottery at Mehrgarh Period IIA, gave to the ceramic crafts of Balochistan a temporal depth that nothing had previously indicated in these regions.30 Mehrgarh Neolithic (Periods I and II), and Chalcolithic (Period III) levels, the latter dated to the 5th and the very beginning of the 4th millennium BC, have revealed a technological and especially pyrotechnological skill, which has never before been recorded for Balochistan in such early contexts.31 For example, it is at the beginning of Mehrgarh III that early Kili Ghul Mohammad and Togau ceramics decorated with geometric designs and already using a rotating support in their manufacture occurred.32 The long-lasting Period III of Mehrgarh (5th and beginning of the 4th millennium BC) has enabled to follow the development of different craft techniques in several areas, particularly in the pottery styles called Togau A and Kili Ghul Mohammad II and III widespread in Balochistan. It is actually interesting to notice that the early fine Togau ware of Balochistan shows par- allels with the fine black-on-red ceramics known at Cheshmeh Ali in the northern Central Iranian Plateau, which have been dated to 5200-4300 BC (Transitional Chalcolithic).33 This pot- tery is typically decorated with various geometric designs, but also with stylized birds and goats in rows,34 which show 21.

It is also significant that the pottery of Mundigak I, the earliest occupation of the "Helmand" cultural complex, corresponds to the Mehrgarh III pottery, in technique - quality of the paste and manufac- ture - as well in the shapes and decoration, probably within a phase dated to the end of the 5th millennium.35 The pottery of Mundigak I-II (fig. 2: 3-5, 7-8) can also be related to the context of Balochistan ceramic productions, especially from Mehrgarh IV around 3500 BC (fig. 2: 1-2). Two potsherds cor- responding to the same Togau style (one decorated with styl- ized goats) have been discovered at Sarazm in upper Zerafshan (Tajikistan), in association with Namazga II vessels36 (fig. 2: 6,9). The extensive geographical scale of the diffusion zone for the Togau ware, characteristic of Mehrgarh III, may now be appreciated.37 Later, at Sarazm, an increasing assemblage of pottery (about 15% of studied material38), especially from Periods III and IV, offers obvious parallels with Mehrgarh VI and VII vessels dated to the end of the 4th and to the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC, while the pottery of Geoksjur style remains in the majority.39 Thus another evidence of the diffu- sion of ceramic productions from Balochistan to Central Asia, north of the great mountain barrier of the Hindu Kush, is now well attested. However, the questions of the appearance and development of different pottery types in Balochistan remain relatively com- plex. Considering the very long sequence of Mehrgarh Period III, it could be assumed that Kili Ghul Mohammad II and Togau A wares have provided the prototypes of different pot- tery assemblages in neighbouring regions, especially Southern Balochistan or Sistān during the foundation of Shahr-i Sokhta. But, in Makran, unlike Central and Eastern Balochistan, the sites apparently remained aceramic until the beginning of the 4th millennium BC. It is only in the first centuries of the 4th millen- nium (Period II in Makran chronology) that, relatively suddenly, a pottery of quality using coil-building technique and probably a rotating support appeared at Miri Qalat and at Shahi Tump.40 As B. Mutin noticed,41 the Period II pottery shows very few links with the ceramic productions from Central and Eastern Balochistan, as it can be seen in particular at Mehrgarh. In fact, the closest parallels can rather be found in south-eastern Iran, Fig. 2 - Togau ware with motifs of stylized caprids. 1-2, Buff reddish ware from Mehrgarh III (C.

Mutin noticed,44 a part of the Period I pottery from the graveyard of Shahr-i Sokhta,45 especially the bowls decorated with pseudo-swasti- kas46 (fig. 3: 1-6), are stylistically very close to the Makran Ilia funerary pottery47 (fig. 3: 7-9). At Mundigak III, besides the several shapes and decorations showing strong affinities with central and eastern Balochistan, large bowls or cups decorated inside with motifs clearly related to decorative traditions of south-eastern Iran (particularly in Makran) also appear in con- 35.

"THE NAL CERAMICS THE QUESTION OF THE ORIGIN OF POLYCHROME DECORATIONS IN BALOCHISTAN A great importance has also been attached to the appear- ance of bichrome and polychrome decorations that occurred in the Indo-Iranian regions in the second half of the 4th millen- nium BC. At Mehrgarh, the first known examples of bichrome decorations painted in red and black on a beige background are recorded in the last phase of Period III, around 4000 BC.50 The development of this decorative technique in Balochistan, mainly attested in the Kechi Beg vessels, was also consid- ered to be a phenomenon of external origin, either related to an influence by the Jemdet Nasr pottery from Mesopotamia or by the Geoksyur-Namazga III pottery from southern Turkmenistan. However, very different types of polychrome pottery were ascribed in a questionable way to the Kechi Beg style. At Mehrgarh IV, around 3500 BC, large cups and carinated pots in Kechi Beg pottery decorated with complex combinations of motifs painted in black and red51 coexist in the same levels with another specific polychrome production. This pottery includes large truncated-conical shaped vessels, jars and carinated bowls covered with red paint and decorated with black and white motifs52 (fig. 4: 1-3). This decoration with white pigments is a striking feature in the pottery production from Mehrgarh IV and V. A recent study carried out in collaboration with the Centre de recherche et de restauration des musées de France (C2RMF) has shown that the white pigment on one sample dated to Mehrgarh IV is obtained from fired steatite.53 The use of such a pigment is consistent with the succession of tech- niques using heat developed by craftsmen in the Kachi-Bolan region to change, in the last phase of the pre-pottery Neolithic, black steatite into white steatite, and to produce, in the begin- ning in the 5th millennium BC, steatite beads covered with a copper oxide glaze.54 In such a context, it is not surprising to find evidence as a further technical step, around 3500 BC, of fired steatite to produce "coloured" pigments used for the pot- tery painting decoration. The use of an additional white pig- ment, which nature may vary according to the different areas, is widespread in Balochistan and in the Indus valley during the second half of the 4th millennium BC. But the ceramic shapes and decorations often differ substantially in the various pottery manufacturing areas. At Mehrgarh, combinations of geomet- ric motifs are predominant whereas flowers or fish decorations occur at Rehman Dheri II.55 Nevertheless, the forms of the large truncated-conical shaped vessels from Mehrgarh IV and V (fig. 4: 1-3) are also found at Sohr Damb/Nal56 (fig. 4: 7), in the cemetery of Shahi Tump in Makran57 (fig. 4: 5-6), and fur- ther west in the Aliabad ware at Tal-i Iblis58 (fig. 4: 4). These shapes are sufficiently rare and limited in time scope, with their almost monumental aspect and their complex polychrome decoration, to be undoubtedly associated. It is important to observe that the Aliabad vessels, produced in a chronologi- cal context prior to the foundation of Shahr-i Sokhta, are less carefully manufactured than it is the case for the exceptional products from Mehrgarh or Makran. Considering the question of ways of influences raised frequently in the archaeology of the Indo-Iranian regions, it becomes necessary to study the factors related to specific craft techniques when attempting to establish a cartography of the development of phenomena such as the diffusion of bichrome and polychrome decoration in this vast geographic territory. This also appears clearly when the question of the Nal poly- chrome ware is tackled. In their article, our Italian colleagues provide a systematic review of the Nal pottery discovered at Shahr-i Sokhta, in particular the canister pots.59 The decora- tive quality of this pottery found over a vast zone of the Indo- Iranian regions, from Makran to Afghanistan and to Iranian Sistān, has often been noted.60 But it is only in the heart of the 48.

This is demonstrated by several painted vessels discovered by Hargreaves, then by U. Franke in the context of Period II at Sohr Damb/Nal, dated between 3100 and 2700 BC61 (fig. 5). Relatively recent looting in this region has resulted in the evermore frequent appearance in various sale catalogues of many representations of winged griffons, raptors with spread wings, lion friezes and, more significantly, human figures with lion heads. However, outside the Nal core area, the canister pots mainly have geometric designs using a range of colours (black, red, yellow, turquoise and green) which have likely been applied after firing. But besides these containers in the "spirit" of Nal pottery, other polychrome ves- sels that differ significantly from the Nal style in their shapes and their decorations occur at Shahr-i Sokhta or in the Dasht plain (fig. 6) even though the same range of colours was used. 61.

Thus the study of technical skill can bring a major contri- bution to a better understanding of the interactions between the sites of the Indo-Iranian regions. This is true for other craft activities such as bead manufacturing, including the produc- tion of steatite faience beads that occurs at the beginning of Mehrgarh VI64 and at Mundigak IV, and as metallurgy char- acterized by the early lost-wax casting technique. An excep- tional discovery is the ovoid weight with handle found in a Period Ilia tomb from Shahi Tump (Makran).65 This artifact with a lead core consists of a cast jacket in copper-lead alloy (the whole weighs more than 15 kg). It is ornamented with leopard and goat motifs made in incrusted shells. For the pottery, the wide distribution of Nal polychrome ware and the production of the Dasht plain and Shahr-i Sokhta II polychrome vessels occurred at the same time around 3000 BC and in the same areas as the development of the Faiz Mohammad and Emir grey wares. Rita Wright has shown that these grey wares are relevant to the same technical tra- dition.66 The Emir Grey Ware is present on many sites of the Dasht plain in Makran Period Illb (2800-2600 BC),67 at Bampur I-IV,68 and at Shahr-i Sokhta II;69 the Faiz Mohammad Grey Ware with its rich variety of geometric, animal and plant designs, is well attested at Mehrgarh VI-VII and Nausharo I.70 The levels of Mundigak IV also provided several fragments of Faiz Mohammad Grey Ware71 which were probably imports from the production centre of the Kachi-Bolan region, as for Shahr-i Sokhta.72 Other links can be established between Shahr-i Sokhta and several production centres of fine grey ware in Balochistan. It may be the case with the very few sherds of incised grey ware found in the levels of the Period IV Burnt Building at Shahr-i Sokhta.73 The incised grey ware has often been considered as typical of South-Eastern Iran and Oman and as a good marker to give "a first glimpse of the wide interaction area in which Shahr-i Sokhta is placed in late III - early II millennium BC".74 More recently the discovery of incised grey ware in Makran shows that this type of pottery occurs from Period Illb ( ca 2800-2600 BC) in the Dasht Plain75 and is also represented in the following Period IIIc (ca 2600-2500) at Miri Qalat.76 Even if a very few samples of incised grey ware are still attested in the levels of Miri Qalat Period IV, it is worth pointing out that the closest parallels with the incised grey ware of Shahr-i Sokhta are precisely found at Miri Qalat IIIc.77 Without further developing this subject, we wish to stress that when good chronological evidence is available, it is pos- sible to clearly observe on several sites of the Indo-Iranian regions the successive and cumulative appearance of techni- cal innovations occurring in productions which are sometimes different stylistically but similar in their technology. We may then better analyse the phenomena of multi-directional inter- action and exchange between Southern Balochistan (Makran), Sistān, the Mundigak region, Central and Eastern Balochistan and the sites of the Indus valley during the centuries that pre- ceded the beginning of the Indus civilization. 64.

"HELMAND VERSUS INDUS" To complete this brief summary, we should point out that, in their article, our Italian colleagues emphasize the relations between the sites of the Helmand system and those of the Indus valley in the part subtitled " Helmand versus Indus 78 The term "Indus" also includes Balochistan. We agree with the links, which we ourselves often observed, between Shahr-i Sokhta I, II and III and Mundigak III and IV and between the sites of Balochistan and the Indus valley at the end of the 4th mil- lennium and in the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. The authors declare: "In fact J.-F. Jarrige and other scholars, on the basis of their sound knowledge of the ceramic sequence of the region and specific ceramic comparisons, have considered Shahr-i Sokhta Period III as contemporary with the Kot-Dijian phase of the core area (i.e. with Period II at Harappa, ascribed by a consistent series of calibrated 14C dating to the range of 2800- 2600 BCE)".79 Periods I, II and III of Shahr-i Sokhta and Periods III and IV of Mundigak should indeed be placed in the same chronologi- cal horizon between about 3100 and 2600 BC. However, in the following points of the article, the authors attempt to extend these comparisons up to the context of the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. It is difficult for us to accept the authors' use of the term "Kot Dijian" to qualify all the cultural assemblage that, in Balochistan and in the Indus valley, preceded the Indus civilization. Kot Diji is an Indus valley site excavated by F. A. Khan in the second half of the 1950s and early 1960s.80 The levels of Kot Diji I, prior to the Indus civilization, yielded many examples of jars with rims encircled by a painted brownish-black band. Afterward, it became customary to use these vessels to define a Kot Diji style, with numerous examples found on several sites of the Indus val- ley and Balochistan. Thus, at Mehrgarh VII81 and at Nausharo, especially in Period I, several Kot Diji jars were found among many other vessels with different types of decoration corre- sponding to styles associated with various names according to the different scholars (fig. 9: 1-3, 7). Some of these Kot Diji jars are also present at Mundigak IV.l (fig. 9: 4) and at Harappa in the Period 1 and 2 levels which also precede the beginning of the Indus civilization82 (fig. 9: 5-6). Without going beyond the scope of this article, it is worth reminding how the archaeology of the Indo-Iranian regions 78. Cortesi et al., 2008: 9-10. 79. Ibid. : 9. 80. Khan, 1965. 81.

In the domestic contexts or in the potter's area from Mehrgarh, Nausharo or Lai Shah, the pottery reflects the stylistic and tech- nical diversity of productions manufactured in the same work- shops. It is important to stress the point that there is no reason for classifying the first 3rd millennium sites in Balochistan or in the Indus valley in a single chrono-cultural phase called "Kot Diji". Although a few examples of Kot Diji jars were found at Mundigak IV83 (fig. 9: 4), this site has provided many more ceramic comparisons with Mehrgarh VII and Nausharo I, including the stepped and bracketed motifs of the Quetta ware and several obviously imported examples of Faiz Mohammad and Emir grey wares not represented at Kot Diji or Harappa. The diversity of these productions, lying in a common tech- nical skill, does not allow them to be unified under the name of a single site. The existence of a so-called "Kot Dijian" cultural entity would imply that sites such as Kot Diji or the "Kot Dijian levels" of Harappa, Period 2 would have played a more crucial role in the development of the Indus civilization than other sites for instance in lower Sind or along the western borders of the Indus valley. In an article based upon the study of sev- eral thousand ceramic vessels from Nausharo and other Indus sites, G. Quivron has clearly demonstrated the existence of a first "Harappan" style of which there is evidence in an obvi- ously identical chronological context at Nausharo Period II, in the deepest levels of Chanhu-daro, at Amri IIIA as well as at Harappa 3A.84 83.

"ZHOB-LIKE FRAGMENTARY CLAY FIGURINE" AND "TERRACOTTA CAKES" From these available chronological elements, the parallels rightly established between the possible imported objects from Shahr-i Sokhta and various finds from Balochistan and the Indus valley fit perfectly into the temporal framework of the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. This is particularly true for the human figurines of Zhob type found at Shahr-i Sokhta II85 (fig. 10: 1), at Mundigak IV86 (fig. 10: 7-8) and at Deh Morasi Ghundai87 (Kandahar, Afghanistan) which correspond to well- known examples recorded in large numbers at Mehrgarh VII (fig. 10: 2-6) and at Nausharo I.88 The Zhob figurines, accord- ing to a terminology established by Fairservis89 from the exca- vations at Damb Sadaat (fig. 10: 9-11), appear to be imported objects from Balochistan, perhaps more typical of the Kachi- Bolan area than of the Zhob valley. At Nausharo, they occur in the levels preceding Period ID (2600-2500 BC). Period ID has provided human figurines of a characteristic style different from those of Mundigak and Shahr-i Sokhta objects. Concerning the triangular terracotta cakes, it is true that for a long time they have been considered as emblematic elements of the Indus civilization. This probably has led our Italian col- leagues to present examples found at Shahr-i Sokhta as "not unknown in the Indus Valley"90 (fig. 11: 1-5). The triangular 85. Tosi, 1983: pl. LXIX, 61. 86.

Quivron and oblong terracotta cakes were discovered in hundreds of thousands on the different Indus sites, including Nausharo II and III. The authors point out, as we have done before,91 that these cakes could have been items for storing heat and used to heat water and food. Such indirect heating techniques have been documented as early as Mehrgarh Neolithic in the 7th mil- lennium BC. The latter has provided circular hearths dug into the floor and filled with burnt pebbles or, in one case, with fired oblong terracotta nodules.92 Still today in Balochistan, bread is occasionally baked by laying the dough on heated pebbles. At Mehrgarh I to VII and at Nausharo I, large amounts of pebbles were used as processes of indirect heating. With the emergence of the Indus civilization, triangular cakes and oblong rolls have replaced pebbles in the hearth zones of Nausharo Period II. Once broken, these cakes were used as foundation beds upon which buildings, streets and alleys were built. However, triangular cakes were already found in the lev- els of Period VII at Mehrgarh93 and at Nausharo I, in a context prior to the Indus civilization (fig. 11: 6-14). It is worth point- ing out that they are very close by their sizes to the examples published by E. Cortesi et al. in figure 12, which come from Shahr-i Sokhta II, III and IV. One of these cakes (fig. 11: 1) shows an incised sign that can be compared to an example from Nausharo IC (fig. 11: 6). Other Shahr-i Sokhta cakes have seal impressions, suggesting that they might have had an administrative role.94 Although Cortesi et al. assign Periods III and IV of Shahr-i Sokhta to the second half of the 3rd millen- nium, we think that the cakes presented in their article belong to the same tradition as in Nausharo or elsewhere during the first half of the 3rd millennium BC and that they do not provide a convincing argument to attribute some of them to a context contemporaneous with the Indus civilization. It is however dif- ficult to explain the relation between the cakes of the first half of the 3rd millennium from Balochistan and their mass produc- tion during the Indus civilization. "THE LATER PHASE OF PERIOD IU"' A CRITICAL RE-EXAMINATION OF THE DATING OF PERIODS III-IV AT SHAHR-I SOKHTA Although they assign the beginning of Shahr-i Sokhta Period III (phase 4) to 2500 BC, our Italian colleagues consider the existence of a later phase of this Period III (phase 3) that could date "between approximately 2350 and 2200 BCE".95 On a previous occasion,96 we have already raised several argu- ments to question this late dating. It is obvious that the Indus civilization did not appear ex nihilo but was rooted in an ear- lier local context. Among the numerous "Harappan" elements that pre-existed, especially in the Kachi-Bolan region, before the Indus civilization, we may list the pottery decorated with intersecting circles, a whole variety of pipai leaves or with fish scale motifs, open bowls decorated on the internal surface with radiating motifs incised with reeds, and perforated jars. At Nausharo II, which corresponds to the very first phase of the Indus civilization, many elements of the cultural assem- blage can be linked with models known in the earlier levels of period ID and even in the earlier levels of periods IB and IC between 2800 and 2600/2500 BC.97 Therefore, few ele- ments from Mundigak IV.3, that Casal has connected to the Indus civilization, find very clear parallels in the context of Nausharo IC and Mehrgarh VIIC as well as at Lai Shah, a site of potter's kilns near Mehrgarh.98 In this period marked by the generalization of the fast wheel technique,99 we can also notice the presence of large bowls decorated on the internal surface with stylized pipai leaves arranged in large volutes (fig. 12). These bowls are particularly numerous at Lai Shah100 (fig. 12: 1) and at Nausharo IC (fig. 12: 4-5), and are also found at Rehman Dheri III101 (fig. 12: 2), at Mundigak IV102 (fig. 12: 7) and at Miri Qalat IIIc, in a context earlier than 2500 BC103 (fig. 12: 6). A fragment of a similar bowl was also found in the Burnt Building of Shahr-i 91. Jarrige J.-F., 1988: 75. 92. Jarrige et al., 1995: 455. 93. Ibid.: 237, fig. 4.19b. 94. Cortesi et al ., 2008: 17. 95.

Sokhta IV (phase 2)104 (fig. 12: 3), which establishes without any doubt the contemporaneousness between Periods III and IV at Shahr-i Sokhta, Lai Shah and Mehrgarh VIIC, between 2800 and 2600 BC. More recently the excavations conducted by S.M.S. Sajjadi in the graveyard of Shahr-i Sokhta from 1997 to 2000105 have revealed a series of tombs dated to Period IV. Tomb 1705 has provided a bowl decorated inside with stylized pipai leaves arranged in large volutes in the same style as the bowl men- tioned above (fig. 12: 8), and very similar to the examples from Lai Shah and Nausharo IC.106 Other pipai designs found on bowls in tomb 1705 (fig. 12: 10) are obviously very close to decorations characteristic of the same area in Balochistan107 (fig. 12: 9, 11). These significant and complex designs cannot be submitted to a fortuitous comparison, unlike the simple geometric motifs. The Shahr-i Sokhta tombs dated to Period IV have thus yielded vessels that may be definitely related to Lai Shah and its pottery kilns, Mehrgarh VIIC, Nausharo IC, Miri Qalat IIIc as well as Mundigak IV. 3. It is quite natural that the Period III levels of Shahr-i Sokhta, which can be assumed to be earlier than those of Period IV, offer evident comparisons with the preceding period on the mentioned sites. Considering the later phase of Shahr-i Sokhta Period III, the authors refer in particu- lar to the grave goods from tomb 731. 108 This tomb contained several footed beakers widespread in the Indo-Iranian regions during the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. (fig. 13: 3, 7-8). One of these beakers (fig. 13: 3) is decorated with a whole leaf with stem symmetrically framed by two volute leaves. These vessels are among the most emblematic pottery of Mundigak IV.l109 (fig. 13: 2, 4, 6) and the specimens found in tomb 731 are very likely imports from the Mundigak area. Beakers with leaf motifs were also discovered at Nausharo I (fig. 13: 1, 5). Another bowl with a decoration of fish among aquatic plants110 (fig. 14: 1) is also very close to examples from Pakistani Balochistan and from Mundigak (fig. 14: 2-3, 6, 8).

"GAMING PIECES AND DICE" Other artefacts seem to justify, for the authors, a late dat- ing for tomb 731, contemporary to the Indus civilization, espe- cially the wooden game elements.113 The game-board found in tomb 731 (fig. 15: 1) consists of small circular spaces formed by the interlacing of a snake and is reminiscent in its shape of one of the game discovered in the royal tombs at Ur. However, it has no known equivalent in the Indus valley, which has pro- duced examples of terracotta game-boards with incised com- partments at Mohenjo-Daro114 and at Lothal.115 In contrast, a chlorite tray set on two feet was found among objects probably coming from looted tombs in the Jiroft area (south-eastern Iran).116 Its surface is covered with interlacing snakes which form circular concavities, very similar to the wooden game- board from Shahr-i Sokhta (fig. 15: 2). It is difficult to date the chlorite objects from irregular excavations, but it is interest- ing to note here that a chlorite fragment decorated with a lion mane in the same style was discovered at Nausharo IC (around 2700 BC) (fig. 16). Concerning the pieces in wood or stone associated with this game-board, they might be considered as Fig. 16 - Fragment of " chlorite " vessel from Nausharo, Period IC ( photograph MAI © C. JARRIGE). prototypes of game pieces in bone or ivory still used nowadays, and common to the Indus and Oxus civilizations. However, we can notice that there is no example of sticks or long dice decorated with an incised 'X' motif in the Indus civilization, similar to the example of Shahr-i Sokhta. Cubic dice in wood have also been discovered at Shahr-i Sokhta IV.117 Although no game board is recorded at Mehrgarh or Nausharo, we have to 113. Cortesi et al, 2008: 24-27, figs. 19-21. 114.

It is important to remember that Shahr-i Sokhta is one of the few sites in which wood is particularly well preserved thanks to the dry air.

For each of these objects, especially the mousetrap dating to Period IV at Mundigak,118 the two fragments of a trap from Bampur, site Y (level 2), 119 and the incised seals, we have examples from levels well dated to earlier periods than the Indus civilization.120 Possible links between the few stone sculptures found in the Indo-Iranian regions and in the Indus valley have often been made, but we must remind that the statuette in steatite sometimes called the "priest-king" is firmly situated in the last great phase of the Indus civilization, in the upper levels of Mohenjo-daro, during 118.

QUIVRON a period of strong interactions between the Oxus civilization and the Indus civilization.121 This period is also marked by the "treasure" of Quetta, the graveyards of Mehrgarh VIII and Dauda Damb and by the occupation layers of Sibri.122 There is thus no reason to systematically link the stone head from Mundigak123 to this late cultural horizon corresponding to the end of the 3rd millennium and very beginning of the 2nd mil- lennium BC. A SO-CALLED "FRAGMENT OF AN INDUS BLACK-ON-RED PAINTING JAR" AND 6 A STEATITE CYLINDER-SEAL WITH AN INDUS INSCRIPTION" A further argument that might prove that Shahr-i Sokhta could have been a site partly contemporary to the Indus civi- lization is provided by a potsherd illustrated in figure 7, 5b of Cortesi et al .' article in Paléorient. This figure shows a jar with a concavo-convex profile typical of the second period of the Indus civilization at Nausharo III, while in the first Indus Period (Nausharo II), this type of shape is squatter.124 This shape was reconstructed from a small body sherd without rim or bottom coming from a surface collection at Shahr-i Sokhta. The potsherd is decorated with a quadruped beneath a sun and above a criss-cross band. It should be pointed out that there is no similar decoration in the pottery corpus of the Indus civilization so far recorded. The relatively numerous examples of this type of jar in the Indus sites are decorated with well- known motifs, usually combinations of intersecting circles, plant friezes and peacocks. Considering the very small size of the potsherd, there is no need to insist on the fact that a great variety of spherical jars existed from all the periods and this find is unfortunately not associated to a context which could allow to define its chronological horizon. It is also well-known that seals from the Indus civilization have been recorded as far as in Mesopotamia. A fragment of a cylinder seal published by R. Knox,125 which presents six signs vaguely similar to those found on the Indus seals, is mentioned by the authors as an obvious evidence of contact between Sistān and the Indus civilization. Quoting R. Knox, the authors remind that this object was collected in 1906 dur- ing a topographical mission led by General MacMahon to define the frontiers of the British Raj from Swat to Sistān. This object is compared with finds such as a cylinder-seal and an amulet with Indus signs discovered at Sibri in the Kachi- Bolan region. It is important to notice that, around 2000 BC, the Kachi-Bolan region is marked by the settling of groups whose cultural assemblage is obviously connected to the Oxus civilization. This is particularly true in the graveyard of Mehrgarh VIII,126 but also at Nausharo Period IV that have brought evidence of interaction between these groups related to the Oxus civilization and the population of the Indus civili- zation. In his survey in Afghan Sistān, G. Dales has also found several objects related to the Oxus civilization.127 But no find showing connection with the Oxus civilization has been so far reported at Shahr-i Sokhta or elsewhere in the Iranian Sistān. Therefore, it is likely that the cylinder seal combining Indus and "Oxus" features mentioned above has been collected by General MacMahon in Afghan Sistān. Future research will perhaps enable to discover occupa- tions from the second half of the 3rd millennium BC in the regions of Helmand, near Shahr-i Sokhta or Mundigak. Such evidence could throw light on possible interactions between these regions and the Indus civilization, as well as with the sites of the "Oxus" cultural complex or with south-eastern Iranian sites such as Shahdad. But, in the present state of our knowledge, the current available data do not enable to consider that one of the great highways of interaction between the Indus civilization and Mesopotamia could have been marked by sites such as Mundigak and Shahr-i Sokhta.128 It is likely that these sites were no longer occupied, while the route of exchanges was lined up in south-eastern Iran with sites such as Shahdad, Tepe Yahya and the Jiroft area. "THE HELMAND CIVILIZATION, BALUCHISTAN AND THE INDUS VALLEY" BEFORE THE EMERGENCE OF THE INDUS CIVILIZATION Research in the Indo-Iranian regions, in particular Balochistan and Southern Afghanistan, has often led the schol- ars to discern "Harappan" elements in the material assemblages discovered in these regions. This is true of W.A. Fairservis 121. Jarrige and Quivron, 2008. 122. Jarrige and Usman-Hassan, 1989. 123. Casal, 1961 : pl. XLII-XLIV. 124. Quivron, 2000. 125. Knox, 1994: 373-378. 126.

But the few potsherds found on the sites located in the highlands of Balochistan, that Fairservis qualified as "Harappan", are limited to fragments of bowls with radiating motifs incised with reeds and to perfo- rated jars.131 Such elements, which are now well documented at Mehrgarh VII and at Nausharo I as we mentioned above, have led Casal to wrongly believe in a possible "Indus" influence during Period IV. 3 at Mundigak. The excavations at Nausharo have provided evidence of a transitional period (Nausharo ID) between the final occupa- tion of Mehrgarh (Period VIIC), contemporary with Nausharo IC, and the beginning of the Indus occupation (Nausharo Period II). This Period ID which can be dated to between 2600 and 2500 BC, in spite of an obvious continuity with the preced- ing Period VIIC at Mehrgarh and IC at Nausharo, is marked by major changes such as the disappearance of motifs from the Quetta-Damb Sadaat tradition and of the polychrome decora- tions as well as the typical Kot Diji jars. But one notices the development of shapes and motifs heralding the "Harappan" pottery of Nausharo II. It is highly probable that the equivalent of this Period ID material would be found, probably on a larger scale, if the deep levels of the sites in the Kachi plain, such as Pathani Damb and Judeiro-daro, of Chanhu-daro in the Sind and maybe of Mohenjo-daro, could be excavated. It should be recalled that, in a 1967 article long before the discovery of Nausharo, Fairservis stressed the fact that the Kachi region, bordered by the ancient bed of the Indus, the "hollow of Sind", is a favourable area to provide significant information on the context related to the emergence of the Indus civilization.132 If many parallels have been established between Shahr-i Sokhta III and IV, Mundigak IV and several sites in Balochistan at the time of Mehrgarh VII A-C and Nausharo I A-C, it is no longer the case with Nausharo ID. We have already stated that the human figurines from Shahr-i Sokhta or Mundigak related to the so-called Zhob style display connection only with figu- rines from Mehrgarh VII and Nausharo IA-C and never with the new types occurring in Nausharo Period ID. The explora- tions carried out by Fairservis in the high valleys of Quetta, in Loralai and Zhob regions, indicate that occupation on many sites belonging to the Quetta-Damb Sadaat III cultural com- plex apparently ended rather abruptly. To explain this phenom- enon, it has been suggested, following Sir Mortimer Wheeler133 that the development of the Indus civilization has led to the disappearance of the cultures in the highlands and foothills of Balochistan. But we know today that some of the phenomena that appear to have affected the valleys and plateaus of Central and Northern Balochistan occurred before the establishment of the cultural assemblage characteristic of Nausharo ID, and thus before the Indus civilization itself in its classic form (Nausharo II). It is likely that these transformations, which occur around 2600 BC, are significant elements for a better comprehension of the genesis of the Indus civilization. But it can also be assumed that such phenomena including the aban- donment of several sites in the highlands of Balochistan have also to be accounted to understand the lack of data concerning the vast area of the Helmand system in the course of the second half of the 3rd millennium BC. Of course Balochistan did not become deserted with the emergence of the Indus civilization. In the southern part of this province, in the Jhalawan region, the original Kulli culture shows an evident cultural and economic dynamism throughout the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.134 In Makran, Indus occupations have been recorded at several sites such as Sotka- Koh and Sutkagen-Dor, and Miri Qalat Period IV.135 At Miri Qalat IV, most of the pottery belongs to the Indus style but also includes a local pottery in direct line from Periods Illb and IIIc vessels.136 Most of the previous ceramic groups are rep- resented, including the painted grey ware. Among it, several fragments of canister pots were found, comparable with exam- ples found in Iran at Bampur and in the Oman Peninsula.137 It is worth mentioning the existence of a "canister pot" deco- rated with ibexes in the Period V levels of Shahr-i Sokhta IV138 (fig. 18: 1). The canister pot of Shahr-i Sokhta (MAI 3335)139 was dis- covered in 1969 on the floor of the room CXXXIX in the last occupation phase of the Burnt Building.140 It is a medium/ 129.

The base is discontinuous with a flat to slightly convex bottom. The decoration painted in dark brown on the whole external surface consists of three superimposed friezes of stylized ibexes separated by sets of two horizontal bands. The division in different registers by the horizontal bands precedes the frieze execution. The ibex pos- ture (with raised-hind legs meaning the running movement) is characteristic of the mid-3rd millennium figurative system in the iconography of South-Eastern Iran and South-Western Pakistan.141 The execution of the animal motifs is very repeti- tive. Potters have first drawn the "U- or V-shaped" body from tail to head (sometimes including one horn), then added horns and the legs. Beneath the undulating and horizontal bands painted on the rim and the neck, the shoulder displays a frieze of hatched triangles and a frieze of slanted spirals composed of 141. Before, ibexes are often combined with geometric motifs and generally depicted in more fixed gesture.

The internal surface bears a frieze of slanted spirals or loops delimited by two bands. The dating of the canister pot found at Shahr-i Sokhta poses some questions if we consider the ceramic parallels with Iran, the Oman Peninsula and Makran. M. Tosi first has pointed out with good reason "direct connections with Bampur and the Umm an- Nar graves".142 The canister pot of Shahr-i Sokhta shows indeed links in the decoration with a vase from Bampur VI143 (fig. 18: 17) even if the vessel shape is different. The neck is larger, the shoulder less high and the walls less convex. Another frag- ment of canister pot displays the same shape at Bampur VI,144 but this type of vase is also known at Bampur V.2145 (fig. 18: 13-14). In the Oman Peninsula, several canister pots decorated with friezes of caprids, triangles and spirals were found in Tombs B146 and 1059147 at Hili, and in tomb A of Hili Nord, dated to the sec- ond half of the 3rd millennium BC (fig. 18: 9-12). However, the best parallel, both in shape and decoration, is a vase discovered in Tomb M at Hili dated to between 2600 and 2500 BC on the basis of the pottery study148 (fig. 18: 8). The material assemblage from tomb M is connected with phases IIB -HCl at Hili 8 and cairns II and V at Umm an-Nar. "Aucune poterie de la tombe M n'évoque (. . .) les assemblages de la fin du IIP millénaire av. J.-C.".149 In Makran, fragments of canister pot decorated with friezes of caprids occur at Miri Qalat IV (fig. 18: 5-7), but the shapes are different with a truncated-conical body or with a marked careen such as Bampur VI. The best parallels identi- fied for the vase of Shahr-i Sokhta are in Period IIIc (2600-2500 BC), for which several canister pots in grey ware with a similar decoration were found (fig. 18: 2-3). There is thus no reason to exclusively associate this vessel to a context dating to the end of the 3rd millennium or very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, while its shape and its decoration show close comparisons with material assemblages from the previous period. The typo-chron- ological study of the canister pots in Makran (from the material of Periods Illb, IIIc and IV) obviously reveals a morphologi- cal evolution that tends to wide-mouthed pots with short neck, convex walls and flat bottom in Period Illb (2800-2600 BC) to pots with truncated-conical body and everted discontinuous bot- tom in Period IV (2500-2300 BC). Besides, it is important to notice that the incised grey ware, the ridged ware, the fragment of painted pottery dish discovered in the same Burnt Building of Shahr-i Sokhta IV,150 that are obviously all connected with a pottery tradition from south-eastern Iran (site of Bampur) and from Pakistani Balochistan, always find good ceramic parallels at Miri Qalat IIIc. It is also true for many vessel shapes in plain red ware and for the development of the streak-burnishing treat- ment at Shahr-i Sokhta IV, which presents the same technical characteristics as in Miri Qalat Period IIIc. CONCLUSION To sum up, the chronological framework based on a large amount of data in Balochistan or in the Indus valley enables to define reliable cultural periods from Mehrgarh Neolithic, during the last centuries of the 8th millennium BC, to the end of the Indus civilization in the beginning of the 2nd millen- nium BC. It is thus necessary to put aside the old models of Sir Mortimer Wheeler's time,151 stressing thè so-called division and isolation of the different geographic entities of Balochistan and neighbouring areas. Beyond the diversity of the craft pro- ductions from many sites, which doubtlessly reflect local iden- tities, broad factors of unity clearly appear on the scale of the Indo-Iranian regions. One of the most significant features is the progressive setting of complex technical knowledge over time, which appears to be synchronous at several sites of dif- ferent regions. We have insisted on the fact that heating tech- niques for steatite beads were established at Mehrgarh as early as the Neolithic; then in the 5th millennium BC, during Period III with glazed beads, lost-wax copper objects and fine pot- tery using rotating technique. In the 4th millennium BC, the Makran pottery differ from that of the Mehrgarh region, but in these same periods, several common elements can be pointed out: the fineness of the ceramic paste, the use of a rotating sup- port in shaping vessels, and the high level of expertise in the preparation and fixation of the coloured pigments. The con- comitant appearance of the F aiz Mohammad and Emir grey wares with their outstanding technical and esthetical quality is also very significant. As another example is the kiln area of Lai Shah, near Mehrgarh, and of Rud-i Biyaban, near Shahr-i Sokhta. These two important pottery areas display the more common use of fast wheel, probably around 2800 BC, and similar technical knowledge and chaînes opératoires. These transformations, often related to craftsmanship of high quality, 142. Tosi, 1976: 85, fig. 4 ; Lamberg-Karlovsky and Tosi, 1973: fig. 6. 143. De Cardi, 1970: fig. 43, 481. 144.

Quivron have indeed to be studied within a concordance of time which careful examination is probably among of the most efficient ways towards a better understanding of the prehistoric archae- ology of the Indo-Iranian regions, but also of the socio-cultural background of the Indus civilization. Although praising the remarkable contribution brought by the Italian mission at Shahr-i Sokhta and now by the Iranian mission, we have seen that none of the arguments reviewed in this article can sustain in a conclusive way that "the stressed importance of the chronology disagreement on Shahr-i Sokhta III is thus proved". The assumption that Periods III and IV at Shahr-i Sokhta would be contemporary with Harappa 3C and therefore with Nausharo IV or Amri UIC does not so far lie on any convincing argument. How could it be possible that Mehrgarh VII, Nausharo I, Makran Illb and IIIc, Mundigak IV, which are obviously contemporary, if we take into account a large amount of data, with Shahr-i Sokhta III and IV, could be later than the two first major phases of the Indus civilization at the time of Nausharo II-III, Harappa 3A-B or Amri IIIA-B? It cannot be excluded that in the near future finds showing connections with the Indus and the Oxus civilizations or with south-eastern Iranian sites occupied at the end of the 3rd millennium BC such as Shahdad will be recorded in Iranian Sistān. But, this is not yet the case.

Caldwell from the ceramic material found at Aliabad, and identified at Tal-i Iblis IV in the Bard Sir valley (Kerman, Iran) (Caldwell, 1967: 75-79, 182- 201). It includes two main painted pottery types: Aliabad Painted (decorated with straight, curved and wavy lines) and Aliabad Bichrome painted in brown, red and black. Although this pottery style needs further investigations, several evidences tend to date this production to the mid-4th millennium BC (Mutin, in press). Emir grey : Group of fine black-painted grey ware first noted by Sir A. Stein in Sistān and defined by Fairservis (Fairservis, 1956: 86). It mainly includes bowls, beakers, small-mouthed globular and canister pots painted with geometric (straight lines, bands, friezes of triangles, diamonds. . .) and naturalistic decorations (caprids, fish, hatched leaves, palms leaves or palm trees). The main production centre of Emir grey ware is the Makran region in South-Western Pakistani Balochistan, but its distribution extends to Iranian Sistān, Southern Afghanistan (Mundigak), South-Eastern Iran (Bampur val- ley, Kerman) and the Oman Peninsula. It is traditionally dated to the first half of the 3rd millennium BC. For a full description, see Wright, 1984; Didier, 2007; Besenval et Didier, 2004. F aiz Mohammad grey : Fine grey ware painted in black or dark red and named for the site on which the vessels were found (Fairservis, 1956: 263, fig. 55). F aiz Mohammad grey ware includes bowls, bea- kers and pots and is decorated with a great variety of geometric, ani- mal and plant motifs in a style inherited from the Quetta tradition. It is mainly manufactured in the Kachi-Bolan, Quetta, Zhob and Loralai regions (eastern Pakistani Balochistan), but was also found at Mundigak and in Sistān. At Mehrgarh, it occurs in Period VI-VII contexts (3100-2600 BC). For a full description, see Wright, 1984 and 1995; Jarrige et al ., 1995. Geoksyur : Geoksyur, an oasis site located in the ancient Tedjen Delta (southern Turkmenistan), gives its name to a style of fine painted pottery of the Namazga III period (second half of the 4th mil- lennium BC). The monochrome or polychrome decorations include mainly geometric designs (stepped motifs often compared to the Quetta pottery), but also stylized goat designs (Khlopin, 1964; Masson and Merpert, 1982). Geoksyur pottery is found from the Kopet Dagh Piedmonts (Southern Turkmenistan) to Sarazm (Tajikistan). Kec hi Beg polychrome : Pottery style defined by Fairservis (Fairservis, 1956: 259, fig. 53) which spreads over a vast area from southern Afghanistan (Kandahar region) to eastern (Quetta valley, Zhob and Loralai regions), and central-southern Pakistani Balochistan (Surab and Nal regions in the districts of Sarawan and Jhalawan). It is a fine buff pottery manufactured with coil-building and wheel-throwing techniques combined into a single sequence and decorated with a great variety of geometric designs (bands, wavy lines, hatched triangles and diamonds, circles, stars, pendant loops, zigzag and crenellated bands, checked squares), and rare floral motifs painted in black and red or brownish red. At Mehrgarh, it is dated to between 3600 and 3100 BC. Kili Ghul Mohammad /Togau : The style of Kili Ghul Mohammad was defined from the excavations of Kili Ghul Mohammad I and II in the Quetta valley (Eastern Pakistani Balochistan) (Fairservis, 1956: 256-257, fig. 50b). It is a fine or medium-coarse red ware painted in black with simple geometric designs. Forms include bowls and ovoid pots. Togau is a fine black-painted pottery defined by B. De Cardi (De Cardi, 1965: 128-232), which spreads from southern Afghanistan (Mundigak region) and eastern Balochistan (Kachi-Bolan region) to central/southern Balochistan (Surab, Jhalawan, and Makran regions) and the Indus valley (Amri). De Cardi has distinguished four stages (A-D) in the evolution of the Togau pottery. Kili Ghul Mohammad and Togau are tradition- ally considered as the first painted pottery styles in Balochistan.

In the first phase (Mehrgarh IIIA), forms are very limited (open bowls, globular jars) and decorations are simple (chevrons, hatched panels). Then (Mehrgarh HIB, Togau A), the decorations include a great variety of geometric (Maltese crosses, rosettes, triangles, diamonds) and naturalistic (stylized caprids, birds, gazelle) designs. During Period UIC (Togau B-C), the number of patterns is subsequently reduced, the motifs tend to be more geometrized (animals are reduced to stylized head and horns), and the first anthropomorphic decorations occur. At the end of Period UIC, we also notice the appearance of friezes of hook characteristic of Togau C-D and the first bichrome ware. Togau E is a variant from South-Eastern Balochistan decorated with "mere stroke" (Franke, 2008: 654). Kot Diji : Red pottery type found at Kot Diji I in the Indus valley (Khan, 1965: 42-43, pl. XVII-XXV) and dated to the first half of the 3rd millennium BC (2800-2600 BC). It is mainly characterized by neckless wide-mouthed globular jars decorated with fugitive bands painted in black, red or brownish red on the rim. The vessel is wheel- made and cream-slipped. It occurs in a great part of the Indus valley and in Eastern Balochistan. Other specimens (dishes-on stand, glob- ular and biconical jars) are decorated with fish-scale motifs, inter- secting circles, flowers and horned creatures. Jemdet Nasr : The typical assemblage of Jemdet Nasr style was found on the eponymous site in south-central Iraq. It is generally dated to 3100-2900 BC and includes monochrome and polychrome pottery decorated with both geometric and figurative designs (Field and Martin, 1935; Matthews, 1992). Its distribution extends to Mesopotamia, Iran, the Oman Peninsula and southern Afghanistan (Mundigak). Nal polychrome : Fine buff pottery painted in black, red, yel- low and turquoise and characterized by complex geometric patterns arranged in friezes and metopes and by abstract figurative motifs (flo- ral motifs, winged griffons, lions, birds, felines, bulls, human figures, and hybrid creatures) (Hargreaves, 1929; Franke, 2008: 661-662). It is mainly produced in the Nal region in Jhalawan (central/southern Pakistani Balochistan) between 3100 and 2700 BC, but its distribu- tion extends over a vast area from South-Eastern Iran to Eastern and Southern Balochistan. Quetta-Damb Sadaat : Black-on buff ware (wheel-manufac- tured), well-known for its typical steppe motifs found at Damb Sadaat II (3100-2700 BC) in the Quetta valley (Fairservis, 1956: 255- 256, figs. 48-49, designs 108-469). It also includes a great variety of geometric and naturalistic motifs arranged between multiple rows of horizontal lines. Other production centres are attested in the Kachi- Bolan, Zhob and Loralai regions. It is distributed from Southern Afghanistan to Central Balochistan.
