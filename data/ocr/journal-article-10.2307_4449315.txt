<plain_text><page sequence="1">Politics &amp; Prejudice Draws Dissent Dear Editor: After many years of absence from its rolls, I recently reestablished member- ship in NABT. I cannot, however, put into words how disappointed I am at one obvious trend in the organization. I am referring to the two-part piece by David R. Gilmore on dissection in the classroom ("Politics &amp; Prejudice: Dissection in Biology Education," April, May 1991). The antispeciesism arguments are purely political and emotional and have no foundation in fact. I am also disappointed that the NABT publication "The Responsible Use Of Animals In Biology Class- rooms" is so apologetic! What is the problem? The question is, of course, rhetorical, for I shall give you the answer. The ranks of biolo- gists are polluted with new, undered- ucated individuals who do not under- stand the very spirit of the discipline. We have, for example, replaced ecol- ogy with environmentalism, and, as another example, we have converted the study of heredity to too much of a look at the purely engineering feat of gene splicing. I suggest that every biology teacher re-read about the life of Pasteur. Where would we be had he been si- lenced by the 19th century antivivisec- tionists? The current animal rights move- ment has no foundation in science, and most of the movement's member- ship has little training in, or under- standing of, nature. More and more biology students (and, therefore, biol- ogy teachers) are coming under the influence of the movement. They are cowards all. Should NABT continue on this course, my reestablished association will be short-lived. NABT, you see, should stand for good science! Bob Ballantyne Boyertown High School Boyertown, Pennsylvania 19512 Dear Editor: Well, now I'm a "speciesist." I guess it was inevitable. I was a "religious fanatic" because I chose to attend a small, sectarian college instead of at- tending the state university. While there I was a "fascist" because I thought we should do all we could to win a war we were engaged in. I'm a "racist" because no people whose skin is a different color than mine live in the same neighborhood that I do, and I guess I'm a "sexist" because I still attend functions that only attract men. But a "speciesist"?; that's hard to swallow. David Gilmore, in his recent two- part argument, ("Politics &amp; Prejudice: Dissection in Biology Education," April, May 1991) proclaiming "specie- sism" as the domain of humans who "exploit nonhumans for their own ends," seems to me to have missed some of the basic ideas of living things that we have developed for some time now. Are the interrelationships that exist among species in various ecosystems exploitations of each other for individ- ual survival? Or are they the basic means by which species survive by taking advantage of the opportunities at hand? Because a species takes ad- vantage of what other organisms may provide for its survival makes it a "speciesist"? Or does it make it an interacting part of the ongoing process of survival? Why shouldn't humans take advan- tage of what other organisms can pro- vide for us? Would they be any less prone to take advantage of us? Would bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoans, worms, insects not infect us and make us their domicile, dining table or bou- doir if we didn't do everything we could to prevent them? Wouldn't plants overgrow our cultivated fields and prevent the production of food if we didn't control them? Wouldn't an- imals eat our crops if we did not pre- vent it? Where is the humane treat- ment by other, competing species out there who need the same things we do to survive? (Or even need to do us in for their survival?) Why should certain species be cho- sen for "humane treatment" and not others? Gilmore suggests that the question posed for deciding where "humane treatment" should be ap- plied is "Can they suffer?" Where on the continuum of life does "suffering" begin and end? Do only companion animals "suffer" because we ascribe anthropomorphic traits to them? (They "love" us.) Only domesticated species? Only those commonly used in the laboratory? Or do the skin mites in our oil glands "suffer" when we wash with alkaline soaps? (Do we stop washing?) Do nematodes "suffer" when we crush them while cultivating our garden? Do bean embryo cells "suffer" when we eat them alive on our salad? The ability to suffer implies the abil- ity to be aware. All of life must be aware in order to respond and sur- vive. How does a virus find just the right cell to infest? A worm the right organ to invade? A root the right di- rection in which to grow if it is not aware? Must nothing suffer? I posit that if nothing suffered then nothing else would survive. Gilmore says, "No matter what the nature of the being, the principle of equality requires that its suffering be counted equally with the like suffering of any other being." I agree. In that all spe- cies share equally. To suggest that dissection is an in- appropriate means of learning about how a system functions goes against one of our basic ways of knowing. To see how the parts fit together must be a first step to understanding how they function together. If we accept that life in all its manifestations is an expres- sion of the same unique system of substances that possesses the living condition, then where is the greater respect for dissecting some organisms but not others? Or would Gilmore also suggest that I not guide my students through the dissection of a bean seed, or a flower, an apple, or a carrot? By the time most students get to dissect anything in a biology course they have already studied many of the manifestations of life in great detail: that the activity that produces life is intricate, complicated, detailed and al- most incomprehensible-almost in- comprehensible, but not quite, be- cause they have started to understand it (this understanding includes the idea that living systems leave unliving accumulations of substances once life activity ceases); that death comes to all living things as a part of living and the nonliving body remains after death; that that body can provide further clues to an understanding of life. Gil- more says that dissection "sends stu- dents a mixed message ('revere life but cut apart a dead animal') and leads to the view that biology is the study of death, not life." I say not so. I say that a well inte- grated course in biology will help a student understand that all of life springs from the same origin, that all of life is continuing on in a struggle for continuity, that organisms make use LETTERS 327</page><page sequence="2">of each other in that struggle, that all of life is related, interrelated and inter- dependent. I say that when a student can dissect with at least a beginning understanding of what it took to pro- duce that organism, he will do it with respect, if not reverence. Roy K.
