<plain_text><page sequence="1">126 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF The intense view of these manifold contradictions and imperfections in human reason has so wrought upon me, and heated my brain, that I am ready to re- ject all belief and reasoning, and can look upon no opinion even as more probable or likely than another. Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and whose anger must I dread? What beings surround me? and on whom have I any influence, or who have any influence on me? I am con- founded with all these questions, and begin to fancy myself in the most de- plorable condition imaginable, inviron'd with the deepest darkness, and utterly depriv'd of the use of every member and faculty. Most fortunately it happens, that since reason is incapable of dispelling these clouds, nature herself suffices to that purpose, and cures me of this philosophical melancholy and delirium, either by relaxing this bent of mind, or by some avocation, and lively impression of my senses, which obliterate all these chimeras. I dine, I play a game of back-gammon, I con- verse, and am merry with my friends; and when after three or four hour's amusement, I wou'd return to these speculations, they appear so cold, and strain'd, and ridiculous, that I cannot find in my heart to enter into them any farther. -David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature I'm not so sure it's good to think back to my childhood memories, be- cause I end up feeling happy and sad at the same time, and that gives me a weird "neutral" feeling. Jack Handey, Fuzzy Memories N i ro concept plays a more central role in epistemology than the concept of belief. I offer here an account of what it is to believe a proposition. More precisely, what I am offering is an explica- dion in Rudolf Carnap's' sense: a precise successor concept that cap- tures significant features of our imprecise pretheoretic notion of belief. An explication is successful, Camap tells us, if the explicatum (the suc- cessor concept) is similar to the explicandum (the pretheoretic con- cept), characterizable in a precise and simple way, and fruitful in its application to theoretical problems. It is not required that the explica- tum cleave precisely to every nuance of usage associated with the expli- candum in everyday discourse; given the vagueness and fuzziness that infect most of the concepts expressible in ordinary language, it is often more useful to permit significant divergence from lay usage in order to achieve greater precision and simplicity.

Given these considerations, I want to make it clear from the outset that I am not attempting anything like an analysis of belief in the widest sense of the term; my discussion will be limited to a single particular aspect of the everyday concept. I am pursuing this strategy not because I regard other aspects of the concept as unimpor- tant, but because I think our overall understanding of belief will be best served by carving the concept at its joints, replacing it with several re- lated but distinct explicata designed to serve the various realms of theo- retical discourse in which we talk about belief. In order to get at the aspect of belief about which I want to talk, I shall begin by describing an important aspect that I intend to exclude. One of the most important ways in which we use the notion of belief in ordinary discourse, and certainly the way that has attracted the most philosophical attention in recent years, is as a component of our commonsensical psy- chological theories. We attribute beliefs to other people (and, signifi- cantly, to animals as well) in order to explain their past behavior and predict their future behavior. In other words, we often talk about beliefs as if they are psychological states that play a distinctive and significant role in the etiology of human and animal activities. As such, they are sim- ilar to the theoretical entities posited by other branches of empirical sci- ence in order to systematize and explain complex patterns of observable phenomena. If we approach the explication of belief from this perspec- tive, we shall be inclined to clarify our understanding of belief in the same way we clarify our understanding of other posits of empirical sci- ence, namely, by clarifying our understanding of the theoretical frame- work in which the concept is embedded. On this approach, we explicate belief by describing the psychological laws that govern the regular pat- terns of interaction between beliefs and other psychological states that are responsible for the production of behavior. Belief is defined in terms of the functional role it plays according to our best psychological theo- ries. Although the claim has been disputed, it is not implausible to think that such an analysis will make detailed reference to the cognitive archi- tecture that underlies human and animal psychological processes. We might, for example, end up characterizing the state of believing that p in terrms of the tokening of a sentence that states that p (in "mentalese," as it were) within a cognitive system designed to use such sentence tokens as data in computations that produce appropriate directives for behavior.2 2 See Jerry Fodor, The Language of Thought (New York: Crowell, 1975) for the classic defense of this approach, and Daniel C. Dennett, Brainstorms (Cambridge: MIT, 1978) for a powerful attack on the claim that theories of belief must be cashed out in terms of underlying cognitive architecture.</page><page sequence="3">128 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Without disputing the importance of this aspect of our concept of belief, I want to stress that such analyses do not exhaust the concept. The point is most readily seen if we look at first-person ascriptions of belief. As Bas C. van Fraassen3 notes, sentences of the form 'I believe that p' are often not comfortably read (in the first instance) as episodes of autobiographical description in which one attributes a psychological disposition to oneself. Such statements are more plau- sibly regarded as speech acts similar to the making of a promise or the declaration of an intention: by declaring that one believes that p, one undertakes certain normative commitments, commitments that govern how one ought to engage in future deliberation and inquiry if one intends to pursue these activities in good faith. Likewise, we often use third-person belief ascriptions not to offer a causal expla- nation of another's behavior but to indicate that the party in ques- tion is explicitly or implicitly committed to the truth of a proposition in the appropriate way. Philosophical epistemology, inasmuch as it is concerned with the appropriateness of various practices of delibera- tion and inquiry, is chiefly concerned with beliefs in this sense. Of course, the psychological and epistemological aspects of belief are not wholly independent; one can often infer much about the psycho- logical state of an individual from information about her epistemic commitments, and vice versa. But the two notions are clearly separa- ble; note that beliefs in the epistemic sense can be attributed to enti- ties, such as corporations and societies, that do not even have psychological properties in the ordinary sense.4 It is worth noting the work of two other authors who have drawn distinctions roughly parallel to the one I have sketched above. L. Jonathan Cohen5 defines acceptance of a proposition as voluntary adoption of a policy to use that proposition as a premise in one's reasoning. Similarly, Daniel C. Dennett defines opinions as the prod- uct of decisions to assent to sentences, roughly akin to gambles that those sentences are true (op. cit.). Both authors contrast these con- cepts with the notion of belief, where the latter is construed as some- thing like an involuntary psychological disposition to feel that a proposition is true and to behave accordingly. Neither acceptance nor opinion corresponds precisely to the epistemic sense of belief I am carving out. Cohen's concept is broader than mine; it includes, for example, the sort of commitment that a lawyer undertakes with " "Belief and the Will," this JouRNAL, LXXXI, 5 (May 1984): 235-56. 4 Margaret Gilbert, "Modelling Collective Belief," Synthese, LXXIII (1987): 185- 204, provides an illuminating analysis of this sort of group belief. 5 An Essay on Belief and Acceptance (New York: Oxford, 1992).</page><page sequence="4">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 129 respect to the innocence of his client or that a scientist undertakes with respect to an admittedly controversial but favored pet theory, commitments that I am reluctant to categorize as instances of gen- uine belief. For Dennett, opinion is necessarily a linguistic phenome- non, whereas I want to allow that an agent might be committed to more beliefs than are expressible in any given language. Neverthe- less, there are clearly important areas of overlap among these three notions, and much of what those authors have to say strikes me as true of, and relevant to, the analysis of the aspect of belief with which I am concerned. Dividing up the concept of belief in this way allows us to bypass some of the stumbling blocks that have plagued much philosophical discussion of the propositional attitudes. Chief among these is the specter of eliminativism. Folk psychology is an empirical theory; more- over, it is a theory of rather dubious intellectual heritage. In this re- spect, it resembles many of our other folk theories, such as the common-sense Aristotelian physics which, we all have to be taught in school, is wildly false in many aspects. So it is an open possibility that the progress of scientific psychology will result in the development of theoretical frameworks for the explanation and prediction of behavior which leave no room for entities like the beliefs we posit in our every- day psychological practice. It may well turn out, in other words, that beliefs (in the folk-psychological sense) just do not exist.6 Given this possibility, we might well fear that any philosophical analysis of belief will be as empty as an academic discussion of black magic or a treatise on the nature of phlogiston. As long as our attention is restricted to belief in its epistemic sense, however, such worries need not bother us. That individuals are capable of undertaking normative commitments to engage in deliberation and inquiry in certain ways is not a fact that is in imminent danger of being refuted by new developments in cogni- tive psychology. The structure of our epistemic practices is a matter of personal and cultural decision, not of our innate cognitive architec- ture; and as long as we find belief talk useful in the conduct of inquiry, we are entitled to preserve it as a central component of that conduct without fear of violating the dictates of good scientific practice. One author who has been persistently mistaken on this point is Paul M. Churchland.7 He is one of the most vocal defenders of elimi- nativism; he insists that the progress of neuroscience will soon force the displacement of our body of common-sense psychological con- 6 John D.

Moreover, he has argued that this revision will entail the ne- cessity of a parallel revision in the concepts that govern epistemology and the philosophy of science; once it becomes clear that there are not any beliefs in our heads, we shall be forced to reframe our meth- ods for evaluating deliberation and inquiry within the new theoreti- cal apparatus of neuroscience. He writes: Autonomy [of epistemology] must be denied because normative issues are never independent of factual matters.... We speak of justification, but we think of it as a feature of belief, and whether or not there are any be- liefs and what properties they have is a robustly factual matter. We speak of rationality, but we think of it as a feature of thinkers, and it is a substantive factual matter what thinkers are and what cognitive kine- matics they harbor. Normative concepts and normative convictions are thus always hostage to some background factual presuppositions, and these can always prove to be superficial, confused, or just plain wrong. If they are, then we may have to rethink whatever normative framework has been erected upon them. The lesson of the previous pages is that the time for this has already come (ibid., p. 196). But I do not see any reason to think that the concepts Churchland mentions, in the sense in which those concepts are employed in epis- temology, embody any controversial factual assumptions at all. Again, it is simply not in the cards that neuroscience might one day convince us that there is something ill founded or incoherent about the practice of committing oneself to the truth of a proposition, any more than it is a possibility that developments in quantum physics will force us to conclude that no one has ever actually made a promise. This is not to say that scientific psychology can make no contribution to epistemology. We are not bound to our present con- ceptual system; we are free to revise it in any way that strikes us as useful, and neuroscience is as good a source as any for inspiring new developments. But the criterion for revision is usefulness with re- spect to our purposes as we conceive them, not faithfulness to some scientistic ideal. Until Churchland has some genuine suggestions about how to use the concepts of neuroscience to improve our prac- tices of evaluating deliberation and inquiry, and not just a sketch of a utopian program that insists that such improvements are forthcom- ing, we need not worry that our discussions of belief are in imminent danger of being rendered obsolete. Carving up belief in this way also affects the position we ought to take on the acceptability of various putative normative principles that govern the adoption and revision of one's beliefs. For present purposes, the most important such maxim is the principle of deduc-</page><page sequence="6">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 131 tive cogency. According to this rule, one ought to believe all of the deductive consequences of any set of propositions all of which one believes; furthermore, one ought not believe any contradictory set of propositions. How plausible is this normative claim? If we are think- ing of beliefs as something like sentences stored in the brain, not plausible at all. Gilbert Harman8 is surely right in maintaining that a well-designed cognitive system will embody a policy of clutter avoid- ance: such a system will not waste valuable time, storage space, and resources generating complicated tautological consequences of sen- tences already stored or testing sets of stored sentences for mutual compatibility. If, however, we are thinking of beliefs as epistemic commitments, the situation is reversed. It is no difficult feat to un- dertake even an infinite number of commitments all in one stroke; all it takes is a simple act of will. There is, of course, no normative re- quirement that one keep an explicit record of all one's commit- ments, nor that one be able to enumerate those commitments upon demand, nor that one be able in all cases to recognize spontaneously that one has violated those commitments. All that is required is that one not knowingly regard a violation of one's commitments with equanimity: if one is made aware that one has violated one's own commitments, one must change either one's practice or one's com- mitments to remain in good faith. Given this perspective, it seems entirely reasonable to postulate that an agent must believe any proposition that is implied by that agent's other beliefs. Thus, in what follows, I shall typically assume that an agent's beliefs can be represented by a single (nonempty) proposition. This proposition, the agent's corpus, is the conjunction of all of the propositions be- lieved by the agent; the agent's beliefs are all and only the deductive consequences of the corpus. One more remark with respect to clarification of the explican- dum, and we shall be ready to proceed. We sometimes think of be- liefs as relations to sentences, sometimes as relations to propositions, and sometimes as relations to both at once. In what follows, I shall in general regard beliefs as purely propositional attitudes. The intuitive picture I have in mind is something like the following: the epistemic agent is confronted with a space of logical possibilities. (For present purposes, it does not matter to me whether these possibilities are possible worlds, possible individuals,9 or some other sort of entity.) The agent's apprehension of these possibilities is, as it were, direct; it 8 Change in View (Cambridge: MIT, 1986). 9 See David Lewis, "Attitudes De Dicto and De Se," Philosophical Review, LXXXVIII (October 1979): 51343.</page><page sequence="7">132 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY is not mediated by some form of linguistic or pictorial representa- tion. (An idealization of our own epistemic situation, to be sure; but not a dangerous one, and close enough to the truth to suit our pur- poses for a wide variety of cases.) The epistemic task that the agent faces is the division of the possibility space into two subspaces: one consisting of possibilities included in the corpus, the other of possi- bilities excluded by the corpus. If we define propositions to be sub- sets of the set of possibilities, then the agent's beliefs will be just those regions of the possibility space which include the corpus as a (perhaps improper) subregion. Note that this way of thinking of be- lief makes it problematic to talk about some familiar cases of belief. Logical beliefs-beliefs about which sentences in a language express the necessary proposition (the entire possibility space) and which ex- press the contradictory proposition (the empty set)-are not com- fortably representable in this system; nor are modal beliefs-beliefs about the structure and content of the possibility space. (I take it that mathematical beliefs by and large fall into one of these cate- gories.) I am uncertain what modifications would be required to al- low my analysis to accommodate these types of belief. Nevertheless, my explication is still valuable as an account of that category of belief most central to our primary epistemic activities, namely, empirical beliefs about the way the world actually is.'0 I I hope I have said enough at this point to give you a reasonable sense of what concept I am attempting to explicate. Let us turn, then, to the explicatum. In terms of what other concepts is it appro- priate to characterize the nature of epistemic belief? My proposal is that the central notion we need is serious possibility, a concept that plays a major role in the philosophy of Isaac Levi." I shall be dis- cussing Levi's views at some length, primarily because his position serves as a useful foil to my own. He, like me, thinks that the concept of belief can be illuminated through explication in terms of serious possibility; his analysis, however, differs from mine in significant and instructive respects. The concept of serious possibility, while presumably not wholly unfamiliar, is not as familiar and central as the concept of belief. I take it, though, that this poses no difficulty for the explication of the latter in terms of the former; the philosophical value of analyses that '?

In introducing the concept, I can do no better than to quote Levi directly: When witnessing the toss of a coin, Xwill normally envisage as possibly true the hypotheses that the coin will land heads up and that it will land tails up. He may also envisage other possibilities-e.g., its landing on its edge. However, if he takes for granted even the crudest folklore of mod- em physics, he will rule out as impossible the coin's moving upward to outer space in the direction of Alpha Centauri. He will also rule out the hypothesis that the Earth will explode. Of course, it is logically possible that the coin will fly out towards Al- pha Centauri upon tossing and even that the Earth will explode under these conditions. But this means only that if X were in that (different) cognitive state wherein his standard for serious possibility consists exclu- sively of logical truths, these hypotheses would be serious possibilities according to X... Logically possible though these hypotheses may be, X both would and should ignore them because they are not seriously possible from his point of view.... The distinction between logical possibilities which are serious and those which are not is important in scientific inquiry as well as practical deliberation. When devising hypotheses about the constitution of quasars, no one considers the logical possibility that they are conglom- erations of drosophilia flies to be a serious possibility. In designing ex- periments, one takes into account only those hypotheses as to the outcome which are serious possibilities."2 In other words, to regard a proposition as seriously possible is to adopt a policy of allowing that proposition to play a significant role in one's practical and theoretical deliberations, that is, to give the logical possibility that the proposition is true some nonnegligible weight in determining the outcome of one's decisions. By contrast, a proposition that is ruled out as not seriously possible has no impact on the conduct of inquiry; an agent who takes a proposition to be se- riously impossible will follow just the same course of reasoning and decision making as an (otherwise identical) agent for whom that proposition does not lie within the space of logical possibilities at all. Levi assumes that a rational inquirer will, at any given time, be committed to a single standard for serious possibility, that is, a divi- sion of the logical possibility space into two regions, one containing those logical possibilities which are taken seriously and the other con- 12 TheEnterprise of Knowledge, pp. 3-5.</page><page sequence="9">134 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY taining those possibilities which are ruled out. In other words, the standard for serious possibility can be represented by a single propo- sition, namely, the proposition that contains all and only those possi- bilities which are serious. Propositions that are entailed by the standard (that is, which contain it as a subset) are seriously necessary; propositions that are compatible with the standard (that is, which overlap it) are seriously possible; and propositions that are disjoint from the standard are seriously impossible. It is easy to see that the se- riously necessary propositions are subject to the requirement of de- ductive cogency. If this model of serious possibility strikes one as similar to the model of belief in terms of the selection of a corpus proposition, this is no accident. For on Levi's account, an agent's cor- pus and standard for serious possibility will be one and the same proposition. This is the core of Levi's analysis of belief: to believe a proposition is to regard it as seriously necessary, that is, to rule out al- ternatives to that proposition as not seriously possible. For Levi, judg- ments of believability and judgments of serious possibility coincide.'3 On first inspection, Levi's proposal may seem to have much to rec- ommend it. After all, there is surely something right about the idea that to believe a proposition is to cease to regard alternatives to that proposition as serious candidates for the truth. Further reflection, however, reveals some disturbing consequences of Levi's develop- ment of this idea. Do we really want to say that a rational inquirer ought tiever to allow the course of her deliberation to be swayed by consideration of the possibility that propositions she believes to be false might nevertheless be true? To give an affirmative answer to this question is to adopt a position of infallibilism, that is, to maintain that one ought to regard all of one's beliefs as certainly and infallibly correct. Levi clearly recognizes this consequence of his position; in- deed, he regards it as a central feature of his analysis. He writes: An immediate consequence of the thesis that X's corpus at [time] t serves as his standard for serious possibility at t is that, according to X at t, no item in his corpus at t is possibly false in the sense of serious possi- bility. If h C KX [X's corpus at t], then h is infallibly true according to X at t in a straightforward and important sense. Thus if Y should disagree with X at t, from X's point of view, Yis certainly in error. It would be in- " In The Enterprise of Knowledge, the concept he takes himself to be explicating is knowledge, not belief. But his remarks about this concept make it clear that he is considering knowledge ascriptions from a first-person point of view, a perspective from which knowledge collapses into belief. This reading of Levi is borne out by the fact that in The Fixation of Belief, he switches terminology from knowledge to be- lief without altering the analysis.</page><page sequence="10">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 135 consistent for X to concede to Y that he (X) might be mistaken if by this Xacknowledges the falsity of h as a serious possibility. Of course, X may consistently acknowledge that items he accepted in his corpus at previous times or will assume in the future are possibly false. He is not committed to the view that whatever he has endorsed in the past or will accept as evidence in the future is infallibly true. But at t, X is committed to the view that whatever he assumes as part of his cor- pus at t is infallibly true.'4 But I take this consequence to be deeply troubling. Most of us, I think, are inclined to adopt a position of fallibilism with respect to our own beliefs; we are willing to concede that there is some non- negligible likelihood that some of our opinions are mistaken. At minimum, I take it that most of us will allow that fallibilism is at least a coherent position which a rational agent may adopt. The argument for fallibilism is the simple argument from humility and mortal im- perfection: I take it for granted that virtually everyone I know has some false beliefs, and I regard it as almost certain that the belief sys- tems of most of the people alive in previous eras were wildly false with respect to nearly every question of intellectual significance. Why should I exempt myself from the obvious inductive conclusion? Like- wise, as Levi grants, we generally take seriously the possibility that our past or future belief corpuses contained errors. But there is nothing epistemically privileged about my present position, so there seems to be no reason why I should not take just as seriously the pos- sibility that my present corpus is erroneous in certain respects. We can confirm that the rationality of fallibilism is supported by our intuitions by considering the judgments we are inclined to make with respect to certain practical decision problems. This point is usu- ally made via reference to a wager at incredibly high stakes. Consider some proposition I believe to be true-for example, the proposition that Millard Fillmore was born on January 7. Suppose that someone offers me the following bet: if this proposition is true, I shall receive a prize of almost but not entirely negligible worth, such as a two-for- one coupon from Burger King; if, on the other hand, the proposi- tion is false, I shall incur a penalty of massive disutility, such as an excrutiatingly painful and permanently disfiguring regimen of physi- cal torture. On Levi's infallibilist account, I am rationally compelled to accept this wager. This is because, from his perspective, I must re- gard the falsehood of the proposition in question as not seriously possible; hence, contemplation of the possibility that I shall incur 14 TheEnprise of Knowledge, p. 13.</page><page sequence="11">136 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the penalty, however undesirable that consequence seems to me, can play no significant role in my decision. The only factor that ratio- nally matters is the small net profit I regard myself as certain to gain. But I feel fairly confident that most of us do not share this judgment. Surely, it is rationally permissible to reject the wager. This conclu- sion, however, can only be justified if we allow that I give serious con- sideration to the possibility that I shall lose the wager if I take it. Some philosophers have questioned the cogency of this form of argument, suggesting that the introduction of utilities and disutilities of extraordinary magnitude can have a distorting effect on our intu- itions. Therefore, I think it is worth reinforcing the point by consid- ering a class of decision problems that have been less widely discussed in the philosophical literature. These cases, which revolve around the phenomenon of hedging one's bets, also demonstrate the rationality of fallibilism, but do so without introducing ex- treme utilities. An example: suppose that I am a contestant on ajeop- ardy-style television quiz show. I have amassed a bankroll of eight thousand dollars so far in the competition, and I now have an oppor- tunity to wager some or all of this sum on my ability to answer the question: "On what date was Millard Fillmore born?" Recall that I be- lieve that Millard Fillmore was born on January 7. Levi's system, then, entails that there is exactly one rational course of action avail- able to me, namely, wagering the entire eight thousand dollars. The reasoning is the same as above: since it is not seriously possible that my answer to the question will be incorrect, considerations of poten- tial loss ought to play no role in my decision, and I am compelled to choose the option that maximizes my potential profit. Once again, however, this judgment appears to violate our intuitions. Most of us would grant that it is rationally permissible for me to wager less than my full bankroll, reserving some of my money as insurance against the possibility that my answer will turn out to be wrong. Again, this response only makes sense on the assumption that I take the false- hood of my belief to be a possibility worthy of serious consideration. The result holds even though nothing of particularly momentous importance hangs on the outcome of my decision. Infallibilism is also problematic with respect to purely theoretical deliberation as well as practical decision making. To take just one ex- ample, consider the long history of philosophical debates over skep- ticism in its various manifestations. To be sure, a number of distinct doctrines, questions, and confusions have been subsumed under the label of "skepticism." It seems unproblematic, however, to make the claim that at least one of the issues that have played a significant role</page><page sequence="12">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 137 in the debate over skepticism is the question of how seriously to take the possibility that most or all of our beliefs in a given domain are radically false. Different thinkers have staked out different positions on this question. To enter seriously into the debate over skepticism at all, however, it seems necessary to presuppose that it is at least conceivable that one could take skeptical hypotheses seriously. Skep- ticism can only be a serious philosophical issue if it is not the case that the nature of belief rules out as conceptually incoherent the act of seriously doubting that one's own beliefs are true. To adopt Levi's infallibilist analysis of belief, then, is effectively to dissolve the entire question of skepticism. But this move cannot be acceptable to any philosopher who regards the issue of the rational force of skeptical hypotheses to be a serious and open question. Since I rank among these philosophers, I cannot find Levi's account acceptable. But the most serious challenge facing infallibilism is the worry that it collapses into incorngibilism. Most of us, Levi included, take inquiry to be a rational activity. That is, we take it that we may rationally en- gage in intellectual pursuits that are designed to produce revisions in our belief systems; we actively seek out new evidence and engage in arguments with opponents in the knowledge that such activities are likely to cause us to discard some of our present beliefs and re- place them with new ones. We adopt a position of corigibilism with respect to our present beliefs. The question that faces us is: Can an infallibilist such as Levi coherently endorse corrigibilism? On the face of it, the answer seems to be negative. If I genuinely rule out al- ternatives to my present beliefs as not seriously possible, then the only appropriate methodology for me to adopt seems to be what C. S. Peirce called the method of tenacity: I ought actively to avoid any ex- posure to new experimental results, new arguments, or anything else that might lead me to revise my beliefs. After all, my present beliefs are certainly true, while the beliefs of my opponents have no possi- bility of being true; so any process that causes me to abandon my be- liefs and adopt theirs must rely on some form of trickery or deception. Unless I regard my own beliefs as possibly false, inquiry seems to be pointless at best, dangerous at worst. Incorrigibilism is the only tenable response. Levi takes the incorrigibilist challenge very seriously; he devotes a good deal of effort to its resolution. But the solution he arrives at is, I think, ultimately indefensible. Levi grants that it is indeed irra- tional for an agent to decide to shift directly from belief in a proposition p to belief in its negation -'p; from the perspective of the agent prior to the shift, such a move represents deliberate</page><page sequence="13">138 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY abandonment of certain correctness in favor of certain error, and is thus to be avoided at all costs. He argues, however, that such a shift may be justified if it is carried out indirectly as the net product of two smaller changes. First, the agent suspends judgment be- tween p and -p. Since this involves only the abandonment of a prior belief, not the adoption of a new belief, such a move will not result in the importation of certain error into the agent's corpus and is therefore not automatically disqualified. After this shift, the agent will judge serious possibility from a new epistemic perspec- tive such that -np is now regarded as a serious possibility. Thus, the agent will no longer regard the addition of -p to the corpus as problematic, since she is no longer infallibly certain that it is false. What cannot rationally be accomplished in one fell swoop may be undertaken incrementally. One might question, however, the reasonability of the first of the two shorter steps, in which the agent contracts her corpus to exclude p. Granted, such a move does not import any falsehoods into the cor- pus, but it does result in the loss of a certainly true piece of knowl- edge. Why should the agent willingly sacrifice information in this way? Levi suggests that the loss may be compensated by the gain of other epistemic virtues: Suppose the initial corpus contains some theory T1. A second theory T2 contradicts T1. From Xs initial point of view, T2 is certainly false. Yet it may be superior in all other respects to T, as a means for furnishing sys- tematic explanations in some domain. X could recognize the superior explanatory virtues of statistical mechanics even though he is certain that it is false and that classical thermodynamics is true. In such cases, X might be prepared to suffer a loss of infonnation due to the removal of T1 from his corpus in order to be in a position to take the truth of T2 to be seriously possible. In that event, X exchanges a given amount of information for the opportunity to give an informa- tionally attractive hypothesis a hearing. To contract in this case is not to reject T1 as false and to accept T2 as true but to shift to a position where judgment is suspended between the rival hypotheses so that investigation can be undertaken to decide whether T1 should be reinstated via inferential expansion or T2 should take T,'s place (ibid., p. 60). But the suggestion is inadequate as it stands. Ordinarily, we do not take the superior explanatory virtues of a theory to provide sufficient reason by themselves for giving that theory a fair hearing. Consider, for example, an ancient cosmology that subsumes a wide variety of natural phenomena under a handful of simple explanatory schemas,</page><page sequence="14">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 139 most of which refer to the behavioral dispositions of a small group of anthropomorphic beings of vast power whose psychological traits are antecedently specified. There is no question that such theories can have significant explanatory power. Someone equipped with a good working knowledge of contemporary science could probably devise a new pantheon of deities whose activities could serve as the basis of an even more comprehensive and accurate explanatory system. Simi- lar remarks could be made about various folk legends, science fic- tion stories, astrological and numerological systems, and a vast array of other theories of dubious repute. Why do we not waste our time giving theories such as these a proper hearing? From my perspective, a simple answer can be given: I am unwilling to suspend judgment with respect to the truth of, say, Babylonian mythology, despite its explanatory power, because I do not regard the truth of Babylonian mythology as a serious possibility. There are other scientific hypothe- ses, such as the existence of cold fusion, which I believe to be false but which I nevertheless regard as seriously possible; inquiry con- cerning these hypotheses strikes me as worthwhile in a way that re- search seeking to establish the truth of Babylonian mythology does not. But Levi, of course, cannot draw these distinctions. For him, all alternatives to one's present beliefs are seriously impossible; hence there is no ranking them with respect to comparative plausibility. Ab- sent such plausibility judgments, Levi owes us an account of how to distinguish between those certainly false hypotheses which deserve serious consideration and those certainly false hypotheses which are just plain silly. An even more serious problem faces Levi's two-stage account, however. Consider the position of an agent trying to decide whether or not to drop her belief in p in order to give -p a fair hearing. Such an agent presumably ought to take into account all of the foresee- able consequences of the available options. But suppose it is clear to the agent that, if she comes to regard -,p as seriously possible, she will take its other virtues (such as superior explanatory power) to provide sufficient reason to add -'p to her corpus. In other words, she knows from the outset that taking the supposedly innocuous first step of the sequence will yield the same net result as shifting directly from belief in p to belief in -p. Under such circumstances, it seems clear that the agent ought to eschew the proposed belief contraction for the same reason that she rejects the direct shift: such a decision will ultimately result in the abandonment of certain truth for certain error. Dividing the process into two steps becomes a mere formal trick which in no way alters the incorrigibilist conclusion.</page><page sequence="15">140 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Levi's response to this challenge is somewhat curious. He stakes out a position that he calls secular realism, a position that denies cru- cial assumptions about the goals of inquiry that motivate the above challenge: According to secular realism, the inquiring agent is committed to maxi- mal certainty about the truth of the assumptions in his current corpus. He is concerned, moreover, to avoid error in the next alteration he makes in that corpus, where error is judged on the assumption that everything in the current corpus is true. Of course, the agent can recog- nize that in making changes in the current corpus, he might and proba- bly will end up several stages down the chain of belief revision, becoming certain of claims he currently is certain are false. But as a sec- ular realist, he is not concerned with the possibility that his beliefs sev- eral stages down the chain will be false as he currently judges truth and falsity. He is not concerned with progress toward the true, complete story, but only with avoiding error at the next step.'5 Levi argues for secular realism largely by contrasting it with an al- ternative position he calls messianic realism, a thesis that he identifies with the epistemological outlooks of Peirce and Karl Popper. Ac- cording to messianic realism, "truth is a regulative ideal directing us toward the End of Days, when inquirers will have attained the true, complete story" (ibid., p. 164). Messianic realists are thus concerned with the avoidance of error not just at the next stage of inquiry, but at all subsequent stages as well, or perhaps just at some ultimate stage when science will have converged on the ideal "theory of every- thing." Levi heaps derision on messianic realism, and he suggests that messianic realists can give no account of the role of truth seek- ing and error avoidance in proximate and short-term inquiry (al- though his argument for this conclusion is obscure to me). At any rate, the contrast Levi offers us is a false one; we need not saddle ourselves with the messianic position in order to recognize that there is something wrong with secular realism. We might, for ex- ample, stake out an intermediate position-presbyterian realism seems an appropriate name-which makes no claims at all about the end of days or the ultimate goals of science, but which holds that avoid- ance of error is a desideratum in inquiry not just at the next stage, but also at those stages in the immediate future whose outcomes are foreseeable with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Presbyterian realism supports the assumption that underlies the incorrigibilist challenge to infallibilism, namely, that there is no real epistemic dis- 5 The Fixation of Belief and Its Undoing, p. 163.</page><page sequence="16">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 141 tinction between a one-step and a two-step importation of error into one's corpus. In light of the availability of this position, what we re- quire from Levi is not more invective against messianic science wor- ship, but a general argument that the peculiar form of intellectual myopia he recommends really is a rational approach to inquiry. And such an argument does not seem to be forthcoming. Certainly, secu- lar realism cannot be derived from a general prohibition against tak- ing future belief revisions into consideration in the course of one's deliberations. Suppose, for example, that I am offered a potent drug, the ingestion of which will cause me a good deal of immediate pleasure, but which will lead some weeks from now to the develop- ment of a susceptibility to suggestions that I can safely leap from tall buildings, stop trains with my bare hands, and so forth. Without a doubt, it is rational for me to refuse this drug precisely because it will eventually cause me to adopt beliefs I now regard as dangerously false. So in the general case, rational decision making requires me to consider the effect of my decisions on belief revisions other than the most proximate one. Why should this requirement disappear when the decision in question is epistemic rather than practical? Levi's only real argument is that secular realism is required in order to rec- oncile infallibilism with corrigibilism. To which I can only reply: so much the worse for infallibilism. II Levi's account of the relationship between belief and judgments of serious possibility is clearly untenable. Nevertheless, as I have already indicated, the basic intuition that what one believes is ultimately a matter of what one regards as seriously possible deserves serious at- tention. It is time for me to put my cards on the table and spell out my own proposal about the real relationship between one's corpus and one's possibility standard. As a first step toward the proposed explication, I want to focus our attention on a particular autobiographical example. As I have men- tioned before, among the propositions I believe is the proposition that Millard Fillmore was born on January 7. What is my attitude to- ward this proposition with respect to my judgments of serious possi- bility? As I reflect on this question, I find that my opinion on the matter exhibits a genuine instability. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, as it were, I am inclined to regard the proposition as seri- ously necessary. January 7 is Millard Fillmore's birthday, after all; there is no real controversy on the matter, and no real reason to speculate about the possibility that other dates might be more cor- rect. The issue is settled, and deliberating further on it is just point-</page><page sequence="17">142 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY less. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, on the other hand, I am inclined to allow that there are genuine grounds for doubt as to the correctness of my belief. Consider: my only evidence for taking January 7 to be Fillmore's birthday is an article I read in the World Book Encyclopedia nearly fifteen years ago. But my memory is not per- fect; neither is the editorial staff at the World Book. I have had plenty of beliefs in the past which were much better supported than this one but which ultimately turned out to be false. So when I am in this frame of mind, I am inclined to regard alternatives to January 7 as serious candidates for Fillmore's actual birthday. What are we to make of this instability? From Levi's perspective, the appropriate thing to say is that, contrary to my initial claim, I do not really have an opinion on the matter of Fillmore's birthday. Rather, I have two opinions, and a tendency to vacillate between them at distressingly frequent intervals. I am perpetually adding the belief that Fillmore was born on January 7 to my corpus, only to turn around and reject this belief once again. But this description just does not seem to me to be true to the facts or to our ordinary way of talking about these matters. My vacillation on this question does not strike me as of a piece with the genuine changes of mind I periodi- cally undergo, such as when I acquire new information or accept the consequences of a novel argument. Rather, it seems to me that both of my stances on this issue are partial reflections of a single deeper state of opinion, a state which has remained fairly stable over the last fifteen years, my vacillations notwithstanding. Psychological factors, such as the immediate salience of certain facts or arguments, may make one facet of that opinion strike me as momentarily com- pelling; but if I step back from these distorting factors and enter a more self-reflective state, I find myself partially identifying with both judgments simultaneously. The phenomenon of epistemic ambivalence that I am describing has been identified and discussed by a number of philosophers of note. The epigraph from Hume with which I began this discussion represents a good example. Hume's position on philosophical skep- ticism seems to be that we are all naturally inclined to regard skepti- cal theses with the same ambivalence I have described myself as adopting toward the Fillmore question. Within the confines of the study, confronted with the full force of skeptical arguments, we are driven to adopt extremely broad standards for serious possibility, feeling ourselves at a loss to rule out anything whatsoever with any certainty. As soon as we change our immediate surroundings and thus our psychological set, however, we find it extremely difficult to</page><page sequence="18">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 143 take seriously the possibilities that gripped us before. The change is not driven by new evidence or superior reasoning; Hume does not think that skepticism can be dispelled by these means. It is driven in- stead by a mere shift in context, one that makes certain features of our judgments more immediately salient than others. Likewise, Peirce in his defense of fallibilism seems committed to something like this picture of ambivalence. On Peirce's extreme version of falli- bilism, the scientific spirit requires that we never rule out any option at all as a serious possibility. To this extent, theoretical science is the enemy of practical deliberation, which requires that we rule out many logical possibilities in order to motivate immediate decisions to pursue courses of action. Yet Peirce allows that one and the same agent may inhabit the worlds of science and of practical affairs simul- taneously, and presumably may do so without lapsing into bad faith with respect to one's epistemic commitments. Thus Peirce, like Hume, seems implicitly committed to the view that we may simulta- neously hold different standards for serious possibility, some of which are more salient in purely theoretical reasoning and some of which present themselves most prominently in practical contexts. Epistemic ambivalence also shares important features with emo- tional ambivalence, a phenomenon that has been given an insightful treatment by Patricia S. Greenspan."6 She writes, [W]e may be said to have or exhibit a particular emotion (and indeed, I might add, to exhibit it consciously) over a span of time which includes, but is not limited to, the times (supposing there are some) when I am actually experiencing it. Thus, if I waver, over time, between happy and unhappy feelings about my rival's victory (I momentarily feel bad when I first hear the news on the phone, say; but then I immediately consider my friend's good fortune and momentarily feel good), we would rea- sonably conclude that I have "mixed feelings" throughout the overall time span involved, and not that I am continually changing my mind (ibid., p. 229). Exactly similarly, I want to suggest that I am at least partly committed to the view that Fillmore's birthday's being on January 7 is seriously necessary even during the periods of time when I do not find this view immediately compelling (and likewise for the view that other dates are seriously possible). It is this partial commitment which coit- stitutes my belief that Fillmore was born on January 7. Just as my sta- ble emotional state transcends the vagaries of my momentary 16 "A Case of Mixed Feelings: Ambivalence and the Logic of Emotion," in Amelie Oksenberg Rorty, ed., ExplainingEmotions (Berkeley: California UP, 1980).</page><page sequence="19">144 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY experience, belief is a state of opinion that transcends the vagaries of my momentary psychological set. I do not believe a given proposi- tion only during those moments in which I hold it with firm and ab- solute conviction, eschewing as patently false all alternatives; I can continue to believe a proposition even as I cycle through moments of certainty and doubt, of trust and skepticism. Consider the game show example once again: if I decide not to bet my entire bankroll on my ability to state Millard Fillmore's birthday correctly, this does not mean that I have suddenly ceased to believe that Fillmore was born on January 7. It merely means that the salient features of my immediate circumstances make me find the skeptical facets of my underlying opinion more compelling than the dogmatic facets. What all this suggests is that my state of opinion with respect to judgment of serious possibility is not adequately represented by a single standard that divides up the possibilities into just two cate- gories; my judgments exhibit a more finely detailed internal struc- ture than this model allows. We do better by supposing that I am committed to a set of propositions, each representing a standard of serious possibility with which I am willing to partially identify. Pick- ing out this set, that is, identifying those judgments to which I am ac- tually committed, requires a certain degree of mental discipline, since in general it requires me to step outside my momentary frame of mind, ignoring the contingencies of my psychological set which may be driving me to identify with a restricted subset of the available standards, in order to recognize the broader range of opinions that I am willing to call my own. It is no part of my account to claim that we are always, or even often, in a position to carry out this sort of self-transcendent reflection. Our relationship to these standards is the same as our relationship to all of our normative commitments: inasmuch as our limited capacities allow us to perceive clearly what obligations we are committed to, good faith requires us to carry out these obligations as best as we can, as judged by our own lights. In connection with this last point, it is imperative that I clear up a possible confusion that my discussion up to this point has (to some extent deliberately) fostered. In order to identify clear exam- ples of epistemic ambivalence, I have focused on cases in which two different states of opinion were each made psychologically salient in a given set of circumstances. But I do not wish to claim that such psychological immediacy is either a necessary or a sufficient condi- tion for partially identifying with a given state of opinion. There may, for example, be standards for serious possibility that I recog- nize upon reflection as acceptable to me, even though there is no</page><page sequence="20">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 145 conceivable context I could find myself in within which those stan- dards would strike me as more compelling than other standards with which I also identify. Likewise, I may make immediate judg- ments of serious possibility which momentarily grip me, but which from a position of self-reflection I decide not to incorporate into my stable epistemic commitments. Consider, for example, cases of per- ceptual illusion. I look at the line drawing, and am immediately gripped by the judgment that the top line is longer than the bottom one. This is a persistent disposition of mine; I have the same reaction time and time again, even though I have measured the lines several times and always found them to be of equal length. Still, there is no state of opinion with which I identify which renders it seriously possi- ble that the lines do actually diverge in length; from a position of self-reflection, I recognize that I am being tricked and thus refuse to identify with my immediate judgment. Similar phenomena include irrational fears (for example, I am momentarily convinced that the small yapping dog poses a real threat to my well-being) and persis- tent undesirable biases (for example, I see a member of another racial group whom I know to be a solid citizen of the community, but am still momentarily gripped by the serious possibility that he will attempt to rob me). The point is the same as that made above: our concern here is with my epistemic commitments, as determined by the decisions I make from a position of reflective self-awareness, and not with my psychological dispositions to produce certain judg- ments given certain stimuli. The latter may be interesting to us in that they may provide some evidence about what we are committed to, but they are not to be confused with such commitments. Levi, as one might expect, rejects the idea that a rational agent might exhibit ambivalence among multiple standards for serious possibility. He writes: Observe, however, that one and the same person may belong to different communities each of which has its own goals and values and each of which may have different and sometimes conflicting standards for seri- ous possibility.... Insofar as X finds himself in this predicament, he may be committed to a cognitive schizophrenia embracing different standards for serious pos- sibility corresponding to his diverse roles.... It is no doubt neither psychologically nor socially feasible to remove all inconsistency or schizophrenia. But insofar as it is feasible to do so, all agents, whether they are individual persons or communities, should commit themselves to single consistent standards for serious possibility.</page><page sequence="21">146 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY When inconsistency arises, as it inevitably will, and when it is detected, steps should be taken to eliminate it.'7 But there does not seem to be any argument here, just dogmatism. Levi's charge of inconsistency is unfounded; the agents he describes are not committed to a single inconsistent standard for serious possi- bility, but are undecided between a range of incompatible standards for serious possibility. The former is clearly irrational; but there is nothing at all obviously wrong with the latter. As for his charge of schizophrenia, this seems to be nothing more than a terminological dispute: Levi chooses to pin a pejorative term on a phenomenon that I am inclined to describe more neutrally as "ambivalence." If the difference between us amounts to nothing more than this, then Levi's name calling is surely insufficient to undermine the prima fa- cie case I have made above for the rationality of ambivalence with re- spect to one's possibility judgments. At any rate, most of the disagreement between Levi and me on this point can be dissolved through a harmless shift in vocabulary. We can, if we wish, take the disjunction (union) of all of the stan- dards for serious possibility which are reflected in my opinion; call this proposition the minimal standard. Those propositions entailed by the minimal standard are just those which all of the opinions I iden- tify with regard as seriously necessary; those propositions compatible with the minimal standard are just those which are regarded as seri- ously possible by at least one of the opinions with which I identify; and those which are incompatible with the minimal standard are just those which I always regard as seriously impossible. So the minimal standard functions in precisely the same way as Levi's univocal stan- dard for serious possibility. Thus, if Levi insists that rational agents are always committed to a single standard for serious possibility, we need not demur. We can simply identify his concept of serious possi- bility with our concept of possibility according to the minimal stan- dard, that is, serious possibility with respect to at least one standard in the set. We can reclassify my analysis as an account of ambivalence with respect to some stronger epistemic notion, say, "quasi-serious possibility" or "contextual serious possibility." This relabeling leaves intact a substantial point of disagreement between Levi and me, however. This is, of course, the question of the relationship between serious possibility and belief. On the account I am offering, one's beliefs will not be limited to those propositions which are entailed by the minimal standard, that is, those proposi- '7 TheEnterpise of Knowledge, pp. 17-18.</page><page sequence="22">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 147 tions which are regarded as seriously necessary according to all of the standards for (quasi-) serious possibility with which I identify. Re- flection on cases such as the Millard Fillmore example has, I hope, convinced you that a large class of our beliefs-call them the fallible beliefs-are regarded as possibly false according to some of the opin- ions we find acceptable. (Nothing I have said is meant to rule out the possibility that one might also have infallible beliefs, beliefs whose truth is regarded as seriously necessary by all acceptable standards. I claim only that these beliefs do not exhaust the range of the concept under analysis.) Still, this much of Levi's view seems to be true: for any proposition I believe, that proposition must be regarded as seriously necessary according to at least one standard for serious pos- sibility I accept. I must be able, at least in some epistemic circum- stances, to maintain a judgment of total certainty in the truth of that proposition in order to count myself as believing it. Furthermore, there must not be any standard I identify with which classifies the proposition as seriously impossible. If my opinion is so ambivalent as to allow me to potentially regard a proposition as either certainly true or certainly false, then I am best described as in a state of sus- pended judgment with respect to that proposition. Summarizing the results of this section, we have arrived at the following necessary con- dition for belief: X believes p only if, where S is the set of standards for serious possibility with which X identifies, p is seriously necessary with respect to some s in S and is seriously possible with respect to all s in S. III It would be nice if the necessary condition for belief we have discov- ered turned out to be a sufficient condition as well. If that were the case, we could pack up and go home now. Unfortunately, things do not turn out to be that simple. In the general case, it is possible sometimes to regard a proposition as seriously necessary and always regard it as seriously possible without believing that proposition. An example: suppose that in a forthcoming election, the three front-running candidates are named Patrick Buchanan, William Clinton, and Robert Dole. These are the only candidates whose vic- tory I take to be a serious possibility. My opinion with respect to the outcome of the election is structured as follows: in some frames of mind with which I identify, I rule out a Buchanan victory but allow for the possibility of Clinton or Dole winning. In other frames of mind, I regard a Dole victory as impossible but admit the possibility of either a Clinton or a Buchanan victory. On all of the rest of the</page><page sequence="23">148 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY standards that I regard as admissible, any of the three outcomes is se- riously possible. (Please note that these do not represent my actual opinions with respect to any historical election.) What do I believe about the outcome of the election? Well, the proposition that Clin- ton or Dole will win satisfies the necessary condition for belief: it is sometimes seriously necessary and everywhere seriously possible. Likewise for the proposition that Clinton or Buchanan will win. So, if we take the necessary condition to provide a sufficient condition as well, I believe both of these propositions. But then by the require- ment of deductive cogency, I am committed to believing their con- junction as well; I must believe that Clinton will win. Now, however, we have a problem. For the proposition that Clinton will win does not satisfy the necessary condition; there is no standard I identify with which judges this proposition to be seriously necessary. The as- sumption that the necessary condition is also sufficient has driven us into a contradiction. What has gone wrong? What feature of my attitude toward the proposition that Clinton or Dole will win renders it unsuitable as a candidate for belief? To answer these questions, we need to take a much closer look at the role that beliefs play in deliberation and in- quiry, at the reasons why we care about having beliefs at all. Accord- ing to Ronald B. de Sousa,'8 we are interested in having beliefs because "we harbor epistemic desires, which make of us collectors of true sentences" (ibid., pp. 58-59). On this view, beliefs can be likened to wagers that a given proposition is true: just as the aim of the gam- bler is to amass as many profitable bets as possible, the goal of the epistemic agent is to have as many true sentences and as few false sentences as possible in his collection. This may be true as far as it goes, but it seems to me that such a view neglects a crucial aspect of the role of belief. van Fraassen'9 comes much nearer to the mark when he writes: 'The point of having beliefs is to construct a single (though in general incomplete) picture of what things are like...to form a single, unequivocally endorsed picture of what things are like" (ibid., pp. 349-50). In other words, our beliefs are not just iso- lated sentences in a collection; they are meant to hang together, to tell a univocal story about the way the world is. It is this feature of be- lief which subjects it to the requirement of deductive cogency: we do not require the gambler to make sure that all of the propositions he 18 "How to Give a Piece of Your Mind: or, The Logic of Belief and Assent," Re- view of Metaphysics, xxv (September 1971): 52-79.

A standard for serious possibility is in many ways like a picture or a story of the world: it represents, in effect, the strongest story about the world to which I am willing to commit myself from the perspec- tive of a particular frame of mind. The question that faces us is: How do we derive from the various stories with which I partially identify a single story that I can be said to unequivocally endorse from a self-re- flective perspective? For a restricted class of cases, the answer is triv- ial. These are cases in which all of the standards with which I identify are logically entailed by a single strongest standard with which I also identify. In other words: define a maximal story to be a standard for serious possibility with which I identify such that no other standard with which I identify is logically stronger. Then the cases I am presently considering are cases in which I identify with exactly one maximal story; and in which every other story I admit as acceptable represents a logical weakening of this maximal story. For these sim- ple cases, there is no problem with simply identifying the belief cor- pus with the maximal story: the necessary condition really is sufficient in such cases. An agent who falls within this domain is, on the whole, committed to the truth of a single strong story about the world; various considerations may make him doubtful about aspects of this story and thus lead him momentarily to endorse weaker ver- sions, but he is never moved to assent to anything that goes beyond or contradicts this single underlying picture. This is a very tidy picture of belief. So tidy, in fact, that at one point I considered making it mandatory. In my first attempt to tackle these issues, I proposed that rational agents were subject to a norma- tive requirement that, in effect, ensured that their opinions were governed by exactly one maximal story. I have since come to regard this move as seriously misguided. States of opinion more compli- cated than these simple cases now seem to me to play an important role in our epistemic activities, a role which cannot simply be swept under the rug. The election example I presented above provides a toy model of the sort of cases I have in mind: here, I identify not with one but with two maximal stories, each of which restricts the list of possible victors to two. Given the right circumstances, I can con- vince myself that either of these stories is certainly true. But I cannot convince myself that they are both true at the same time; and so, given that from a position of reflection I see nothing to recommend one over the other, I refrain from incorporating the specific details</page><page sequence="25">150 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of either of them into my overall picture of the world. More realistic examples can perhaps be found by considering my attitudes toward various contemporary scientific theories. Sometimes, when I reflect on the tremendous predictive and technological successes of the physical sciences, I am genuinely moved, pace Peirce, to regard the central tenets of our best physical theories as certainly true. In other words, when I am in such a mood, I am inclined to paint a portrait of the world that includes the truth of these theories as a central fea- ture. But I am also capable of identifying with much darker skeptical stories, according to which the universe is so incomprehensibly com- plex that we literally have no chance of doing any better than ap- proximately capturing a few extremely local and superficial empirical regularities of no real significance. Such frames of mind are especially likely to result from prolonged exposure to studies in the history of science. It is because of this radical ambivalence that I am reluctant to describe myself as believing the results of contempo- rary physical science: even though there are stories of the world with which I identify according to which those results are true, I see from the broadest perspective no reason to favor those stories over other stories I identify with according to which those results are certainly false. We are now within spitting distance of the explication we have been seeking. First, however, it is necessary to impose a new norma- tive requirement on our epistemic commitments, one that I have previously alluded to but not yet made explicit. In the preceding dis- cussion, I have generally taken it for granted that an agent will be committed to at least one maximal story. Nothing I have said so far guarantees this, however; it is possible to construct coherent sets of possibility standards in which no story is maximal. We can imagine, for example, an infinite set of standards, linearly ordered by logical implication (that is, given any two standards in the set, one of them implies the other), which converge upon but never reach a lower bound which is not in the set. Such cases, though imaginable, must be ruled out if the analysis I am proposing is to succeed. Specifically, what is required is the following: Boundedness condition: let S be an agent's set of standards for serious pos- sibility; for all s in S, there is a maximal story m in S such that m logically implies s. In other words, for every story about the world that an agent is will- ing to tell on some available frame of mind, it is possible to supple- ment that story with additional details and thus construct a maximal</page><page sequence="26">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 151 story that the agent is also willing to tell on some other available frame of mind. I am not claiming that this normative requirement recommends itself to us with a great deal of intuitive force, nor that it plays a significant role in our ordinary way of thinking about our epistemic practices. (I must admit that, purely in my own case, the principle does carry with it at least some intuitive force. There does seem to me to be something genuinely wrong about states of opin- ion that violate boundedness, such as the converging series de- scribed above. But my intuitions on the matter are hardly neutral or untutored.) My argument for imposing this principle is that it greatly simplifies our understanding of the nature of belief without imposing undue strain on our other epistemic concepts. It does not seem to me that, in ruling out unbounded epistemic states, we are arbitrarily dismissing a class of opinions that are of genuine episte- mological significance (as we would have done had we ruled out opinions governed by multiple maximal stories). Any unbounded opinion can easily be transformed into a bounded one simply by adding the appropriate maximal stories to the standard set; this modification does not seem to produce unacceptable changes in the underlying state of opinion thereby represented. Given this, I think that the theoretical advantages to be gained by imposing the bound- edness requirement are sufficient to justify its adoption. (Still, I do regard this move as an unfortunate necessity; and I would be deeply obliged to anyone who can show me a simple way to reconstruct the heart of my analysis in such a way as to avoid this requirement.) So, for agents who satisfy the boundedness condition, I propose the following definition: An agent's belief corpus is the disjunction (union) of all of the maximal stories with which that agent identifies. As before, the agent believes just those propositions which are logi- cally implied by the corpus. This analysis trades on the insight that from the self-transcendent perspective relevant to the determination of one's overall epistemic commitments, one is not in a position to choose between the various precise states of opinion with which one partially identifies. Ex hypothesi, all of these states strike one's reflec- tive self as of roughly equal acceptability. Therefore, in formulating a single picture of the world to which one is unequivocally committed, one should not include features that are idiosyncratic components of some but not all of the maximal stories with which one identifies. Rather, one should restrict one's attention to those claims which are common to all of the acceptable maximal stories. It is an easy matter</page><page sequence="27">152 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY to verify that, on this explication, all of an agent's beliefs satisfy the necessary condition formulated in section ii. For any believed propo- sition p is a logical consequence of the corpus, which is in turn a log- ical consequence of each of the maximal stories; since the maximal stories are sometimes judged to be seriously necessary along with their logical consequences, p is sometimes judged to be seriously necessary. Likewise, since every accepted standard for serious possi- bility is implied by some maximal story, every accepted standard is logically compatible with all of the consequences of at least one max- imal story. Since p is a consequence of every maximal story, p is thus judged to be seriously possible by every accepted standard. It is also trivial to see that beliefs on this model are deductively cogent. So the proposed analysis is at least formally adequate. It also seems to be in- tuitively acceptable, at least for all the cases we have considered here. Consider, for example, the election case once more: the explication yields the result that I believe nothing stronger about the election than that one of the three front runners will win, and this seems to be the appropriate conclusion to draw. It is perhaps worth mentioning that this component of my analysis shares certain structural similarities with an account of belief re- cently proposed by Mark Kaplan.20 Kaplan, like me, takes the project of belief formation to be the project of constructing a single univo- cal account of how things are, or, as he puts it, a global theory of the world. Kaplan calls a proposition a global contender if it is unsurpassed by any other proposition according to standards of plausibility, ex- planatory and question-answering power, comprehensiveness, and so forth. Roughly speaking, there is no way of improving a global con- tender along one of these evaluative dimensions without sacrificing some of the virtues it possesses among the other dimensions. (Ka- plan's definition is, of course, more precise than this, but the details need not concern us.) Kaplan's hypothesis is that each global con- tender represents for you an equally, maximally good candidate for your global theory of the world. Since you have no further epistemic standard by which to rank the global contenders, you ought not arbi- trarily favor one over another, but should rather assent to only those claims which are common to all global contenders. Hence, your global theory of the world will be the strongest proposition that is implied by all of the propositions you regard as global contenders; your beliefs will be just those propositions implied by your global theory of the world. The overlap in our perspectives should be obvi- 2 Decision Theoly as Philosophy (New York: Cambridge, 1996).</page><page sequence="28">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 153 ous. We differ, of course, in our accounts of what it is to judge a proposition to be a global contender, that is, a maximal story. I want to end this section by returning to the question I posed ear- lier: What is the function which beliefs play in our practices of delib- eration and inquiry? Levi makes much of this question; indeed, he issues it as a straightforward challenge to those who, like me, reject his account of belief: Denying this thesis of epistemological infallibilism entails rejection of the view of knowledge as a standard for serious possibility and, hence, the view of how knowledge functions as a resource for inquiry and delibera- tion which I am advocating. Those who reject epistemological infallibil- ism, therefore, are under some obligation to supply an alternative view of the functions and value of knowledge.2' This challenge may seem especially pressing given the somewhat baroque analysis of belief I have been pressing. It may not be at all obvious to you why you should care whether a given proposition is or is not entailed by the disjunction of all the maximal stories you iden- tify with. Thus, if I have successfully convinced you that you believe just those propositions to which you bear this relation, you may find yourself asking why the question of what one believes matters at all. I shall not attempt to offer a full answer to this question, but I think the above discussion provides the foundation for at least a partial an- swer that should be sufficient to allay any deep worries about the rel- evance of belief. Belief, I claim, bears a special relationship to assertion. Suppose that I am participating in a highly idealized form of public inquiry in which my only motivation is to share the truth as I see it with my fellow inquirers. More specifically, my intention is to assert precisely those propositions which I am presently certain are true. It is taken for granted that my opinion does not change within the context of this inquiry; that is, all of my assertions will be taken as reflections of a single underlying state of opinion (although psychological factors such as salience may well shift my perspective on this stable opinion in the course of deliberation). Granted, real-life inquiry almost never takes this pure form, but this fact does not negate the philo- sophical significance of the example. I ask myself: By what standard should I judge what to assert and what not to assert? One possible answer: I should assert just those propositions which presently strike me as seriously necessary. Hence, if I am in one of my skeptical moods, I shall assert very little; if my outlook changes so that I am 21 TheEnteprise of Knowledge, p. 13.</page><page sequence="29">154 THEJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY more inclined to assent to a more detailed picture of the world, I shall become more garrulous. At the limit, I may be moved to assert one of my maximal stories in its entirety. Another possible answer: I should assert just those propositions which presently strike me as se- riously necessary and which I believe. Any proposition that goes be- yond my belief corpus, even if I presently find it completely compelling, should not be introduced into the public debate. My claim is that the second answer is the better one. Belief in a proposi- tion is a necessary prerequisite for warranted assertion of that proposition (at least when one's motives are wholly truth gov- erned). The argument for this claim relies, once again, upon the condi- tion of deductive cogency. The other participants in the conversa- tion do not regard my assertions in strict isolation from one another; they assume that my assertions are meant to hang to- gether as contributions to an overall story about the world which I am in the process of laying out. They will therefore take it for granted that I shall not make any contradictory assertions, and that I am committed to the truth of any consequence they can de- rive from the collection of assertions I have made thus far. The presupposition of deductive cogency is a basic component of all serious epistemic inquiry. But if I take my immediate standard of serious possibility as my criterion for assertion, I shall not in gen- eral be upholding my commitment to deductive cogency. Once more, the election case provides a good example: if, at one stage, I am moved to assert that either Clinton or Dole will win, and then at a later stage, I am driven to assert that Clinton or Buchanan will win, my companions will be justified in regarding this pair of assertions as tantamount to an assertion on my part that Clinton will win. But I do not regard myself as warranted in asserting this proposition; hence, I cannot in good faith permit myself to make a set of assertions that can be misinterpreted in this way. Here is where my belief corpus comes into play. This corpus, recall, represents the strongest proposition that is logically im- plied by all of the maximal stories to which I am committed. Hence, if I restrict my assertions to those propositions which I be- lieve, I need never worry about committing violations of deduc- tive cogency of the sort described above. I shall never make an assertion whose truth I shall later be moved to rule out as a seri- ous possibility; nor shall I make any set of assertions that jointly entail a proposition I am under no circumstances inclined to re-</page><page sequence="30">FALLIBILISM, AMBIVALENCE, AND BELIEF 155 gard as certainly true. In other words, as long as I take my belief corpus to provide the standard for assertibility, I shall ensure that I am always in a position to assert as large a chunk of my presently favored maximal story as possible, subject to the constraint that I must pay due respect to the other maximal stories toward which I may soon find myself leaning. This, I submit, provides sufficient reason in and of itself for us to care about what we believe. By keeping track of our beliefs, we are in effect keeping track of the limits of what we may safely assert (or, mutatis mutandis, take as a stable premise in our private deliberations) without fear of con- tradicting ourselves.
