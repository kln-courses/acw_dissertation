<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Form of Veiled Life Antonin Raymond's dormitory for the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, India (1936-8) Mohsen Mostafavi The Czech-born American architect Antonin Raymond (1888-1976) was, until recently, best known outside of Japan for his collaboration with Frank Lloyd Wright on the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. Both architects had travelled to that country in 1919 and while Wright returned to the United States three years later, Raymond decided to stay. Raymond was born in Kladno, Bohemia and, after completing his studies in Prague, worked for a Yugoslavian civil engineer in Trieste before taking a freighter to the United States in 1910. After working as a draughtsman for Cass Gilbert (on such exotic projects as the Woolworth building) he returned to Europe where he lived and painted near Rome on the fees he had received while doing freelance renderings for other architects. At the outbreak of the First World War, Raymond, who by now had met his future wife Noemi Pernessin (1889-1980), returned to New York and to Cass Gilbert's office, where he worked until the couple moved to Spring Green, Wisconsin to join Wright at Taliesin. It was when Raymond had left Taliesin, and returned to New York to pursue a career as an independent architect, that he received the invitation to travel to Japan to work on the Imperial Hotel. And although Raymond and his wife returned to America on a number of occasions, Japan remained their primary home; they spent a total of forty-three years there. During his career, and often in collaboration with his wife, Raymond designed numerous residential, religious and administrative buildings. Regardless of their location, these buildings combine a European cultural and artistic sensibility with American technological know-how. However, the true distinguishing mark of Raymond's architecture is its deep appreciation of traditional Japanese architecture and construction, combined with an understanding of local conditions such as landscape or climate. Not only did the house Raymond designed for himself at Reinanzaka (1924) mark the first use of exposed reinforced concrete by an architect in Japan, it also marked a departure from the influence of Frank Lloyd Wright. Displaying an affinity with the work of the Czech cubists, and a similar feel to the houses of Mallet Stevens, the house aa files 44 reveals the importance of Raymond's European roots. Subsequent projects reveal how Raymond's architecture became lighter and less contorted in its attention to detail. The Italian Embassy Nikko Villa (1929) clearly demonstrates the influence of Japanese vernacular architecture and makes use of local materials such as cedar bark siding. This, in turn, exemplifies a fascination with the relationship between structure and surface that would be further revealed in many of Raymond's later projects. In these buildings it is the beauty and simplicity of the structure, the choice of materials, and the manner of construction that forms the buildings' decorative and supplementary conditions. By 1937 the political situation in Japan had changed to such a degree that Raymond found himself facing the prospect of little or no work becoming available to the office. He was, for example, refused a permit to build a large assembly plant in Yokohama for the Ford Motor Company. This and other incidents made him realize the potential seriousness of the international conflict that loomed on the horizon, and led him to accept an invitation, from Sri Aurobindo Ghose, to move to India in order to design and supervise the building of a new dormitory for the spiritual leader's disciples at an Ashram in Pondicherry. Sri Aurobindo was born in 1872 and had become one of India's political intellectuals. Sent to England by his father (who believed in the superiority of Western culture and the inferiority of his own) at the age of seven, he studied at St. Paul's School and then at Cambridge University before returning to India where he joined the Baroda State Service. He would later assume a number of academic and administrative posts before becoming fully involved in political resistance to the British rule. There is a close connection between Sri Aurobindo's life as a yogi and his Nationalism; religion and anthropomorphic imagery were some of the key focal points for the aspirations of the people. Sri Aurobindo turned to the practice of pranayama and in 1907 secluded himself for three days with a yogi. This became a life-changing experience after which (and despite a year-long incarceration as a consequence of his political activities and his suspected involvement in a bombing) he moved to the French settlement of Pondicherry where he set up an Ashram and spent the rest of his life in search of the soul's 'reality'. In 1926 Sri Aurobindo withdrew into seclusion leaving the day to-day running of the Ashram to a French disciple, Mirra Alfassa, whom he had met in 1914. Having returned to France during the First World War, Alfassa (later to be called 'the Mother') came back to Pondicherry in 1920 (following a short stay in Japan), and never left again. Given Sri Aurobindo's retirement, one can assume that Alfassa was chiefly responsible for the construction of Raymond's dormitory. 'We speak of the evolution of Life in Matter, the evolution of Mind in Matter; but evolution is a word which merely states the phenomenon without explaining it. For there seems to be no reason why Life should evolve out of material elements or Mind out of living form, unless we accept the Vedantic solution that Life is already involved in Matter and Mind in Life, because in essence Matter is a form of veiled Life, Life a form of veiled Consciousness. And then there seems to be little objection to a further step in the series and the admission that mental consciousness may itself be only a form and a veil of higher states which are beyond Mind.'1 3</page><page sequence="2"> The spiritual teachings of Sri Aurobindo in many respects parallel the thought of Raymond who believed that 'life philosophy and design philosophy are one thing, and if the fundamental precepts of life's philosophy become confused, so will the design in any field of art become confused'.2 One might speculate that it was Raymond's critical stance with regard to the logical mind of the West, and his search for the more intuitive approach of traditional Japanese culture that made him an ideal candidate for the design of the dormitory. The interior of the dormitory possesses a calmness that is in part a result of the contrast between the strong, warm light outside the building and the cool darkness of the interior. Another important factor is the limited palette of the building materials - mainly concrete - and the juxtaposition of the deeply textured, light and elegant wooden furniture in the rooms. For Raymond, architecture should always be designed from the inside out and never from the outside in. Even though the dormitory exterior unquestionably exhibits a simple and modest beauty, it is Raymond's understanding of and sensitivity to this building's use that helps him to gauge and articulate the sensuality and character of its situation. How, after all, do you make a room for someone who has relinquished all worldly possessions? His pursuit of this task is akin to the Japanese tea master who aims not at the making of a cup of tea but at a relation of theory to form as a way of understanding the fundamental relationships of life. For Raymond, an understanding of this relationship required the suppression of personal expression: 'the artist aiming at an objective truth seeks to eliminate himself from his work. This is the opposite from the western idea of "expressing one's personality"... one who seeks to eliminate himself from his work in his pursuit of the truth ...inevitably finds expression'.3 This is what Raymond tried to do with the dormitory building in Pondicherry; his gift to that city.

AA FILES 44</page><page sequence="3">The dormitory building and its grounds occupy a comparatively large site in the centre of Pondicherry, the plan of which was laid out in 1756-77 by Jean Law. The building, which is placed at an angle to the orthogonal plan of the city, consists of two staggered blocks of rooms facing south-east which are linked by the main stairs and the bathrooms. The rooms are arranged along one side of the corridor to optimize ventilation. The entrance to the building is in between the two blocks and the skewed angle of the buildings forces the visitor either to ascend the steps to the dormitories or to turn immediately right. The latter path results in a view of a large landscaped garden bordered by the fagade of one of the blocks. A channel of water runs parallel to the building's edge before culminating in a pond. It is only when you pass under or through the first block that the second becomes visible. The section of the site rises slightly from the front to the back of the building: while the rooms are raised above the ground towards the front, they are almost at the ground level of the more wooded garden at the back. (The rooms are raised off the ground to ensure dryness during the wet season.) The area underneath the building is taken up by some of the service facilities. There is also a covered link to the back garden which provides a cool and shaded space for those who work at the dormitory. The rooms of the dormitory have no windows, but benefit from a series of operable louvers, and are separated from the corridor by sliding doors constructed in a basket weave pattern that allows for cross ventilation. The construction consists of concrete slabs with brick partitions between the rooms. One of this building's many innovations is the use of a raised pre-cast tile roof, allowing for the ventilation and cooling of the slab above the top rooms.
