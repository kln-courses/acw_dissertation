<plain_text> <page sequence="1">  a diasporic reading of N ATHAN THE WISE   Ned  Curthoys   In this essay I analyze the continuing controversy surrounding Gotthold  Ephraim Lessing’s famous 1779 drama N athan der Weise ( Nathan the Wise ),  an emblematic Enlightenment-era play whose evaluation has been drasti- cally affected by the appalling history of the twentieth century. I argue  that the  Nazizeit and the Holocaust have produced a caesura in N athan  criticism, a dramatic reversal of the play’s critical fortunes. A play that was  once celebrated as a harbinger of German-Jewish emancipation, promising  the creative participation of Jews in German society, is now harshly criti- cized and repudiated for the failure of that promise. Recent interpreters of   Nathan the Wise , both scholars and playwrights, have been lugubriously  mindful of the Nazi assault on the German-Jewish community that was  launched in the early 1930s and of the subsequent European Jewish genocide.1   They read the play through the prism of the anachronistic stigma that  attaches to German intellectual history, a stigma that has long encouraged  post-Holocaust criticism to discuss German literature and culture in teleo- logical ways, mining eighteenth and nineteenth century texts and discourses  for attitudes and mentalities that prefi gure the disaster of Nazi Germany.   As I argue, this reversal in the critical fortunes of N athan the Wise is  by no means a salutary development, inasmuch as it has diminished our  ability to appreciate the play’s aesthetic merits, the cross-cultural friendship  and creative collaboration that helped to produce it, the fertile intellectual  milieu that informed it, and the signifi cance of its historical setting in late  twelfth-century Jerusalem, a Jerusalem under the benign Muslim sover- eignty of the famed Egyptian sultan Saladin. In order to interpret  Nathan  the Wise , I suggest, a cosmopolitan sensitivity to world-historical time is  required, a genealogical sensibility that reads the play as an enthusiastic  commentary on the pluralistic and polyglot societies of the Levant and  comparative literature studies, vol. 47, no. 1, 2010.

Nathan the Wise   Lessing’s  Nathan the Wise is set in approximately the year 1192 CE in Jerusalem during an uneasy peace in the Third Crusade, a peace engi- neered by the wise sultan Saladin, a much-lauded historical fi gure who  regained Jerusalem from Christian crusaders in 1187 CE. Saladin invited  Jews to resettle in Jerusalem under his protection and guaranteed freedom  of pilgrimage and worship to Christians. The play’s chief protagonists are  the wise, generous, and humane Jewish merchant Nathan; the initially anti- Jewish but brave and honorable Christian Knight Templar who, just before  the play’s action begins, has saved Nathan’s adopted daughter Recha from  an inferno; and Saladin, the noble-minded ruler of Jerusalem who fears  crusading Christians and is tempted to fi nancially exploit Nathan’s wealth  and credit. The play has an episodic narrative structure and is diffi cult to  classify; it is a “problem play” that is neither comedy, drama, or tragedy.  What the play does enact is a sometimes meandering journey toward the  reconciliation of three characters, a Muslim, a Jew, and a Christian, whose  real human virtues threaten to be overwhelmed by the historical and insti- tutional realities of religious hatred.   Nathan the Wise is most famous for the parable of the rings in act 3.  The profl igately generous Saladin, after successfully waging war to recap- ture Jerusalem, is heavily in debt and needs credit from the famously wise,  humane, and fi nancially astute Jewish merchant Nathan. The parable is  Nathan’s artful response to Saladin’s attempt to put pressure on him by  asking him the most fraught question of all, which is the one true religion,  and why has a wise and independent man capable of choosing what is best  chosen to remain a Jew?   Nathan’s initial panic articulates the profound dilemma of how to  defend one’s position in the world in an age that inhibits individual and  secular conceptions of identity:   I must be on my guard. But how?   I can’t insist that I’m a Jew; but to  CLS 47.1_04.indd   71 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> 72 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S  Deny that I’m a Jew would be still worse.   Then he could simply ask,   “If not a Jew, . . .? Why not a Muslim?”2    It is important that Nathan neither dismisses nor overstresses religious  and cultural difference. Nathan chooses an artfully indirect route in response,  the parable of the three rings. The parable, set in an amorphous “East,” is  about a beautiful opal ring purported to have magical powers that make the  wearer compassionate and beloved by God and other human beings. The  ring is passed down through the generations until one doting father, unable  to choose who to give the ring to among his three beloved sons, has perfect  copies made of the original. After the father’s death the sons fi ght over which  ring is the real one, presenting their case to a judge who determines that  the father counterfeited two rings because he loved all three sons equally  and that therefore the true ring will only reveal itself by its wearer emulat- ing the loving actions of the father. Thus, the judge states, each bearer of  the ring must bring to light the power of the stone in their own ring by  gentleness, sincere good nature, charity, and deepest devotion to God, and  only in a thousand years should they return to his court. But, in a moment  of Kafkaesque deferral  avant la lettre , the judge observes that by that time  another judge, a wiser man than he, will be presiding.   As with the cultured, guileful heroine Scheherazade of the famous O ne  Thousand and One  Nights , Nathan adroitly averts disaster by deferring a con- clusive judgment and entertaining his interlocutor, thereby winning the trust  and friendship of Saladin and setting in train a complex sequence of events  that brings the stubborn Knight Templar into the circle of friendship. The  dénouement of  Nathan the Wise is the revelation that the Templar Knight is  in fact related to Saladin and is the half-brother of Recha, a theatrical deus  ex machina that encourages us to recognize the major monotheistic faiths  as siblings in a single human family.   Nathan the Wise and German Jews   In his now classic study G erman Jews Beyond Judaism, George L. Mosse  argues that Lessing’s  Nathan the Wise could be considered the Magna Carta  of German Jewry, an emblematic articulation of Enlightenment values such  as B ildung (self-education and moral autonomy) and humane tolerance  that infl uenced the liberal political ethos of German Jews. Throughout the  CLS 47.1_04.indd   72 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="4">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 73 nineteenth century, the fl edgling German-Jewish community celebrated  the play as a limpid statement of Lessing’s love for humanity regardless  of religion or creed, a love exemplifi ed by his close friendship and fertile  intellectual collaboration with the German-Jewish philosopher and critic  Moses Mendelssohn. Mosse mentions the famous advocate of Jewish  emancipation Gabriel Riesser, one of the fi rst Jews to enter German politics  and in 1848–1849 the vice president of the Frankfurt parliament. Riesser,  a devotee of Lessing, exulted that with Lessing the German-Jewish com- munity had attained a new phase of  Bildung, a “heavenly bliss” in which  humanity had awoken from its slumber to embrace values such as justice and  compassion.3  In 1838, in an essay paying tribute to Lessing, Riesser argued  for the symbolic signifi cance of the Mendelssohn/Lessing friendship as  portending the unfi nished German-Jewish struggle for emancipation and  equal rights. 4 During the 1880s, as Mosse records, Jews led the subscribers  to Lessing’s centenary monuments and continued to adhere enthusiasti- cally to his humanistic values as a kind of secular faith.5  In 1929, on the  commemoration of Lessing’s two hundredth birthday, many speakers,  among them Reichspräsident von Hindenburg and Thomas Mann, praised  Lessing’s N athan as a “high point of German literature and culture.”6    The symbolic power of N athan the Wise as a testament to German  and Jewish coexistence and reciprocal dialogue was such that, remarkably,  it was the fi rst play chosen to be performed by the K ulturbund Deutscher  Juden , a Jewish cultural organization established with the approval of the  Nazis in 1933. The cofounder of the K ulturbund , Julius Bab, had to defend  the controversial decision to inaugurate the dramatic season by staging  a German-authored play to an audience and a community ostracized by  the Germans. Bab maintained that he did not want to cultivate a one- dimensional Jewish culture but to evoke that “great German culture which  gave us nourishment.”7  Bab was referring to the culture of Enlightenment  humanism that advocated Jewish emancipation, human rights and cosmo- politan ideals, and antiabsolutist political reform.   The Antiassimilationist Critique of  Nathan the Wise   Jeffrey Sammons, biographer of the German-Jewish poet and essayist  Heinrich Heine, has argued against the “condescension toward if not   condemnation of German Jews that has become a conspicuous feature  of post-Holocaust discourse and, in the interest of justice and equity, is  CLS 47.1_04.indd   73 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> 74 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S much in need of readjustment.”8  There are a number of reasons for this  condescension, including a Zionist critique of the supposed assimilation- ist tendencies of German Jews, a contemporary critique of the normative  violence implicit in the notion of “tolerance,” and a deeply rooted herme- neutic suspicion of the Enlightenment as an arrogant ideological project  that attacked traditions and cultures that did not live up to rational norms,  a project seen as particularly hostile toward the perceived backwardness,  obduracy, and sectarian exclusivity of the Jews.   Nathan criticism is also affected by the near-universal critical consensus  that Lessing based the humane and wise character of Nathan on Moses  Mendelssohn, the fi rst German-Jewish public intellectual, of great repute  in both the German and German-Jewish communities and throughout  Europe for his writings on metaphysics, aesthetics, political theory, and  Judaism. Mendelssohn was one of the chief promulgators of the German  Enlightenment, or  Aufklärung , and its core values of religious and ethnic  tolerance, humanism, and rationality. He is also considered the progenitor  of the  Haskalah, the German-Jewish Enlightenment, which encouraged  Jews to enter secular fi elds such as science, history, and languages, often  deplored the intolerance, insularity, and parochialism of Orthodox rabbis,  and reconceived Judaism in less exclusive and more universalist terms as  a faith compatible with the progressive tendencies of world history, all of  which prefi gured the emergence of Reform Judaism in Germany and the  United States in the nineteenth century.9    Debate still rages over Moses Mendelssohn as a fi gure of Jewish moder- nity and the effect of his legacy on postemancipation Judaism. Michael  Meyer, the prominent historian of the German-Jewish encounter with  modernity, articulates the continuing anxieties catalyzed by M endelssohn’s  philosophical idealization of Judaism as a rational and tolerant religious  faith when he describes emancipation and the Enlightenment as “seductive”  for the Jews, an era that called into question the “viability of Judaism and  [undermined] Jewish solidarity.”1 0 Mendelssohn’s insistence on a “tolerant  Judaism” that was more a matter of individual faith than a cohesive com- munity of observance led, Meyer argues, to a “subjectivized” Judaism that  “entered the modern world without clear norms and uncertain of its future.”1 1  Thus the question as to whether Mendelssohn is a Jewish hero inaugurat- ing the cultural effl orescence of Judaism after emancipation, or a catalyst  for the destruction of Judaism by the forces unleashed by a homogenizing  modernity, is at the very heart of postwar  Nathan criticism. Mosse’s pointed  question in G erman Jews Beyond Judaism —“What, after all, was Jewish about  Nathan?”—lingers on.  CLS 47.1_04.indd   74 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="6">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 75  The question was fi rst articulated by a generation of German Jews  in the vanguard of the Jewish renaissance in the Weimar Republic who  rejected the bourgeois assimilation of their parents’ generation, critiqued  many aspects of German-Jewish history, and sought to articulate a more  vital and distinctive conception of Jewish identity that proudly acknowledged  Jewish difference.1 2   One such prominent fi gure of the postassimilationist Jewish renaissance  was the German-Jewish philosopher Franz Rosenzweig, who, in his lecture  notes on N athan the Wise , responded with irritation and bemusement to  Nathan’s famous declaration to the hostile Knight Templar: “Are Chris- tian and Jew sooner Christian and Jew than human being?” Rosenzweig  exclaimed in his notes, “How empty is this presupposition of humanity,  if men do not want it.”1 3 Rosenzweig challenges the play’s enthusiasm for  the “unhoused” human being as revealed in the play’s “anemic” fi fth act  and commends Zionism on recognizing that, in light of contemporary  circumstances, “the Jewish human being has the power of a fact”; for today,  muses Rosenzweig, we German Jews can no longer wish to remain “naked  human beings.”1 4 Rosenzweig also laments the mesmerizing appeal of the  Mendelssohn/Lessing friendship on which the play was putatively based,  a friendship, he suggests, that was not really a meeting across difference  of Christian and Jew but rather of two men who “found themselves in the  common abstraction of their positive religions,” a friendship only possible  in an age, that of the Enlightenment, that “lacked the blood of the present  times.” Indeed, bemoans Rosenzweig, the space of coexistence and mutual  dialogue envisioned by N athan the Wise is today devoid of “even the best  Christians.”   Perhaps the most problematic aspect of N athan the Wise for Rosenzweig  is the legacy of Mendelssohn himself, that “man of our destiny” who was a  Jew but also “covered up the fact,” a reference to Mendelssohn’s many Gentile  friends and his initial reluctance to become involved in religious contro- versy.1 5 Ten years later, in 1929, in his “Pronouncement for a Celebration of  Mendelssohn,” Rosenzweig refers to Mendelssohn as the “fi rst German  Jew” but one who “has not been able to bequeath to us the protection under  which he himself effected the new combination.” Rosenzweig laments  Mendelssohn’s heirs, many of whom were converts to Christianity (such as  the famous composer Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy), as a “symbol of the  menace into which he led the existence of our, his, spiritual descendants.”  Mendelssohn, complains Rosenzweig, “led us defenseless into this dan- ger,” the danger of an anti-Semitism that no longer accepted converted or  assimilated Jews, for Mendelssohn’s own protection was the “worldview  CLS 47.1_04.indd   75 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> 76 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S of his century,” an ephemeral phase of German history that believed  in the unifying power of ahistorical ideals such as humanity, tolerance,  and truth.1 6   Hannah Arendt   In the 1930s the German-Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany and politi- cal theorist Hannah Arendt reiterated the antiassimilationist critique of  Rosenzweig, interpreting Mendelssohn/Nathan as prefi guring all those  educated and secularized German Jews who sought to assimilate to  German culture, neglecting solidarity with their more downtrodden core- ligionists. In R ahel Varnhagen: The Life of a Jewess , which was completed  in manuscript form in 1933 but only published after the war, Arendt writes  of Mendelssohn that his lack of civil rights “hardly troubled him,” that  he only took a very incidental interest in social inclusion, and that he was  satisfi ed to be the “least inhabitant,” protected but without equal rights,  of the Prussia of the enlightened absolutist ruler Frederick II.1 7 Arendt’s  assertion that Mendelssohn advocated an assimilationist quietism is actu- ally quite false. As Willi Goetschel suggests, not only was Mendelssohn a  political philosopher who argued for the unconditional acceptance of Jews  and the Jewish faith within the German polity, vigorously disagreeing with  the paradigm in which Jews would be granted civil rights in exchange for  their “moral regeneration” as favored by Christian Wilhelm Dohm, the  fi rst Prussian political fi gure to famously call for the civic equality of the  Jews in Germany, but he was also a prominent public fi gure or  shtadlan,  an advocate and spokesperson on behalf of German and European Jewish  communities that were discriminated against and subjected to orders of  expulsion. As Goetschel writes, “Mendelssohn’s international stature and  his irrefutable integrity made him one of the most prominent and effective  advocates and representatives of Jewry in his time.”1 8   Arendt’s hostility toward Mendelssohn is more explicable if we look at  another essay of hers, “The Enlightenment and the Jewish Question” (1932),  where it is clear that Arendt repudiates the comportment of Mendelssohn  for reasons that resonate with Rosenzweig’s J ’accuse . Here Arendt critiques  Mendelssohn as a prototype of the educated, secularized German Jew who  readily falls for the seductive appeal of the rationalizing forces of modernity,  heedless of the baleful effects they might have on Jewish communal solidarity  and historical consciousness in subsequent generations. Arendt reserves her  CLS 47.1_04.indd   76 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="8">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 77 sharpest criticisms for Mendelssohn’s famous defense of Judaism in a book  that ensured his lasting legacy as a political philosopher, J erusalem (1783).  According to Arendt, in J erusalem Mendelssohn attempted to salvage the  Jewish religion on the basis of its rational “eternal content” rather than its  historical attestation as a revealed religion preserved, in the face of tremendous  odds, by a people in dispersion for nearly two thousand years. 19 Arendt regards  Mendelssohn as a typically antihistorical representative of Enlightenment  reason, who assumed that reason and truth are antithetical to the chaotic  fl uctuations of history and the superstitions and prejudices bequeathed by  tradition.   Doubtless with Mendelssohn in mind, Arendt argues that in the  character of Nathan, Lessing accurately portrays the lack of prejudice in  educated Jews of the Enlightenment era, lack of prejudice being equivalent  in her view to a rational subjectivity that is “not connected to any sort of  historical content.” 20 Like Rosenzweig, Arendt suggests that Mendelssohn’s  legacy rendered the Jews isolated human beings rather than an integral and  politically active community, leading to the “failure of Jews to appreciate  history.” Arendt reads the trajectory of Jewish emancipation in Germany  as that of an increasingly embourgeoised group who “denied their own his- tory and regarded everything particular about themselves as an impediment  to their integration, to becoming full human beings.” 21 Arendt implicitly  blames Mendelssohn for the bitterly ironic aftermath of the initial hopes of  the emancipation era, during which Jewish emancipation seemed more and  more to mean emancipation from the onerous stigma of Jewish identity and  history and a movement toward the self-forming, individualistic ethos of  Bildung . Like Rosenzweig, Arendt felt that Mendelssohn’s rationalist apolo- getics for Judaism were only conceivable in the deceptively benign intellectual  climate of the Enlightenment, an era that left the newly isolated German  Jew defenseless against the rise of German nationalism, mass politics, and  organized political anti-Semitism.   Scholem’s Construction of the Self-Negating German Jew   Perhaps the most infl uential critique of the Enlightenment’s infl uence on  the course of German-Jewish history has been that of Gershom Scholem,  who set the tone for the postwar repudiation of the assimilationist   tendencies of educated German Jews in his polemical essay “Against  the Myth of the German-Jewish Dialogue,” written in Israel in 1964.  CLS 47.1_04.indd   77 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> 78 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S Scholem begins by refusing the seemingly self-exculpatory German  invitation to celebrate a “German-Jewish symbiosis,” a hybrid form of  “German-Judaism” tragically interrupted by Nazism. Scholem consid- ers the notion of such a symbiosis to be illusory and mystifying, arguing  that there never was a German-Jewish dialogue, that it “died at its very  start and never took place.” This is because while Jews in Germany “put  their own creativity” at the disposal of German culture, even their most  humane German interlocutors never considered “what they had t o give as  Jews” but only “what they had to g ive up as Jews” in order to participate  in German culture as equal citizens.2 2   Scholem traces German-Jewish self-abandonment back to the abortive  emancipation of Jews in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries,  suggesting that even liberal Germans, including passionate advocates of  Jewish emancipation and civil rights such as Wilhelm von Humboldt,  demanded a “resolute disavowal of Jewish nationality,” a price the leading  spokespeople and writers of the Jewish avant-garde “were only too happy  to pay.”2 3 Scholem laments the “tragedy” of German Jews struggling for  emancipation not for the sake of their rights as a people but rather for the  sake of “assimilating themselves to the peoples among whom they lived.”  Losing their confi dence as a people, their sense of their community as an  integral nation with a transmissible tradition, many German Jews were  “disordered” by the deep insecurity that began to hound them after leaving  the ghetto.2 4 The German rejection of the Jews as a people intensifi ed the  progressive “atomization of the Jews as a  community ,” a process acceler- ated by individual Jews attempting to ingratiate themselves with German,  Christian culture.2 5   Scholem critiques the late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century  German-Jewish Enlightenment, the  Haskalah , and the proponents of  Jewish reform and secular education, the Maskilim, whose most famous  early proponent was Moses Mendelssohn. With Mendelssohn, and above  all with the school of Enlightenment reformers of Judaism he inspired,  there began, in Scholem’s view, a fateful process of “turning towards the  Germans,” leading to a propaganda campaign by “enlightened” modern- izing Jews for the Jews’ resolute absorption by German culture and, shortly  thereafter, by the German people themselves.2 6 The era of German-Jewish  entreaties to Jews to become active participants in German culture, continu- ally stonewalled by the anti-Semitic suspicions of German society, should  now be read, according to Scholem, as a process of self-estrangement  and increasing neurosis, of a “decay in the Jewish tradition and in Jewish  self-consciousness.”2 7  CLS 47.1_04.indd   78 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="10">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 79  More recently, Sander Gilman’s reading of German-Jewish identity  as it was shaped by the  Aufklärung and Jewish emancipation also shares  a Zionist proclivity to pathologize and repudiate the Jewish response to  German culture that was inaugurated by Moses Mendelssohn. In his 1986  book  Jewish Self-Hatred , Gilman reads Mendelssohn’s desire to fully partici- pate in the philosophical and cultural debates of his times as assimilationist  and self-abandoning, an attempt to seek out and then imitate the “life and  learning of the Christian world.” 28 Gilman sees Mendelssohn as a parvenu  who attempts to ingratiate himself as an acceptable model of the “good  Jew” tolerable to Germans. In Gilman’s doleful narrative, strongly redolent  of Arendt’s suspicion of Mendelssohn’s alleged quietism,  Mendelssohn  abandons his Jewish mien for the sake of becoming part of a small clique  of Enlightenment thinkers in 1750s Berlin that famously included his  close friend and intellectual companion Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. 29   Mendelssohn, according to Gilman, fashions himself in the role of the  inconspicuous, culturally odorless, court-protected elite Jew, an assimilated  Jew who speaks Prussian German rather than East European Yiddish and  is polite and decorous rather than argumentative in the rabbinic, Talmudic  mode: “Mendelssohn’s creation of an image of the nondisputive, rational,  German-speaking Jew using tools of Western rhetoric and logic was in  fulfi llment of the cultural demands of Christian, capitalistic society.” 30 Echo- ing Mosse’s suspicion of Nathan’s Judaism, Gilman notes that the perfect  German of the character of Nathan was not at all typical of German Jews of  that era but rather conformed to an Enlightenment version of toleration that  “draws the line at language difference.”3 1 Gilman reads Lessing’s N athan as  a metonym for the Enlightenment itself, a school of thought that was only  capable of acknowledging Mendelssohn/Nathan as an extraordinary Jew,  the culturally acceptable “good Jew,” an exception to the norm of Jewish  dishonesty, corruption, and greed.3 2   In its disdain of the putatively ahistorical humanism of Enlightenment- infl uenced German Jews,  a humanist orientation now read as naïve and  ineffective in combating the looming crisis of anti-Semitism, the now  normative critique articulated by Rosenzweig, Arendt, Scholem, and  Gilman ignores and elides the agency of German-Jewish intellectuals  from the age of emancipation until the twentieth century in creating their  own, diasporic image of Jewish identity and history. This proleptic cri- tique locates the reasons for the demise of German and European Jewry  in diasporic Jewish comportment toward the Gentile world. Yet, as we  have seen, throughout the nineteenth century German Jews celebrated  Nathan for fashioning an historically accurate version of a diasporic Jew at  CLS 47.1_04.indd   79 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> 80 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S ease in a variety of cultural spheres, a character that symbolized their own  aspirations for creative participation as Jews in the non-Jewish cultures in  which they found themselves.   Diasporic Readings   The oeuvre of the Mizrahi Israeli critic Ella Shohat, of Iraqi Jewish descent,  offers an alternative perspective to the hostile, ethnocentric, and Zionist- infl uenced critique of Mendelssohn/Nathan. Shohat points out that the  Zionist historical imaginary, for which the experience of European Jewry  at the hands of Christian Europe is overpowering and paradigmatic, has  discouraged relational sympathies with other collective experiences of  oppression, expulsion, and genocide. Zionism’s narrative of a monolithic  Jewish experience, the idea of a unique, transhistorical victimization of  Jews, resists parallels and overlaps with other religious and ethnic com- munities, “preclud[ing] analogies” and the appreciation of linked oppres- sions in particular historical contexts.3 3 Shohat calls for an adversarial  scholarship working against “censored affi liations” that fail to link Jewish  historical experience to the fate of Muslims conquered and then expelled  from Christian Spain after 1492 and to the sufferings of indigenous people  in the A mericas that also began in that fateful year, which saw the triumph  of a racist Christian demonology ready to be recycled against “heathens” in  the newly conquered Americas. 34 Shohat muses that a Holocaust-centered  version of Jewish suffering discourages the analysis of polyglot Sephardic  and Arab Jewish cultures within Muslim geographies, a correlative of the  hegemonic demonization of “Arab” Muslims that functions to unify an often  fi ssured Israeli Jewish identity.3 5   Within a Zionist imaginary in which the monocultural European  nation-state dominates as both ideal ego and signifi er of persecution and  the Holocaust, the “diaspora Jew” is repudiated as shameful, rootless, and  extraterritorial, endangering Judaism by living a superfi cial existence outside  of a Zion-centered Jewish history that has been redeemed by the Jewish  nation-state. 36 Shohat’s critique is applicable to the jaded  Nathan interpreta- tion that critiques Jewish diasporic existence in Germany as “unhoused” and  assimilationist, ignores the overt sympathy for Islam in N athan the Wise , and,  tellingly, glosses over the fact that Nathan is a Levantine Jew prospering in  the Muslim world. Working against the “censored affi liations” of which  Shohat speaks, we could describe Nathan as a Jew who reprises a German  CLS 47.1_04.indd   80 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="12">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 81 Jewish appreciation, stemming from the era of the H askalah , for the cultural  and philosophical heritage of Arabized Levantine and Sephardic Jews. This  rich Judeo-Arab heritage includes the tenth-century Egyptian-born Jewish  philosopher, grammarian, and exegete Saadia Gaon, who translated the Bible  into Arabic, the great twelfth-century Jewish philosopher and p hysician  Maimonides, who originally wrote his famous  Guide for the Perplexed in  Arabic, and the brilliant Andalusian lyrical poet Judah Halevi (b. 1075 CE),  author of the famous philosophical dialogue and vindication of Judaism, the   Kuzari, also written in Arabic.   The “Sephardic mystique,” as it has been termed, is an appreciation  of a diasporic Jewish heritage that was rationalist, highly skilled, worldly,  broadly erudite, and linguistically polyglot. 37 In the last decades of the  eighteenth century the proponents of Jewish enlightenment, or M askilim ,  extolled Andalusian Jews such as Maimonides as exemplars of the possible  achievements of Jews in less restrictive and discriminatory cultural con- texts than Christian Europe. The H askalah appreciation of the Arabic and  Sephardic Jewish legacy profoundly infl uenced prominent nineteenth-century  German-Jewish historians of diaspora such as Heinrich Graetz and Abraham  Geiger. Heinrich Graetz’s eleven-volume H istory of the Jews (1853–70) offers  a dynamic account of Jewish diasporic existence that strongly underscores  Jewish intellectual achievement in Muslim lands, including the “happy  peninsula” of Sefarad/Al-Andalus. Graetz considered Hispanic Jews to have  “contributed almost as much” to the development of Judaism as Judea and  Babylonia. He believed that Jews were more likely to prosper in Muslim lands,  where peoples of the Book were respected, than in the persecutory realms of  Christendom. In establishing a refi ned, Abrahamic monotheism, Mahomet,  Graetz writes, showed regard for Judaism’s “highest aims” and founded Islam  on a “lofty basis” informed by Jewish strictures against idolatry.3 8 Graetz  asserts that in the early Middle Ages the “European Christian countries were  still less fi t to become the center of Judaism than the Mahometan Kingdoms  of Egypt and Northern Africa.”3 9   The idealized Sephardic Jewish tradition so appealing to German  Jews interested in the diasporic achievements of their forebears may well  inform Daniel and Jonathan Boyarin’s call for a diasporic model of Jewish  self-perception and historical understanding as an alternative to Zionist  nationalism. In reprising a genealogy of Sephardic Jewish cultural refi ne- ment, aesthetic discernment, and cultivated personality enabled by active  participation in the sophisticated culture of Moorish Al-Andalus, liberal  humanist German-Jewish thinkers anticipated the Boyarins’ desire for an  “idealized Diaspora generalized from those situations in Jewish history  CLS 47.1_04.indd   81 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> 82 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S when Jews were both relatively free from persecution and yet constituted  by a strong identity,” when “Promethean Jewish creativity” was not anti- thetical to but “synergistic with a general cultural activity.”4 0 The German- Jewish reprisal of the achievements of Arab-speaking Jewish intellectuals  in Andalusia prefi gures the Boyarins’ preference for “exile” over rootedness  in the land and for a differentiated historical consciousness and creative  optimism over the Palestine-centric preoccupation with Jewish victimiza- tion throughout history.4 1   Mendelssohn/Nathan’s Spinozism   What elements of Mendelssohn’s contemporary reputation, philosophi- cal outlook, and political philosophy, and what aspects of the character of  Nathan, allow us to read both Nathan and Mendelssohn as imbued with the  “Sephardic mystique” and the rich Judeo-Arabic cultural heritage it invokes?  Alexander Altmann’s monumental biography of Mendelssohn is helpful in  this regard, noting that Mendelssohn was one of the fi rst eighteenth-century  thinkers to rehabilitate the controversial, heretical, ex-communicated phi- losopher Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677). Mendelssohn and Lessing discovered  Spinoza’s writings in the 1750s, catalyzing the Spinozist renaissance that  had a dramatic impact on the thought of Herder, Goethe, and Friedrich  Schlegel among others and that strongly infl uenced eighteenth-century  Enlightenment culture.4 2   Altmann suggests that Spinoza had a “special fascination” for Men- delssohn, for like Spinoza, born in Amsterdam of an emigrant Portuguese  Marrano (Christian converts who secretly practiced an adapted form of  Judaism in post-Inquisition Spain and Portugal) family, Mendelssohn  was also an emigrant Jew (he was born in Dessau and moved to Berlin  when he was fourteen years old) trained in medieval Jewish philosophy.  Mendelssohn identifi ed with the philosophical adventurousness of Spinoza  and felt that despite his “speculative doctrine” he could have remained an  Orthodox Jew if he had not so drastically renounced Jewish law. 43 Not  only did Mendelssohn vigorously critique the conventional denunciation  of Spinoza as an outcast, heretic blasphemer and scandalous atheist, but  according to Altmann, Mendelssohn was also “attracted to [Spinoza]” and  may even have dreamed of becoming a “second Spinoza.” In the early stages  of their enthusiastic friendship, in the autumn of 1754, Lessing fl attered  this aspiration when he suggested that Mendelssohn’s “honesty and his  CLS 47.1_04.indd   82 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="14">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 83 philosophical mind make me anticipate in him a second Spinoza equal to  the fi rst in all but . . . his errors.” 44   With some audacity Mendelssohn defended the honor of the  Marrano Sephardic Dutch Jew and secular philosopher, who, he argued,  “lived moderately, withdrawn, and blamelessly” denying himself “all  human pleasures” in a life “devoted to contemplation.” As Adam Sutcliffe  writes, the Sephardic Spinoza was a focus of “confused fascination” for eman- cipated Jews who sought to fi nd historical models for mediation between  Jewish and non-Jewish worlds. 45 Thus Mendelssohn was equally as fulsome  in his praise of Spinoza’s sociable relationships with mostly Gentile scholars  and acquaintances throughout Europe: “Who would not be delighted to  have had Spinoza as a friend . . .? And who would refuse to give Spinoza’s  genius and excellent character their due?”4 6   A thread in Mendelssohn’s subsequent philosophy, from his P hiloso- phische Gespräche (P hilosophical Dialogues ) of 1754 to his “An die Freunde  Lessings” (“To the Friends of Lessing”) of 1786, was his attempt to prove  that Spinoza’s doctrine is “consistent with reason and religion.” 47 Respond- ing to Lessing’s own estimation of him as a “second Spinoza,” as both an  exemplar of Jewish intellectual vitality and a rebel against the parochialism of  many Orthodox rabbis, Mendelssohn celebrated Spinoza as an acculturated  Sephardic Jew whose breadth of knowledge and virtuous conduct were more  signifi cant than adherence to any dogma or orthodoxy. In 1783 Mendelssohn  translated and wrote a famous preface to the  Vindiciae Judaeorum (1656),  written by Menasseh Ben Israel (1604–1657), the ecumenically inclined  Amsterdam Jewish community leader and Portuguese Jewish rabbi, who  taught Spinoza, a tract Ben Israel undertook to write to facilitate the return  of the Jews to England by refuting the many calumnies being made against  the Jews. As Sutcliffe writes, Spinoza’s heterodoxy, complex relationship to  Judaism, and exemplary life of philosophical contemplation were also at least  as interesting to Lessing as his humane philosophy, suggesting that com- mon humanity and virtuous character transcend theological and sectarian  differences. Following Sutcliffe and Goetschel I think it more than likely  that Spinoza himself was an inspiration for both  Nathan the Wise and for  Lessing’s other philo-Jewish play, T he Jews (1749). 48   Many of Spinoza’s philosophical precepts appealed greatly to both  Mendelssohn and Lessing, stimulating, for example, their rational, ethical,  and inclusive conception of God, a pluralistic theism suspicious of the exclu- sive and violent claims to a single and unrepeatable revelation on which the  Mosaic distinction between true and false religions is predicated. Spinoza  postulated, for example, that God takes account of the whole of nature  CLS 47.1_04.indd   83 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> 84 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S and not merely of the human race alone. God is not an anthropomorphic  being that plans and acts purposively, who punishes and rewards, and who  therefore needs to be obeyed, feared, and placated by the intercessions of  a priestly caste. Nor does Spinoza’s God perform miracles, since there are  no departures possible from the necessary course of nature; indeed Spinoza  believed that the retreat to superstition was the “bitter enemy of all true  knowledge and true morality.” Spinoza’s philosophy is a form of religious  humanism characterized by an intellectual love of God and the desire for  more knowledge about the world God has created.4 9   Spinoza argued that the supreme being desires only practical virtue  such as love of one’s neighbor and not infl exible dogmas or sectarian  devotion. True faith in God does not involve metaphysical doctrines or  anything contrary to our understanding of the natural world but is best  represented by a “pure conception of the divine mind which was revealed  to the prophets,” according to which one is called on “to obey God with all  one’s mind by practicing justice and charity.”5 0 Therefore Spinoza held that  familiarity with scripture or other holy texts is not necessary for a blessed  condition, since the loving message of scripture is in fact available to our  rational faculties alone. Spinoza’s religious humanism and rationalism,  which critiqued clerical demagoguery, the superstitions of the multitude,  and the hubris of invoking God as being on the side of a particular people,  greatly appealed to Lessing and Mendelssohn as they attempted to articulate  the ethical and edifying rather than exclusive and violent tenets of their  respective religions.   Is Nathan a Spinozist?   Nathan the Wise offers many clues that its hero, Nathan, is not a representa- tive “Jew” whose humanity demands our tolerance and sympathy. He can be  read in a more specifi c sense as a polyvalent Spinozist, a perpetual outsider  fi gure and philosophical skeptic, both Jew and heretic, inside and outside  Judaism, neither a “housed” nor abstractly “unhoused” human being. A Jew  who is prospering in the medieval Islamic world that stretched from the  Levant to Moorish Spain, Nathan is conversant with a variety of religions  and cultures and analyzes human beliefs and folly with a degree of sympa- thetic detachment. In the play’s second scene Nathan has returned from his  merchant travels to Baghdad, the seat of the Islamic empire, and elsewhere  in the Levant, only to fi nd his adopted daughter Recha infl amed with pious  CLS 47.1_04.indd   84 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="16">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 85 enthusiasm for what she thinks was an “angel”—in fact the Christian Knight  Templar—who had miraculously saved her from a house fi re.   Recha: Let us now rejoice   And praise our God. He surely bore you and   Your boat on wings of his unseen angels   Across the treacherous streams. And it was God   Who beckoned to my angel to be seen,   Carrying me through the fl ames on his white wings.   Nathan: (On his white wings-of course! That must have been   The Templar’s white and outspread cloak.) (1.1.186–93)   We should note that Nathan’s rational substitution of a familiar  phenomenon, the Knight Templar’s fl owing cloak, for Recha’s impression  of an angel savior, is distinctly reminiscent of Spinoza’s philological method  of analysis in his  Theological-Political Treatise, in which biblically attested  miracles are redescribed as natural phenomena, guided by the hermeneutic  presumption that there is nothing in scripture “that does not concur with  our understanding” and that “nothing happens in nature that contradicts  its universal laws.”5 1   Nathan’s rationalist, Spinozist suspicion of miraculous occurrences and  the contagious religious enthusiasm they generate (such enthusiasm was  usually termed  Schwärmerei in eighteenth-century Germany and vigorously  opposed by  Aufklärers such as Mendelssohn and Lessing) has an ethical  justifi cation; it is a warning against the camoufl aged hubris implied by the  belief that God is capriciously revealed to particular individuals or communi- ties. Responding to the naïve and enthusiastic Christian zealotry of Recha’s  companion Daja, who suggests that there is no harm in Recha thinking that  she has been saved by an angel rather than a human being, Nathan critiques  the narcissistic belief in an anthropomorphic God.   Nathan: Pride! Nothing but pride! The iron pot   Wants to be lifted from the fi re with silver   Tongs, in order to imagine it’s a pot   Of silver.   . . . your “Feeling so much nearer to God”   Is either nonsense or else blasphemy.   And there i s harm in it, there really is.

In his recent book  The Origins of Violence (2008) John Docker stresses that  Spinoza did not believe in the hubris of a reason that masters and controls  the world, that indeed he confessed limitations to human knowledge; as we  have seen Spinoza did not believe that nature was so limited that “man” is its  chief part. Spinoza rejected the idea that a wisely conducted life should accept  nothing as true that could not be called into doubt, for most of our actions  are, he wrote, fraught with “uncertainty and hazard.” 52 As Docker argues,  Spinoza believed that the universe is governed by a single substance (God,  nature) which has no fi nal cause or telos, no natural end or aim, “permitting  the fl ourishing of difference, diversity, and experimentation.”5 3 Spinoza did  not believe in a strict mind/body dualism, instead arguing for the mind as  the “idea” of the body in all its intersubjective desires and unpredictable  encounters. For Spinoza the highest form of knowledge was not obtainable  by apodictic reason or the ascetic denial of the senses but by reason working  with intuition, imagination, and emotion (love).5 4   It is also in a Spinozist fashion, then, when Nathan points out to Recha  that the workings of providence are all the more extraordinary, unpredictable,  and enchanting when it comes to embodied human beings, in whom even the  most embedded prejudices against other races and religions can be overcome,  The Knight Templar’s initial enmity towards Jews and Muslims dissolves in  the face of his amorous desire for the charming Recha and in the face of the  disarmingly genial, sentimental Nathan, whose cleansing teardrop on the  Templar’s cloak marks the beginning of an improbable friendship.   Nathan: It might sound natural and commonplace   If he who saved you were a real Templar   Knight; but surely that would be no less a Miracle! The greatest  miracle   Is that those miracles which are both real and true   Can and do become so commonplace to us.   . . . No thinking person would call miracles   Those things which only seem so to a child,   Who stares at and pursues the strangest things,   Struck only by their novelty. (1.2.213–23)   Although himself adhering to Mosaic laws such as the principle of  charity and alms, Nathan, it is reputed, has brought up Recha in “no faith at  all, and taught her neither more nor less of God than reason fi nds  suffi cient”  CLS 47.1_04.indd   86 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="18">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 87 (2555–58). In conversation with Daja, who is deeply distressed that the   baptized Recha has yet to return to the Christian fold, Recha confi rms that  her upbringing by Nathan has been purely in the spirit of religious human- ism rather than couched in a distinct creed based on revelation:   Recha: To whom does God belong? What sort of God   Belongs to just one person? One who needs   People to fi ght for him? (3.1.1555–58)   What has [Nathan] done to make you want to mix   The seed of pure reason, which he planted   In my soul, with weeds or fl owers of   Your homeland? (3.1.1564–67)   What I found more consoling was   The lesson that devotedness to God   Does not wholly depend on what   We speculate about him. Dear Daja,   My father has so often told us that. (3.1.1589–93)   Nathan’s religious humanism, alive to the uncertainty and future pos- sibilities of God’s providence rather than assured of God’s plan as determined  by a unique historical event and its concomitant testament, stands in strong  contrast to the hateful bigotry of the senior Christian in Jerusalem, the patri- arch, who upon hearing that Nathan has brought up a baptized Christian  girl declaims ominously that “the Jew shall burn” (4.2.2559).   Nathan’s Philo-Semitism   As a Spinozist, Nathan is not just the proponent of a rational and humane  philosophy; the polylingual fi gure of Spinoza reprises leading thinkers of  the medieval Judeo-Islamic world such as the Jewish Maimonides and the  great Islamic philosopher Averroës. As Adam Sutcliffe has argued, Spinoza,  well versed in medieval Jewish and Arabic philosophy and infl uenced by  Maimonides’ Aristotelian rationalism and refi ned conception of God, was  an “intellectual bridge between the secular Enlightenment and medieval  Andalusia.” 55 Mendelssohn was a close student of Maimonides’ writings  and published a commentary on Maimonides’ L ogical Terms in 1761.5 6 Indeed  CLS 47.1_04.indd   87 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> 88 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S Spinoza’s intellectual independence, his anticlerical attitudes, and critique of  the Mosaic distinction, encouraged those strands of what Jonathan Israel has  called the “radical Enlightenment,” which were cosmopolitan and distinctly  philo-Semitic in the broadest sense, embracing the wisdom of Arabic and  Jewish religion and culture and criticizing Christianity’s supercessionist claim  to be the one true faith at the vanguard of historical progress.   A prominent example of the Spinozist-infl uenced radical Enlighten- ment in the eighteenth century was the free thinker and pantheist John  Toland, an Egyptophile who believed the Egyptians were the “wisest of  mortals” because they secretly encoded their esoteric religious knowledge  in hieroglyphic form. Toland loved the Greek philosophers and Confucius  for their wise teachings and virtuous actions. 57 In his remarkably syncretic   Nazarenus; or, Jewish, Gentile, and Mahometan Christianity (1718), Toland  claimed to have exhumed a “Mahometan Gospel” unknown to any Chris- tians, which observes the “true and original plan of Christianity,” that is,  the encouragement of a diversity of observances and ceremonies, a pluralism  of worship bitterly opposed by Paul, who, according to Toland, lamentably  expelled the fi rst Jewish Christians.5 8 Toland praised the multireligious space  of the Ottoman Middle East and argued that Muslims and their mosques  should be tolerated in Amsterdam and London just as Christians of every  kind were in Constantinople.5 9   Toland’s heterodox appreciation of Islam conversed with that of Unitar- ians such as Stephen Nye, who thought that the ancient Nazarene faith in the  unity of God had been corrupted by institutional Christianity but preserved  in Turkish and other Muslim dominions and with that of Montesquieu in  his satirical  Persian Letters , in which Muslim characters question European  cultural norms, thus returning the superior gaze of Europeans on the Ori- ent. As Docker argues, these works are part of a distinct philo-Semitic  and heterodox cultural movement in the eighteenth century that rejected a  Christian teleological sacred history focused on the Israelites alone, admired  Arabic literature and religion, and was attentive to the possibility of “cultural,  philosophical and religious exchanges between Europe and the Orient.”6 0   Moses Mendelssohn and Gotthold Ephraim Lessing were active pro- mulgators of the heterodox philo-Semitic Enlightenment of the eighteenth  century. In one of his earliest published writings, the R ettungen (V indications )  of 1754, Lessing defended heretics and heterodox thinkers who had been  ignored or dismissed and who did not have a voice of their own. One of  Lessing’s R ettungen of 1754, “Rettung des Hier. Cardanus,” was dedicated to  the sixteenth-century Renaissance mathematician, philosopher, and physi- cian Hieronymus Cardanus, who was reviled as an atheist and heretic for  CLS 47.1_04.indd   88 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="20">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 89 taking Islam seriously as a subject for theological discussion by c omparing  Islam and Judaism unfavorably to Christianity.6 1 Lessing defended Cardanus  but also sharply criticized him for being unfair to the tenets of Judaism  and Islam. Lessing reworks Cardanus’s dialogue by having a Jewish and  Islamic protagonist defend their religions. The Jewish character refutes  the charge that the Jews’ dispersal and exile is a sign of God’s punishment  and the Muslim defends his faith against the charge of being irrational  and barbaric by stressing that Islamic monotheism, which believes in the  unity of God and teaches that God rewards and punishes as a measure of  our actions in this world, is in accord with the purest conceptions of reason  (“allerstrengesten Vernunft”). Lessing goes further, having his Muslim pro- tagonist proclaim that the Christian religion is a hodgepodge of doctrines  that no healthy reason could ever recognize (“Wirrwarr von Sätzen, die eine  gesunde Vernunft nie für die ihrigen erkennen wird”), a critical perspective  Mendelssohn shared: “In [Mendelssohn’s] view Christianity was permeated  with intolerance and the spirit of persecution.”6 2   Lessing, who did not believe in a fi nal truth that could be achieved once  and for all, leaves the question of the one true faith open, but his Muslim  protagonist’s powerful critique of Christian doctrines such as the Trinity is  a “return of the gaze” that also invokes the long literary history of imagining  a “world upside down,” a tradition in which offi cial norms and established  truths are parodied and criticized. 63 We should recognize that Lessing is  not simply criticizing Christianity in order to overturn a hierarchy of values;  rather, his critique is intended to provoke Christians to enter into dialogue  with those faiths it disdains and oppresses. In a telling moment, Lessing has  Recha rebuke Daja, who has benefi ted from the kindness and hospitality  of the Jewish Nathan but nevertheless believes he will be damned to hell,  as “one of those fanatics who imagine that they know the only true and  universal way to God” (5.6.3587–89).   Mendelssohn/Nathan’s Jerusalem   After Lessing’s death Mendelssohn paid heartfelt tribute to Lessing’s pen- chant for siding with the weak and the oppressed and for socializing with  outsiders and outcasts such as actors and soldiers. Mendelssohn’s apprecia- tion of Lessing’s acute sense of justice is not surprising when we consider  that in texts such as  Jerusalem Mendelssohn himself articulated consistent  philo-Semitic and subaltern sympathies: “Reader! To whatever visible church,  CLS 47.1_04.indd   89 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> 90 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S synagogue, or mosque you may belong! See if you do not fi nd more true  religion among the host of the excommunicated than among the far greater  host of those who excommunicated them.”6 4 Rather than encouraging Jews  to conform to German and Christian cultural norms, as he is often accused  of doing, Mendelssohn’s subversive strategy in  Jerusalem was to remind  Christians of Jewish and Muslim cultural and philosophical achievement  and of an impressive Judeo-Arabic heritage typifi ed by the powerful Jewish  contribution to culture and politics in Muslim lands. As Willi Goetschel  argues, Mendelssohn leaves us in no doubt that Christian Europe has a  “reprehensible past” and that the Jews’ fortunes are better in Ottoman lands  than in Europe where they are disenfranchised from most of the professions  and from political participation.6 5 I quote from J erusalem :   It may be true in our times that Jews in Christian states are in better  circumstances than in Muslim states; but never have they been so  cruelly persecuted, murdered, tortured, burnt, robbed and chased away  naked than by Christian governments and theologians of the Middle  Ages. Still nowadays Jews in Turkish lands pay only a moderate head  tax and suffer little more than other subjects. . . . The number of Jews  in Muslim states is probably higher than in Christian states. Thanks to  their excellent skills as physicians and also as state offi cials they often  rise in Muslim states to a position of honor. . . . Even now the prime  minister of the Emperor of Morocco is a Jew called Sumbul.6 6   In this respect the Jerusalem of Mendelssohn’s famous work is also the  Jerusalem of Lessing’s  Nathan the Wise , published only a few years earlier,  a polyglot space protected by the mature and benign sovereignty of the  Muslim leader Saladin, in which Jews, Christian, and Muslims are brought  into a relationship of mutual respect. It is also a Jerusalem where Jews and  Arabs must forge political alliances, as Nathan and Saladin do, to fend off  ravaging Christian armies, a counternarrative to Christian Europe’s fear of  invading Muslim hordes.   Mendelssohn’s Jerusalem is a site of negotiation and exchange between  different cultures and faiths, a heterogeneous zone of contact that is capable  of edifying prejudiced Christians as to what constitutes civilized behavior.  It is the Jerusalem of the noble and principled Saladin, who spares the life  of the Knight Templar and encourages intermarriage between Christians  and Muslims. It is also the Jerusalem of Nathan, who instructs the initially  anti-Semitic Knight Templar on the values of pluralism, deploying, like Jesus,  the parable form to encourage the Knight Templar’s acceptance of a shared  CLS 47.1_04.indd   90 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="22">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 91 humanity (“one gnarled branch must accept another”) and reminding him  that no single “treetop” should assume that it alone did not spring from the  ground, a reference to Christianity’s violent attempts to suppress its Jewish  origins (1283–86).   Following Willi Goetschel, I think Mendelssohn should be interpreted  as a vigorous “cosmopolitan citizen” and anticolonialist liberal thinker who  was fi ercely critical of ethnocentrism and who refused to concede the state  or the church the right to sit in judgment on matters of religion and inner  conscience. Inheriting Spinoza’s liberal republicanism and critique of the  mischief caused by revealed religions, Mendelssohn conceives of Judaism  as equally accessible in its ethical precepts, such as the notion of God’s  providence, to every human being.  Jerusalem is therefore a harsh critique  of the universalist claims of revealed religions and the colonial institutions  they require to promulgate their teachings. In what is probably an allusion  to Diderot’s fi ercely anticolonial and anti-imperialist contributions to the   Histoire philosophique des deux Indes (1772– ) edited by the Abbé Guillaume- Thomas Raynal, Mendelssohn, following Spinoza, challenges the notion of  a people chosen by revelation:   If therefore, mankind must be corrupt and miserable without rev- elation, why has the far greater part of mankind lived without true  revelation from time immemorial? Why must the two Indies wait  until it pleases the Europeans to send them a few comforters to bring  them a message without which they can, according to this opinion,  live neither virtuously nor happily? . . . According to the concepts of  true Judaism, all the inhabitants of the earth are destined to felicity;  and the means of attaining it are as widespread as mankind itself. . . .  As often as it was useful, Providence caused wise men to arise in every  nation on earth.6 7   The last statement fi nds its echo in Nathan’s reassuring overture to the  distrustful Knight Templar, suspicious of the pride and exclusivity of the  Jews: “Good people are produced in every land” (2.5.1273).   Saladin’s sister Sittah also provides an acerbic commentary on the impe- rial violence of the Christian nations, which suggests that  Nathan the Wise  is keen to evoke “the Crusades through Arab eyes”:   Sittah: Their pride is: to be Christian, but not human.   Even that mixture of humanity   And superstition, which their founder gave to them,  CLS 47.1_04.indd   91 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="23"> 92 COMPARAT IVE  L I TERATURE  STUD IE S  They love not for its human values,   But because Christ teaches it, Christ did it.   . . . Not his virtue; it’s his name   That must be spread throughout the world, that must   Dishonour and devour the names of all   Good people. For the name, the name alone,   Is everything to them. (2.1.868–79)   We are reminded of Lessing’s comment in his famous treatise on  aesthetic principles, the  Hamburg Dramaturgy (1767–69): “[The] Crusades,  at the outset a political subterfuge of the popes proved one of the most  inhuman of persecutions of which Christian superstition has been guilty.” 68   Conclusion: The Wandering Jew   So far I hope to have indicated that N athan the Wise is not an ahistorical  or abstractly humanist drama about tolerance but a powerful commentary  on the nightmare of history, its cyclical violence, its hubris and folly, its  redemptive possibilities. The character of Nathan has a choric function,  as he stands outside of history’s madness. Late in the play we fi nd out that  during the Crusades the Christians murdered all the Jews, including wives  and children, in the Mediterranean town of Gath. Among those murdered  were Nathan’s wife and seven sons, all “full of promise,” burned to death in  his brother’s house (4.7.3040–44). After initially swearing undying hatred  for Christendom Nathan’s reason returns, and in another moment of all- too-human providence, he is presented with the possibility of bringing up  an orphaned Christian child, Recha, by a kindly Christian, the lay brother.  As the lay brother points out, children need love more at a young age than  they need Christianity, and anyway, was not all of “Christianity founded on  Judaism?” (4.7.3021–22).   In a sense, then, Nathan is a redeemer fi gure and martyr, taking on  himself the burden of renewing and regenerating a world sundered by hatred,  tyranny, and the desire for conquest. Yet he is not a messiah, not the Christ;  he represents no fi nal revealed truth, no decisive historical event that compels  recognition and obedience. Rather, Nathan redeems us from the very idea  of a redeemer, of a sacred history that includes some groups and excludes  others. The histories he evokes are multiple and the future he strives for open  ended. He is the wandering Jew who mediates between different cultures,  CLS 47.1_04.indd   92 11/03/10   3:20 AM </page> <page sequence="24">  A  D IA S POR IC  READ ING 93 he is the unsettling stranger depicted by George Simmel who comes today  and stays tomorrow but is never reconciled to his adopted home, remaining  skeptical, detached, wary, and observant of human nature. Yet Nathan is  also the garrulous and generously sociable sage Socrates, constantly drawing  people into conversation, questioning the way they rationalize their own  lust for power, disarming them with narratives, parables, and metaphors,  humbly confessing his ignorance. Now a famous political theorist, in the  1960s Hannah Arendt favorably reappraised N athan the Wise as a “classical  drama of friendship.” 69 Rather than as a bland illustration of the virtues of  tolerance Arendt came to reinterpret  Nathan the Wise as a humanist depic- tion of the importance of friendship as that form of human sociability that  makes “political demands and preserves reference to the world.” 70 Arendt  seems here to be implicitly alluding to the epochal friendship of Lessing  and Mendelssohn, a friendship and creative collaboration that challenged  orthodoxies, gave voice to the oppressed, called for freedom of thought,  and promoted cultural experimentation. Like the mature Arendt, I think  we should refrain from judging N athan the Wise ’s message as naïve and  ineffective, instead recognizing the timeliness of its philo-Semitic challenge  to Eurocentrism and orientalism, its pluralist approach to history, and its  emphasis on the importance of cross-cultural dialogue.   Australian National University   Notes  1.  Analyzing a characteristically bleaker post-Holocaust dramatic interpretation of  Lessing’s play, Anat Feinberg describes the Hungarian-born Jewish playwright George  Tabori’s N athans Tod (1991) as a “highly original and subversive . . . variation on Lessing’s  appeal for tolerance,  Nathan the Wise —indeed an anti-Lessing piece in which evil has the  upper hand”(E mbodied Memory: The Theatre of George Tabori [Iowa City: University of Iowa  Press, 1999], 47). As scholars of postwar dramatizations of N athan the Wise have argued, “The  more provocative N athan stagings by Claus Peymann, Joshua Sobol, and George Tabori in  postwar, post-Auschwitz Germany have concentrated on the pogrom that destroyed Nathan’s  family, and have emphasized the pronouncement of the Christian patriarch who exclaims . . .  “the Jew shall be burned” (Barbara Fischer and Thomas C.
