Pp. viii + 278. Huli [Papua New Guinea] Q: I ambolo beraria minaribe? Where did you get that baby from? A: Hai maneha beraria minaru/ Anga maneha beraria minaru I got it from the banana/pandanus tree. [Huli caretakers frequently identify heard but unseen frogs in the bush as 'babies'; when a newborn arrives, the above response given here references the frogs mentioned on these previous occasions (Goldman I99I).] Anglo-American/Australian Q: Where do babies come from? A: I found it under the mulberry bush/in the cabbage patch The stork brought it. These stereotypical question-response sequences do more than register an intercultural coincidence. For the analyst, such routines are content rich. They tell us much about children as homo interrogans, their response to a new arrival, and the problems that confront adults in accounting for new- borns. As fecund symbols or familiar locations, banana and pandanus seem here functionally comparable to a mulberry bush/cabbage patch or to the nurturing imagery evoked by "stork and sling," no doubt suggested by storks' habit of nesting in human abodes through northern Europe. Furthermore, we understand from these routines that certain types of knowledge are, for certain audiences, classified in nature such that our culturally shaped re- sponses are sensitive to the expediency of deception. Children are socialized through deception as much as to deception, and indeed concealment is a per- vasive theme in Melanesian ethnography. The culturally specific messages en- coded by the responses are also noteworthy, for in Huli the frog is a symbol of loquacity and figures in language development practices (Goldman 1987). For Huli children, the most significant aspect of a new arrival is not the pres- 663</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS ence of a new body but a new voice. Such seemingly mundane interchanges serve to open up the subcultural world of caretaking and as such are relevant both to the general aims of Schieffelin's book as well as the specific reser- vations expressed herein. For like it or hate it, intercultural similarity and dif- ference continue to define, for both the general and academic audience, endpoints in this discipline. They are what most captures the imagination of outsiders and what, if only superficially, can provide escape from resort to unending cultural relativisms. The primary goal of this book is to show how, through a fine-grained examination of everyday verbal interaction, Kaluli (Papua New Guinea) chil- dren are linguistically socialized into culturally appropriated roles, relation- ships, and the complementary modalities of assertion and appeal. We learn much about the gender-inflected patterns concerning the speech acts of teas- ing, requesting, and denying as facets of a prevailing ethos of reciprocity - of give and take (see Sillitoe 1978) - in this egalitarian society. The work is highly focused culturally, theoretically, and in the levels of ethnographic data tapped. Beyond demonstrating the importance of language as an analytical resource, there are no governing hypotheses, little historical depth given to the Kaluli, and almost no comparisons/parallels drawn either of a regional or global nature. What emerges is a picture of socialization that makes sense both in its own terms and in reference to the picture of adult Kaluli life as sketched by other fieldworkers. Schieffelin's prose style is highly accessible to a general audience, though readers will have to quickly accommodate to the type of presentational for- mat she adopts. This largely consists of conversational grabs, dyadic or tri- adic in nature, that we are eased through on a word-by-word/line-by-line basis to illustrate the points addressed. Chapter I provides a general intro- duction to this lowland culture highlighting both the importance of talk and the Kaluli view of development as a process of "hardening" from a natural and uncontrolled "soft" state. This belief underpins developmental strategies aimed at "showing" children language and facilitating the passage from a mode of "appeal" to independence, autonomy, and "assertion." Chapter 2 briefs us as to the ethnographic perspective on socialization and some of the theoretical and methodological problems that beset the collec- tion and presentation of transcript data. It is here that the serious scholar may be dissatisfied with the particular compromises made, for accessibility has been purchased at the expense of both theoretical advance and an ex- panded range of cultural information that might otherwise have been in- cluded. For example, no attempt has been made here to situate the findings within the broader disciplinary themes of language development such as the motherese hypothesis. One questions the necessity for descriptive statements such as "like family life in most places, Kaluli family interactions are highly repetitive, undertaken in like manner day after day" (20). This redundancy 664</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS of detail is particular irksome in Chapter 3, where we are introduced to the four principal child actors: Abi, Wanu, Suela, and Meli. Their biographies are so finely etched as to include the idiosyncratic nature of the materials used in their clothing or the positional incline of their houses. Moreover, they are highly impressionistic and anecdotal in nature: "children generally seem to enjoy themselves . . . there are lots of things to do, and it is a break from the routine of the village . . . people seemed relaxed and enjoyed their time in the forest" (42). Such reports take on a quasi-psychiatric tinge when we are told that not only has Abi a "quick temper . . . not easily appeased . . . [and is] attached to his mother" (47) but also that his "adjustment to his new brother was difficult" (47). The author displays here and elsewhere a dangerous tendency to rely on her audience's intuitive grasp of behavioral categories when interactional labels like "sarcasm" (I52, 155, 177) or "abrupt- ness" (209) need to be explained with respect to precisely how they were coded. Given the noticeable lack of magical rites or spells in child development practices, one might ponder the missed opportunities for some pointed and much-needed comparative excursions. Does Schieffelin perceive the Lowland (Kaluli, Etoro)-Highlands (Huli, Melpa, Enga, Mendi) dichotomy as barrier, boundary, or bridge? Such seemingly innocent details as the fact that Kaluli children have their heads shaved but leave a little "topknot" (235) screams out for further comment in light of the well-documented association between growth-hair-fontanelle- and spirit passages in the region. Again, from the viewpoint of Highlands ethnography, does the postnatal taboo on fathers have a name, and are there underlying rationales of pollution to be teased out here? Succinctly stated, the view of socialization as refracted through se- lected verbal interchanges is unnecessarily narrow. For further insight into concepts of gender stereotypes and growth should we not draw on resources such as nursery rhymes, folktales, myths, folk heroes, spells, and so forth? Had certain rituals or games ceased to exist at the time of Schieffelin's field- work? What of the Kaluli view of speech disorders like stammering? More- over, one gains little impression of the ambience of deception - forms of bribery, corruption, and false promise - so strategically central and common in both Western and Highlands socialization practices. The question is legit- imately raised as to whether these are mere absences or omissions. The lack of attention to such topics is the more regrettable for the inclusion of irrel- evant details already noted and indeed the inclusion in places (e.g., Chap- ter 4) of already published materials. Too often we gain the impression that Kaluli children are subject to a daily diet of language lessons. Talking is cer- tainly a serious business, but not all talking is taken seriously, and the no- tion of "play for play's sake" is not well captured here. We are indeed exposed to routine forms of teasing and shaming, but they lack the typical preformulated structure found elsewhere in the region. But then, Kaluli cul- 665</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS ture apparently lacks a whole gamut of named games (222) (even cat's cra- dle?) that might otherwise have provided an important window onto the subculture of the child. The basic features of this socialization system include an abundance of tri- adic interactions and instances where mothers will speak for infants as in- fants, making sure the child appears as a communicative and responsible interlocutor. No babytalk (BT) lexicon is employed, and there is general dis- couragement of sound play as being like "birds"' speech. Again, this con- trasts with Highlands cultures where avian and human speech parallel each other. One wonders to what extent anthropomorphism occurs here. In neigh- boring Huli, for example, Spine-tailed Swifts (yagombe) that constantly dart about are heard to say "my penis is hurting, my penis is hurting," an indi- cation that rain will fall by analogy with human urination. The passage of explaining these practices by reference to an ideology of hardening in which there is minimal accommodation of speech input to children may not be quite as smooth as Schieffelin assumes. There are other societies in the region where similar beliefs prevail, where models of "repeat after me" operate, but where BT still occurs. Chapter 4 provides a lengthy analysis of this 'say after me' (clema) model, which can take both a dyadic and triadic form where caretakers tell a child to say something to another child. eIema socializes the child into the modal- ity of assertion but functions also in correction sequences of a grammatical, phonological, and pragmatic nature. Here, Schieffelin provides an interest- ing account of its occurrence in teasing, shaming, insults, and threats. The functions accorded such interactional exchanges are fairly tried and tested. They inculcate an understanding of turn-taking and promote the acquisition of ethnography of speech conventions. Moreover, Schieffelin sees this behav- ior as helping to establish and solidify reciprocal relationships. We further note the preference for avoiding direct confrontation. ,Thus, mothers engaged in rejections, or tellings off, will often reference an absent third-party author- ity figure as a potential punisher, just as children can become vehicles for the expression of a mother's anger. Chapter 5 addresses the contrasting mode of appeal as embedded within the sibling relationship known as ade. This has an affectual dimension as older sisters are encouraged to "feel sorry" for their younger brothers. At an early age, children appear as consummate strategists constantly monitoring and adjusting their verbal outputs. This impression gets reinforced in Chapter 6, which examines the grounding of reciprocity in some special named rela- tionships like wi eledo (food based) or nesu (bridewealth based). In teasing and shaming routines, rhetorical questions emerge as a key linguistic choice by speakers and even young children appear skilled in the use of these and third-party threats: "children are encouraged to think that the selection of the appropriate verbal form is critical to the desired outcome of the imme- 666</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS diate situation" (I62). The emphasis on the pedagogic metamessages begs the question of how far participants are conscious of these. The examples pro- vided of interplay between heightened frustration/anger followed by placa- tion through offerings of breast are rationalized by Schieffelin as ways "of rebalancing the relationship" (174). They may equally signal an end to the "game" or a means of coping with tantrums. But Schieffelin's viewpoint on these routines derives from her explicit acceptance of the adult-grounded culture - described by E. Schieffelin (1976) as the reference framework - and most particularly ideas about opposition scenarios. The logic behind this choice is understandable as an attempt to trace the socialization path from child to adult, to integrate her account with other available reports, but one cannot help feeling that perhaps the order of priority should have been reversed. That we needed to broaden the horizons of our knowledge about "children" as a means of reanalyzing our perspectives on adult Kaluli behavior. I found Chapters 7 and 8 to be by far the most interesting and insightful. The former looks at the language of requests, which covaries with object de- sired (breast, food vs. objects), addressee (mothers vs. others), and intended recipient (self vs. others). The analysis is extended to cover choices in affect- marked pronouns, verbs, and voice quality. Special baby forms of the verb give occur and there are significant differences in use between younger and older children. Indirectness is again prevalent in the conversational extracts as a technique by which such exchanges are continued. Chapter 8 focuses on how Elema is a gender-specific nurturing routine among children and the im- pact this has on socialization of gender roles in Kaluli. The finding is made that boys are socialized differently from girls. There is a high toleration of aggressive acts by boys and they are playfully indulged; by contrast, care- takers display "abruptness" to girls. Such discontinuities are related to the overarching themes of assertion and autonomy. Given the dearth of full-length monographs on the topic of socialization for this region, the book is both a welcome and highly significant contribu- tion. Children have always lagged well behind women as ethnographic voices worthy of a hearing. For the general audience, their pleasure will not be di- minished by the kinds of reservations expressed herein. Research scholars, however, may well feel a little disappointed that an opportunity to indulge in theoretical and comparative excursions was given up for the safe confines of well-trodden paths. I am left wondering whether Kaluli children ask their mothers where babies come from, and what answers are forthcoming. REFERENCES Goldman, L. R. (I987).
