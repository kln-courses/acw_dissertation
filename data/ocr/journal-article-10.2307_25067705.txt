Cloth, $45.00, ISBN 0-19-726280-5. Scholars who study ceramic figurines may differ in their temporal and geographic interests, but they all face similar constraints. Many more figurines come from rubbish dumps than from the settings in which they were originally used. Virtually no figurine comes with any form of written identification. It should come as no surprise, then, that there is little consensus about the purpose of clay miniatures. Were they secular objects such as toys or hermeneutic devices, or were they used in religious pursuits, as votives or as representations of deities? Indeed, is it reasonable to expect a single overarching explanation to cover all known figurines? As Roger Moorey points out in his excellent new book entitled Idols of the People: Miniature Images of Clay in the Ancient Near East, "At the best of times few things in archaeology are more elusive than the definition of functions determined socially rather than inherent in the objects themselves" (pp. 67-68).1 The absence o? broadly accepted guidelines makes the study of figurines even more daunting. Scholars o? historic period figurines utilize research on prehistoric periods and on regions outside the Near East, to develop their own theoretical frameworks. In addition, they increasingly utilize methodological advances drawn from fields such as anthropology and women's studies. Recent archaeological discoveries have had a powerful impact on biblical scholarship, which in turn has influenced the interpretation of figurines from Iron Age Israel and Judah. Moorey's interest in figurines spanned his lengthy career in archaeology. The author of more than a hundred books, articles, museum handbooks and more, he wrote about iconography and imagery on many occasions.2 Most recently, he catalogued the Ashmolean Museum's collection of Near Eastern terracottas (p. x). In the three 2001 Schweich lectures that provided the basis for Idols of the People, Moorey set out to examine ceramic figurines from Bronze Age Syria and Canaan and from Iron Age Israel and Judah. In his words, "These miniature images are treated ... as a distinctive phenomenon with prehistoric antecedents and recurrent characteristics across millennia" (p. ix). This theme was developed as figurines were examined not as isolates, but rather as elements integral to larger archaeological assemblages. While this might sound commonsensical, it is certainly not common.  Anthropomorphic figurines are rarely viewed in conjunction with zoomorphic or other counterparts; female figurines are rarely analyzed in conjunction with their male counterparts; figurines are rarely looked at in conjunction with images on seals and sealings, and so forth. Putting them all together, as Moorey has so ably done, changes the discussion. 116 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 70:2 (2007)</page><page sequence="2">The first chapter of Idols of the People looks at theory and at prehistoric miniatures; the second and third chapters examine the figurines of the Bronze and Iron Ages. Highlights of chapter 1, "In the Beginning: Origins and Originating Questions," are several. One is Moorey's discussion of miniaturization, as seen through the lens of Neolithic figurines. By comparing the rather large figurines from Prepottery Neolithic B "Ain Ghazal with the miniature pieces from that same site, Moorey differentiates between community and household ritual. In addition, he reflects on the meaning of miniaturization and the "performative potential" of miniature pieces in re ligio-magical rites (p. 18). Another highlight is Moorey's insight into the relationship between gender and figurines. In his opinion, the appearance of male figurines in third-millennium Sumer must be related to the emergence of the state. Their function may not have been religious, but rather should be seen as a component of male dominated socio-political events. He returns to this insight in chapter 2, when he discusses the appearance of male statuary and the advent of the Middle Bronze Age city-state, and in chapter 3, when he links terracottas depicting males to the Iron Age states of Israel and Judah. Moorey concludes chapter 1 by suggesting that no single scholarly interpretation should be privileged over another, if each is "well grounded in the available evidence" (p. 22). In chapter 2, "Terracottas in Early Complex Societies: Sumer, Babylonia, Syria, Egypt and Canaan (ca. 3000-1150 BC)," the discussion of the Bronze Age focuses on the most popular type of ceramic figurine, which depicts "a youthful, nude female shown full-frontal in low relief, with and without attributes, on hand held clay plaques, which were mass-produced to relatively standard patterns in one-piece open molds" (p. 23). First found in third-millennium Sumer, it was produced by elite religious authorities that took pains to coordinate matters of intellectual and ideological significance. In early-second millennium Babylon, the nude female was one among many terracotta images. In Syria, it first appeared in the Middle Bronze II, when it was associated with the goddess Ishtar. At this same critical juncture in city-state formation, male imagery was represented in monumental art. In Late Bronze Age Canaan, male imagery, fabricated in metal, predominated in the temple cult. Both the identity and the function of the ever-popular plaque figurine remain obscure, even as it provides insight into Canaanite culture. (Eventually, according to Moorey, it would become Canaan's legacy to the states of the Iron Age.) In addition, the plaque figurine offers "... rare access to the popular rituals of women, _ as distinct from those of male-dominated official, temple-based cults in Late Bronze Age Canaan" (p. 23). To discuss them, Moorey turns to Egypt and notes Hathor's enduring role as the goddess protective of mothers and their children. Through their association with Hathor, Egyptian figurines were charged with the power to ensure fertility, and Moorey suggests that this is how they would have functioned in Canaan, too. That is, they were not representations of deities, but rather procreative talismans associated with female domestic piety. One of the most popular plaque figurines of the Late Bronze Age has floral, costume, and other attributes, while the other lacks these attributes but holds its arms in several typical postures. Both are Near Eastern in origin but the former displays Egyptianizing features and does not survive beyond the end of the Late Bronze Age. Apotropaic or prophylactic in function, they would have served to establish the relationship between an individual and her deity. Moorey accepts neither of their common appellations, "Qudshu" or "Astarte." With chapter 3, "Terracotta Imagery in Israel and Judah under the Divided Monarchy (ca. 925-586 BC)," Moorey turns to the figurative imagery of the Iron Age. Much of his analysis is centered on the "Asherah" or Judean pillar figurines of the ninth century and later. What makes his analysis so interesting is that he looks at these figurines as components within the larger assemblage of Iron II terracottas, which also includes horse and other zoomorphic figurines, horse-and rider figurines, male rider figurines, as well as furniture and building miniatures. He acknowledges the importance of the inscriptions from Khirbet el-Q?m and Kuntillet (Ajrud, which link the Israelite god Yahweh to the goddess Asherah. At the same time, he refutes the common identification between the pillar figurines and Asherah. Instead, Moorey suggests that male and female figurines must be considered together, as votaries or human supplicants of the divine, reflective of the concerns of the private domestic world. They must be studied within the context of individual piety and of family and community worship, rather than as components of official cultic practice. He concludes that "if the full range of male and female images, of animals and birds, and of furniture are taken together, they epitomize the primary pre-occupations of the common people, whether acting individually or corporately: the continuity of the family (past, present and future) and of the household in all its aspects. Which supernatural powers were particularly solicited through these images is not self-evident and not yet elucidated beyond reasonable doubt by any written evidence directly associated with them" (p. 65). NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 70:2 (2007) 117</page><page sequence="3">Idols of the People is a book that is well researched, well reasoned, and thoughtful. It takes a popular topic, the study of ceramic figurines, and discusses it in new and interesting ways. Moorey's insistence that preconceived notions be put aside, that interpretation be based on all relevant archaeological data, and that assemblages be considered in their entirety, may not be unique. What makes his analysis so effective is that he does precisely what he proposes to do. Looking across western Asia, Cyprus, and Egypt, he examines the longue dur?e and underscores recurrent iconographie motifs within specific archaeological and socio-historical contexts. Idols of the People is a thought-provoking study of a most fascinating topic.
