<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Temple of Confucius and Pictorial Biographies of the Sage JULIA K. MURRAY SETS OF NARRATIVE PICTURES PORTRAYING the life of Confucius (Fig. 1; all figures appear at the end of the text) first appeared in considerable numbers in the late Ming period, typically under the title Sheng-chi t'u (Pictures of the Sage's Traces; hereafter SCT) or some close variant.' Produced at varying levels of expense, these illustrated biographies or hagiographies were made in a variety of media, such as woodblock prints, paintings on silk, and incised stone tablets. The various examples also exhibit a wide range of artistic quality. These differences in quality and form suggest that pictorial biographies were made for multiple purposes and for diverse audiences. Furthermore, the pictorial biographies differ in total numbers of scenes and in specific episodes selected for inclusion. These differences in content imply disparate conceptions of Confucius and the significance of his life. For a variety of reasons, the SCT has been virtually ignored in scholarly literature. The only publication to do more than simply reproduce one of the sets of pictures is Koshi gaden (Pictorial Biography of Confucius) by the modern Japanese intellectual historian Kaji Nobuyuki. Kaji uses color plates of an anonymous late Ming album of SCT paintings (Fig. 2) to illustrate his chronicle of events in Confucius's life, and he supplements each color plate with two or three small monochrome reproductions of the corresponding scene from various other sets of SCT, including Japanese as well as Chinese ones. An appendix by Sato Kazuyoshi, a specialist in Chinese literature, Julia K. Murray is an Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Wisconsin, Madison. A preliminary version of this paper was prepared for the 1995 AAS panel, "On Sacred Grounds: The Material Culture and Ritual Formation of the Confucian Temple in Late Imperial China," organized by Thomas Wilson. I wish especially to thank him and the discussant, Sue Naquin, for their penetrating comments and helpful suggestions. I also thank Lu Zongli for his assistance in an earlier phase of my investigation, and Benjamin Elman for other advice. Finally, for their financial support of my research, I am deeply grateful to the Smithsonian Institution, American Council of Learned Societies, Chiang Ching-kuo Foundation, Metro- politan Center for the Study of Far Eastern Art, and the University of Wisconsin Graduate School. 1SCT is used in this article to refer both to the general category and to specific sets of pictures of the life of Confucius.

MURRAY provides a short bibliographic essay and partial list of extant Chinese and Japanese versions. Because the SCT is predominantly pictorial, it has not otherwise attracted the interest of textually oriented sinologists, whose distrust of images is validated by well-established patterns in European and Chinese thought (Mitchell 1986; Sommer 1994). Moreover, most SCT illustrations are annotated with textual explanations that are drawn from well-known sources and thus contain little "new" information about Confucius; and the poetic eulogies (tsan) that embellish some sets are apparently of no literary importance (Sato 1991-92). In addition, most extant representations of Confucius's life include paranormal events that modern sensibilities judge to be supernatural (Fig. 3), so scholars have discounted the biographical reliability or seriousnesss of the compilations. The hagiographical elements should make the SCT interesting to students of religion, but even these scholars have not studied it, perhaps because the cult of Confucius is usually perceived as less than fully "religious" (de Bary 1991), although this view now seems untenable (Feuchtwang 1992; Huang 1994; Wilson 1995a and b). Even art historians have completely overlooked the SCT, primarily because it belongs to categories of visual representation that are not generally regarded as "artistic" and thus worthy of study. One reason is that the SCT is more often rendered in printed or carved media than in the generally more prestigious medium of painting. The majority of examples are woodblock-printed books or albums, followed by rubbings from stone tablets incised with the pictures. The dominance of media whose purpose is to facilitate replication underscores the fact that most versions of the SCT were made in multiples and were intended to be disseminated; they were not unique masterpieces for rarefied aesthetic contemplation. Today, examples of the SCT are more likely to be kept in libraries and rare book collections than in museums and private collections of art, where art historians customarily find their objects of study. Secondly, the SCT cannot be reliably associated with the oeuvre of any prominent or distinguished artist. The names of Yen Li-pen (d. 673), Li Kung-lin (c. 1049- 1106), and Wang Chen-p'eng (c. 1280-c. 1329) have been linked with the SCT by a few writers in recent centuries, but their claims are not supported by early sources or by stylistic analysis. Lacking any link to famous old masters, the SCT is merely another example of "later illustration." Following the lead of traditional Chinese critics, modern art historians believe that illustration as a genre declined after the Sung period, because the leading masters turned to "literati" (or "scholar-amateur") modes and left more objective, representational methods to anonymous or uncelebrated artisans. As articulated by theorists and critics of the Sung and later periods, the supreme values of literati painting are artistic autonomy, cultivated self- expression, and calligraphic brushwork (Bush 1970, Bush and Shih 1985, 191-240; Egan 1994, 281-309). Landscapes and nature studies provide congenial subjects in which to realize these subjective, nonrepresentational values. Few masters tried to achieve them by depicting stories or texts, whose themes were to some extent predetermined rather than invented by the artist. In corresponding fashion, the reception of later narrative illustration is associated with unsophisticated viewers, who appreciated stories more than brushwork, and who were easily deceived by the attributions to famous Six Dynasties, T'ang, and Sung painters that were spuriously attached to many illustrative paintings. Nonetheless, even if figural illustration was no longer considered by elite connoisseurs to be "artistic," it did offer a practical means of instructing persons of little education, and even literate viewers found illustrations visually pleasing. Although story-pictures were dismissed as declasse by the most sophisticated critics, illustrations of many kinds were made in great profusion</page><page sequence="3">THE TEMPLE OF CONFUCIUS 271 during the late Ming period, for purposes that include entertainment and status- seeking as well as instruction.2 Although Japanese and Western historians of Chinese art have begun to study traditions formerly dismissed as debased,3 serial illustrations that sometimes are crudely made or that resemble modern cartoons have remained beyond the pale. In mainland Chinese scholarship, Communist sympathy for what is presumed to be folk art has brought attention to serial pictures (lien-huan hua) in general (A-ying 1980; Yung-lo-kung, 13-16), but not much to the SCT specifically, perhaps because Confucius seems the very embodiment of elitist values associated with prerevolutionary society (Staiger 1969). In short, because of the conjunction of these various circumstances, there is virtually no scholarly literature on the SCT to review here. The present article is a preliminary attempt, by an art historian, to explore the creation of the pictorial biography of Confucius and its eventual intersection with his official cult, when it was given a place at the Temple of Confucius (K'ung-miao) in Ch'ii-fu, Shantung. Generic Affiliations of the Sheng-chi t'u Within the general category of narrative illustration, the SCT belongs to the genre of multiple-episode pictorial biography, sometimes called eden, after a term common in the titles of analogous Japanese examples, such as Ippen Shonin eden (Pictorial Biography of Saint Ippen [Kohara 19911). The genre evolved in the context of religious art and is associated with transcendent figures who were worshiped as deities after their deaths. Often based to some extent on textual sources, a pictorial biography consists of a sequence of closely related illustrations that trace the significant events in the individual's life and vividly confirm his or her heroic stature. The linked scenes might be displayed on temple walls or on votive steles, or be rendered in portable media, such as scrolls and illustrated books, which lend themselves to wider dissemination. The earliest examples of pictorial biography in China probably were illustrations of the life of the Buddha Shakyamuni; indeed, the initial development of the genre itself was closely associated with Buddhism (Murray 1995). Sequential narrative representations of the Buddha's life, in which his figure did not actually appear,4 were depicted in Indian art at the Great Stupa of Sanchi in the first century B.C.E., even before anthropomorphic icons of the Buddha had come into being. Pictorial 2The storerooms of many Western museums confirm not only that illustrative pictures have survived in large quantities and exhibit a wide range of technical qualities, but also that such works appealed strongly to the foreigners who built the early collections of Chinese painting in America and Europe, unaware of or unsympathetic to the literati tradition. 3For example, women's painting (Flowering in the Shadows: Women in the History of Chinese andJapanese Painting, ed Marsha Weidner, [Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 19901); Ming professional painting (Barnhart 1993; Cahill 1978 and idem, The Painter's Practice [New York: Columbia University Press' 19941; and Suzuki 1968); later Buddhist painting (Weidner 1994); and erotic painting (Cahill, published version of 1993-1994 lectures on Chinese erotic painting, forthcoming). 4Recent scholarship on early Buddhist art rejects the long-used term "aniconic" to char- acterize such depictions, but there is no consensus on what might be a better description. For an introduction to the ongoing debate, see articles by Susan Huntington and Vidya Dehejia in Ars Orientalis 22 (1992).</page><page sequence="4">272 JULIA K. MURRAY biographies that depict the Buddha's human likeness first occurred in Gandharan stone reliefs of the second to fourth centuries C.E. In China, surviving early portrayals of the life of the Buddha date to the fifth and sixth centuries, such as the pictures on the backs of stone steles dated 425 and 543 and the undated Northern Chou mural in Cave 290 at Tun-huang (Nagahiro 1969, vii-xii). The number of scenes deemed necessary for an adequate biographical sequence range from the "Four Great Events" (Shakyamuni's birth, enlightenment, first sermon, and nirvana) in Gandharan stone reliefs, to the 200 scenes in an early Ming woodblock-printed illustrated book, Shih- chia-ju-lai ch'eng-tao ying-hua shih-chi chi (Fig. 4), which also includes events in the development of the religion after the Buddha's death. Pictures of the life of the Buddha probably were used initially in China to attract the interest of potential converts and to explain the doctrines. Somewhat later, scenes from the Buddha's life also came to be painted on temple walls. In this context, they served to create a holy environment for the performance of rituals, includ- ing the worship of iconic sculptural images, and the paintings themselves may have been worshiped as well.5 Halls dedicated to the life of the Buddha may also have been constructed in order to encourage pilgrimage to temples. Buddhist temples whose hagiographical murals have been preserved include the twelfth- century Yen-shang-ssu in Shansi and the fifteenth-century Chueh-yuan-ssu in Szechwan.6 The concept of serial pictorial biography was also adopted by the Taoist church and by popular cults that worshiped various types of deities and deified individuals. Late Yuan murals depicting the life of Lu Tung-pin in 52 scenes (Fig. 5) still survive on the walls of his primary worship hall, the Ch'un-yang-tien, at the Yung-lo-kung in Jui-ch'eng, Shansi (Jing 1995; Katz 1993; Steinhardt 1987; Yung-lo-kung). Illustrated hagiographies were also made in scroll or book form, such as the Lao-chiin pa-shih-i hua t'u-shuo (Pictorial Explanation of the 81 Transformations of Lao-tzu [Reiter 19901). In the Ming and Ch'ing periods, pictorial biographies were created for cult deities such as Kuan Yu (Kuan-ti sheng-chi t'u-chih [Fig. 61) and Ma-tsu/T'ien- hou (T'ien-hou sheng-mu shih-chi t'u-chih), and various local gods (Dean, oral communication). Such pictures offered a means of attracting people to the temple of the deity and encouraging their patronage. However, Confucius was not a god of the sort worshiped by Buddhism, Taoism, and other cults that derived considerable financial and social support from the populace. The state promoted and maintained his cult (Shryock 1932; Wilson 1995a), and its adherents were effectively limited to men who were already able and motivated to read the books that contained his teachings. Nonetheless, a degree of affinity with Buddhism and Taoism became well established during the T'ang period. In 630, T'ang T'ai-tsung ordered all counties and prefectures to erect temples for the worship of Confucius, his disciples, and canonized later followers. As in Buddhist and Taoist temples, sculptural icons of the enshrined figures served as the focus of the sacrificial rituals, which were performed twice a year. Although officials and students probably 5This speculation is inspired by Paul Katz's suggestion concerning Taoist murals (Katz 1993, 53). 6The Yen-shang-ssu murals are partially reproduced in Chung-kuo mei-shu ch'ian-chi, hui- hua pien, v. 13: Ssu-kuan pi-hua (Beijing: Wen-wu ch'u-pan-she, 1988), pls. 34-43. For the Chiieh-yuan-ssu, see Chien-ko Chiieh-yuan-ssu Ming-tai fo-chuan pi-hua (Sakyamuni's Story Mu- rals of Ming Dynasty in Jueyuan Temple, Jiange Country, Sichuan Province [sic)), Mu Hsueh- yung, comp.

Moreover, some early texts, including the so- called Han apocrypha, characterized Confucius as a heaven-sent sage with superhuman powers of prognostication and wisdom (Elman 1990, xxvii, 205-13). Therefore, while the incentives to create a multi-episode pictorial biography for Confucius might have been weaker than for other cult figures, there were certainly grounds to justify one. But circumstances did not call it into being until the middle Ming period. This is much later than the emergence of iconic representations of Confucius and his followers, which started to be made in the Han period (Fan Yeh n.d., 1998), and which were produced in great numbers to accommodate the proliferation of temples from the T'ang period onward. The Emergence of the Sheng-chi T'u The earliest pictorial biography of Confucius-the first SCT-was created in 1444 by the censor Chang K'ai (1398-1460; cs 1424 [Sat6 1991-19921), who selected between 29 and 34 episodes from Ssu-ma Ch'ien's biography of Confucius in the Shih- chi (Ssu-ma Ch'ien n.d., 1905-47) and had pictures made for them. Some time before Chang's death in 1460, this SCT was carved on stone tablets for preservation at his home in Ssu-ming, modern Ningpo (Yang Shou-ch'en n.d.). Chang's colophon says that he annotated each scene with the relevant text from the Shih-chi and a poetic eulogy (tsan) of his own composition (Chang K'ai 1444). As a preface to the entire set, he transcribed Chu Hsi's preface to the Lun-yi (Analects), in which Chu presented a highly selective summary of the Shih-chi biography of Confucius (Chu Hsi n.d., 29- 31). Although Chang K'ai's original compilation is no longer extant, I have been able to reconstruct most of it from later versions (Murray forthcoming). The narrative sequence begins with Confucius's mother praying for a son on Ni-shan, followed by one scene from his childhood (cf. Fig. 11) and then proceeding directly to events of his young adulthood and maturity. Confucius is shown traveling around the realm in search of an upright ruler to serve and withdrawing to compile the classics and teach his disciples (Fig. 7). The last scene depicts Han Kao-tsu's sacrifice at Confucius's grave in 195 B.C.E. (Fig. 8), an important posthumous event. All in all, Chang's SCT presents a thoroughly humanistic portrayal of Confucius as a teacher, transmitter, and frustrated statesman, not as a godlike being. In his colophon, Chang K'ai states that he compiled the illustrated biography in order to promote the correct Way more widely and avoid the delusion of heterodox ideas (i chi-kuang chi-tsun cheng-lu, pu-wei i-tuan t'a-ch'i chih huo). Confucius's life embodied the lofty values that Chinese officials were expected to have absorbed as they prepared for civil service examinations and positions in government. 7Valerie Hansen has suggested that candidates prayed at local Confucian temples for success in civil service examinations, and that some people believed that Confucius could work other miracles (Hansen 1990, 181, 36-37). Ch'en Kuo-tung has presented evidence that late Ming scholars occasionally went into a Confucian temple and wept (k'u-miao) to protest some officially perpetrated injustice (Ch'en 1992). Confucian temples may also have experienced "gentry tourism" by educated men who came for inspiration or just out of curiosity (Huang 1994; Susan Naquin, private communication).</page><page sequence="6">274 JULIA K. MURRAY Furthermore, the Sage's own unsuccessful career provided them with a model for respectable and principled failure in times when the ruler was deficient and circumstances unfavorable for fulfilling the ideal of service. Accordingly, it must be significant that Chang compiled the pictorial biography just after a major incident involving Wang Chen (d. 1449), the first of the notorious Ming eunuchs to usurp imperial prerogatives. In the seventh lunar month of 1443, Wang arrested Li Shih- mien (1374-1450), the chancellor of the Directorate of Education (kuo-tzu-chien chi- chiu) and forced him to sit in the gateway wearing a cangue (Ming-shih n.d., 134; Mote and Goodman 1985). The students responded by demonstrating outside the palace, and Li was released after three days, but Wang was not punished. The affair marked a serious escalation of tensions between scholar-officials and eunuchs, who had gained power in court politics despite the Ming founder's prohibition. In the third lunar month of 1444, a major rebuilding of the national university (t'ai-hsueh) was completed and the Cheng-t'ung emperor made an official visit, during which he performed a sacrifice at the adjacent Temple of Confucius (Ming-shih n.d., 134). Chang K'ai wrote his colophon in the middle of the seventh month, exactly a year after the original disturbance and only months after the apparent resumption of normalcy. The wording of his signature indicates that he compiled the SCT in his official capacity as censor. By commemorating Confucius, the paragon and virtual patron saint for scholar-officials and aspiring students, Chang reaffirmed the fundamental value of moral self-cultivation as the only appropriate qualification for political involvement. It is intriguing that Chang resorted to the genre of pictorial biography, because the literati customarily advanced their ideas through texts; particularly by submitting memorials to the throne, writing commentaries on the classics, or compiling anthologies of Confucian thought (Wilson 1995a). However, pictures on a theme that was absolutely above reproach offered a vehicle for advocating a view that might elicit severe retaliation from the emperor or his eunuch confidant, if presented more directly. Moreover, pictures purport to give a concrete reality to diffuse or distant events, so Chang may have chosen the medium of serial illustration for its potential to convey ideas more vividly than words. A pictorial biography of Confucius might enable viewers to "see" the Sage in action and impress his example more forcefully. Chang K'ai's pictorial biography of Confucius circulated through sets of rubbings, one of which eventually came into the hands of Ho T'ing-jui (d. ca. 1497), a prefect of Hengyang, Hunan. According to a colophon written in 1497 by a group of colleagues,8 Ho had acquired 29 pictures from Chang K'ai's SCT and showed them to his friends, savoring the illustrations and chanting Chang's tsan. Aware that the work was little known, Ho resolved to reproduce it for wider dissemination. Nonetheless, he felt that Chang had left some important events out of the biography and decided to supplement it. While having an anonymous craftsman copy the existing pictures so that they could be carved onto woodblocks for printing, Ho selected nine additional episodes from various sources [Ssu-ma Ch'ien, n.d. K'ung-tzu chia-yi, and K'ung Yuan-ts'o 12271 and had illustrations made for them as well (e.g., Figs. 9 and 10). The additions can be readily distinguished from Chang K'ai's core group because no tsan were composed for them (compare Fig. 8). 8The colophon is preserved in editions based on Ho T'ing-jui's revision, such as one in the Harvard University Art Museum (85.536.MI.24.1971). A copy of the 1497 colophon on a Japanese folding screen is reproduced and transcribed into Japanese in Shisei Bunsen'e. Inter- estingly enough, Ho's colleagues refer to themselves as a "faction" (tang).</page><page sequence="7">THE TEMPLE OF CONFUCIUS 275 The scenes added by Ho T'ing-jui significantly altered the character of the SCT, because they introduced the supernatural manifestations and powers that mark Confucius as a being who was created, supported, and endorsed by heaven. In Chang K'ai's SCT, the scene in which Confucius's mother prays for a son on Ni-shan was immediately followed by one that shows the child Confucius at play, pretending to perform the rites (cf. Fig. 11). In Ho's SCT, however, three portentous episodes were inserted between these two events. First, a ch'i-lin brings an inscribed jade tablet to Confucius's mother, auguring the Sage's conception (Fig. 9). Next, his imminent birth is heralded by the appearance of two heavenly dragons and five old men in the clouds, representing the five directions. When Confucius is born, in the following scene (Fig. 3), a heavenly orchestra provides music and the infant's body bears 49 unusual signs (even Shakyamuni had only 32!), among them a five-character inscription on his chest. A scene added near the end of Confucius's life shows him receiving heavenly recognition for his editorial labors: when he sacrifices to the Northern Dipper (Pei- tou) to report that his books were completed, a red rainbow suddenly radiates from the constellation and turns into an inscribed jade tablet (Fig. 10). These prodigies establish Confucius on the same terrain with Buddhist and Taoist deities and suggest that he is a god in human guise. The remaining episodes added by Ho T'ing-jui highlight the brief periods when local rulers honored or employed Confucius. For example, he is shown serving as chung-tu-tsai (administrator of the central district) in Lu, a time when "the four quarters took him as their model" (ssu-fang tse chih). In short, Ho T'ing-jui portrayed Confucius as a heaven-sent, preternaturally intelligent and efficacious individual. The Proliferation of the Sheng-chi t'u Ho T'ing-jui's edition was published in 1497 by his colleagues, who provided funds to carve and print the blocks after his sudden death. Evidently well received, the work was extensively circulated and reprinted several times in the sixteenth century, and some of the scenes also found their way into other kinds of publications, particularly at the end of the century (Murray forthcoming). Two Ming princes issued revised editions, one in or slightly before 1506 by Chu Chien-chun, the Prince of Chi (1456-1527 [Ming-shih n.d., 36371), and the other in 1548 by Chu Yin-i, the Prince of Shen (d. 1549 [Ming-shih n.d., 36061). Chu Chien-chiin's "Chi-fu" edition even went to Japan, where it inspired not only a variety of indigenous printed books but also folding screens (Kaji 1991, 166-67, 174-75; Murray forthcoming; Shisei Bunsen'J 1938). Perhaps Ho T'ing-jui's conception of the pictorial biography was so successful because it presented a more potent Confucius, who was both more equally matched against the deities of Buddhism and Taoism and more heroic a model for scholar- officials in the increasingly contentious atmosphere of the late Ming. This representation of Confucius may also have better fulfilled the expectations of popular religion or diffused beliefs concerning deified individuals. It is important to note that the temple rituals of the official cult of Confucius had no role for any of these pictorial biographies, which were produced on individual initiative and contemplated in secular settings. Until 1530, idealized portrait-icons of Confucius and his followers served as the focus for worship and offerings in the temple (Shryock 1932; Sommer 1994). These images embodied the possibility of direct and inspirational contact with lifelike surrogates for the holy presences.</page><page sequence="8">276 JULIA K. MURRAY However, the Chia-ching ritual reform abolished representational icons from the temples of Confucius, because such embodiments were determined to have entered the cult under the influence of Buddhist and Taoist practices. Images were permitted to remain only in the temple at Ch'ii-fu, which also served as the ancestral temple of the K'ung family (Wilson 1995a). In all other temples of Confucius, the anthropomorphic icons had to be replaced with inscribed tablets, and the devotee's encounter with the spirits became a more cerebral experience. It may be no coincidence that many new editions, commercial reprints, and creative variations on the SCT came into being in the decades following the interdiction on icons in the temples of Confucius. The pictorial biographies offered an alternative means of encountering the image of the Sage and could thus address a desire for representational embodiments. Pictorial biographies of Confucius were available in some schools and academies. For example, Chu Chien-chiun had his edition of the SCT printed at the Yueh-lu Academy for distribution to its students (Ming-shih n.d., 3637). Particularly well documented is an early seventeenth-century SCT that was carved on stone tablets for the temple associated with the K'ung-chai shu-yuan (K'ung Residence Academy) in Ch'ing-p'u, Sung-chiang (K'ung-chai chih c. 1716; Murray forthcoming). The life of the Ultimate Sage and Foremost Teacher (chih-sheng hsien-shih) was an appropriate model for persons preparing themselves for public service, and pictorializations of that life were meant to be inspirational. It is possible that SCT pictures also might have served as souvenirs of a visit to major temples of Confucius, as does a cheap modern edition sold in Ch'ii-fu today. The late Ming expansion in the publishing industry (Oki 1991; Rawski 1985; Wu 1943) and the emergence of an urban visual culture (Clunas 1991) as a result of far-reaching economic and social developments were also important factors stimulating the increased numbers and diversified presentations of pictorial biographies of Confucius in the late sixteenth to early seventeenth centuries. This period saw the production of many kinds of illustrated works (Chou 1988; Chf-goku kodai hanga ten 1988), and the profusion of books in general reached a much wider audience, including persons of -only modest literacy (Hegel 1985, Johnson 1985). Many publications were concerned with moral instruction or models for conduct (Carlitz 1991; Leung 1994; Sakai 1970). In addition to serving as guides to proper behavior, some, including the SCT, may have functioned as emblems of Confucian piety. Moreover, commercial publishers sometimes used illustrations to make their books more attractive. Scenes excerpted from or inspired by the SCT came to accompany assorted texts that were generally within the sphere of Confucian ideology (e.g., K'ung-sheng ch'iian-shu [Fig. 111). From the origins and initial circulation of the pictorial biography of Confucius among the official elite, to whom it symbolized the highest ideals of the profession, the SCT thus moved out into more disparate realms of society. Confucius's significance to different audiences was multivalent, although less so than that of other cult figures, such as Lu Tung-pin (Katz 1993 and forthcoming 1996), Kuan Yu (Duara 1988), and T'ien-hou (Watson 1985). The transformations of the SCT suggest that various audiences had different interests, reading abilities, and tastes, as is indicated especially clearly by the relative proportions of uplift to entertainment. Other works fundamentally concerned with morality, such as the Lieh-ni chuan (Biographies of Exemplary Women [Carlitz 19911) and the K'ang-hsi emperor's Sacred Edict (Mair 1985), also exhibit a great diversity of treatments that make them suitable to different audiences. However, unlike other texts that "originated in elite writing and spread</page><page sequence="9">THE TEMPLE OF CONFUCIUS 277 to mass forms" (Hegel 1985, 114), the SCT seems not to have penetrated to the very lowest levels of society. The most popularized rendition of Confucius's life is found in an illustrated ch'uan-ch'i play, Hsin-pien K'ung-fu-tzu chou-yu lieh-kuo ta-ch'eng ch'i-lin chi (Newly Compiled Record of Master K'ung Making the Rounds of the States and Fulfilling the Ch'i-lin), a lowbrow and amusing work in which some of the biographical episodes are significantly reformulated. For instance, the prayer on Ni-shan is now offered by both parents in a temple with an anthropomorphic icon, instead of by Confucius's mother on a lonely hilltop; and the ch'i-lin delivers the jade tablet to Confucius's father, who does not appear at all in other illustrations of this episode (cf. Fig. 9). There are also new human-interest scenes, including one of a feast at which Confucius and his wife and child entertain his parents (who actually had died during his childhood), and one of the birth of his grandson, Tzu-ssu. Most of the nineteen illustrations are labeled with a four-character title, making it easy to find the relevant section of the play script. The Sheng-chi t'u and the Ch'ii-fu Temple At the same time that the biographical pictures were circulating within and being reshaped by late Ming unofficial culture, however, the theme retained its original symbolism and ideological thrust among the official elite in the increasingly factionalized milieu of late Ming politics. In 1592, one group of officials succeeded in installing a greatly enlarged SCT (actually entitled Sheng-chi chih t'u) in the Temple of Confucius at Ch'ii-fu itself. This recension consisted of 112 illustrations and ancillary texts that were carved on stone tablets for permanent display in the Sheng- chi-tien (Hall of the Sage's Traces), a new building erected solely for this purpose at the end of the main axis of the temple.9 The project was initiated by the censor Ho Ch'u-kuang (cs 1583) during his year of service as Regional Inspector for Shantung (Shantung hsun-an yii-shih), probably in the late 1 580s. After Ho's departure, the work was continued by K'ung Hung-fu, the district magistrate of Ch'ii-fu, and it was completed by another censor, Chang Ying-teng (also cs 1583), who came to Ch'u-fu as the Surveillance Vice-Commissioner for Shantung (Shan-tung an-ch'a fu-shih) in the autumn of 1592.10 According to Chang Ying-teng's informative inscription, Record of the Hall of Pictures of the Sage (Sheng-t'u-tien chi), which was carved on two additional tablets (transcribed in Baba 1934, 173-74 and Baba 1940, 2 bis), Ho Ch'u-kuang had found woodblocks with scenes from the life of Confucius scattered about the corridors of the temple. In order to organize and preserve the pictures, he raised funds to have them 9For photographs and architectural plans of the Sheng-chi-tien, see Ch'ii-fu K'ung-miao chien-chu, plates 98-99 and pp. 359-62.

A detailed inventory of these and other tablets in the building is given in Baba 1934, 159-74 and Baba 1940, 1-3 (bis). 10Chang's general outlook may be inferred from his lifelong preoccupation with the mar- tyred Southern Sung general Yueh Fei (1103-1141), vividly described by Kuo P'u (1511- 1593, cs 1565) in a preface to T'ang-yin Ching-chung-miao chih (1585), which Chang compiled for Yueh Fei's ancestral temple in T'ang-yin hsien, Honan.</page><page sequence="10">278 JULIA K. MURRAY carved on stone tablets and "set up in a hall where they could be solemnly admired" (tien lieh erh yan feng). The building was quickly completed and the pictures cut into stones, "but for a long time there was no plan to polish them" (erh chiu yuan pu mo chi). In late 1591, K'ung Hung-fu took charge of finishing work on the tablets. As a sixty-first-generation descendant of Confucius, he may have perceived the project as a way of promoting the prestige of the K'ung family. However, in the tenth lunar month of 1592, Chang Ying-teng assumed control and ordered K'ung to add eight scenes that pertained specifically to the fundamental principles and transmission of the Way (Fig. 12). When all the tablets were finished, Chang composed his Record as the official account of the project, listing the names of some twenty-five other officials who had contributed financial and moral support. In referring to himself and his colleagues as "the sixtieth generation of the Sage Gate [Confucius's disciplesi" (Sheng- men liu-shih ch'uan), Chang indicates how literally and seriously he conceived their place in the transmission of the Way. The first ten illustrations in the Sheng-chi-tien tablets treat the events related to Confucius's birth and early adulthood, which are largely the same as in Ho T'ing- jui's version. One picture was added to show Confucius as a youth attending school, and two existing scenes underwent significant alterations. Both depict episodes involving a birth, that of Confucius himself and that of his son, K'ung Li (a.k.a. Po- yu). Where the earlier version portrays Confucius's mother sitting with her newborn baby and heavenly musicians playing above the house (Fig. 3), the 1592 picture shows only a roof in clouds and much larger musicians (cf. Fig. 13). Likewise, mother and infant are removed from the scene in which Duke Chao of Lu bestows a carp upon Confucius, inspiring him to name his newborn son after the gift. These deletions may reflect a conservative Ch'eng-Chu view that the Sage transcended the concerns of flesh and blood. There is again a general correspondence between the 1592 tablets and earlier versions of the SCT in depicting events near the end of Confucius's life and after his death. However, the tablets go beyond Han Kao-tsu's visit in 195 B.C.E. to end with Sung Chen-tsung's pilgrimage and sacrifice in the Ch'ii-fu temple in 1008 C.E., underscoring a quantum leap in the temple's support and prestige under that emperor. The middle section of the tablets has many new scenes, most of which depict encounters between Confucius and an assortment of other people, including teachers, rulers, brigands, and disciples. The compositions are highly formulaic (Fig. 12), with few motifs to help identify the episodes, so the viewer must refer to the text to know what is represented. The texts are written directly on the pictures and are introduced by four-character titles (transcribed in Baba 1934, 169-70 and Baba 1940, 2-3 bis), which facilitate recognition and memory. In content, the texts are somewhat simplified from the classical sources, and the tsan have been discarded. The encroachment of text onto pictorial image also invokes the aesthetics of literati painting, in which it was customary to write on the picture. The permanent display of a comprehensive pictorial biography of Confucius at the most venerable temple of his cult was meant to ensure that present and future generations would be able to "see" the Sage in action, even though he was long gone from the world. Chang Ying-teng's Record states: The set came to 112 pictures, which were arrayed above the altar table. [One] can respectfully regard them and have an audience with them, or take rubbings and transmit them. Whether you ascend the hall and enter the chamber, or open a roll [of rubbings], you come face to face with virtue, almost like an admonition. If the Sage were not present in pictures nor in the hall, then by what means would he be seen?</page><page sequence="11">THE TEMPLE OF CONFUCIUS 279 Chang's confidence that these pictures offered the viewer direct access to Confucius indicates that he espoused traditional ideas concerning the efficacy and proper function of representational images. These ideas had their origins in the Ch'in-Han period, but by the late Ming were primarily associated with a populist milieu. Han murals depicted good and evil figures from the past in order to exhort viewers to better moral conduct (Powers 1991; Wu 1989). From these didactic origins, the representation of figures evolved to serve a variety of other functions, including more purely aesthetic or even hedonistic purposes (Lawton 1973). However, when the authoritative writings of Tung Ch'i-ch'ang (1555-1636) conclusively established the dominance of the literati-painting aesthetic (Ho 1992), representational art in general was devalued as too accessible to the untutored eye. Moreover, figural representation and illustration were prominently associated with Buddhism and Taoism (Sommer 1994; Weidner 1994), and with popular culture. A distrust of representational images that is more in accord with orthodox late Ming views is articulated in the second inscription composed for the Sheng-chi-tien tablets, the Statement on the Hail of the Sage's Pictures (Sheng-t'u-tien shuo; transcribed with minor abridgments in Ch'fieh-li wen-hsien k'ao [17621 1966, 889-90, repeated in Baba 1934, 17 1-73 and Baba 1940, 1-2 bis). The author, military circuit intendant Shao 1-jen (cs 1580), implies that he disapproved of the pictures and accepted the invitation to compose an encomium only because he was "concerned that someone looking at these pictures might grasp only the traces and not think about what they are traces of' (yi lI fu tu ssu t'u che ch'ih ch'i chi erh pu ssu ch'i so i chi yeh). In contrast to Chang's enthusiasm for the efficacy of pictorial images, Shao cautions that it was better to study the "traces" of Confucius in the Six Classics-his writings and teachings-instead of in "the experiences of his body and the things he did not talk about" (shen chih ching-li yi ch'i so pu yi che). Shao explains: Confucius's virtue was substantial in the extreme; certainly it is fitting that his radiant example lasts for 10,000 generations and is as inexhaustible as heaven and earth. However, that which is inexhaustible is his heart-mind, not his traces.... He used his heart-mind and obtained the transmission of Yao and Shun.... This is what he used to make himself the model for his own age and for transmission to later generations.... As for the wise man who "approaches the gate," such as the intelligent Tzu-kung, even he sought the Sage through words. All the more is this true for later generations! Furthermore, Shao felt that there was a danger that certain incidents could be taken at face value as tales of the supernatural (shen) and the strange (kuai), and that various other episodes might be superficially misconstrued as base (pi), honorable (tsun), autocratic (chuan), meritorious (kung), sycophantic (ch'u), onerous (k'un), advantage- seeking (hsun), or shameful (ju). He cautions, "[What matters is] how Confucius employed his heart-mind in these events" (K'ung-tzu ho yung-hsin yfi ch'i-chien). Shao did not disagree with the idea that Confucius was embodied in the pictures; he worried only that viewers would respond to superficial aspects of Confucius's life and not comprehend the essential principles. At best, the pictures could be an expedient means of inspiring-people to study his teachings. Nonetheless, Shao admits that his own motivation had been greatly stimulated by coming to Ch'ii-fu: I climbed the Apricot Altar, waded in the Chu and Ssu Rivers, and saw the beauty of the Temple of Confucius. And my desire to study increased by leaps and bounds over what it had been in the past. Now, won't the establishment of the Hall of the Sage's Pictures also stimulate the intention of later people?</page><page sequence="12">280 JULIA K. MURRAY In suggesting that the pictures might enable other people to experience the same kind of inspiration, even if they did not have the opportunity to travel to Ch'ii-fu, Shao's concluding remark anticipates the fact that the stone tablets would become better known through reproductions than from visits in person. In addition to rubbings, a woodblock edition based on the stone tablets (Fig. 13) served to disseminate this pictorial biography more widely, perhaps to schools and academies in particular. Conclusion Just as Ho Ch'u-kuang must have anticipated in proposing to build a separate hall dedicated to the visual representation of the life of Confucius, the installation of the Sheng-chi chih t'u tablets in the Sheng-chi-tien made them more authoritative than any other version of the pictorial biography. Not only was this depiction of the Sage's life rendered in the durable material of polished stone, it was enshrined in perpetuity at the most ancient and celebrated temple of Confucius. The erection of the Sheng- chi-tien publicly associated the pictorial biography with the imperially sponsored cults of Confucius enacted at the Ch'ii-fu temple, both the state's sacrifices to Confucius as the Ultimate Sage and Foremost Teacher and the ancestral rites maintained by his descendants at state expense. Several later sets of woodblock illustrations of the life of Confucius were based on the Sheng-chi-tien tablets and drew their claims to authority from this relationship." These recarved editions made only minor changes to the pictures and texts. Whether intentionally or not, the creation of the Sheng-chi-tien was based on Buddhist and Taoist precedents for displaying the pictorial biography of the temple deity or sect founder. In Buddhist and Taoist temple layouts, the hall dedicated to the life of the deity or important patriarch of the sect was placed on the central axis behind the main sacrificial hall, as was the Sheng-chi-tien. In addition, the construction of a monument to Confucius's "traces" within his temple is reminiscent of Buddhist strategies for creating sacred places and objects within a temple or monastery in order to enhance its attraction to pilgrims (Faure 1992). In both respects, the establishment of the Sheng-chi-tien subverted the Chia-ching emperor's intent to distinguish the cult of Confucius from other religious cults. Nonetheless, the staunch members of "the sixtieth generation of the Sage Gate" perceived no conflict in choosing this means of promoting their conception of Confucius and enhancing the prestige of the Ch'ii-fu temple. It is possible that they deliberately chose the form in response to the challenge of a reinvigorated Buddhism, which flourished among the late Ming educated elite as well as the general populace (Brook 1993; Elman 1994; Weidner 1994; Yu 1981). More likely, however, Ho Ch'u-kuang and his associates did not specifically associate the concept of an enshrined pictorial biography with rival 11Major new editions, which directed the biographical illustrations to new purposes, were issued in 1874 and 1934. The former was published by K'ung Hsien-lan, a seventy-second- generation descendant of Confucius, who was worried about continued support for the cult and the K'ung family. The 1934 edition was published by Li Ping-wei of the Pei-p'ing min- she, a nationalistic group concerned that modernization had eroded important traditional val- ues. The latter edition has been reproduced several times in the 1970s and 1980s, both in Taiwan and mainland China (e.g., K'ung-tzu Sheng-chi t'u).</page><page sequence="13">THE TEMPLE OF CONFUCIUS 281 cults; they simply recognized that the genre offered a mode of visual rhetoric that was both powerful and familiar. The introduction of a pictorial biography of Confucius into the one temple that was allowed to retain its sculptural icons after the Chia-ching reform also clearly demonstrates that the SCT was more than just a surrogate for the images that had been abolished from other temples. Pictorial narrative had its own suasive power; its unfolding plot engaged the viewer's interest and drew him or her on to the desired conclusion. The patrons of the Sheng-chi-tien used pictures to create a visible embodiment of moral principles in action and presented them as complements to the texts that preserved Confucius's teachings in verbal form. Convinced that representational images might have an impact that written words alone did not, they proposed to stimulate viewers to a higher level of moral consciousness by providing vicarious contact with the Sage through pictures. The biographical narrative they enshrined was instructional, inspirational, and celebratory. It is also significant that the pictorial biography of Confucius became linked with the official cult during a period of considerable contention and instability in the public sphere. The Wan-li era was characterized not only by a surge of religious activity, but also by intense conflicts concerning correct interpretations of Confucian doctrine and the true lineage of Confucian thinkers (Chien 1986; de Bary 1981; Elman 1990; Wilson 1995a). Proponents of orthodox Ch'eng-Chu Confucianism clashed intellectually and politically with the followers of Wang Yang-ming (1472-1529) and among themselves. Differences in interpretation were sometimes correlated with allegiance to political factions, so criticisms that were expressed in ostensibly philosophical terms served as a means for attacking political enemies. Polemics on morality contained frequent appeals to the authority of the ancients and their presumed practices. The life of Confucius was a potent symbol open to manipulation until it became, literally, set in stone. The Sheng-chi-tien tablets affirm a conservative Ch'eng-Chu conception of moral self-cultivation linked to a concern for proper governance (cf. de Bary 1981, 70-71, 171-74, 189). Significantly, a prominent role in establishing the Sheng-chi-tien as a monument to orthodox morality was played by censorial officials, who were powerful arbiters of political fate in the factionalized late Ming milieu (Elman 1989; Hucker 1966). The SCT may also have offered an emblem of solidarity to reform-minded men whose careers suffered setbacks, particularly at a time when government service was dangerous and compromising because of the shifting alliances of officials and the emperor's abdication to eunuchs. Confucius had refused to sacrifice his principles for political advantage; he had turned to scholarship and teaching when he was unable to influence the feudal rulers of his time. His self-righteousness and stoic endurance of failure were admired and emulated by people who saw their own ambitions thwarted by opponents they perceived as corrupt. Further research on the circulation of pictorial biographies of Confucius in the late Ming period may well disclose that the SCT helped to validate the attitude of stubborn moralism that came into full blossom with the Tung-lin and Fu-she movements of the seventeenth century.</page><page sequence="14">282 JULIA K.
