<plain_text><page sequence="1">Renaissance Studies Vol. 10 No. 1 Coluccio Salutati's defence of poetry W. G. Craven The writings of the humanist Coluccio Salutati in defence of classical poetry have attracted considerable scholarly attention. Salutati, who has been called the 'dictator of the humanist world of Italy' during the three decades from the death of Petrarch and Boccaccio until his own death in 1406,1 held the office of chancellor of Florence during the same period. He defended the reading of classical poetry in a number of writings: in seven of his letters, two of them of substantial length, in the first version of his exposition of the myths about Hercules, and most extensively in book 1 of the later ver sion of the same work. It might be expected that the defence of an interest so fundamental to the humanists' whole enterprise might have been the occasion for some kind of manifesto or systematic exposition of the reasons why classical culture was so worthy of study. A number of historians have, in fact, held high expectations of Salutati's writings on poetry and have attributed a special significance to them.2 Eugenio Garin and Cesare Vasoli perceived a symbolic meaning in the act of defending classical literature. The discovery of man took place under the standard of great poetry; the defence was intended to vindicate the rights of a human culture antecedent to any determinate religion, to recover for pagan poetry an autonomy analogous to that already won for pagan philosophy. Particular themes chosen from the substance of Salutati's defence, taken up also by Matteo Iannizzotto in his study of Salutati's philosophy, included the function of poets as linguistic innovators and their role in immortalizing the feats of heroic men. Garin saw particular significance in Salutati's choice of the mythical figure of Hercules, symbol and protector of Florence but also symbol of man making his own destiny. In a later essay he suggested that the search for religious, moral and philosophical doctrines in ancient poetry opened the way for a reconsecra tion of ancient myths, a bridging of the abyss between classical and R. Weiss, The Spread of Italian Humanism (London, 1964), 36. 'Dictator' is a scholarly pun on 'dic tator litterarum', one of the designations of the chancellor's office. 2 In addition to the works mentioned below, recent studies of Salutati's defence of poetry include B.

Craven Christian worlds and, in consequence, a dangerous weakening of the radical uniqueness of the Christian revelation.3 A comparable perception can be found in Hans Baron's interpretation of Salutati's writings on poetry. He saw them as evidence of a militant at titude associated with 'the first wave of uncompromising classicism at the turn of the Trecento'. Cino Rinuccini's Invettiva made a number of accusa tions against humanists of the time, attributing to them in particular a paganizing tendency in religious matters. As evidence that this charge was not without foundation, Baron pointed to Salutati's treatise on the Hercules myths. He found in it an advance towards 'the rehabilitation of ancient religion in classical poetry' and a vigorous tendency to justify some of its aspects.4 Charles Trinkaus found a rather different significance in Salutati's writings on poetry. In his two-volume study of Italian humanist thought published in 1970, he set out to examine the way humanist disciplines and methodologies were applied to religion, and in particular to biblical scholar ship and theology. Salutati was a significant figure in this process. He characterized the Bible as poetry on the grounds that it concealed a deeper meaning within its metaphors and figures of speech. At the same time he considered pagan poetry to be theological, concealing a mystical meaning about the nature of God and man and the relationship between them. This theologia poetica could be seen as manifesting 'a humanist's desire to demonstrate that the content of philosophy and theology might be discovered in poetry'. By this path, a conciliation might be effected both between Chris tian doctrine and pagan poetic vision of divinity, and between humanism and scholastic philosophy and theology. The defence of poetry would become, then, a point of cultural convergence, bringing together classicism, Christian religion and scholasticism. Trinkaus credited Salutati with having arrived in his final letters at 'what amounts to a humanistic epistemology - a theory of the necessity for poetic statement of theological truths' and a 'programmatic conception of the tasks of humanism with regard to religion'. He did note, with some disquiet, that Salutati's approach to the task of interpretation seemed arbitrary and 'astonishingly naive'.5 Nancy Struever, in contrast, had no such misgivings. She affirmed with approval that Salutati saw the realm of poetic fancy as 'a secularized world of free intentions or meanings' with unlimited 3 Ε.

He was a key figure in her fourteenth-century 'linguistic revolution'.6 Nancy Struever's views were cited with approval by Jan Lindhardt in his study published in 1979.7 He argued that humanistic rhetoric, and the vision of life of which it was an integral component, had been under valued by historians. In his defence of Salutati's credentials as a philo sopher, the writings on poetry were an important resource. Salutati affirmed a close relationship between poetry and theology on the grounds that poetry, too, was divinely inspired, and that both poetry and the Bible expressed themselves metaphorically and ambiguously. The divine in spiration of the Bible was not of great significance; all true poetry was divine. The inventions of the poets and Holy Scripture were not in op position; a poet could be compared with an Old Testament prophet. While he identified a letter of 1401 as the most radical expression of Salutati's views, Lindhardt did not distinguish different phases or a development. That project was, however, being undertaken contemporaneously by Ronald Witt. About the time when the studies of Trinkaus and Struever were being published, and originally inspired by the work of Hans Baron, Witt was begin ning the researches which were to culminate in his volume Hercules at the Crossroads: The Life, Works and Thought of Coluccio Salutati. He discerned a definite development in Salutati's thought. In the last decade of his life, his religious outlook became increasingly dominant over his humanism. Cor respondingly, there was a change in his attitude to pagan poetry. In some of his earlier writings he identified in the poetry of Virgil and Seneca doc trines known only through divine revelation. The words he used suggested that the poets might have been consciously inspired by God, or at least that there was some kind of divine intervention. This belief led Salutati to assume a continuity between natural and revealed truth and between pagan and Christian culture. His later letters, Witt argued, reveal a different attitude. Now only the Bible was inspired by God; this was what distinguished it from other literature. Poetry was of purely human origin. The continuity between pagan and Chris tian culture disappeared, poetry was desacralized, and the way was open to doubts about the value of pagan literature. Witt interpreted this develop ment in Salutati's ideas about poetry as part of, and evidence for, the more general change in his outlook. Dante became the strongest literary influence on him, matching the insistent religious needs he now felt. His republican sentiments were dulled, and had to be accommodated within the framework of Dante's divinely ordained Empire. He made disparaging references to pagan culture and argued that Petrarch was superior to the ancients because Ν. Struever, The Language of History in the Renaissance (Princeton, N.J., 1970), 46, 51.

G. Craven of his knowledge of Christian truth. His abandonment of the idea that pagan poets were divinely inspired both reflected and confirmed his new outlook.8 Despite Witt's painstaking analysis, it can still be argued that the peculiar features of Salutati's writings on poetry have not yet been fully appreciated or taken into account. The truly remarkable characteristic of Salutati's defence of poetry is that it is riddled with inconsistencies. It is a collection of incompatible arguments from disparate sources, juxtaposed with very little concern for coherence. Salutati himself once characterized his literary com position as patchwork. When in 1385 Cardinal Tommaso Orsini asked for some of his writings, Salutati referred to them in these terms: 'Like menders we patch together from pieces of richest antiquity clothes which we present as new.'9 While this is the language of conventional literary self-deprecation, intensified by the dignity of his correspondent, it is a disarmingly accurate description of his writings in defence of poetry. There, the inconsistencies are so pervasive and so striking that any interpretation must come to terms with them. They are not lapses to be excused or explained away. They are woven into the fabric of Salutati's composition. Recognition of their pervasiveness has immediate consequences for any interpretation of these texts. Negatively, it should make the interpreter aware of how perilous it is to make assertions about Salutati's central preoccupations or real convictions. If statements of views which are sup posedly characteristic or fundamental can be matched by contradictory statements from the same period or document, then, at the very least, explicit and defensible criteria will be needed for judging what is central or significant. Positively, the pervasiveness of inconsistency is a valuable indicator of the kind of literary performance in which Salutati was engaging and of the conventions within which he was writing. An apprecia tion of these conventions should, in turn, provide a surer basis for under standing the texts. While inconsistencies in Salutati's writings have for long been recognized by scholars as a problem, and have been noted, discussed and variously ex plained, there has been a notable reluctance to admit that he might not have been personally committed to particular views he expressed. Ronald Witt repeatedly acknowledged inconsistencies and anomalies, but at the same time defended Salutati's 'sincerity' and criticized those who seemed to him to im pugn it. He preferred to speak of the 'dialectical character' of the humanist's R. G. Witt, Hercules at the Crossroads: The Life, Works, and Thought of Coluccio Salutati (Durham, N.C., 1983), esp. pp. 190-3, 405-10; see also his article 'Coluccio Salutati and the conception of the poeta theologus in the fourteenth century', Renaiss Q 30 (1977), 538-63.

Eugenio Garin, referring to Salutati's work De seculo et religione, uses the analogy of pieces of a mosaic; see Garin, L'eta nuova, 168.</page><page sequence="5">Coluccio Salutati's defence of poetry thought, exemplified in the way he took unequivocal positions while with other passages 'insidiously qualifying the absolute statements'.10 Victoria Kahn enumerated several occasions when Salutati argued both for and against a position, but warned that '[c]learly this does not mean that Salutati is insincere or noncommital or that his position in each case is merely rhetorical'.11 In springing to the defence of Salutati's 'sincerity', however, these scholars seem to be assuming that he and his readers shared our ex pectations about the functions of literary composition. The problem is not whether Salutati was sincere, but what he was sincere about; not his com mitment, but to what exactly he was committed. If Salutati so often makes incompatible statements about the same topic, then it is worth considering the proposition that the point of his writing may reside not in particular statements but in the whole patchwork or mosaic. It would be the literary performance as a whole which mattered. Victoria Kahn recognized that Salutati's comparison between medicine and law, De nobilitate legum et medicine, must be taken as a whole, and the recognition led her to a subtle interpretation of the work'as an 'exemplum of prudence'.12 In a similar fashion, Dain Trafton confronted the incon sistencies of the treatise De tyranno, and saw in it 'Salutati's attempt to develop a rhetoric adequate to the complexities and ambiguities of political ex perience as he understands it', a rhetoric 'whose apparent inconsistencies force upon his readers a labor of interpretation'.18 An examination of the texts in defence of poetry will suggest, however, that these readings are un necessarily subtle. In this case, at least, it must be the literary performance itself which is the point. Kahn quotes, very appositely, the commendation of the practice of 'disputation' which Leonardo Bruni puts into Salutati's mouth in his Dialogi, and comments: 'It is this activity rather than the subject matter under discussion that is of primary importance, for it refines the faculty of judgement that will enable us to reason appropriately in each par ticular case.'14 Whether the way Salutati engages in the activity in his defence of poetry could serve to refine the faculty of judgement may seem very doubtful,15 but Kahn must surely be correct in her insistence on the significance of the activity itself. Witt, Hercules, 205-6, 418, 425; he cites Herde and Seigel as having questioned Salutati's sin cerity. Witt notes other inconsistencies on pp. 221, 223, 226, 243, 288, 330, 332, 334, 347, 350-1, 373, 380. " V.

Craven Salutati's texts in defence of poetry are similar to the exchanges on set themes depicted in Bruni's Dialogi. They are, in other words, examples of disputation of the kind Bruni was depicting. Judging from Salutati's practice, disputation was an activity whose conventions valued a well-stocked armoury of authorities and references far more than coherence or consistency. Proficiency was shown by marshalling and deploying what were, for the most part, familiar references. Disputation was a grave and learned game with its own unspoken rules and its own satisfactions. If the activity itself or the literary performance was the point, then the inconsistencies within and between Salutati's writings on poetry cease to be a problem. At the same time, however, a key element in Ronald Witt's careful reconstruction of Salutati's intellectual and spiritual development is called into question. If, more generally, the writings in defence of poetry should prove to be not a unique case, and similar inconsistencies were to be recog nized in Salutati's writings on other subjects, then doubt would be thrown on the whole enterprise of constructing his intellectual biography. This interpretation of Salutati's writing on poetry is squarely aligned with one school of thought in those scholarly controversies concerning the in consistencies and ambivalences of early Italian humanists which were ignited some thirty years ago and which flared up intermittently during the follow ing decade. In 1965 Jerrold Seigel studied Petrarch's 'seesaw allegiance' to divergent ideals of moral philosophy and concluded that Umberto Bosco had been justified in characterizing the poet as senza storia, ' "without a history", if by "history" is meant any development in a consistent direc tion'.16 Hans Baron had already sought to establish the contrary position, applying to Petrarch what he called 'the genetic methods that have proven so successful elsewhere in the study of Humanism'. His aim had been to establish a definite pattern of development. His later studies of Petrarch's Secretum, while modifying the pattern, still insisted that the book was truthful self-revelation, not literary and moral persuasion.17 In 1966 Seigel turned his attention to Leonardo Bruni's Dialogi, the centrepiece of Baron's inter pretation, and proposed that it should be read not as Bruni's response to the political events of 1402 but in terms of his rhetorical culture. Baron retaliated with characteristic vigour.18 Then in 1973 David Robey examined the political attitudes of Pier Paolo Vergerio and found discrepancies and inconsistencies which were independent of his political environment. Again the effect was to demonstrate that a developmental interpretation such as that proposed by Baron was unsustainable. Robey concluded by h J.

He had called Virgil a 'lying seer', and later attributed to him a doctrine of immutable cosmic cycles. Salutati came to Virgil's defence in two letters written in 1378 and 1379.21 He was to do so again in three letters written twenty years later. One treated the episode of Dido and Aeneas, another the question of whether Aeneas was of legitimate birth. The third, written to another chancellor of Bologna, Pellegrino Zambeccari, was occa sioned by the reported destruction of Virgil's statue at Mantua by Carlo Malatesta, and began with a brief defence of poets and their fables.22 He first set about defending poetry as such when, in the early 1380s, he under took the task of making sense of Seneca's tragedies, especially the Hercules furens and Hercules Oetaeus. This was the origin of what was to become his treatise entitled De laboribus HerculisP He explains that he had been very puzzled why, if Seneca wanted to represent Hercules ultimately as a god, he had portrayed this raging killer of his wife and children. The other tragedies can easily be made to yield moral lessons, but these two are so far fetched that much more work and skill is needed. Salutati therefore embarks on the task of interpreting the true meanings of the proper names. Hercules becomes a symbol of the soul, and allegory reveals the doctrine of the direct creation of the human soul by God and its infusion into the body. His murder of Megara and their three sons becomes the struggle between the soul and the body in this life, the three sons being anger, sensuality and desire, born from the conjunction of soul and body. The interpretation is prefaced by a general discussion of poets, their treatment of the gods and the lofty mean ings they had hidden under their fables.24 1 D. Robey, 'P. P.

Craven Salutati's first attempt to explain Seneca's tragedies was never completed, but the abandonment of this particular draft implied no loss of enthusiasm for the general project. He embarked on a much more ambitious work, follow ing the career of Hercules from conception and birth through the seven labours, the descent into the underworld, the murder of his wife and sons, the interpretation of his marriages, and finally the fire on Mount Oeta by which he was added to the number of the gods. Originally there were to be just three books, but, as before, he added an introductory treatise on poetry in general. This made four books in all, corresponding to the four elements. The first book was probably substantially written by 1391, though the great work itself was still incomplete when Salutati died in 1406.25 The treatise on poetry is Salutati's fullest treatment of this theme. It car ries the title 'About poetry, a compendious defence against those who malign it, and where it might be thought to have had its beginnings'.26 It is signifi cant that it takes the form of a defence. There were ample precedents for such a stance. Most recently, some time before his death in 1375, Boccaccio had added a final section defending poetry to his Genealogy of the Gods, a com pendium of mythography explaining the allegorical significance of fables about the gods, similar in purpose to Salutati's work. Earlier, Petrarch had defended poets in an invective he wrote against a medical doctor and more briefly in letters, while at the beginning of the century the proto-humanist Albertino Mussato, who was also a devotee of Seneca's tragedies, wrote verses on the theme.27 Salutati drew on these writings, or at least on common sources, for many of his arguments. There is a noticeable gap between the ideas on poetry in the earlier and in the later versions of the Hercules, and it is neatly filled by a letter Salutati wrote rebutting the complaints of a disenchanted former student of literature.28 Repeated provocation by the same opponent, who had mean while become a Camaldolese monk, drew a longer response from Salutati in the final year of his life.29 In the same year he wrote a reply to a treatise entitled Lucula noctis by the Dominican friar Giovanni Dominici.30 These Witt, Hercules, 218-19.

The references to poetry in the letter clearly indicate a date between the two versions of De laboribus Herculis. In the earlier version, for example, Salutati quoted Horace but had not yet discovered, or at least had not yet used, the idea of poetry as praise and blame; in the later version, he used it to modify his interpretation of Horace. In this letter to Giovanni da Samminiato, the two quota tions appear side by side, as yet unconnected. '9 Salutati, Epistolario, IV, 170-205. M Ibid, iv, 206-40, esp. pp. 230-40; G.

The general discussion of poetry in the first draft of the Hercules is characteristic of his approach. Salutati makes use of a limited stock of references and ideas. He quotes the dictum of Horace, that poets want either to benefit or to delight, and Lactantius on the duty of the poet. The poets did not expect us to believe that their fables were true. They wanted to foster the belief that the gods were the authors of all things and the regulators of human life, and that they had been transformed from men into gods by their merits. The poets would not be so foolish, therefore, as to defile them by attributing to them debauchery, adulteries, murders, parricides, rapine and endless crimes. They were concealing something different under the husk of these fables, so that while the ignorant crowd was beguiled by the outer layer, a sweet inner sense would be left for the more discerning. As authorities he cites Cicero, Macrobius, Lactantius, Fulgentius, the Mythographus tertius Vaticanus and 'innumerable others', and refers to Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Gods as a source of examples. A little further on, he repeats the assertion that lofty truths about the nature of things and about conduct are concealed under the husk of poetic fictions. Moreover, although the poets spoke of many gods, they were merely using different names for the one God, referring to his various attributes and functions.31 Already this is an interesting and somewhat incongruous assortment of ideas. The claim that philosophical and moral truths were concealed under the beguiling surface had a long history, and had been used by the earlier humanist defenders of poetry. Petrarch had spoken of 'adorning the truth of things with veils';32 Salutati prefers the word cortex, a husk or outer layer, also used by Boccaccio. The inner sense has to be discovered by the use of allegory, and this is what Salutati was proposing to do with Seneca's depic tion of Hercules. The brief reference to deified men is of considerable interest. It is the first appearance of euhemerism in these early humanist defences of poetry: of the theory, that is, that the gods were ordinary people who had been deified after their death through the high esteeem in which their fellow citizens held them.33 Shortly after this allusion Salutati adds another idea: that although the poets spoke of gods and used various names for them, they knew that there is only one God. He argues further that if the poets wished deified men to be honoured as gods, they would not want their readers to believe the scandalous stories they told about them. He does opposition to humanism', in Religion and Humanism, ed. Keith Robbins, Studies in Church History, 17 (Oxford, 1981), 103-14, esp. pp. 111-12. 31 Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 586-8.

Craven not attempt to explain why they adopted the risky course of telling such stories, especially when it was the common people they were trying to convince. This collage of ideas from a variety of sources is in many respects characteristic of Salutati's defence of poetry. It is marked not merely by dissonances and inconsistencies but by an apparent lack of concern about consistency. To illustrate the pervasiveness of the phenomenon, Salutati's ideas will be discussed in three groups or clusters: poetry and religion, poetry as praise and blame, and the placing of poetry among the intellectual disciplines. Since a topical exposition necessarily loses the effect of the texts in themselves, an attempt will also be made to indicate how the ideas are juxtaposed in the documents where they occur. A good example of the juxtaposition of discordant themes is the letter which fills the gap between the two drafts of the Hercules. Addressed to a man who had complained that his literary education had not brought him a lucrative career, it begins with a diatribe against such disloyalty in blam ing the Muses. Whatever success he has enjoyed he owes to them, while his failures are his own fault.34 The body of the letter, however, confronts the question of whether poetry is an art. From the early draft of the Hercules Salutati retains the quotation from Horace and references to deified men and hidden truths. He adds a passing reference to Aristotle's Poetics and a definition of poetry as consisting of praise and blame. He attributes it to Arisototle but it comes, in fact, from the thirteenth-century Latin transla tion by Hermannus Alemannus of Averroes' commentary on the Poetics?b He also adds a quotation attributed to Alfarabi and a description of the origin of poetry as a special form of language devised for worship. Both are associated with the encyclopaedic tradition going back to Isidore of Seville in the seventh century; Salutati could have found them in the Speculum doc trinale of Vincent of Beauvais.36 The first quotation located poetry among the parts of logic, its function being to make hearers imagine something beautiful or horrible, evoking attraction or repulsion. The second, explain ing poetry as the language of worship, is based on a passage attributed to Suetonius which had been used by both Petrarch and Boccaccio in their writings in defence of poetry. It described how people had built shrines and temples finer than ordinary houses, raised statues larger than life, and devised a special form of speech for worship, namely poetry. Petrarch had paraphrased the passage, changing 'gods' in the original to divinitas, a 'M Salutati, Epistolario, m, 222-5. Salutati, Epistolario, m, 225; Ο. Β.

He linked the creation of poetic language with the poets' intention to hide lofty mysteries of divine matters under the husk or shell of the words.37 Salutati abbreviates Boccaccio's material, repeating the reference to one god. Shortly afterwards, however, while describing the things which poets have hidden beneath the surface of their verses, he mentions that poets sang the merits and doings of kings and gods, 'that is, of deified men'. For good measure he adds towards the end of the letter that the poetic mode of speaking seems to be a divine institution rather than a human in vention, and that Sacred Scripture is, as it were, a most perfect poem.38 The letter is, in other words, a collection of disparate and sometimes con flicting ideas set down one after another, with no attempt to reconcile or rationalize them. Poetry is part of logic, it is praise and blame, it is the artificial language of worship and the necessary language for speaking about God, a human invention and a divine invention, used for the worship of the true God and for the praise of deified men. One cannot avoid the impression that Salutati was more interested in having an array of arguments than in working out a consistent case. At the beginning of his argument that poetry belongs among the branches of knowledge, he calls as witnesses Aris totle, then Alfarabi, Aristotle again, and then says Ί conclude, however, with Horace ... ', making no effort to compare or relate them.39 They are there as authorities; what they contribute are sententiae, which stand as indepen dent units. The arguments he goes on to produce are set down in a similar way. It would be pointless to criticize his lack of a coherent theory, because this is clearly not what he is engaged in producing. Salutati is operating within a different set of assumptions. The chapters on poetry in the Hercules seem at first sight to be more systematic and coherent.40 The arguments are developed at greater length, and Salutati attempts a comprehensive definition of poetry and of the poet. In fact, however, the more he begins to develop his arguments, the more obvious are the inconsistencies between them. This is most clearly apparent in the cluster of ideas associated with the religious origins and functions of poetry. After an initial skirmish against the philosophers, whom he identifies as his opponents, Salutati turns to the origin of poetry. Without referring to the theory mentioned in the letter, the idea that poetry was the language of worship, he develops instead what had there been a passing remark: '' Petrarca, Le familiari, ed. V. Rossi (Florence, 1934), π, 301-2; Boccaccio, Genealogie, 768, 702-3; the word cortex occurs on p. 702.

G. Craven that the gods of the pagans were deified men. The poets with their lofty style and elegant speech, exchanging one word for another and one thing for another, aroused the people's admiration for those they praised. They were so successful that they persuaded their listeners, contrary to the evidence of their senses, that these men whom they celebrated had not died, but had been taken up into heaven in recognition of their virtues. It was the poets, therefore, who were responsible for the deification of human beings. Their monotheism, asserted by Petrarch and Boccaccio and accepted by Salutati elsewhere, is now in abeyance; they were simply men who were very religious according to the standards of their time.41 Nor could it be said in extenua tion that the deification of men was an unintended consequence of their eloquence. It was deliberate, aimed at restraining the savagery of the people, keeping them in check more easily with the sanction of religion and the awe it inspired. Salutati does not claim that the poets were right in pursuing this policy. They were fostering error and the impiety of superstition. The only excuse he can offer is human frailty and the fact that God had not yet revealed himself. He concludes, rather lamely, that at least their words were most effective, since they made people believe the contrary of what they saw.42 Immediately following this passage Salutati introduces the idea that not only the pagans (whose gods were really men or demons) but also the writers of Sacred Scripture used figurative language. The latter did so in speaking of the true God, conveying the mysteries of true divinity under the veils of poetic speech. This they did out of necessity, not because of a passion for ornamentation or a desire to hide things. Not that Moses was the first to use poetic language. People worshipped idols in earlier times and no doubt sang their praises as if they were true gods. They even began to reason about the being and nature of the gods, most notably Orpheus, Musaeus and Linus. Clearly, this first chapter shows the same characteristics as the letter already analysed. Far from being an orderly exploration of the origin of poetry, it puts side by side euhemerism, where poetry is used to deceive the common people, the poetry of the Bible which is necessary for speaking about the infinite, and poetry as the language of pagan idolatry and theology. He con cludes blandly: Therefore the origin of poetry ... is the praise of divinity and virtue which pagans had in common with true religion.'43 41 'secundum sua tempora et nationem religiosissimis', Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 7. Ianniz zotto, Saggio, 92, misconstrued this passage. It was not that poetry conferred fame and glory 'quasi immortale' on virtuous men, but that poets actually caused them to be honoured as gods after their deaths. Furthermore, the phrase 'revocavit a sensibus' does not mean that the poets converted primitive mankind from the unreflective life of the senses, but that they made them believe what was contrary to the evidence of their senses: 'adeo revocavit a sensibus quod ipsos id fecerit opinari cuius con trarium visibiliter percepissent'. 42 Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 8. The idea that religion was invented by wise men to serve the interests of the state, along with the theory of Euhemerus about the posthumous deification of eminent men, could be found in Cicero, De natura deorum, I, xlii, where both theories are said to be totally destructive of religion; euhemerism was mentioned by Augustine, De civitate Dei, vi, 7, vii, 18 and 27. 4 'Est igitur poetrie ... initium laudatio divinitatis atque virtutis quam gentiles habuerunt cum vera religione communem.' Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 9.</page><page sequence="13">Coloccio Salutati's defence of poetry 13 The title of the second chapter suggests that Salutati might be about to explain how poetry could be common to pagan and true religion: 'Why poetry was accepted by all worshippers of God or gods'.44 One might expect him to suggest something in the nature of all religion which gives rise to poetry. The explanation he gives, however, only underlines the conclusion that, ac cording to the ideas he has presented, the occurrence of poetry in both was merely coincidental. It could not be otherwise, because his use of euhemerism deprives the pagans of that kind of belief in a supreme being which Petrarch and Boccaccio had postulated and which they might have shared with the true religion. Instead of trying to salvage something of this kind, Salutati simply reiterates the quite different uses of poetry for pagans and for believers in the true God. The latter took up this lofty style because of the sublimity of the sub ject matter and the appropriateness of such language for creatures speak ing about the infinite Creator. This was not just a concession to the ignorant; even the wise had to use figurative language to speak about what is beyond words. For this reason the Bible uses poetry and is the most sublime and perfect poem, even though in our language it lacks the lilt of metre. The pagans, for their part, used poetry for the worship of their gods because of its excellence and the delight it gave. Salutati repeats the point that this had a salutary effect on the minds of the ignorant populace. Almost as an after thought he adds that another effect was to hide the humanity and wickedness of the gods from less educated minds. The poets covered anything disgraceful under some fable.45 It appears, then, that these deified men were not after all such paragons of virtue. Inevitably the objection had to be faced that it was not virtues which the poets attributed to the pagan gods, but, notor iously, immorality and wickedness. The idea that nevertherless they hid things which were even worse was a favourite one of early Christian apologists. Lactantius, for example, demythologized the seduction of Danae by Jupiter in the form of a shower of gold, interpreting it as masking a more sordid The effect of Salutati's afterthought is to compound the inconsistencies. Instead of showing what pagans and true believers had in common, as the title of the chapter promises, Salutati shows that they had nothing in common. The biblical writers and theologians used poetic language because they could only use figurative language for the inexpressible. The pagans used poetry for quite different purposes: in hymns to their idols, to deify men by beguling the common people, to conceal the wickedness of the gods and to hold the populace in subjection.

The objection that poets showed the gods behaving scandalously was also to be found in Cicero, De natura deorum,</page><page sequence="14">14 W. G. Craven The reading proposed here is in marked contrast to that espoused by Hans Baron. He found significance in the advance, since Boccaccio, in 'the rehabilitation of ancient religion as reflected in classical poetry'. These in troductory chapters contain 'a systematic discussion ... intended to show that an adequate conception and expression of God's nature is beyond human power in any age of history, and that therefore Christian and non-Christian religions alike must take refuge in anthropomorphic representations of the effects of the divine being'.47 Salutati does give this as the explanation for figurative language in the Bible and in theological discussion, but its application is limited to believers in the true God. He gives several different and not easily compatible reasons why pagans used poetry in their religion, but they do not include the necessity of anthropomorphic metaphor. The common ground between Christian and pagan religions, presumed by Petrarch and even in some sense by Boccaccio, has disappeared. The secret monotheism of the poets, their sense of a supreme being beyond the different names, has been destroyed by Salutati's dalliance with euhemerism. He reduces pagan religion to a cynical exercise in social control, where the poets use their powers in the service of law and order. The full text of the passage which Baron quoted in part to support his assertion brings out the contrast between pagan and true religion.48 The question of pagan worship recurs in the first chapter of book II, an enquiry into how and when the worship of idols began, since it seems to Salutati very true that this was where poetry also began. After examining how idolatry arose, however, he remarks that the falsity of these gods was not lost on the poets, who celebrated with most elegant verses the sacred rites and prayers while unmasking the emptiness and stupidity of the gods in theatrical performances under the cover of fables. Thus, they were far closer to the truth than the philosophers.49 Next, he tries to establish a time scale, deciding that Ninus son of Belus was the originator of the worship of idols. Again, however, he implies that poetry arose independently among pagans and among true believers. When Enos began to call on the name of the Lord in the 235th year after the creation of the world, no doubt he used figurative language, since it is not possible to speak literally of the infinite. It was at that point that 'our' poetrv had its beginning.50 Baron, Crisis, 2nd edn, 296. According to Baron's interpretation, Salutati's ideas about pagan religion became increasingly radical from the late 1390s until his death. Baron dated the final ver sion of De laboribus Herculis to 1405-6, whereas internal evidence supports Ullman's argument, Humanism of CS, 25 η. 1, that Book 1 was substantially complete by 1391. Baron also detected forcefulness in the final letters to Giovanni da Samminiato and Dominici, whereas it will be argued that in fact they are marked by caution and withdrawal from some of the more awkward inconsistencies evident in De laboribus Herculis. Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 15. In quoting this passage, Baron omitted (with acknowledge ment) seventeen lines which included the words emphasizing the contrast between pagan and Chris tian use of poetic language; Crisis, 558 n. 12. The pagans used it to deceive the people; 'veri autem dei cultores' used it for completely different purposes. 49 Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 78.

One suggestion is that during the last part of his life he revived the theories of Petrarch and Boccaccio on the secret monotheism of the pagan poets.51 It is true that the poets' part in euhemerism is not mentioned after the end of book I, while the theory itself does not appear in the letters written near the end of his life. The first chapter of book II supplies other explanations for the origin of idolatry, in which the poets' role is limited to providing elegant hymns. At the same time as they fulfilled this function, however, they also exposed the foolishness of the gods in theatrical presentations, thus proving themselves better friends of truth than the philosophers.52 Salutati also refers briefly to this idea that the poets discredited the gods in the final letter to Giovanni da Samminiato, citing from Augustine Varro's three kinds of theology, civil, physical and poetic. For Augustine, the third kind which he called fabulosa was full of indignities and obscenity; Salutati turns this to advantage, investing it with a subversive intent.53 The argument was one he had improvised in book I of the Hercules to answer the objection that the poets were liars. Their tales of the depravity of the gods were not lies but the truth, since the gods were demons or men.54 Whereas Augustine had ascribed to physical theology the role of discrediting civil theology, Salutati now claims that poetic theology discredited both, and that the poets were closer to truth than the philosophers. He also positively affirms the poets' monotheism. Although in the first chapter of book II he assigns a common origin to poetry and idolatry, he says in the second chapter that the poets believed there was one god even though they seem to be affirming a multitude of gods. He goes on to give more examples of Christian doctrines discernible in Virgil.55 It could be said, then, that in the last ten or fifteen years of his life Salutati simplified somewhat his tangle of ideas about poetry and religion. The change is one of a small number of instances where, near the end of his life, he withdrew from some of his more precarious positions and retreated to safer ground. In this case, he quietly abandoned his distinctive contribution to the discussion of the poets and the gods, the recourse to euhemerism, and reverted to his early emphasis on an underlying monotheism. It can best be understood not as a response to some personal or religious crisis but as a strategic, rhetorical decision in the interests of more defensible argument. 1 D.

Craven A second cluster of ideas relates to the content of poetry. From his first defence of Virgil against Zonarini in 1378, Salutati drew on the allegor ical tradition and its assumption that there were truths hidden beneath the surface of poetry. In Virgil could be found ideas drawn from ancient learning and philosophy, as well as precepts of morality. There were also verses which one might think had been drawn from the heights of theo logy, because they could be applied to revealed truths like the Trinity.56 Salutati, like Boccaccio, uses the word cortex, a husk or rind, to characterize the immediately obvious sense of the words, as distinct from the inner meaning. Already in this letter, however, there is ambivalence: the cortex is described both as bitter, though covering a taste of surpassing sweetness, and as appealing, like the beauty of flowers, with nourishment beneath.57 A problem was that the surface meaning, being fable, fiction or at least a metaphorical statement, was not true. Nevertheless, it was appealing. In the first draft of the Hercules Salutati refers to a cortex of fables to charm the ears of the ignorant crowd, and repeats the comparison with flowers and fruit.58 The surface meaning is false, therefore, but it is also acknowledged to be alluring. There are several other expressions Salutati uses to describe the way poets say one thing but mean another. In the Hercules he develops at some length the idea of mutatio or commutatio, meaning figurative language. The second chapter refers to the double delight with which poets captivate their hearers. One is the pleasure of the verse, while the other is that remarkable and beautiful substitution of words, things or deeds which is characteristic of poets. Metaphors, similes and any changing of words, things or speeches into something else is poetic."9 Salutati's use of the word mutatio suggests that he is drawing on Quintilian's discussion of tropes, defined as the altera tion of a word or phrase from its proper meaning to another in an effective way.60 For Quintilian it is orators' language, though poets also use it; for Salutati it is poetic language. To acknowledge that the surface meaning of poetry is untrue, however, was to open the way to moral reproach. Why should poets use lies when they could use the truth to convey their meanings? This objection was unwittingly reinforced by a favourite argument in poetry's favour, the comparison with Sacred Scripture. After a brief mention in the letter to the disillusioned student, where Scripture is described as 'a holy and most perfect poem, so to speak', this idea is used several times in the Salutati, Epistolario, l, 302-3. 'cortex amarus saporem dulcissime suavitatis includit'; 'non solum in cortice venustatem et inter flores suavitatem odoris, sed in medulla talem cibum ... '; Salutati, Epistolario, I, 306, 307. 18 Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 586, 587. 59 Ibid. 10. 'Tropus est verbi vel sermonis a propria significatione in aliam cum virtute mutatio.' Quintilian, Institutio oratoria, vin, vi.</page><page sequence="17">Coluccio Salutati's defence of poetry 17 Hercules.61 Salutati acknowledges that the sacred authors used poetic speech by necessity, not because of any passion for ornamentation, nor to hide things, but as a suitable way of speaking about the supernatural. He gives examples of anthropomorphic metaphors. Later, contrasting the pagans' use of poetry to deceive the people with the use made of it by believers in the true God, he says first that it was necessary to use language suitable for ord inary people, then that even the wise could use no other to speak about God. It follows that there is no more sublime and perfect poem than Scripture, even though it is not metrical in our language. He also notes, however, that Scripture differs from secular poetry in that it conveys the pure truth of things which were done. He repeats the contrast in later chapters. The comparison receives a more extended treatment in the letter of 1398 to Zambeccari. Salutati faces the objection that poets compose exquisite lies, twisting the course of events, mixing up times and persons, and hiding what they want to say under coverings. His response is to say that Scripture also uses figures and signs, using one thing to signify something else, like the sacrifice of Isaac or the selling of Joseph. He anticipates the objection that Scripture, nevertheless, is literally true, whereas poets are too high-handed altogether with the truth, overwhelming it with falsehood and hiding under fables what they could express clearly. In other words, if Scripture uses figurative language by necessity, and is also true even at the surface level, it will not serve as a warrant for poets who use such language by choice and produce falsehood on the surface. Salutati's unexpected response is that God could have said what he wanted without the coverings of fables.62 This seems to contradict his statements in the Hercules, more or less contem poraneous with the letter. It reflects a confusion which he never attempts to clarify between language about God and the supernatural, which cannot be literally true, and accounts of events, understood as true happenings, which also serve as figures or sym bols of something else. The effect is to nullify the argument from anthropo morphic metaphors, and to leave him with the objection sharper than ever: why did poets use lies if they could have used truths? Salutati's reply is a tortuous argument based on decorum. It was fitting that the highest truth should reveal truth through truth, whereas human poetry, at a lower level of truth, could properly use fictions. Next he reverts to the idea that in speaking of divine things we use figurative language by necessity, whereas for earthly matters we are pleased to borrow a certain elegance of ornamentation, using it by choice. In the latter case it is light shining in darkness, whereas in the case of Scripture it is, as the evangelist Rl 'sacre littere, quasi celestium et salutarium rerum sanctum perfectissimumque poema Salutati, Epistolario, m, 231; De laboribus Herculis, 8-9, 15, 16, 70, 87. Salutati, Epistolario, m, 291-2.</page><page sequence="18">18 W. G. Craven says, light from light. He adds the curious thought that if it had been allowable to the sacred authors, they too would have adorned their truths with exquisite fictions. Finally, there is nothing wrong with hiding truths. The effort of un covering them makes them sweeter and more valued.63 In the two letters written near the end of his life Salutati avoids the prob lem by retreating to safer ground. In speaking about God we cannot avoid anthropomorphic metaphors; if poetry is condemned for its superficial falsity, then the same condemnation applies to Scripture, which is also false at the literal level. Christ himself used parables, and God often revealed himself in dreams. This way of speaking on two levels is a divine rather than a human invention. Salutati also makes reference to the scandalous stories in the Old Testament to justify the similar licence of the poets.64 Ronald Witt saw it as very significant that in the last letter to Giovanni da Samminiato Salutati referred explicitly to the literal or surface falsity of Scripture. Witt believed that he was able to do this because he had aban doned the idea that poets were subject to divine inspiration, and therefore had a clear criterion to distinguish Scripture from secular poetry. As long as he thought that poets participated in inspiration, he needed the complete truth of Scripture to set it apart from secular poetry.65 For Witt, this forms part of an argument about the development of Salutati's thought which will be considered more fully later. On this particular point, it is true that Salutati does not speak explicitly of the falsity of Scripture in his earlier writings. In fact, he does so only in a single passage in this one letter to Giovanni da Samminiato.66 Later in the same letter he says the opposite.67 In the letter to Giovanni Dominici he carefully avoids the issue, repeatedly using the evasive terms figura and bilinguis.68 Falsity was clearly implied, of course, in his references to anthropomorphic metaphors in the Hercules. It could not be literally true that God 'spoke' or 'repented'. As has already been noted, Salutati, Epistolario, III, 292-3. 64 Salutati, Epistolario, iv, 175-6, 178-81, 235-8, 195. Lindhardt, Rhetor, 130-6, misses the evasiveness of 'bilinguis'. 6n Witt, Hercules, 538-63, esp. pp. 557-61. 'quid enim est divina Scriptura, quantum ad loquendi formam attinet, nisi fictum aliquid quod de virtute sermonis falsum est, licet sub illo velamine certissimam contineat veritatem?' Salutati, Epistolario, iv, 178. e" 'divina vero Scriptura nec hominis inventum est nec fictum nec ut fictum aliquid, sed ut verissimum, distorta licet et impropria dicendi ratione relatum'; Salutati, Epistolario, iv, 199. Witt quotes this passage in support of his argument that poetry was now, for Salutati, 'strictly of human origin', whereas it undermines the point he has just made; 'Coluccio Salutati and the poeta theologus\ 560, and Hercules, 409. In the letter of 1398 to Zambeccari, too, the writings of Scripture are described as 'verissima', even though they are also a figure and sign of something else; Epistolario, iv, 291. 'quid est vel in terminis vel etiam in rebus nisi figura?'; 'quid est.. . quod bilingue iure non possit et debeat appellari?' Salutati, Epistolario, IV, 234, 235; see also 230-1, 233, 238, 240. Witt, 'Coluccio Salutati and the poeta theologus', 561, and Hercules, 413, laments that the letter 'breaks off just before the point where, after stressing the poetic quality of Scripture, Salutati would have to offer a distinction between the two'. This was, however, the issue on which he had carefully avoided committing himself in this letter by the use of such evasive terms.</page><page sequence="19">Coluccio Salutati's defence of poetry 19 the problem of the literal truth of Scripture arose in connection with descrip tions of events. Salutati can refer to 'falsity' in connection with Scripture in this particular letter because he refrains from speaking about events and confines his examples to metaphors about God.69 The reason he chooses to do so on this one occasion could well be polemical. He is answering Giovanni's objection that secular poetry is 'pernicious lies'.™ What better polemical point against this particular adversary than to invoke explicitly the 'falsity' of Scripture? The general principle must be reiterated, however, that when dealing with texts so full of inconsistencies, it is not safe to infer a doctrinal change from a single passage. Even though he avoided complications about the literal truth of Scripture in the letter to the Camaldolese monk, he nevertheless became involved in another confusing but characteristic argument. In an earlier letter to the same opponent, he had claimed that because certain sections of the Bible are in verse, this form of expression is most closely related to the divine word and the godhead.71 Giovanni objected that the presence of verse in the Bible does not mean that it is poetry. Verse is merely an instrument. Salutati's answer is to distinguish different senses of the word 'instrument'. Poetry is not the kind of instrument one can use without becoming a poet. A theologian who writes verse does not do so as a theologian, but as a poet. Trying a different direction he argues that neither verse nor prose is the 'instrument' of the biblical writers, because the two Testaments are themselves referred to as instruments. Next, in a remarkable about-face, he denies that he wants to call Scripture a poem. In spite of the fact that in the contem poraneous letter to Giovanni Dominici he was asserting that Scripture is nothing but poetry, and that the figments of the poets are no different to Scripture but follow the same pattern, he now disowns the idea. A poem is a human invention, either fiction or related to fiction. Scripture is neither of these, for all that it is expressed in an inexact manner of speech.72 In the same letter, therefore, he is speaking of Scripture's husk of falsehood and asserting that it is completely true, if, so to speak, a little out of focus. The introduction of this argument is a very good illustration of Salutati's method and his lack of concern for an integrated or consistent position. It underlines the perils of trying to draw inferences from particular arguments or from their absence. In the case of secular poetry, the surface meaning is deceptive. There is, however, a deeper meaning, theological, philosophical or ethical, which is ' Petrarch had confined his examples to figurative language about God; Familiares, x, 4, ed. Rossi, il, BO 1-302. The distinction between allegory in words and in events had been made by Augustine and Thomas Aquinas, while Dante used the terms 'allegory of poets' and 'allegory of theologians'. See C.

In the early letter to Zonarini, Salutati finds expressions which yield revealed Christian doctrines like the Trinity or the afterlife. It was to God's glory to have revealed so many secrets even through the ignorant, through someone try ing to convey something else, and through those who did not know him. There is also the moral example of Aeneas, adorned with many virtues.73 For whatever reason, Salutati does not mention the familiar lines from the Eclogues traditionally taken as referring to Christ's virgin birth. Zonarini pounced on the omission, professing to believe that it was because the lines contained a doctrine of immutable cosmic cycles. In reply, Salutati invokes Ecclesiastes to show that there was a biblical precedent for believing that natural processes move in regular cycles, like the four seasons and the six ages of the world. It would not be surprising if Virgil, through his own in telligence or through divine revelation, or even without being aware of it, had become a prophet. The new offspring sent from heaven could have referred simply to Plato's idea of the soul's descent, although many have taken the words as referring to Christ.74 In other words, Salutati leaves the question open. Virgil is still the 'incomparable seer' in the first draft of the Hercules, show ing a genius altogether divine. He serves as a guide to the underworld, having alluded to heaven, hell and purgatory in the sixth book of the Aeneid. His words are allegorized to yield the moral significance of particular features of the underworld.75 He is not alone, however, in giving expression to Christian truths. Seneca's Hercules, subjected to etymological analysis and allegory, yields the doctrine of the direct creation of the human soul by God.76 In the letter which forms a bridge between the two versions of the Hercules Virgil is again used to illustrate how hidden truths can be discovered, including tropological and anagogical senses relevant to morality and to our ultimate destination.77 The Hercules itself also contains examples of divine mysteries hidden in Virgil's verses.78 In all of this discussion Salutati shows little concern about the precise pro cess by which revealed doctrines came to be present in pagan poetry. Never theless, Ronald Witt found here, despite hesitancy and ambiguity, a belief that 'at least unknowingly great pagan poets like Virgil had sometimes uttered Christian truths under the influence of divine inspiration'. Thus, there was a certain 'continuity of truth' between pagan and Christian epochs, 'thanks Ibid, ι, 303, 306-7. 74 Ibid. I, 324-9. Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 600-7. ™ Ibid. 592. Salutati, Epistolario, m, 230-1. Witt, Hercules, 407, sees a changed attitude in the words 'pro captu gentilitatis' qualifying Virgil's knowledge of the final end of man. They need mean no more, however, than that Virgil, whether consciously or not, accommodated his description to his audience's understanding. For example, the unity of essence and multiplicity of persons in God and God's omniscience; Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 82-4.</page><page sequence="21">Coluccio Salutati's defence of poetry 21 to the constant operations of the Holy Spirit'. This meant that Salutati was taking a more traditional view than Boccaccio or even Petrarch. For Boccaccio in particular 'the source of truth in the poets lay within the poets themselves', even though their powers, like any human ability, were a gift from God. The effect of this attitude was to 'de-sanctify' poetry.79 Now Salutati was reopening the possibility that ideas contained in pagan poetry were there because of a direct divine intervention, even if the recipient was quite unconscious of the process. The point which should be emphasized, however, is that Salutati leaves all possibilities open, suggesting that he was not interested in pursuing the question. In the first draft of the Hercules, where he finds the doctrine of the direct creation of the human soul in Seneca's verse, he again declines to commit himself on the question of how it came to be there. The ways of God are paradoxical, he uses the most unlikely agents, and, one way or another, he willed that this truth should appear through the agency of the poet. If the latter was aware of it, God be praised who breathed into him the spirit of truth. If, however, as many think, this was not the poet's inten tion, although the words can be adapted to such a meaning, thanks are still due to God who provided the truth for Christian readers to discover.80 In the Hercules itself, Witt again found Salutati's 'sense of the pervasiveness of divine influence on the poets, bridging the gulf between pagan and Chris tian experience'.81 The text, however, does not support this interpretation. Early in book II, Salutati sets out some criteria by which to judge senses at tributed to poets' words. The best warrant is the etymology of proper names. It will reveal the true meaning of the author, or, if not, a much more suitable sense than the author's. The reason for this is that God often brings about an effect not intended by human beings, as when Joseph was sold into slavery by his brothers. The meaning of secular poetry is sometimes directed by God to something of which the author was unaware.82 This passage claims no more than that God may have used the pagan poets as unwitting instruments for his own purposes. Divine intervention it may be, but to call it 'inspiration' gives the wrong impression. It is in fact con trasted in the same context with the spiritual and divine poetry of the Bible which has the Holy Spirit as its author.83 Certainly it is the same God at work in both cases, conveying the same truth, but Salutati's point is to distinguish them, not to link them. Witt notes elsewhere that Salutati ascribes Witt, Hercules, 193; 'Coluccio Salutati and the poeta theologus\ 546. Salutati, De laboribus Herculis, 592. Aguzzi-Barbagli, 'Humanism and poetics', 89, is not justified in claiming that 'Salutati's attention is focused with particular intensity on the problem of the origins of poetry and of the divine nature of poetic inspiration.' 81 Witt, 'Coluccio Salutati and the poeta theologus, 557.

G. Craven different origins to divine and human poetry, an observation which matches the point already made about the different uses of poetry in pagan cults and in the worship of the true God. Confused though his ideas may be, Salutati is unusually consistent in keeping pagan and revealed religion, and their respective poetic expressions, distinct from one another. The idea of a pervasive divine inspiration bridging the gulf is not supported by the texts. More fundamentally, it attributes a position to Salutati on a question about which he declined to reach a decision, and assigns to it a quite disproportionate significance. The reason for attaching such significance to it becomes clear as Witt's argument progresses. He detected a crucial change in the later letters, where inspiration is not attributed to pagan poets. The effect was to emphasize the distinction between pagan and Christian worlds, opening the way to a sense of affinity between them based on common human nature. It was a return to the 'naturalistic' conception of poetic creativity associated with Boc caccio and Petrarch. Witt was frank and explicit about his perspective: 'if one regards the secularization of human society and history as characteristic of modernity, then in this respect the fourteenth-century proponents of poetry seem to have approached more closely the conception of creativity held by our own age than did their successors in the fifteenth'.85 It was with this model of modernity in mind that Witt conceptualized the changes he discerned in Salutati's attitudes. Historians who search humanist texts for secularity and modernity bear a curious resemblance to those early Christian apologists who sifted the pagan poets for Christian truths. In each case there is a clear vision of the direc tion history will take. In Witt's interpretation Salutati becomes the unwit ting spokesman for a future yet to be revealed, in an ironic parallel to Virgil or Seneca inadvertently giving expression to Christian doctrines. While the theological content and religious function of the poets took up a significant proportion of Salutati's defence, he also wrote about the philosophical and ethical content of their works. To discover this meaning was his major preoccupation in analysing the story of Hercules. The letter bridging the two versions of the Hercules makes a good starting-point for tracing the development of his ideas on the poet as moralist. There he quotes for the first time the saying he attributes to Aristotle, that poems are imag inative speeches of reprehension or praise.86 Whether out of respect for Aristotle or because he was a useful authority for polemical purposes, Salutati made praise and blame an essential element in his definitions of poetry and of the poet.87 In this letter he sets it beside the quotations he took from the Witt, 'Cctluccio Salutati and the poeta theologus\ 554. 83 Ibid. 561-2. 86 Salutati, Epistolario, III, 225. 8' 'convenienter possumus cum Aristotele diffinire poesim esse potentiam considerantem lauda tiones et vituperationes prout metris et figurativis locutionibus concinuntur'; 'Est igitur poeta vir optimus laudandi vituperandique peritus . . .

This passage is notable because it is one of the rare instances where Salutati makes some effort to harmonize his authorities. He does so by reducing Horace's delectare to a didactic, moralizing sense. In the chapter of the Her cules where he explains his definition of a poet, he associates reprehension with benefit and praise with delight, because praise is not immediately useful. At the same time, each entails the other. Praise, whether true or false, can benefit by serving as an incentive. Later in the chapter he recapitulates, say ing that the aim of poets is to benefit with praise and blame in such a way as to delight, and to delight in such a way as to benefit.88 In the same chapter he faces the objection that it is difficult to find par ticular poets praising or blaming. His answer is that they do neither explicitly, but that what they say can always be adapted to one or the other. Bravely, he takes the example of Ovid's Amores, which, he asserts, illustrates the slavery of vice.89 There were clearly some potential problems if poets were to be represented as didactic moralists. If their meanings were hidden and accessible only to the learned, then their effectiveness would be severely limited. Furthermore, if the outer surface of their poetry was not bitter but alluring, how many readers would bother to look further? In addition, it quickly became apparent that in this guise poets were difficult to distinguish from orators. The third cluster of ideas to be considered is associated with the place, status or identity of poetry as an intellectual pursuit. The question had been discussed exhaustively in classical and medieval times. Poetry could be associated with grammar, rhetoric or logic, or it could be considered part of philosophy or theology. Salutati's first explicit defence of poetry in general was in answer to the charge that it was not an art. An art, in this sense, was something with precepts and doctrine which could be taught. His answer includes his first use of the idea of praise and blame: poetry is not trivial or futile because it praises virtue and condemns vice.90 The same question is taken up in the Hercules, where Salutati makes the distinctiveness of poetry the result of its borrowing a characteristic quality from each subject of the trivium and quadrivium: the congruity of grammar, the adornment of rhetoric, measures from geometry, melodies from music and correspond ences from astrology. It is therefore composed of all the trivium and quadrivium, all the sciences and liberal arts, like a posy containing one of each kind of flower. It presupposes them all as a preparation for itself.91 In the following chapter he reverses the image. Poetry with its figurative 88 Ibid. 68, 70.

G. Craven language is able to bring to completion the effect of each of the other disciplines without having an effect peculiar to itself. It borrows from each of the others, but its own possession is the delight of alterations and verses. Later, at the end of the first book, he notes that the figurative language of poets has been annexed by rhetoricians and even grammarians; nevertheless, it was the invention of poets.92 The placement of poetry remains ambiguous, however, and he is still faced with the problem in his last letter addressed to Giovanni Dominici. Having dealt with the trivium and quadrivium subject by subject, he then proposes to treat poetry, since it presupposes them all. While Quintilian says that the exposition of poetry belongs to grammar, and as an art and science it is part of logic, Aristotle devoted a separate book to it. Salutati insists that it is an art, being a collection of precepts directed to a single goal; indeed, it is both an art and a facultas, a claim which according to earlier usage would have been paradoxical if not contradictory.93 In defining poetry and the poet in terms of praising and blaming, however, Salutati is in effect serving notice on the orators and their claim to be moral philosophers. Adapting Cato's definition of the orator he argues that poets have been good men while orators have not.94 He meets head on the objec tion that poets do not overtly praise or blame, stating that if something in poetic form cannot be directed to one or the other then it is just verse, not poetry.95 Earlier, in the second chapter of the Hercules, Salutati identifies verse as the distinctive property of the poet. He shares praising and blam ing with others, notably with orators, while he has fables in common with orators and philsophers.95 Nevertheless, it now appears that verse is not enough to make something poetry. Salutati tries repeatedly to locate what is specific to poets in the kind of language they use, 'that wondrous and fitting alteration of words, of things, of events, which we see belonging to the poet in a unique way'.97 Metaphors, similes and any alteration of words or things or speeches into something else is poetic. Poetry has its material element in common with rhetoric, but its formal differences are in its metres and its imaginative, figurative language.98 Metre on its own is not enough; it must be joined to imaginative Ibid. 21-2, 71. S. Marrone credits Salutati with having worked out 'an explicit theory of poetry, distinct from rhetoric and independent of the seven liberal arts', adding confusingly in a footnote that 'he works out a system in which poetry depends on the seven liberal arts while at the same time remaining superior to them'. 'Domenico Silvestri's defence of poetry', Rinascimento, 2nd ser., 13 (1973), 124. 93 Salutati, Epistolario, iv, 230, 233.

Even while writing these prescriptions, however, Salutati has to acknowledge that poets are not easily distinguished from orators. Cicero himself had said that they were closely related.100 The mutationes which Salutati considers so characteristic of poetry had already been claimed for orators by Quintilian.101 Apart from metre, then, which was a necessary con dition but not a sufficient one, Salutati had very limited success in marking out a special domain for poets. Calling on the supposed authority of Aristotle only complicated the question further, making poets more like orators than ever. One way of looking at Salutati's whole defence of poetry would be to see it in relation to the long-standing debate over the placement of poetry. He, like other early humanists, was aware of its indeterminate status, and of the many strands of argument which had been and could be woven into the debate. His strategy, it could be suggested, was to argue that poetry was really one or several other disciplines, and to claim status accordingly. It was a kind of rhetoric, praising and blaming and using figurative language; it was really philosophy, with its hidden truths; or it was theology, because of its religious and cultic origins. To focus so sharply on this particular question, however, would be too restrictive. Salutati's material about the religious origins of poetry is concerned with the respectability and dignity of poetry in rather more general terms than its precise place in the academic hierarchy. At the same time, it is clearly related to those debates and comparisons between faculties and disciplines which have long been recognized as a distinctive genre.102 Salutati contributed to the genre explicitly with his treatise com paring law and medicine.103 Inaugural orations, at the beginning of an academic year or a particular course, delivered by the professor in praise of his discipline, were an established medieval practice, developed further by the humanists, and they could give expression to rivalries between the faculties or disciplines.104 Whether in or out of their institutional context, they became a favourite theme for humanists. They were stylized rhetorical performances, and disappointment would await any reader who expected to find in them information about how law or medicine was practised at the time. A similar disappointment awaits a reader who expects to find literary criticism or a poetics in Salutati's defence of poetry. Ibid. 69. 1,1 'Est enim finitimus oratori poeta . . .

Quintilian's definition of a trope employs the word mutatio. He notes repeatedly that poets also use mutatio, usually with the implied qualification that poets will be more extravagant in its deployment than orators. He considers it, nevertheless, to be orators' language. Mutatio is a word which Salutati frequently uses to characterise poetic language. See, for example, L. Thorndike, Science and Thought in the Fifteenth Century (New York, 1929), ch. 2, 'Medicine versus law at Florence'; La disputa delle arti nel (Quattrocento, ed. E. Garin (Florence, 1947).

Craven An overriding impression leit by the texts defending poetry is how little Salutati was concerned about consistency or coherence. He used different strands of argument which were often incompatible. The poets were really monotheists, whose sayings about the gods could be referred to the one God. They sought to discredit the pagan gods by revealing the scandalous truth about them, though under a veil of fables. The poets were also the willing agents of euhemerism, promoting the deification of men for the sake of law and order, and hiding their humanity and wickedness. Their fables both hid and revealed the truth about the gods' depravity. They told the truth about beings who were really men, and wicked men at that; they wrote fictions, with no semblance of truth on the surface, designed to discredit the gods. It is true that the writings in which these contradictory statements are found span a period of perhaps twenty-five years, and that there are traces of some attempt at accommodation. Nevertheless, these ideas do occur together in the Hercules, and even in close proximity. Another example of an uneasy juxtaposition of ideas is the definition of poetry as praise and blame and the theories concerning its cultic origins. According to the latter, poetry was both a special, exalted, ornate language, developed for the worship of gods or idols, and an unavoidable way of speak ing about the true God. Poetry which is praise of virtue and denunciation of vice would serve a quite different function. Salutati does not try to recon cile them, but simply makes indiscriminate use of them, in one case setting them down side by side.105 Sometimes he allows delight - delectatio - as an effect of poetry, but elsewhere he moralizes it, limiting it to the recipient of just praise. One chapter argues that poetry is an art, composed of and presupposing the whole trivium and quadrivium; the following chapter admits that it has no peculiar effect of its own, but brings to completion the effect of each of the other disciplines.106 This would reduce poetry to a mode or a technique, a facultas, without a content of its own, neither an art nor a science. Another striking example already noted is where he disowns his repeated assertion that Scrip ture is a poem.107 It is as though each point to be made, each argument, is a separate unit, which can be used irrespective of its compatibility with others he is using. The way Salutati treats arguments is paralleled by the way he treats quota tions from authorities which had been cited as objections. He takes Giovanni da Samminiato to task for neglecting the context of a quotation, then com pletely disregards it himself. He disposes of an objection from Boethius by claiming that scenicas meretriculas, 'theatrical prostitutes', need not be of the various humanistic disciplines; see C.

He claims that the words 'All those things are smoke and wind' in the Confessions of Augustine refer to the applause Augustine earned, not to the poetry he declaimed, but he makes no mention of the indictment of poetry which precedes the sentence quoted. With Jerome's injunction 'Do not read ... philosophers, orators, poets, nor dally with such readings', Salutati legalistically wrings every drop of meaning from the word requiescas, while playing the fastidious humanist over Giovanni's incorrect reference and corrupt text.108 Earlier, he takes a quotation from Lactantius from the en cyclopaedias and treats it as a charter of poetic licence, whereas in context it prescribes limits.109 Wanting to show that poetry is an art, with doctrine and precepts, he finds himself confronted by a quotation from Cicero's Pro Archia concerning the inborn faculty and divine inspiration of poets. In this instance he produces another sentence from the same work where Cicero refers to the need for training as well as ability. The second quotation does not, however, refer specifically to poets, as he admits in one context but not another.110 The reason for pursuing the inconsistencies in Salutati's writings about poetry is certainly not to belittle him, nor to criticize him as a poor theorist or a poor philosopher. The appropriate inference from the evidence presented is that he was writing neither as a theorist nor as a philosopher. He was not attempting to produce a humanist poetic, nor a contribution to literary theory. His was a different undertaking, less immediately intel ligible to a modern reader. It was within a genre where it mattered more to have a range of arguments than it did to develop a coherent position, and where many of the arguments would be familiar to readers and expected by them.111 Novelty did not rank high on the scale of values; it was more a matter of manipulating material from familiar sources and authorities. To understand these literary performances, it helps to consider what prompted some of them. Often they were in response to explicit challenges. Two such challenges came from clerics, at first sight appearing to reinforce the stereotype of medieval puritannical zeal resisting the emergence of humane culture. Even with the two clerics, however, the confrontation was not as simple as the stereotype might suggest. Giovanni Dominici's basic objection was to giving the pagan classics to schoolboys.112 Certainly, when Salutati, Epistolario, iv, 186-93. This passage was another embarrassment for Ullman: 'we must admit, he overinterprets Jerome's "nec in eorum lectionibus requiescas" ... as with Boethius, 'his interpretation is scarcely justifiable'.

Quoting the same passage in the letter to Giovanni Dominici, Epistolario, iv, 233, he merely says 'subdit'. 111 Garin had noted that this was characteristic of Boccaccio's Genealogia, 'preoccupato piuttosto di accumulare che non di coordinare gli argomenti'; Medioevo e Rinascimento, 2nd edn (Bari, 1961), 76-7. 112 'Numquid igitur pueros in etate tenella et adolescentia initia Ovidio vel Maroni, Lucano vel Ciceroni, Terrentio vel cuiquam tragico, fide Christi imbuendos, traduntur.' With some justification</page><page sequence="28">28 W. G. Craven he came to make out his case, the arguments he used were against giving the pagan classics to Christians of any age, but this represented the tradi tional material available to him. His sources did not make the distinction he wanted to make. In the other case, that of Giovanni da Samminiato, the attack was first launched while he was still a layman, turning against the education which had failed to open a lucrative career for him. It took the form of a challenge to debate whether poetry is an art. He pursued the con troversy very much in the spirit of a formal challenge, claiming that Salutati's failure to respond constituted capitulation.113 The first to challenge Salutati on the subject was Giuliano Zonarini, chancellor of Bologna, who might have been expected to have shared his literary enthusiasms. The expectation is reinforced by the fact that he con sidered Zonarini the kind of person he could ask to act as his agent in the purchase of a Virgil manuscript. Instead Zonarini responded provocatively, calling Virgil a lying seer.114 Shortly before this he had written to Salutati inviting him to say how he felt about the cares of this world, and in what manner he aspired to the blessedness of eternal rest. It was, surely, a con ventional invitation, to which Salutati responded with a conventionally moralistic reply.115 The comment about Virgil was more aggressive, but the shape of the reply must have been equally predictable. The invitation to write about the cares of the world was a remarkable one, given the circumstances. The date of the reply is September 1378, a month after Salutati had survived the second Ciompi revolt, the latest of a series of crises which had beset him since his appointment as chancellor of Florence. Even in those circumstances Zonarini felt able to expect, and Salutati able to produce, the appropriate response. Another example is a letter written twenty years later in which Salutati undertakes to defend the legitimacy of Aeneas. Again it has every appearance of being a set piece, a challenge to a paradoxical task. There is significance, too, in the arguments he uses. They are marked by the kind of inconsistency familiar from his writings on poetry. He argues that to be the offspring of a god is even better than being legitimate; that glory follows virtue, not birth; that matrimony was not an established institution in earlier times, apart from the Jews; that, moreover, Venus was the wife of Anchises. Ullman's comment is that 'Coluccio makes the well-known mistake of producing every possible argument, even those which nullify one another.' It happens too often, he doubts whether boys will glimpse the inner truths under the false husk: 'ea traduntur que sunt in cortice falsa, quorum latentia vera pueris non deducuntur ad extra'. G. Dominici, Lucula noctis, ed. E. Hunt (Notre Dame, Ind., 1940), 128, 130. Hunt cites the relevant passages in his introduction, xvi n. 26, acknowledging that Salutati recognized Dominici's restricted aim, but concludes notwithstan ding that 'he really preferred no consort with the classics at all (ironically enough quoting the classics rather freely to prove his point)'. A further irony is that Dominici's position is close to the view expressed by Boccaccio, Genealogia, ed. Romano, 769-770. See Rich, 'Giovanni da Samminiato', 386-90. 114 See Ullman, Humanism of CS, 56.

In this case the recipient of the letter was a pro fessor of literature and author of a speech which combined the praise of poetry with an attack on those who say that it offers its students no prospect of financial success.116 Here was another correspondent who knew what to expect. Responses to actual challenges, as well as participation in long-standing controversies, must constitute a significant category of early humanist writings. It is this kind of challenge and response which is depicted in Leonardo Bruni's Dialogi, and is identified as 'disputation'. Salutati is represented as warmly advocating the practice of disputation, and the text exemplifies the kind of exercise he is shown as commending. Niccoli takes up Salutati's challenge concerning the neglect of disputation by the younger generation, and delivers a diatribe on the current state of learning. Salutati responds, pointing out the irony that Niccoli's skill in disputation had refuted his assertion that disputation is not possible in such decadent times. He then issues a further challenge, concerning the excellence of the three Florentine poets, Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio. Again Niccoli accepts the challenge and launches an attack on the poets. At the beginning of book II Salutati is pressed to respond. He makes it clear that he recognizes Niccoli's speech as deliberately provocative and as a stratagem, but he declines the oppor tunity and in due course Niccoli is chosen to respond to his own challenge. A further topic for disputation, whether Caesar was the parricide of his fatherland, is also raised at the beginning of book II, and Salutati points to his book about tyrants as his contribution to that debate.117 Disputations of this kind are described in the language of martial com bat. Domenico Silvestri, in his defence of poetry, spoke of a duel, a combat, a fight.118 Giovanni da Samminiato could feel justified in claiming a forfeit when Salutati had neglected to take up one of his challenges, while Salutati's reply was that his battle-line stood firm.119 Such language suggests that disputation was a kind of literary joust. It was the exercise which mattered; the content was there to provide the occasion for the exercise. Inferring beliefs, values or intellectual allegiances from the materials used in disputa tions would, therefore, be hardly less hazardous than inferring attitudes 116 Ullman, Humanism of CS, 56; Salutati, Epistolario, in, 264-76. In the same speech the recipient, Iacopo délia Massa Alidosi, referred to the Aeneid as 'angelicum poema'. Ullman's suggested explana tion for the inconsistency is that Salutati may have converted him. The letter concerning Dido and Aeneas, Epistolario, ill, 232-8, employs a very similar style of argument. Not long afterwards, the report that Carlo Malatesta had overthrown the statue of Virgil at Mantua elicited literary responses from Salutati, Vergerio and an anonymous writer; see D. Robey, 'Virgil's statue at Mantua and the defence of poetry: an unpublished letter of 1397', Rinascimento, 9 (1969), 183-203. 11 ' L.
