<plain_text><page sequence="1">840528 Improving the Crashworthiness of Restraints for Handicapped Children Joe Benson and Larry Schneider University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute ABSTRACT As a result of improved educational opportunities, handicapped children have increased exposure to transportation related risks. Many of these children require specialized orthopedic seating and posture control devices and must remain in them while riding in a vehicle. The lack of impact protection features in these seating devices introduces an unnecessary level of risk. The emphasis of this program was to demonstrate that proven restraint principles could be applied to handicapped seating without compromising the medical requirements of these units. Efforts were concentrated on two such systems: a molded- shell orthotic seat and a stroller-type Travel Chair. Sled impact tests at 30 mph and 20 g's were used to assist in the evaluation of the upgraded restraints. The results have been encouraging and have shown that handicapped seating can supply the same level of crash protection provided by conventional child restraint systems. THE EDUCATION FOR ALL HANDICAPPED CHILDREN ACT of 1975 was enacted to assure that all handicapped children are provided with an equal opportunity to a public education. This law includes the requirement that transportation arrangements be provided as a part of their school programming. As a result, thousands of handicapped children with various physical, sensory, and mental disabilities are now transported to and from school in buses and van- type vehicles. Over the past five years, research and testing at The University of Michigan Transpor tat i on Research Institute (UMTRI - formerly HSRI) (Schneider et al, 1978, 1979, I98O, 198i, 1982), has clearly revealed the inadequacies of most restraining devices used in transporting these children on vehicle seats, in wheelchairs, or in other special seating devices and structures. While Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 222 is aimed at improving the safety of school bus transportation for able-bodied children through specification of increased seat padding, reduced seat spacing, increased seat back height, forward facing seats, and other vehicle features, the standard excludes the transportation of disabled children. As a result, most disabled children are transported without adherence to basic occupant protection design principles and criteria. For example, most children in wheelchairs are placed sideways in the vehicle with little provision for lateral restraint for the wheelchair or occupant. Restraint belts are often placed over soft abdominal tissue and/or are made from inadequate materials or stitching. Wheelchair securement or occupant restraint hardware (e.g., "D" rings, clips bars, bolts) is often unable to sustain the forces generated in a vehicle impact, and the immediate environment of the disabled child is often hazardous from a crashworthiness point of view (e.g., close to other wheelchairs, unpadded poles, metal trays attached to wheelchairs, etc.). In this study, basic crashworthiness design principles and dynamic impact tests were applied to demonstrate the feasibility of providing effective restraint for handicapped children. In particular, this effort was focused on upgrading the impact protection for children with cerebral palsy seated in molded-shel 1 , orthotic seats manufactured by American Orthopedics Services, Inc., and on upgrading the crashworthiness of the stroller or travel type wheelchairs in which these orthotic seats are frequently used. A total of thirteen forward facing impact tests were conducted, and, where applicable, the dynamic performance requirements of the FMVSS 213, Child Restraint Systems, were used as evaluation criteria. Initially, two tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the orthotic seat as it is currently manufactured, restrained on a vehicle seat with: (a) a vehicle three point 3.704 0096-73dX/85/9303-0704$02 • 50 Copyright 1985 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">belt system and (b) a vehicle lap belt only. Design modifications were then made to increase the strength and restraint features of the orthotic seat, and a third test on a vehicle seat was conducted. The next seven tests examined various prototype designs for securing a travel wheelchair manufactured by Or thok i net i cs , Inc., in both the vehicle seat and floor mounted modes. The final three tests were conducted to evaluate the composite of the orthotic seat and travel-type chair when used together. In all design modifications, concern was given to preserving the orthopedic functions of the various devices. TEST FACILITIES The dynamic testing of these handicapped restraint systems was conducted on the UMTRI impact sled. This facility consists of an air- launched, 990 lb., 6.5-ft. square platform which is guided along a track on linear bearings. The sled operates on the rebound principle, stopping and reversing direction by impacting an adjustable pneumatic decelerator or programmer. The sled velocity is sampled immediately before and after impact, and sled deceleration is continuously monitored. Seat belt forces are measured using GSE load cells. Test signals are recorded on magnetic tape and analyzed with a NOVA/A computer. For this test series, the sled operating pressures were set to obtain nominal impact parameters of 30 mpb ancł 20 g1 s, the severity level specified in FMVSS 213 for dynamic testing of child restraint systems. Two test bucks were used that bolted to the impact sled. For handicapped seating devices normally transported on a vehicle seat, the "standard seat assembly," which simulates a typical automotive bench seat and is described in FMVSS 213, was used. Handicapped devices which normally anchor to the floor of a bus or van were tested on a flat reinforced platform consisting of a welded steel channel frame with a plywood top surface. Two anthropomorphic test dummies were used: a three-year-old dummy weighing approximately 37 lbs, and a Sierra six-year-old dummy weighing 50 lbs. The three-year-old dummy was instrumented per FMVSS 213 with acce 1 erometer triax packages, one in its head and one in its chest. TEST CONDITIONS AND RESULTS The following subsections describe the design modifications, test setup conditions, and impact results for the three situations of: (1) Orthotic seat on vehicle bench seat with three-year-old dummy (2) Travel Chair with six-year-old dummy (3) Orthotic seat in Travel Chair on vehicle bench seat with three-year-old dummy ORTHOTIC SEAT ON VEHICLE BENCH SEAT--Amer i can Orthopedic Services, Inc., of Pontiac, Michigan, manufactures a plastic shell orthotic seat with a torso positioning harness and a wooden base. The shell is individually molded to each patient and uses layers of removable foam liners to allow for growth. It is used to provide corrective and postural support for disabilities such as cerebral palsy or quadrapl eg i a . Although this device is not sold as an automotive child restraint system, it is being used in that manner for transporting handicapped ch i 1 dren . To evaluate the crashwor th i ness of this handicapped device in some of its typical automotive installations, three sled tests were run. To assist in this program, American Orthopedic Services custom molded plastic seat shells to fit the three-year-old dummy. Test results are summarized in Table 1. In test 83WOO7, the orthotic seat was evaluated as it is currently produced and transported using a standard three-point (lap/shoulder) vehicle belt to restrain it on the standard seat assembly. Figure 1 shows the seat and dummy installed on the sled for testing. As shown in Figure A- 1 , the three- point vehicle belt provided good restraint for the orthotic seat and dummy and met all dynamic performance requirements of FMVSS 213. This restraint configuration violates the "direct restraint" requirement (S5 • ^ • 3 - 2) of FMVSS 213» however, by allowing inertial loading of the orthotic seat against the dummy. It also violates the "installation" requirement (S6.I.I.3) of FMVSS 213 by not using only a vehicle lap belt for installation. The shoulder belt also interacted with the dummy's neck during impact. From a practical standpoint, safe installation in actual use is limited by the availability of three-point belt systems in motor vehicles (e.g. it could not be installed in the rear seats of most cars and on bench seats in buses and vans).

SCHNEIDER Fig. 2 - Side view of 3~year-old dummy in unmodified orthotic seat with vehicle lap belt restrai nt . In the second test, 83WOO8, the same production orthotic seat was evaluated, but the attachment to the standard seat assembly consisted of only a vehicle lap belt wrapped around the orthotic seat and dummy, as shown in Figure 2. During the impact (Figure A-2) , the molded shell of this unmodified orthotic seat fractured, producing jagged, sharp edges (see Figure 3). It was not possible to evaluate the strength of the production velcro posture harness, due to the shell failure at a shoulder strap force of only kl pounds. Even if the shell were reinforced, however, it is doubtful that the webbing, velcro securements, and D- rings of the posture harness would withstand the impact loading of the dummy. Thus, restraint of an orthotic seat with only a lap belt clearly does not provide effective protection for the occupant . Fig. 3 " Fractured molded shell of orthotic seat after test 83WOO8 using a vehicle lap belt for restraint. For the third test, 83W020, an orthotic seat was modified in an attempt to provide the necessary structural strength and support for installation with only a lap belt, as required by FMVSS 213* Figure k shows the tube-frame structure that was designed and fabricated at UMTRI to enclose the fragile molded shell and isolate it from the restraint forces. This frame structure bolts securely to the orthotic seat's wooden base and provides anchorage for a five-point occupant restraint harness. Tie-down to the standard seat assembly was by a vehicle lap belt placed around the orthotic seat assembly and acting against the tube frame. Belt guide loops on the tubing served to position the vehicle lap belt and prevent slippage. During test setup, the tube frame actually facilitated the installation and positioning of the orthotic seat by providing sturdy handles that are normally lacking, a feature that should prove beneficial in actual veh i c 1 e use as wel 1 . This modified orthotic seat with its surrounding tube frame performed very well as shown in Figure A-3, meeting all dynamic performance requirements of FMVSS 213» In addition, the same unit was used in two subsequent impact tests without visible deterioration. This approach to providing restraint for an orthotic seat is highly preferred and recommended, as it permits safe transport on any vehicle seat that has an ava i 1 abi e 1 ap bel t .

Their model 63OO Travel Chair was selected for this program because of its wide usage and its adaptability to automobile, van, and bus transportation. It is best described as a stroller/wheelchair with posture-control features. The rear wheel structure can be telescoped upward to permit placing the Travel Chair on a vehicle seat while the occupant remains in the chair. It is also commonly used in vans and buses by simply remaining on the vehicle floor in either the upright or collapsed position. The Travel Chair uses ve 1 cro-secured vinyl shoulder straps and lap belt plus adjustable side bolsters to secure and position the child during normal use. When placed on a vehicle seat, the usual procedure for restraint is to place a single lap belt around both the child and chair. Not only does this procedure violate the "direct restraint" requirement of FMVSS 213» but dynamic testing at 20 mph/l6 g (Schneider et al, 1978) has demonstrated that significant pitching of both the chair and dummy occur, resulting in excessive head excursion. For the situation in which the Travel Chair remains on the floor of a van or bus, there has been no procedure available for providing adequate tie-down and restraint. Previous dynamic testing in the floor-mounted mode, using air-cargo tie-down straps for chair securement and a harness for child restraint, resulted in collapse of the chair frame and failure of the restraint harness as illustrated in Figure 5* In the present effort, a total of seven impact tests were run to assist in the redesign of the Travel Chair and tie-down systems. The test conditions and results for this series are given in Table 2 for floor-mounted Travel Chairs and in Table 3 for Travel Chairs fastened to a vehicle seat. An un i nstrumented six-year-old dummy was used in all tests as the Travel Chair occupant. Although the excursion limits of FMVSS 213 do not apply because of this larger and heavier dummy, they are referenced for compari tive purposes.

BENSON AND L. SCHNEIDER Fig. 6 - Side view of 6-year-old dummy in reinforced Travel Chair showing installation on vehicle floor using front anchor bracket and rear straps for restraint. Four tests were run to evaluate Travel Chair tie-down systems in the floor-mounted mode. In the first test, 83WOO6, the Travel Chair was tested at 30 mph/20 g. The side armrests were replaced with a tubing assembly that triangulated the seatback structure on both sides to a reinforced seatpan. To further redistribute the impact forces, a front anchor bracket was designed to secure the front caster bar of the Travel Chair as shown in Figure 6. This bracket was designed to provide easy installation, in thatpushing the Travel Chair against the bracket will cause the front end to ramp-up and then drop into the bracket's retention slot. Two straps were attached at the base of the seatback to secure the rear of the Travel Chair to the floor. During the impact, the dummy head excursion was effectively limited by the five-point harness, and the severe distortion of the Travel Chair frame noted in previous testing was eliminated. The new load path through the front caster bar produced upward pitching of the rear of the Travel Chair, as can be seen in the time sequence photo of Figure A-A. This could be reduced with very tight rear strap adjustment or eliminated with a rigid rear tie-down link. The primary concern would be head impact against the roof in a low vehicle, if the straps had too much slack or were not fastened. The remaining three tests of floor-mounted Travel Chairs,' 83WOI5» 83WOI6, and 83WOI7» were to evaluate proposed tie-down systems designed by Orthok i net i cs that represented both retrofit and future product applications. These new systems were based on the structural modifications that performed successfully in test 83WOO6. Because the armrests support optional equipment, such as trays and posture control pads, Or thok i net i cs considered their Fig. 7 ~ Side view of test 83WOI5 with 6-year- old dummy in floor-mounted Travel Chair restrained by front anchor bracket, déployable arms, and rear tie-down straps. replacement with triangulation members undesirable. Therefore, as an alternate approach, déployable, vehicle-mounted triangu- lation arms were pivoted from the front anchor bracket to brace the Travel Chair seatback. As in the UMTRI design, the front anchor bracket, which traps the Travel Chair's front caster bar, bolts to the vehicle floor as shown in Figure 7» In this version, the Travel Chair is wheeled up to the anchor bracket and locked in place with a clevis and through-pin. The déployable arms are then raised and secured to- attachment points that were added to the seatback frame, and adjustable belts are tensioned to secure the ends of these arms to the vehicle floor. Test 83WOI5 evaluated a Travel Chair for which the attachment points for the déployable arms were welded into the seatback structure, while the Travel Chairs used in tests 83WOI6 and 83WOI7 utilized retrofit bolt-on hardware to provide the attachment points on the seatback. The test setups are shown in Figures 7» 8, and 9, and the time sequence photos of the impacts are shown in Figures A-5, A-6, and A-7. All three configurations provided good restraint for the occupant and virtually eliminated distortion of the Travel Chair frame. As in test 83WOO6, rear kickup of the Travel Chair occurred in each test as the chair pivoted about the front caster bar anchor bracket. Additional effort should be directed at developing rear tie-down methods other than straps that would minimize the upward excursion during impact. As summarized in Table 3» three impact tests were conducted to evaluate different methods of securing a Travel Chair and occupant on a vehicle seat. In the first test, 83WOO9, a modified Travel Chair with triangulated seatback and five-point harness was tested to FMVSS 213 with the tie-down provided by a vehicle lap belt</page><page sequence="6">RESTRAINTS FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 3.709 TABLE 3- 0RTH0K I NET i CS TRAVEL CHAIR TEST RESULTS INSTALLATION ON VEHICLE SEAT TEST NO. 83WOO9 83WOI3 83WOIA TRAVEL CHAIR TRIANGULATED YES NO NO TO SEATPAN RESTRAINT LAP 3 POINT 3 POINT METHOD BELT HARNESS HARNESS + EXTRA + EXTRA LAP BELT LAP BELT VELOCITY (mph) 30.3 30.3 30.4 DECELERATION (g) 20.5 19-9 19-9 EXCURSIONS (in) HEAD 36.0 24.0 25.O KNEES 37.0 3O.O 29.O OCCUPANT HARNESS LOAD (lbs) RT SHOULDER 502 LT SHOULDER 452 RT LAP ...

The test setup is shown in figure 10, and the time sequence of the impact is shown in Figure A-8. During impact, the reinforced Travel Chair restrained the dummy satisfactorily and developed only minor frame distortion. Although FMVSS 213 excursion limits were exceeded (the head excursion by four inches and the knee excursion by one inch), this primarily reflects the larger dummy s i 2e. This approach te securing the Travel Chair in its seated mode, by reinforcing the chair structure, is preferred since it meets all the installation requirements of FMVSS 213 and. allows safe transport on any vehicle seat equipped with a lap belt. The next two tests were conducted to evaluate tie-down methods recommended by Orthokinetics for use with their travelchairs which are equipped with an improved, contoured armrest design. A rearward loop in the tubing of this new armrest permits the use of a three- point vehicle belt by allowing a low placement of the lap belt portion to restrain the pelvis of the occupant as shown in Figure 11. These upgraded armrests are now supplied on production Travel Chairs and may be easily retrofit or, older models.

For tests 83WOI3 and 83W014, the Travel Chair and dummy occupant were restrained on the standard seat assembly with a conventional three-point vehicle belt. In addition, a lap belt was added to the same floor anchors that secure the three-point vehicle belt and was tightened around the the base of the Travel Chair seatback to secure the chair independently</page><page sequence="7">3.710 J. BENSON AND L. SCHNEIDER Fig. 10 - Side view of 6-year-old dummy in reinforced Travel Chair showing installation on a vehicle seat with lap belt restraint. of the occupant. This satisfied the "direct restraint" requirement of FMVSS 213 but not the "installation" requirement that specifies that only a lap belt may be used to secure a restraint system and occupant on a vehicle seat. The only difference between these two tests was the routing of the added lap belt - for test 83WOI3 it was low, just behind the seat cushion, and for 83WOIA it was placed higher, above the armrest tubes at their attachment to the seatback. Figures 11 and 12 show these two test setups for comparison, and Figures A-9 and A-10 show the time sequence photos of their impact tests. Both configurations provided very good restraint for the occupant and gave head and knee excursions well within limits despite the larger dummy. The. lower routing of 83WOI3 is preferred, however, because it gives significantly lower forces in the lap portion of the three-point belt and reduces the tendency to submarine. This approach provides an effective method for restraining recently purchased Travel Chairs or Travel Chairs that have been modified with the new contoured armrests, but it has a somewhat limited application. It can only be implemented in vehicles which have an available three-point belt system to which the extra lap belt has been added. ORTHOTIC SEAT IN TRAVEL CHAIR- While working with American Orthopedic Services, Inc., it was noted that for applications where the orthotic seat was used in conjunction with the Or thok i net ics Travel Chair, trunk latches were used as quick-connect devices to secure the plywood base of the orthotic seat to the Travel Chair seat. The development work on the crashwor th i ness of the Travel Chair and orthotic seat opened the possibility of combining the results of these two programs and applying them Fig. 11 - Side view of 6-year-old dummy in unmodified Travel Chair with bel t- 1 ocat i ng armrests restrained on standard seat with a 3- point belt plus a low-mounted lap belt.

As with the Travel Chair alone, there are two installation modes to consider - usage on a vehicle seat and securement to a van or bus floor. The floor installation will be evaluated in future testing and will utilize a Travel Chair secured by the front anchor bracket tie-down with an upgraded orthotic seat strapped in position. For vehicle seat applications, an unmodified Travel Chair was used because its seatback would not be heavily .loaded and therefore did not require reinforcement. Several methods of restraining the composite seat on a vehicle seat were devised, and three tests were conducted to evaluate them. Table 4 summarizes the set-up conditions and results.</page><page sequence="8">RESTRAINTS FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN 3.711 TABLE A - COMPOSITE SEAT TEST RESULTS TESTED ON FMVSS 213 STANDARD SEAT ASSEMBLY TEST NO. 83WO2 1 83WO22 83WO25 VEH LAP BELT TRAVEL PLACED AROUND : BOTH CHAIR BOTH SEATS SEATBACK SEATS ATTACHMENT BETWEEN TWO TWO SEATS OF COMPOSITE STRAPS STRAPS NONE VELOCITY (mph) 30.1 29.9 29.8 DECELERATION (g) 19-3 1 9 • ^ I8.8 PEAK CHEST RESULTANT (g) 24.9 30.2 28.0 PEAK HEAD RESULTANT (g) 38. 0 46.7 44.3 HIC 223 285 205 EXCURSIONS (in) HEAD 31 -8 32.9 30.8 KNEES 32.6 32.9 31. k VEHICLE SEAT BELT LOAD (lbs) RT SIDE 1162 1435 1254 LT SIDE IO58 1326 II82 For each test, the standard seat assembly was used with a vehicle lap belt tie-down and an instrumented three-year-old anthropomorphic dummy as the orthotic seat occupant. For the first two tests, 83W021 and 83W022, a modified orthotic seat with tube frame and five-point harness was securely fastened to an unmodified Travel Chair frame with an upper and a lower strap, in test 83W021, the vehicle lap belt was placed around both seats of the composite as shown in Figure 13» In test 83W022, the vehicle lap belt was routed around the base of the Travel Chair seatback, and the orthotic seat was restrained to the Travel Chair by the two belts as shown in Figure 1A. The time sequence photos of these tests are shown in Figures A- 11 and A- 12. Both configurations provided good restraint with no structural difficulties. However, the routing of 83W022, which placed the tie-down belts in series, produced a higher head excursion of 32.9 inches, exceeding the 32.0 inch limit of FMVSS 213» Of these two, the routing used in test 83W021, with the vehicle belt restraining both seats of the composite, is preferred for its ease of installation, lower head excursion, and lessened dependence on the two straps connecting the seats together. For the third test, 83W025, the vehicle lap belt was placed around both seats, and passed through the belt guides of the orthotic seat tubing. However, the two straps which connected the seats together in previous tests were Fig. 13 - 3-year-old dummy installed in composite seating system and restrained on standard seat with vehicle lap belt placed around entire assembly.

This is the simplest solution to providing restraint for the composite seat, and it will be automatically implemented when the structurally upgraded orthotic seats become commercially available.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS At the 1979 SAE Congress, Schneider et al, (1979) described the results of . impact tests that revealed the "ineffectiveness of many of the currently used restraint systems for protecting handicapped children in school bus collisions." Today, five years later, the situation is essentially unchanged. The safety of thousands of handi capped eh j 1 dren, who are transported daily to and from school with their special wheelchairs, seats, and other equipment, is based so ley on the hope that the vehicle is not involved in an accident or emergency manuever. FMVSS 222 provides limited protection for able-bodied children through improved bus and seat design but continues to exclude the handicapped child from even these provisions. Today there are over forty states with child restraint laws for children under four, which require the use of safety seats meeting the dynamic test standards of FMVSS 213. but there are no provisions or requirements for tie-downs, restraints, and seating systems for handicapped ch i ldren. The present study demonstrates that this need not be the case. The prototype systems developed and tested here need further development work and field evaluation to arrive at acceptable and useable products from a consumer and user perspective, and this will be the goal of future efforts. It is clear, however, that providing effective impact protection for the handicapped child through application of basic occupant restraint design principles and dynamic testing is not only possible and feasible but is compatible with other requirements and needs of these children. This is not to say that the problem has a simple solution. The orthotic seat and travel cha ir used in this study are but two examples of the wide variety of devices and situations that must be dealt with in transporting handicapped children. It is also true in dealing with the handicapped that each case has unique constraints related to each child's particular disabilities and limitations. There is, however, much progress that can be made in areas that are common across cases such as the design of wheelchairs and seats so they can withstand occupant restraint forces and yet be effectively and independently secured against typical impact decelerations. There are also thousands of parents, therapists, and other dedicated professionals who are willing and able to give the individualized attention that is needed and, when informed on the issues of adaquate occupant protection and safety, will see that the best procedures and equipment ava i 1 abi e are used . What is needed now is not simply more awareness of the problem. It is time to address the issues head-on with a concentrated effort by both industry and government to test, develop, and modify equipment, systems, and seating components that will provide the level of protection in motor vehicle transportation we know to be possible. Manufacturers of special seating systems for the disabled child must also recognize the increasing application and use of their products in motor vehicle transportation and take responsibility to design and test for their suitability as vehicle seats and child restra i nts . ■ ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This study was sponsored by the Ford Fund of the Ford Motor Company and by the United Cerebral Palsy Foundation of Michigan, Inc.
