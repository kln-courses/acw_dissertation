One reason for this is the lack of research about organizational members' own sense of their P-O fit. In this paper we discuss the criteria required of suitable research tools to explore this domain. Drawing on arguments from the cognition literature, we argue that storytelling and causal mapping techniques are suitable for exploring organiza tional members' sense of fit. We conclude with a short example of the method in action and a discussion of some of the practical issues that researchers will face. KEY WORDS: causal mapping; person-organization fit; storytelling. The fit between individuals and organizations has been shown to be an important factor influencing the reasons why people are attracted to, selected by, and stay with organizations (Cable &amp; Judge, 1996, 1997; Chatman, 1991; Kristof, 1996; Schneider, 1987; Schneider, Smith, Taylor &amp; Fleenor, 1998; Turban &amp; Keon, 1993; Van Vianen, 2000). Whilst there is general agreement that person-organization (P-O) fit is crucial in these decisions, there is little agreement about the definition, currency Address correspondence to Jon Billsberry, Centre for Human Resource and Change Man agement, Open University Business School, The Open University, Milton Keynes MK8 ODA, United Kingdom.

Although there have been attempts to find a common con ceptualization of P-O fit (Chatman, 1989; Kristof, 1996; Van Vianen, 2000), Rynes and Gerhart's (1990) view that P-O fit is an 'elusive' con struct still holds true (Kristof-Brown, 2000; Van Vianen, 2000). We believe that one of the main reasons why P?O fit has remained elusive is that researchers are yet to explore the nature of individuals' own sense of fit. So far, researchers have considered fit from three angles. First, fears of anthropomorphism led some researchers to conceptualize P-O fit according to the language and currency of organizations. For example, the most commonly used tool to capture P-O fit, the Organizational Culture Profile (O'Reilly, Chatman, &amp; Caldwell, 1991), was developed following a review of the organizational culture literature. Those values that also had relevance to individuals were retained to form the instrument. Second, some researchers have explored a narrow segment of P-O fit in accordance with their interests. Turban and Keon (1993), for example, were interested in the congruence between individual's motivational preferences and organizational structures. The third way that researchers have ap proached the study of P-O fit was to explore homogeneity between indi viduals using extant individual-level constructs. Schneider et al. (1998), for example, consider the congruence of personalities in organizations. Studies in all of these domains have contributed to our under standing of P-O fit. However, it is our contention that if we are to bring clarity to the literature in terms of its definition, currency and bound aries, we need to invest some time understanding the factors influencing people's sense of fit. How do they define fit? What currencies are involved? How do they separate P-O from other types of fit, if they do? The answers to questions such as these should resolve many of our uncertainties with the construct and thereby make it less elusive. In this paper we aim to make a contribution to the fit literature by identifying and describing a method that can be used to explore and chart organizational members' sense of fit. We start by setting out the premises of a methodology that should allow us to study employees' sense of fit to their employer empirically. Then, we describe suitable methods and demonstrate their effectiveness with an example. We conclude with a discussion of some of the practical difficulties that researchers might experience using the method. PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT P-O fit is a branch of research within the larger person-environ ment fit domain. Central to this domain is the idea that human behavior</page><page sequence="3">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 557 is a function of the interaction between people and the environments in which they find themselves (Lewin, 1952). Initially, work in this field examined the fit between the individual employee and his or her whole work environment (e.g. Downey, Hellriegel, &amp; Slocum, 1975). But researchers found that such a holistic approach to fit frustrating as the construct seemed "elusive" (Rynes &amp; Gerhart, 1990, p. 14). Such views fragmented the field and researchers focused on different aspects of work-related person-environment fit. Some researchers focused on employees' fit with their jobs, usually referred to as person-job (P-J) fit (e.g. Caldwell &amp; O'Reilly, 1990; Edwards, 1991). Others have considered employees' fit with their colleagues, which is known as person-group (P G) fit (e.g. Klimoski &amp; Jones, 1995; Kristof-Brown &amp; Stevens, 2001). An additional fragmentation of the construct is that researchers have often adopted different definitions of the environmental variable within each stream of research. As Kristof-Brown, Jansen and Colbert (2001) say, "[although focusing on specific dimensions of fit such as P[?] J or P[-]0 fit has enriched our understanding of each, it has simultaneously con strained our knowledge of a person's fit with the total work environment" (pp. 3-4). Consequently, a reason for wanting to explore organizational members' own sense of fit is to examine how these various forms of fit combine and interact. The concept of P-O fit itself has been difficult to pin down and to define. One of the reasons for these difficulties is that the word fit has multiple definitions in common parlance. Dictionaries commonly contain a dozen or more different definitions for the word 'fit' and more for the associated words of 'fitful', 'fitment', 'fitness', 'fitted', 'fitter', and 'fitting'. Unsurprisingly therefore, as researchers began to explore the concept there was some diversity in definition of the term 'person-organization fit' that fragmented the field. There were, however, several elements binding the research together. There was acceptance that the focus was on two domains?the individual and the organization?and how they interact. In addition, researchers either focused on how features of the two domains were similar (e.g. by looking how the values of the two domains were similar), or how one of the parties fitted into the other (e.g., how an individual fitted into the organization, or how an organization supplied the needs of the individual). Kristof (1996) defined P-O fit as, 'the compatibility between people and organizations that occurs when: (a) at least one entity provides what the other needs, or (b) they share similar fundamental characteristics, or (c) both' (Kristof, 1996, pp. 4-5). Kristof s integrative review of the P-O fit literature conceptualized three different forms of the construct (Krjstof, 1996). The first of these three conceptualizations is termed supplementary fit. This is about similarity, in that there is said to be a high degree of supplementary fit when the characteristics of one thing</page><page sequence="4">558 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY are similar to the same characteristics of something else. For example, when an individual's values are similar to the values of his or her employer, there is a high degree of supplementary P-O values fit. Much of the research that has been conducted under the P-O fit banner has investigated this form of fit (Kristof, 1996) and positive associations have been found between supplementary P-O fit and job satisfaction (Cable &amp; Judge, 1996; Chatman, 1991), job commitment (Cable &amp; Judge, 1996; Finegan, 2000; O'Reilly et al., 1991), job tenure (Chatman, 1991; O'Reilly, et al., 1991), socialization (Chatman, 1991), prosocial behaviors (Posner, 1992), willingness to recommend their organization to others (Cable &amp; Judge, 1996), and work performance (Bretz &amp; Judge, 1994). The second and third conceptualized forms of P-O fit are different aspects of complementary fit. Rather than similarity, complementary P-O fit is about one of the parties (the individual or the organization) making the other whole (Muchinsky &amp; Monahan, 1987). It can take several forms such as needs?supplies or demands?abilities relationships (Kristof, 1996). In other words, this form of fit looks at whether one party can supply what the other party needs or demands. In P-O fit terms, this conceptualization of fit can be viewed from two perspectives; individual and organizational. A high level of individual complementary P-O fit exists when the organization supplies what the individual needs. A high level of organizational complementary P-O fit exists when an individual has the abilities, attitudes etc. that the organization demands. FACTORS INFLUENCING INDIVIDUALS' SENSE OF FIT P-O fit scholars have offered a range of factors that might influence people's P-O fit. Kristof (1996) suggests that people require organiza tions to supply financial, physical and psychological resources and task related and interpersonal opportunities. These dimensions stem from other literatures, such as those on motivation, job satisfaction and psy chological contracts. However, there are an enormous number of factors that might influence P-O fit given the diversity in people. As we do not have any form of map of these factors, researchers cannot yet assess the importance or universality of factors that might be expected to influence fit. Hence, an exploratory design, free from all external prompts, is required to survey the domain. A similar argument has been made by Bretz, Rynes and Gerhart (1993), who were the first P-O fit researchers to advocate the use of non directive research methods to investigate P-O fit. They noted that the domain of P-O fit was largely uncharted and the use of researcher generated scales and similar methods risks slanting responses. Bretz et al. (1993) asked respondents to articulate their own conceptualization</page><page sequence="5">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 559 of fit, specifically requesting that they identify good- and poor-fitting candidates and critical incidents that produced these impressions through the medium of a structured interview. Their method forced respondents to describe the abstract construct of P-O fit in explicit terms and in terms relevant to their own sense of fit. They found that by far the most frequently mentioned determinants of fit were job-related course work or experience and desirable personal characteristics rather than values as predicted by the literature (e.g., Chatman, 1991; O'Reilly et al., 1991; Schneider, 1987) thereby adding weight to the assertion that it is important to adopt an exploratory design in surfacing dimensions of fit. The study is powerful insofar as people are asked about their perceptions of fit, researchers' intervention is limited, and the focus is directly on the factors influencing perceptions of fit (Kristof-Brown, 1997). However, there is a difficulty with this approach. By mediating the assessment of fit through a third party, there is an assumption that what someone identifies in others is the same as that which is found within themselves (cf. Passini &amp; Norman, 1966). The use of a third party in this manner might not always be appropriate. Like most fit researchers, Bretz et al. (1993) make the assumption that people are aware of well they fit and are able, given the right cues, to express it. However, the 'elusiveness' of the concept (Judge &amp; Ferris, 1992; Kristof-Brown, 2000; Rynes &amp; Gerhart, 1990; Van Vianen, 2000) suggests that people might not be fully conscious of their own fit. This point is made by Wachtel (1977) who argues that people's sense of fit is held at accessible, sub-threshold levels of consciousness. There are different levels of consciousness. In between the two anchor points that are unconsciousness (knowledge that is not accessible to the knower because it is deeply ingrained) and consciousness (knowledge that can easily be communicated), one can find at least two other degrees; these are two levels of sub-threshold consciousness. They are an intermediary type of consciousness. Sub-threshold levels of consciousness can be accessed to some extent with some effort. Hence some knowledge can be held at the sub-threshold conscious level but could become conscious if people were simply asked about it. Some other knowledge also held at the sub-threshold level could be accessed but cannot be expressed through the normal use of words. If individuals' sense of fit is held in their consciousness, it would imply that they were thinking of little else, which is clearly not the case, except, maybe, for people experiencing a strong misfit. If, on the other hand, people hold their sense of fit at an unconscious level, it could not be captured by the methods currently employed by researchers. In summary, a method will be able to capture organizational mem bers' sense of fit if it exhibits all of the following characteristics:</page><page sequence="6">560 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY 1. It allows respondents to articulate their own conceptualizations of fit (i.e. they should not lead the respondent other than to describe factors within the P-O fit domain). 2. It focuses the attention of respondents on their own sense of fit, rather than a perception of the fit of others. 3. It has the power to explore sub-threshold domains. Researchers (e.g. Eden &amp; Ackermann, 1998; Laukkanen, 1994; We ick &amp; Bougon, 1986) interested in intangible phenomena have developed research techniques, such as cognitive and causal mapping, that allow respondents to surface previously tacitly held thought processes in an explicit manner. We believe that methods such as these will be important when exploring organizational members' own sense of fit. CAUSAL MAPPING Fiol and Huff (1992) suggest that people make sense of their expe riences by developing map like structures within their own mind. Techniques that can reveal these mental maps are cognitive and causal mapping. When someone produces a cognitive map on paper or computer they produce a representation of their knowledge and experience. There are different types of cognitive map (see Huff, 1990), one being the cause or causal map. Weick and Bougon (1986) describe a causal map as "a form of cognitive map that incorporates concepts tied together by cau sality relations" (p. 106). A causal map is a graphic representation which consists of nodes and arrows linking them (Laukkanen, 1994). The nodes that the individual describes are the individual's salient constructs and the arrows show the relationships between the constructs. Causal map ping has been shown to be powerful in revealing sub-threshold factors (e.g., Langfield-Smith, 1992). It works through the process of spreading activation (Daniels, De Chernatony, &amp; Johnson, 1995). Respondents are asked to reflect on the factors that influence their fit. In doing so, and as items emerge, they jog their memories and surface events, stories, and feelings that they would have been previously unable to recall. During the mapping, they are pressed to explain these factors and in that process they reveal to themselves some aspects of their fit that up to this point were held at the sub-threshold level. The subjective data that the causal map ping technique surfaces has been called mental models (Hodgkinson &amp; Johnson, 1994), scripts (Gioia &amp; Poole, 1984), and sch?mas (Brewer &amp; Nakamura, 1984; Cossette &amp; Audet, 1992 ) by different authors. To surface an organizational member's sense of fit, the mapping session starts with the notion of 'your fit within your organization' and</page><page sequence="7">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 561 the question 'what causes your fit?' is asked. The questions that can help the participants to explore their sense of fit are, for instance: What influences your fit? What causes that? How does it happen? Who is in volved? By answering the questions the participants can start surfacing more specific factors explaining their sense of fit within their organiza tion. As explained by Ambrosini (2003) this is a digging process. The best image to describe the process is maybe the 'onion' metaphor. Causal mapping is like peeling an onion. By peeling layer after layer of the reasons for their fit participants get to the detail, the less explicit causes for it; causes they could not have readily surfaced without prompting and probing. Our method is summarized in Figure 1. The process relies on the individual being able to think of at least one construct that is relevant to the issue being mapped. The person puts the construct on the map and links it to the issue. As the person thinks about this relationship, causes and constructs can come to mind. These are recorded on the map and these in turn trigger further thoughts (Ambrosini &amp; Bowman, 2001). The process is analogous to some well described psychological processes. One example of which is a violation of a psychological contract. When one incident causes a psychological con tract to be violated in a way that is particularly salient, it triggers the individual to think of lots of other issues that had, up until then, been resident in the unconscious. Imagine that a person's boss reneges on a promise to recommend him or her for promotion. This upsets the indi vidual, who then finds him or herself thinking about all the other smaller things that annoy him or her about the organization; the way a colleague was treated, the location of his or her desk, two years ago the decision Figure 1 Causal mapping as a means of assessing an individual's sense of fit: Summary of the research method (adapted from Ambrosini &amp; Bowman, 2001) 1. Introduction to the causal mapping session (process and content) 2. Begin the map with your fit in your organisation and ask the general question: what influence your sense of fit, what causes your fit? (A, B, C) 3. Continue the mapping process with questions such as: What causes that? How does it affect your fit? 4. If the flow of constructs stops, ask questions such as: Could you give an example of what influence your fit? Could you tell a story? occurrence of c? &lt;?=&gt; Could you give an example of b? C=&gt; Could you narrate a d ) story about the</page><page sequence="8">562 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY that he or she couldn't take vacation on preferred dates and so forth. Causal mapping attempts to replicate this process. This example dem onstrates that the initial cue may create a positive or negative bias. For this reason, it is important that the researcher remains uninvolved, merely explaining the mapping process, so that the researcher's biases and preconceptions do not influence the mapper. Causal mapping seems particularly appropriate for mapping some one's sense of fit for a number of reasons. First, as interest is in revealing the underlying factors influencing fit, a causal structure is being uncovered. Second, when an individual produces a causal map they are encouraged to think about the factors influencing every construct that they mention. As they generate more and more items and develop a causal map of the many influences, the respondent is producing a richer picture of their own fit. Third, the task of producing a causal map is relatively simple and non-threatening. This creates a relaxed atmo sphere whilst, at the same time, the respondents are being challenged by being asked to think about things that they had previously not thought about before. The maps can be constructed by placing self-adhesive notes on a large board and then typed later on or they can be built using computer software such as Decision Explorer.1 As with the manual version, the maps are on display but here they are on a screen and the participant can see them evolving. The choice is very much dependent on how confident the researcher is with computers and the participant's preference. Fourth, Walsh (1988) has argued that causal maps are particularly useful when the researcher wants to reveal factors that are context dependent. In these situations, people store their understanding of a situation in the form of causal maps (Bougon, Weick &amp; Binkhorst, 1977). By definition, P-O fit is context dependent, with people assessing, con sciously and subconsciously, the stimuli they receive from the organi zational environment. This means potentially each organizational member's map could be different because each one may operate in a very different context and may have a different set of influences and beliefs. While this may be limiting in terms of result generalization should each map be radically different, one cannot retreat from the context specificity of P-O fit and hence we need to deal with it. Causal mapping allows us to do so as it allows us to capture the idiosyncrasy of people's fit. It should help us in our quest to draw a fine-grained picture of the concept of P-O fit. This is particularly important in an exploratory research when little is known about a phenomenon, when one is unsure about how general, 1 Decision Explorer is a Windows based mapping software. The software was developed by Colin Eden, Fran Ackermann and their colleagues at the University of Strathclyde. The software is easy to use, it allows the visual display of the maps under construction and factors can be readily moved across the map and modified.</page><page sequence="9">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 563 heterogeneous or organized the phenomenon is. Fifth, Weick and Bougon (1986) say that one of the main advantages of using causal maps is that they "place concepts in relation to one another, [...] they impose structure on vague situations" (p. 107). As such, causal maps can help the respondent reveal things that were previously unknown, felt, believed, or valued subconsciously. They can also help the respondent, and therefore the researcher, order, analyze and make sense of something that is 'fuzzy' and complex. It is a technique that can help people reflect (Eden, Ackermann &amp; Cropper, 1992). All of these factors are likely to be relevant in the exploration of organizational members' sense of P-O fit. STORYTELLING There is one process missing in causal mapping that might limit its use in mapping P-O fit. This missing process is help with the initial trigger; if an individual has no idea about what fitting with the organi zation might mean, the map cannot start. This is a problem that the research technique of storytelling might be able to help with. The re search technique of storytelling has a very long tradition across many academic fields and it has many forms and manifestations. The variation of interest here is the elicitation of stories from individuals in face-to-face meetings to trigger the effective use of causal mapping. In other words storytelling can be used to generate the first few components (nodes) of the map, i.e. the A, B, C of the map captured in Figure 1. Storytelling is an interesting technique to consider for the explora tion of organizational members' fit because many people have an inventory of stories about work that they can recount (Gabriel, 2000). When these stories concern the storyteller's own experience in the organization, they are clearly relevant to the subject under investigation. Often, the stories capture pivotal moments in the relationship between the individual and the organization (Gabriel, 2000). Naturally, therefore, such stories have a lot of personal meaning for the storyteller (Boje &amp; Dennehy, 1993). Interestingly, the storyteller does not need to know about the construct of P-O fit to impart stories that are relevant to it. They can be elicited by asking the respondent to recount stories about how they feel about their employer. As such, this initial triggering event is largely free from the influence of the researcher and is couched in the storyteller's own language. Storytelling can do more than act as a trigger for spreading activa tion though. It is also a technique that can help people understand their circumstance. It is particularly useful in an organizational context be cause "stories are one of the many forms of implicit communication used in organizational contexts" (Martin, 1982, p. 257), they are used in</page><page sequence="10">564 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY organizations to "explain 'how things are done around here"' (Martin, 1982, p. 256) and they "can reflect the complex social web within which work takes place" (Brown &amp; Dugruid, 1991, p. 44). Fineman and Gabriel (1996) say, "Exchanging gossip, jokes, anecdotes is often central to the way we make sense of our experiences. This process goes on incessantly in workplace corridors, offices and coffee-rooms, and continues at home in accounts of 'what happened at work today'" (p. 1). These stories have meaning to the storyteller (Feldman, 1991). They are expressions of how people naturally code their experience (Fineman &amp; Gabriel, 1996). When telling stories, people say more that they would normally; "stories permit researchers to examine perceptions that are often filtered, denied, or not in the subjects' consciousness during traditional interviews" (Hansen &amp; Kahnweiler, 1993, p. 1394). Importantly for this study, the benefit of asking people to tell their stories may not lie in the accuracy of what is told, but in the feelings and emotions that are elicited. These can give the researcher some insight into factors that lie beneath the threshold of consciousness. Another reason why storytelling appears a natural ally to causal mapping is that when people tell their stories, they tend to de scribe a cause map of their experience (Brown &amp; Dugruid, 1991). All this suggests that storytelling is not only to be used to start the map. When the process moves from one explanation to another, to the less explicit causes of fit where the participants start to reach their sub-threshold consciousness, the flow of factors is likely to slow down. In this case, it is useful to encourage the participant to think of examples of how the factor they have just elicited influences their fit, or tell stories about it, because, as just mentioned, this technique can help to help articulate those activities that are difficult to express. ELICITING FIT: A POSSIBLE RESEARCH APPROACH Based on the above argument, we surmise that causal mapping combined with storytelling is likely to be an appropriate technique for the initial exploration of the peoples' sense of fit. Although we have ar gued above that these two methods complement each other, an expla nation is needed to explain how they will work together in practice. The most natural architecture to bind the two techniques together would appear to be during the mapping process itself and when the participants are briefed about the exercise they are about to embark on. When explaining the mapping process, for instance, we would imagine the following sequence of events. First, the employee would be prompted to recount stories that offered him or her some insight about their rela tionship with their employer. For instance the participants could be asked about how similar they are to people they work with, how similar</page><page sequence="11">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 565 they are to their employer, how well they get on with their boss or their colleagues. They might be asked to recall an event in which the work atmosphere changed and their responses to the change. After the person recounts a story, the researcher could ask him or her what lessons were to be learnt about their fit to the organization from the story, and these could be written down on 'post-it' notes. It is at this point that the re searcher might introduce the idea of causal mapping and explain it can be used to capture the factors that influence their fit to their employing organization. The interviewee would be encouraged to build up a causal map of their fit to their employer using the ideas already surfaced and adding to these whenever possible. As new ideas occur to the interviewee, they would be asked whether they had any examples or stories that could illustrate the point. Telling stories would help the participants explain further what they mean and would also trigger other thoughts and sto ries and hence keep 'the ball rolling'. AN EXAMPLE In this paper we have suggested that causal mapping associated with storytelling could help in eliciting an individual's sense of fit. In Figure 2 below, we give an example of part of a map that was built by a senior manager in a university. This shows that this method might in deed be an avenue for empirically researching P-O fit. While this map was being built a number of stories were told. In particular during the construction of the above map, he explained that being an integral part of a team contributed towards his sense that he fitted well. When asked how he defines 'teamwork', he recalled, Figure 2 Fragment of an organizational member's causal map</page><page sequence="12">566 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY "I remember a book ... about the shaping ... of Black America and it is that coming together that is significant for me, it is about understanding how things go together". Later in the interview, the manager explained how his level of confidence both helps him to fit in and how his impres sion that he fits well increases his sense of confidence. When asked to unpack the factors contributing to his confidence so as we could under stand better why confidence mattered for his sense of fit, he recollected about previous jobs. For example, "... at Oxford. It encourages you to be confident, to be able to perform"; "I have done lots of things outside, before, and inside this organization. ... I know I can do the job". These extracts demonstrate the sort of raw data that the combina tion of causal mapping and storytelling can produce. The interpretation of this type of qualitative raw data has been well documented by other writers (e.g., Dey, 1993; Silverman, 1993) and therefore there is no need for us to repeat their work. However, even a cursory glance at these initial fragments clearly demonstrates the complex and multi-faceted nature of organizational members' sense of fit. For this manager, the raw data seems to show that both factors internal (e.g., confidence in having the skills to do the job, and being part of a team) and external (e.g. past reading, and previous jobs) to the organization influence his sense of fit. CONCLUSION The goal of this paper was to identify a method, or methods, that can be used to explore and chart organizational members' own sense of fit. We argued that it is important to explore organizational members' own sense of fit because there is considerable uncertainty in the literature regarding the definition, currency, and boundaries of P?O fit. A first step towards a clarification of the construct is the identification and devel opment of a method to explore individuals' sense of fit. We have discussed the various criteria that such a method must satisfy and then, drawing on the cognition literature, we argued that a combination of causal mapping and storytelling appears a promising way forward. Three as pects of this combination appear to be especially useful. First, the use of storytelling should help respondents explore their understanding of the term 'fit', the importance of it to themselves, and the various factors influencing it. Second, the combination of storytelling and causal map ping should help the interviewees construct their own sense of fit, much of which we proposed is held at sub-threshold levels. Third, the different methods should help the flow of the session by maintaining concentration and energy. Before concluding the paper we would like to acknowledge some of the limitations of our proposals, as some difficulties might be anticipated.</page><page sequence="13">J. BILLSBERRY, V. AMBROSINI, J. MOSS-JONES, AND P. MARSH 567 First of all we would like to address the issues of validity and reli ability as such a study needs to stand up to outside scrutiny. In the context of causal mapping, Jenkins (1998) argues that to ensure the validity of an approach one needs to ask 'have we allowed the respondent to respond in a way which is salient and meaningful to him or her?' (1998, p. 240). We believe that the method we have suggested does allow us to respond positively to this question. As explained, the map is con structed by the participants themselves and they are free (and actively encouraged) to introduce whatever ideas they want and to modify the map at any stage. In other words the participants are consistently in volved; they Validate' the process along the way. As far as reliability is concerned, possible researcher bias is minimized by the fact that the researcher's involvement is limited. The researcher is merely there to prompt the participants to talk and to record faithfully what they say, with the participants constantly checking what is being recorded. The only real reliability concern that may be raised is maybe participant bias as factors such as tiredness, stress and mood can affect the process and therefore producing the same results when replicating the study will involve replicating exactly the same context and conditions, which is extremely difficult, if not impossible. However, this is not a problem unique to causal mapping; it is common to any technique that gathers data from living participants. Finally to close on these issues we would like to quote Laukkanen (1998) writing about the validity and reliability of causal mapping, that "the pragmatic conclusion is to do one's best to enhance data quality by acting on areas that are obviously critical and controllable" (1998, p. 75). We believe that by thoroughly researching, thinking about and planning the causal mapping session, we would have done our utmost to generate some valid and reliable findings. Another point that we would like to address is the fact that some interviewees might experience initial problems with the storytelling technique when it is used prior to the causal mapping. The simple re quest for stories could be problematic, as people might not have stories readily available. This sort of issue is commonly experienced in the clo sely related method of critical incident analysis (Billsberry, 2000). In such circumstances, the process of spreading activation might not be ignited and little will be discovered about the person's fit. However, the use of two different methods increases the likelihood that people will find that one of the methods works for them. An interesting aspect of causal mapping is that the subjects can use it on many levels (Jenkins, 1998). Sometimes the interviewees will think of a new element, record it and move on to another without exploring the causality of the element at all. At other times, the interviewees spend a considerable amount of time on an element and will develop fairly com plex sets of factors influencing the element (i.e. two or three levels of</page><page sequence="14">568 JOURNAL OF BUSINESS AND PSYCHOLOGY causality). Often, they will return to such a stream of causality later in the session and develop it further. However, although many such streams of causality can be elicited, the primary outcome of these ses sions is to surface and construct individuals' perceptions of their own fit. As this will usually be the first time that these people have consciously considered their own sense of P-O fit, our conjecture is that the elements that Eire likely to emerge will be of a first-order nature with relatively little development. It is only when people have time to reflect upon the outcomes that they begin to develop a sense of their own P-O fit. This might occur in one session, but it seems more likely that two or more sessions will be needed to progressively peel away the layers. Conse quently, we think that researchers may need to adopt a two-stage process to explore organizational members' sense of fit. The first stage is to help people become conscious of the 'fit' between themselves and their em ployer. Once this awareness and understanding of the term has been achieved, the individual is then in a position to explore the factors influencing it. Whilst some interviewees will be able to do this in the one session, it is possible that some will require more time and perhaps two separate sessions. The exploration of fit is still in its infancy. We need to develop our understanding of what it is and what its features are before being able to engage fully in the next stage of exploration, such as understanding the organizational implications including the management of fit, and the performance benefits and drawbacks associated with fit. We hope that this short paper will act in some respects as a trigger for conceptual and field studies on P-O fit. REFERENCES Ambrosini, V. (2003).
