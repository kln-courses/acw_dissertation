<plain_text><page sequence="1">"GODS ... ADORNED WITH THE EMBROIDERER'S NEEDLE": THE MATERIALS, MAKING AND MEANING OF A TAINO COTTON RELIQUARY Joanna Ostapkowicz and Lee Newsom A unique cotton Taino reliquary—the only extant example currently known—provides an unprecedented window onto the complex mortuary and ritual ceremonies of the pre-Hispanic Caribbean. This study explores its cultural context as recorded by the early Spanish and French chroniclers and missionaries who were witness to the use and beliefs surrounding these objects in both the Greater and Lesser Antilles. It provides the first AMS radiocarbon date for the reliquary, placing it within a firmer historical context. It also examines the woven sculpture in some detail, providing a review of the manufacture process and a detailed study of the components—cotton, animal hair, lianas, gourd, resins and shell—that went into its cre ation. From the wrapping of important cernís (representations of spirits) in cotton, to the binding of the skeletal remains of venerated ancestors within elaborate weavings, cotton had an intrinsic value as a material that wrapped and bound the ancestors to the living and the living to each other. Un exclusivo relicario taino de algodón—el único ejemplar conocido hasta la fecha—provee una mirada sin precedentes hacia las complejas ceremonias y rituales del Caribe prehispánico. El presente estudio explora el registro cultural asociado al reli cario a través de los registros realizados por los primeros cronistas y misioneros españoles y franceses, quienes fueron testi gos de los usos y creencias que rodearon a estos objetos tanto en las Antillas Mayores como Menores. Este objeto provee una de las primeras dotaciones por radiocarbono (AMS), localizándolo dentro de un claro contexto histórico. Al mismo tiempo, se examina la estructura del tejido en cierto detalle, brindando una revisión del proceso de manufactura y un detallado estu dio de los componentes—algodón, pelo animal, lianas, calabaza, resinas y conchas—utilizados para su creación. Desde la envoltura de importantes cernís en el algodón, hasta la unión de restos de esqueletos provenientes de venerados ancestros den tro de elaborados tejidos, el algodón tuvo un valor intrínseco como material que "envolvió y unió" a los ancestros con los vivos, y a los vivos entre sí. ... and the images of gods which are adorned at our God's arrival in this country, —letter with the embroiderer's needle represent men from Bishop Alessandro Geraldini (b. 1455, d. who were religious and just and known to have 1525) to Pope Leo X,ca.l519or 1520 (in Sym conferred some benefit on the people, and were cox 2002:133). numbered among their saints by the common beautification of the priests and country.

One of the earliest published images of cotton cemi, in Rudolph Cronau's Amerika (1892:1:263; see also Fewkes 1891; Seelye 1892:133). Note the absence of the strap on the forehead and the loose fibers at the top of the head, suggesting that damage to the back of the cemi's head preceeded the publication. The damage is also appar ent in the illustration in Fewkes's 1891 publication. (©British Library Board [9551.1.6].) 1903, when Fewkes noted it being sent to Italy, and ca. 1928, when the cotton cerní was transferred from Schiaparelli to Marro. Further archival work is needed to clarify its twentieth-century history. Vega (1987 [1971]) initiated the first major study of the piece and its history, including the first radiographs of its internal structure. These clearly show the human cranium encased in the cotton weave, as well as a bulky, opaque substance at the figure's center, which Vega suggested was stone. His study has been followed by a growing body of research on the cemi (AMT ca. 1975; Girotti and Meaglia2001; Guidi and Appendino 1973; Masali and Pia 1991; Meaglia and Girotti 2001; Ripley 1980), most recently the CT study by Martina et al. (2010), which has brought the internal structure of the cemi to light in magnificent detail (Figure 4, Supplemental Figure 4). The work undertaken here, initiated by the first author in 2005, builds on these foundations by focusing on its radiocarbon age, construction materials, and process of manufacture. Radiocarbon Results A 75 mg sample of cotton was extracted by MAET conservators from two separate areas of the cerní: the left side flap at the back of the cemf s head and the right knee. The former, the larger of the two samples, was submitted for radiocarbon dating, while the smaller sample from the knee area was analyzed by Newsom for material identification. The radiocarbon result of 395 ± 27 B.P. (OxA-15359; 8 l3C = -22,4%c) calibrates with 95.4 percent confidence to A.D. 1439-1522 (76.7 per cent), 1574-1584 (1.6 percent) and 1590-1624 (17.1 percent): of these, the greatest probability lies with the period A.D. 1439-1522. While tradi tional Taino lifeways continued for some decades after contact, it is extremely unlikely that this object would have been made as late as 1575-1624: as will be discussed below, such sculptures required an intact indigenous sociopolitical system for their meaning and relevance, and due to population decline and forced acculturation this essential framework disintegrated by the mid-sixteenth cen tury. Moreover, the piece does not feature any post contact materials, as seen in other large cotton sculptures, such as the blue glass in both the Pig orini and Cisneros cernís, the latter in Europe by ca. 1502. This would suggest that the cotton for the cemi was collected, and likely spun and woven, some decades prior to, or very shortly after, Euro pean contact. Cotton fibers (technically, seed hairs or "lint") are produced by the plant on an annual basis, and so represent one year of growth; they are harvested regularly, and hence are an excellent material for radiocarbon dating, as they are not sub ject to in-built age. Although both raw and spun cotton were stored in cacical "warehouses," as well as people's homes, it is unlikely that they were stored for long periods of time given the constant demand for cotton products, such as hammocks, naguas (skirts), and body ornaments. Hence the date provides a good indication of when the cemi was constructed.

This in essence made them central to events and involved in the lives of their descendants and community members. Their "death" may simply have been viewed "as another rite of passage into the next stage of the life/death/rebirth cycle. Such ancestors remain[ed] relevant to and concerned with, or pro tective of, the living among whom they [were] passed down as inheritable relics" (Roe 1989:859). Using such intermediaries appears a universal prac tice, both in traditional cultures and inherent in many of today's major religions. As Holsbeke (1996:15) points out: ers, would not circulate in exchanges, but likely remained within the descent group (Oliver 2009:250). As carefully curated and safeguarded lineage "treasures," accruing greater potency with each beneficial "act," such cemis would be expected to have a long life of involvement and ceremonial activity. The older they became, the greater their potency, and by association, the greater the pres tige of the descendants. It is quite possible that the belief in their efficacy may have spanned genera tions. When not brought out for rituals and con sultation, which likely included the use of cohoba (the ingestion of hallucinogenic drugs), they would have been safeguarded in a cacical caney or other By giving intangible beings a material shape, secure locations, such as caves.

ADORNED WITH THE EMBROIDERER'S NEEDLE" 323 Summary and Conclusions The cotton cemi was an investment on many lev els: of time, effort, artistry, knowledge, and belief. It embodied these aspects through a fusion of the now indefinable (ritual, ceremony) with the tangi ble: the layering of materials, from wood, stone, lianas, vegetable fibers, cotton in quantity, animal hair, gourd, resins, inlays and pigments, and, at its core, the human skull. The creative vision and skills of the artist/weaver are evident in each phase of construction—from the foundation balanced by weights and supports to the rich finishes (texture, color, inlays) covering the surface. The elaboration of the woven body, juxtaposing a life-affirming physicality (fleshed body, enlarged navel, genitals) with both skull and skeletal imagery (rib cage, hip bones), functioned to bring the forces of life and death clearly and eloquently into view. This cre ative and technical investment ultimately reflects the cernís deep social and cultural value: one based on the belief of an unbroken link between the liv ing and the dead. The integration of ancestral remains and relics into both ritual and the every day functioned on a variety of levels: from linking descendants with powerful predecessors and so establishing and reinforcing status and ancestral legacies, to harnessing these ancestralIcemi forces as intermediaries for the benefit of the community. In this sense and many others, this figure was— and remains—a bridge between the living and those who have gone before. Acknowledgments.

Kerchache (1994:162) considered the elaborately beaded cotton cemi in the collections of the Pigorini Museum, Rome (accession number 4190) a reliquary, but there is no evidence to suggest that it was used in this way: it does not contain any human remains, nor is its construction suggestive of an artifact specifically made to encase bones, as is the case in the Turin cemi. Instead, the Pigorini cemi con sists of two separate cotton elements—a full sized belt at the base (Biscione 1997:158), and beaded cemi sculpture at the top, both nailed to a turned wooden base (the latter likely a historic display support). 2. Animal hair assignments were made using published data and comparative specimens obtained on loan from the Florida Museum of Natural History collections, including pri mate (Saimuri sciureus, UF#398), felid (Felis wiedii. UF#6789; Lynx rufus. UF#24401), hutia (Capromys pilorides, UF#26758; Geocapromys brownii, UF#15249; Plagiodontia aedium, UF#22399), agouti (Dasyprocta aguti, UF#13304), guinea pig (Cavia porcellus, UF#9170; Cavia sp., UF#9172), and bat (Artibeus jamaicensis, UF#2165; Brachyphylla nana, UF#20704; Eptesicus fuscus, UF#20706; Molossus major, UF#6549; Monophyllus redmani, UF#31422; Mormoops biainvillei, UF#13683; Noctilio leporinus, UF#630; Pteronotus quadridens, UF#13687; Tadarida brasiliensis, UF#19185). Additional comparative samples utilized in this analysis and curated in Newsom's lab include domestic dog (Canis familiaris), domestic cat (Felis catus), domestic sheep (Ovis aries), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), cot tontail rabbit (Sylvilagus sp.). 3. "The women bandage their legs from the calf to the knee with woven cotton to make them look thicker; they call this adornment coiro and think it very elegant; they make the bandage so tight that if it is loosened for any reason the leg looks very thin. The Jamaicans, both men and women, also have this custom and even bandage their arms up to the armpit so that they look as if they wear armlets such as were once used among us" (Colón 1992:170).
