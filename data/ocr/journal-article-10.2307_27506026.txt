BAIRD ABSTRACT: All perception and judgment are to some extent the reflection of who we are. Our picture of God, too, is a product of the cave into which we were born. Acknowledging this is an antidote to one form of idolatry?the worship of our symbols for God. This confession that our pictures never perfectly reflect God does not mean, however, that we cannot give reasons for thinking that one picture of God is more adequate than another. The paper attempts to demon strate this by reference to contrasting pictures of God analyzed by the process thinker Charles Hartshorne. On a sabbath morning in 1914 (the great conflict had just begun), they held a prayer service in Berlin. The Kaiser was there. The aisles were jammed. ... A German minister mounted the stand and, reading from the Old Testament the account of the battle between Gideon and the Midian ites (and how God favored . . . [Gideon]), drew across the centuries a 1914 parallel; and then they said . . . , "Our strength is our God." Then they prayed, "God of Germany, give the victory to Germany. God of righteous ness, give the victory to right." On that sabbath morn they held a prayer service in Paris. The war minis ters were there. The aisles were packed. A French priest mounted the stand and, reading from the Old Testament the account of the battle be tween the Israelites and the Philistines (and how God favored the Israel ites), drew across the centuries a 1914 parallel; and then they [said] . . . , "Our strength is our God." Then they prayed, "God of France, give the vic tory to France. God of righteousness, give the victory to right." On that sabbath morning they held a prayer service in London. The King was there. The aisles were packed. An English bishop mounted the stand and, reading from the Old Testament the account of the battle between Da vid and his enemies (and how God favored David), drew across the centu ries a 1914 parallel. [And then they said, "Our strength is our God."] Then they [prayed], "God of our fathers, God of England, give England the vic tory. God of righteousness, give the victory to right."1 Written in 1936 by an undergraduate student, this text dramatically makes a point I want to pursue. The Germans see God through German eyes; the French see Him through French eyes; and the British through British Robert M.

We see Him through our own eyes. And all of us see through a glass darkly, a glass well-smoked by the environmental and hereditary factors that influence who we are. You may be a Martin Marty who sees God through the eyes of a Lutheran church historian. You may be a Jimmy Swaggart who sees God through the eyes of a fallen fundamentalist Church of God evangelist. You may be a Charles Hartshorne who sees Him through the eyes of a process philosopher. You may be an Elie Wiesel who sees Him through the eyes of a Jewish sur vivor of the holocaust. You may be an Ayatollah Khomeini who sees God through the eyes of a Shiite Muslim. The point is Plato's?and Francis Bacon's. We are born in a cave. Our per spective is always a reflection of the narrow world in which we live. Every perception and thought is influenced by the unique structure of our minds. It is as if we see the world and everything that is in it and out of it through tinted glasses. The glasses are partly a result of our genetic inheritance, partly a result of the environment in which we live, and partly a result of the choices we have made. The glasses color and distort everything we see. Our picture of God, then, is to some extent a projection of who we are. My picture of God may say much more about me than it does about Him. I acknowledge that, just as I insist that someone else's picture of God says much about him or her. Paraphrasing the British philosopher John Mill, the religious dogmatist never stops to realize that mere accident has decided which religion is the ob ject of his faith, and that the same causes that make him a Christian in Lon don would have made him a Buddhist or a Confucian in Peking.2 Disturbing though this thought may be, we must acknowledge that had we been born in a Buddhist culture, the odds are we would see God through Buddhist eyes. Had we been born in a Moslem country, likely we would make pilgrimage to Mecca. Once when I made this point in another setting, a thoughtful person said: "You know, John Mill's claim is surely true, but you should not go around telling people that." She had recognized that this is a disturbing thought. It raises so fundamentally the question: What is truth? And how do we know when we have it? But despite the anguish it creates, I am convinced that there is an urgent reason for acknowledging that our picture of God is inevi tably distorted by the glasses we wear or by the cave in which we live. The reason is this: such an acknowledgement is an antidote to idolatry. The one who never doubts the adequacy of his picture of God is worshiping his picture. To worship the picture is to worship the pointer to God rather than God, and to worship anything other than God is, by definition, idolatry. A needed corrective here is that fundamental tenet of the Reformation churches?the Protestant Principle. This principle asserts that because there is an infinite gap between man and God, man simply does not have the ca pacity to know with certainty the final truth about God. The Principle under</page><page sequence="3">Robert M. Baird 235 cuts every human effort to play God, which is what we do when we claim that our knowledge is absolute.3 Precisely because we have not seen God "face to face," we have to be criti cal of our pictures of Him lest we confuse those pictures with who He really is. As finite creatures, we try to "anchor [God] in the life of the mind"4 by creating images. But these are only symbols, more or less adequate, pointing to Him. Even the word "Him" is a picture. And while I have continued to use the traditional masculine form to refer to God, the concept of God transcends sexual differentiation. Whatever our picture of God, He is beyond it. But without these anthropomorphic images, God becomes an empty abstraction. Use them, but criticize them. It is our only option. This is the lesson of the Protestant Principle. To reject this principle is to assume that our picture of God perfectly reflects who He is. It is to assume a level of knowledge equal with God's?and that is idolatry of the highest sort. Tillich argues that one cannot be a fanatic in the presence of God,5 for in the presence of God one is so overwhelmed by divine sovereignty, love, and grace that one knows that God cannot be fully grasped, put in a formula, packaged in a creed. As another theologian put it: "[Even] though our appre hension of God in Jesus Christ may be an apprehension of ultimate truth, it is still our apprehension and subject to the limitations of our perspective as historically conditioned and as sinful human beings."6 Again, as Tillich would argue, the cross itself stands as a judgment on every limited view we have of the Holy One.7 But if our pictures of God are inevitably distorted by the home cave, if our symbols of Him are always limited by our finiteness, where does this leave us? Do we see through a glass so dark that the glass has become opaque? Is our blindness so intense, is every picture of God so wide of the mark, that any picture is as good or as bad as any other? Are we reduced to a radical kind of relativism? Paul Tillich or Oral Roberts? Charles Hartshorne or Tammy Faye? Does it make no difference? Is there no reasonable choice? Surely there is. The confession that our pictures of God never perfectly reflect Him does not mean that we cannot give reasons for thinking that one picture is more ade quate than another. Religious experience and logical coherence are standards we must employ in defending one picture over another. Moreover, should one be convinced that, in terms of experience and logical reflection, one's picture of God reflects something of His nature and charac ter, then that picture should be advanced boldly. At the same time, the pic ture must be advanced with humility, for to some extent it will inevitably re flect our cave. Charles Hartshorne is a superb model of one whose religion is reflective. In many of his writings he paints two pictures of God, and in the process co gently argues that one of the pictures is more coherent and more faithful to experience than is the other.8</page><page sequence="4">236 Journal of Religion and Health Consider, first, the picture of God as permanent and unchanging, a picture with a long history in Christian theology. This picture had its origin in the early confrontation between Christianity and Greek philosophy, the details of which constitute a fascinating story.9 The essence of that story is that the early apologists for Christianity began to use the ideas and language of Greek philosophy to propagate the faith. One notion deeply rooted in Greek thought was the idea that whatever is ultimately real and valuable must be perfect. And whatever is perfect must be unchanging, for to change would be to become different; and if the per fect became different, it would become less than perfect. Following this line of thought, the Greeks developed a bias against change, against process, against that which is dynamic. In the Greek mind, the permanent, the fixed, the absolutely unchanging was superior. Influenced by the Greeks and believing God to be the one who is ultimately real, valuable, and perfect, Christian theologians began to picture God as permanent and unchanging. Following in the footsteps of the Greeks, they asked how that which is perfect (God) can change without becoming imper fect. He cannot. Therefore, God is fixed and permanent. He does not change. As Hartshorne repeatedly reminds us, the logical outcome of this picture of God was explicitly stated by the classical theologian Anselm, who concluded that God could not be compassionate because to be compassionate involves feeling, but to feel is to change, and the perfect cannot change.10 This picture of an unchanging God has become deeply embedded in the Western mind. Contrast this picture with the one drawn by Hartshorne himself. Rejecting the notion of God as static and unchanging, Hartshorne defends the picture of a dynamic God who is personal. Let me briefly reconstruct Hartshorne's picture, using more specifically Christian language than he would typically use. The birth, the life, and the death of Christ portray the creative source of every thing that is as a personal father who cares. This, it might be argued with some plausibility, is the Christian claim. But the phrase "a personal father who loves" is empty, Hartshorne argues, if God is pictured as absolutely changeless. For if God is love, then he cares, but to care is to be affected by the well-being of the one cared for, and to be affected is to change. If God is pictured as absolutely changeless, He cannot meaningfully be pic tured as personal and loving. If God is pictured as personal and loving, he cannot be considered fixed and static. In fact, it is unfortunate that the notions of "perfection" and "unchanging" ever became associated. Which is more desirable? To be rigid, permanent, unresponsive, fixed, inflexible, unchanging? Or to be in process, growing, sensitive, responsive, creative, changing? Which picture, Hartshorne would ask, best portrays the supremely excellent?</page><page sequence="5">Robert M. Baird 237 Is it a sign of excellence in a father to be unresponsive to, uninfluenced by, independent of, his children's joys and sorrows, needs and wants? If an earthly father were altogether neutral and unchanging with regard to the changing welfare of his child, would we not call him heartless?11 Why, then, should such characteristics when ascribed to the heavenly father be consid ered virtues? Hartshorne argues that they should not. God is not an un changing thing; he is a social being, affected by, responsive to the world he has created. But, someone might object, the Christian perspective declares that "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and for ever,"12 and that every per fect gift comes from the Father in " . . . whom there is no variation."13 What has happened to Christ, the solid rock, on which I thought I was standing? Is there not something permanent on which faith is based? This is a legitimate question, the answer to which is that the rock in the midst of the flux is the moral character of God. There is an important sense in which God is unchanging. His moral character is absolute. In him there is no moral vacillation. Hartshorne speaks of "the loving or sensitively respon sive nature of God."14 This love endures. Now we seem to have a picture of a God who changes and does not change. But this generates no problem as long as we realize that the polar character istics (change, permanence) are being ascribed to different dimensions of God. This is the logical point Hartshorne is so concerned to make. An implication of this logical point is that God is changeless as far as His moral character is concerned, but He changes as a result of His sensitive encounter with the world. To be sure, this picture of God as a faithful father sensitively relating to His world has been subject to abuse. Pictures abound of God as a cosmic Santa Claus who can be manipulated by saying the right words or praying the right prayers. These simplistic interpretations of the personal love of God must be subjected to rigorous critical analysis. But there is a way of con structing this picture which is coherent, faithful to experience, and which has important implications for our lives. Recall that the theologian Anselm finally had to admit that his picture of God as permanent and unchanging meant that God could not be compassion ate. How different it is with the picture of God as father. For if God is a lov ing father, His very being is affected by our happiness and our pain. Consider suffering. The human word about suffering is that it is real. Pain is relative, of course. There is suffering, and then there is that descent into darkness which few of us have faced, but which we know is there: the pain of a mother and father whose 30-year-old son is dying of AIDS; the tears of the wife and children of a man tortured by terrorists; the suffering of the college student so lonely he takes his life; the pain of the professional who has spent years preparing for a task he cannot do or cannot stand to do; the pain of the</page><page sequence="6">238 Journal of Religion and Health older person who regrets the past; and the agony of the young afraid of the future. On and on we could catalogue such moments. We know the depth of human anguish. But if this is the human word on suffering?that it is real?what is the di vine word? It is a word of hope growing out of the picture of God as caring fa ther. But let us be careful lest we cry "hope" superficially, lest we cry "hope" where there is no hope. The hope does not lie in the elimination of suffering. We know better than that. Nor does it lie in the intellectual understanding of suffering. We know better than that. Rather, the hope this picture suggests is the hope in suffer ing shared. The religious affirmation is that we never face the valley alone, that the ultimate source of life is a shepherding father who is present in our darkest night, enabling us to walk and not faint. The word of hope is this picture of God as father who cares. And because he cares, our suffering is not borne alone. Process thinkers have expressed this in a variety of ways. Whitehead: "God is the great companion?the fel low-sufferer who understands."15 Alan Gragg: God is the "Cosmic Sufferer" who feels "supreme sympathy for the agonies of all creatures."16 Nicolas Berdyaev: "We can only reconcile ourselves to the tragedy of the world be cause God suffers in it too. God shares his creatures' destiny."17 Finally, the moving words of Hartshorne himself: "I have no Christology to offer, beyond the simple suggestion that Jesus appears to be the supreme symbol [picture] furnished to us by history of... a God genuinely and literally 'sympathetic' . . . receiving into his own experience the sufferings as well as the joys of the world."18 From the Christian perspective, to reject the picture that God suffers as we suffer, is to reject the cross. To affirm that picture is to lay claim to the hope in suffering shared. Indeed, such a picture expresses the good news of the bib lical witness. "O thou that teilest good tidings to Zion, Get thee up on a high mountain; O thou that teilest good tidings to Jerusalem, lift up thy voice with strength" and declare boldly that "God is love." And because He is love, He shares life with us, rejoicing in our joy, sorrowing in our sorrow, deeply affected by our laughter and by our tears. It is a redemptive picture. References 1.
