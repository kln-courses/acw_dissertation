<plain_text><page sequence="1">Encountering Aborigines: Anthropology and the Australian Aboriginal. By Kenelm Burridge. (New York, Pergamon, 1973. 260pp., bibliography, index, no price listed [paperback].) This is a unique book. It sets out seriously to answer a question that is seldom, if ever, asked by practicing anthropologists: namely, why is it that only Europeans or people whose cultural background is European-derived have systematically studied other cultures? In attempting to answer this question, the author focuses on the study of Australian Aborigines as an example of this phenomenon. Thus, this book should be reviewed at two levels. First, it must be considered as an attempt to deal with ideas in the ETHNOHISTORY 20/1 (Winter 1973)</page><page sequence="2">104 BOOK REVIEWS mainstream of Western thought, with particular emphasis on the way these ideas influenced the concept and practice of anthropology. And, second, it must be viewed as a contribution to the literature on the anthropology of Australian Aborigines. The author is to be commended for attempting an ambitious and worthy venture. There is always value in examining the basic philosophy and ideas which motivate a particular field or profession, and the implication of this book - not stated by the author, but clear enough all the same - is that anthropology is often shallow in its purposes and could stand greater self-examination if it is not to become trivial. There is always a danger that careerism may overwhelm purpose in any academic enterprise, and Burridge's book is valuable as a counter to this tendency. The author argues that early anthropology was motivated by concepts which developed in Greek and, later, Christian attitudes toward "otherness," that is, toward cultures outside the European tradition. Europeans embraced "otherness" in two ways: by identifying with it on the one hand, and by seeking to analyze it objectively on the other hand. The attempt to resolve these somewhat contradictory attitudes toward "otherness" is seen as lying at the heart of past and present approaches in anthropology, which in turn is regarded as part of a wider intellectual effort in Western thought throughout the Christian Era. How satisfying is this argument? The author offers many plausible analogies between the theological debates of early and medieval Christianity and present approaches in anthropology. Some of the insights thus arrived at are of undoubted value. For example, the author's use of the Christian theological concepts of virgin birth are especially helpful in understanding Aboriginal attitudes toward paternity. This much-debated issue may never be fully resolved, but new ideas on the subject are welcome, especially when they fit so well with what is already known about Aboriginal cosmology. But Burridge's broader argument is marred by its non-historical nature. Allusions here and there to historical events and ideas, such as the author's reference in several places to the ecclesiastical debate at Valladolid in 1 550-1551, do not constitute history or even a history of ideas. For this approach to be convincing, one needs to perceive the flow and interaction of events and personalities in history. A selective commentary on history, which is what the author provides, is valuable, but this value is limited by the author's selection of historical analogues. Might not some other selection be of equal value? For example. Western culture has been unique or at least unusual in the degree to which it has sought to perceive and understand the "otherness" of the natural and physical universe. The efforts, noted by Burridge, of Europeans seeking to center their attentions on understanding man and human nature can be matched by other scholars. also in the Christian tradition. who sought to understand the nlatural world and the universe in rigorously non- ETHNOHISTORY 20/1 (Winter 1973)</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 105 anthropomorphic terms. Copernicus was a contemporary of the debate at Valladolid, and his ideas had an unquestioned influence on the later development of Western science - which in turn has influenced anthropology. Copernicus showed us that man is not the center of the universe, yet he is not mentioned once in this book. In short, the basic questions asked by the author could have been answered more convincingly by a comprehensive history of ideas rather than by an appeal to analogy and a retrospective and selective approach to history. The arbitrary nature of this selection process is nowhere more apparent than in occasional opinions which are voiced and then left as literary Parthian shots. Thus on p. 205 we read: In condemning the rounding up, capture, exile, and so the eventual disappearance of the Tasmanians ... it should be remembered that if this operation seems little different from the attempted destruction of the Jews in Europe by the Nazis, both are grounded in the same framework of assumptions as legalized abortion or the expulsion of Palestinean Arabs from their homeland. What a can of worms the last part of this statement opens up, especially when nothing further is said about these matters. Happily, however, this is not a book about Nazi atrocities or homeless Arabs, and in the realm of Aboriginal studies the author fares much better. The book abounds with original and useful ideas about Aboriginal culture which, as anyone who has studied Aborigines at firsthand will agree, bear the stamp of reality. The discussion of totemism - both the general concept and Australian Aboriginal varieties - is one of the most thorough and yet succinct reviews on the subject ever encountered by this reviewer. And the author's remarks about the need for anthropologists to recognize and adapt to new and drastically changed conditions in which the "otherness" they once sought to study no longer lies outside the gambit of the anthropologist's culture are timely and reflect an informed awareness of real conditions in Australia and many other parts of the world in the 1970's. If Burridge's book is perhaps less effective than it might have been in answering the broad questions it poses, it nevertheless stands as an interesting and useful contribution for its particular ideas on a variety of subjects in anthropology and Australian Aboriginal studies.
