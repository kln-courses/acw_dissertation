Egloff In the inaugural volume of The Australian Journal of Historical Archaeology, J.M. Birmingham and D.N. Jeans (1983) published an article titled The Swiss Family Robinson and the archaeology of colonisations' which offered a framework for what the authors believed to be a diverse and uncoordinated field of study. It is apparent that for the most part historical archaeology is confined to artefactual and documentary based approaches to under- standing the transference to the shores of Australia of goods and processes developed in the European industrial revolution (Birmingham et al. 1988; Birmingham and James 1981). Rather than offer a framework, perhaps the Swiss Family Robinson model provides a mental strait- jacket which has promoted studies of colonisation and frontierism, as are popular with our colleagues in North America, at the expense of approaches which are more relevant to the scholarship of today, in particular contribu- tions to an understanding of the relationships between the land, indigenous people and new settlers. This relation- ship goes beyond the 'exploration', 'learning* and 'develop- ment phases' proposed by Birmingham and Jeans, and looks towards the work of environmentally based ap- proaches to history represented in The Humanities and the Australian Environment (Mulvaney 1991), Australia's Ever-Changing Forests (Dargavel and Feary 1993) and Environmental History (Dovers 1994). Two of these pub- lications feature on their covers paintings by Sir Russell Drysdale which epitomised a fourth and fifth phase; 'dis- possession' and 'despoliation'. This article is not about diminishing by one iota the contribution of a cohort of historical archaeologists, who have made a contribution far out of proportion to their small numbers. Instead it points out that there are other avenues of inquiry one can and should pursue which are not necessarily incompatible. In the words of the editors of Australian Archaeology, you have been chosen to write this article as you are not yet one of the established greats but know something about it. In 1967 upon arrival in Australia, one of my first arch- aeological experiences was to listen to Judy Birmingham present a paper to the Canberra Archaeological Society on the excavations at Irrawang, in the Hunter Valley. As one would expect her talk postulated colonial British origins for the archaeological patterns she and her students had excavated and recorded. More memorable was a discourse on her plans to reach an understanding of the personality of James King, the essential force behind an early pottery manufacturing venture in New South Wales (Birmingham 1968). This attempt to delve into the mind behind the archaeological pattern struck me as being equal to, if not ahead of, the thinking of my colleagues in the United States. I had come to study in what was a Department of Anthropology at The Australian National University in response to the sirenic call of John Mulvaney and Jack Golson. Each of these mentors had an interest in history which led them into prehistory. The link between history, anthropology and archaeology was familiar ground having just emerged from the fertile fields of North Carolina where both Stanley South and Louis Binford had memor- able if not initial experiences in historical archaeology. I was imbued with the notion of understanding the past by starting at the present and working back through time.

An exception to this fixation with the prehistoric was Jim Allen, at that time embarking on a trip to England to delve into the Imperials records of Port Essington. Allen (1973) had conducted excavations at this far distant out- post where the British Empire sought to solidify its claim to northern Australia. My own work drew me to Papua New Guinea where after much stumbling around in the swamps and travelling about on slow boats, some of which managed to stay afloat, a thesis emerged on the recent prehistory of Papua. It was not until a decade later in 1978 that I returned to Australia and became involved with Aboriginal land rights and then with historic site management. During my absence from Australia the scene had changed considerably with respect to prehistoric archaeology; there were more jobs in public archaeology and academic positions had multiplied as had the number of university departments offering degrees. In the late 1970s, historical archaeology was happen- ing only by chance so to speak. Jim Allen was back at The Australian National University undertaking research in coastal Papua New Guinea with a brilliant future in historical archaeology behind him. Two advocates held centre stage, one had been there for some time and the other was a newcomer to Australia. Judy Birmingham continued at the University of Sydney as a Senior Lecturer in Near Eastern Archaeology and tacked on to her depart- mental responsibilities what is now widely acknowledged to be the role of the founding figure of Australian histori- cal archaeology. Her research focus had moved on from Irrawang to the Aboriginal resettlement camp at Wyba- lenna on Flinders Island in Bass Strait and then on to Regentville and the historical archaeology of the bourgeois of colonial New South Wales. Students were active in all of this fieldwork thus spawning a generation of historical archaeologists who would bear the brunt of public archae- ology in the 1980s and 1990s. By a fortuitous quirk of fate an appointee in 1971 to the Classics and Ancient History Department at the University of New England in Armidale, Graham Connah, was to put his considerable energy behind historical archaeology, jug- gling his passionate interest in African civilisations with encouraging student field studies immediate to the uni- versity as well as administering a thriving and innovative department, and bravely joining with Judy Birmingham in the initial excavation of Regentville (Connah 1986). In that same year a committee looked at the status of historical archaeology (Allen 1975) and regularly there have been critical reviews of the discipline (Jack 1985; Connah 1983; Bairstow 1984; Megaw 1984; Murray 1985; Murray and Allen 1986). As one would expect there is general agreement that as an academic discipline histori- cal archaeology is weak on theory and strong on tech- niques, in particular the mechanisms of cultural heritage management, site based excavations and thematic descrip- tive systems (Wesson 1983, 1984; Pearson and Temple 1984). It is difficult to be critical of historical archaeology as it is a wonder that it exists at all in Australia as the first position created in an academic department specifically for a historical archaeologist was not filled until Tim Murray took up an appointment to La Trobe University in 1986. That department had been founded by Nigel Oram, an historian of colonial Papua, under the wing of the History Department, and is now active in the field of historical archaeology. More recently a position has been filled at Hinders University of South Australia by Susan Lawrence Cheney, a doctoral student at the La Trobe Department of Archaeology. Throughout most of the 1970s and 1980s only two aca- demics were active and identified themselves as historical archaeologists, Judy Birmingham and Graham Connah, neither holding a position where their efforts could be directed solely towards that discipline. Today, the situa- tion is still tenuous with only two or three academic fiHiB 2 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="4">Egloff positions in all of Australia specifically concerned with historical archaeology. One wonders how so few academ- ics were able to foster such an active movement. Granted they did have allies in cognate disciplines such as geogra- pher Denis Jeans (in Birmingham 1979 et al.; Jeans and Spearritt 1980; Jeans and Birmingham 1983), the histori- ans Ian Jack (Jack and Cremin 1994) and Aedeen Cremin, and an educationalist Brian Rogers (1993) as well as partners in public archaeology such as the legendary Peter Coutts (1985) of the Victoria Archaeological Survey, Michael Pearson firstly in the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service and then in the Australian Heritage Commission and Helen Temple of that State's Heritage Council, now of the Historic Houses Trust But how could so few accomplish so much in the space of only a few decades? Obviously there was no academic dead wood, they were effective mentors and good students have been fostered as well as productive relationships with allied disciplines, and more recently with colleagues in New Zealand. Approximately 80% of 93 articles in the first nine issues of The Australian Journal of Historical Archaeology have been written by people who do not hold paid academic positions. This is indicative of the wide- spread support which historical archaeology enjoys in Australia and is a considerably different genre than that presented in Australian Archaeology which, if Volume 38 is typical, for the most part publishes the works of academ- ics and museum based prehistorians. After the 1988 bicentennial Historical archaeology had its origin in Australia with- in a few academic departments, its fluorescence within the field of cultural heritage management, and has regularly subjected itself to critical review. The Australian Society for Historical Archaeology offers regular public lectures in Sydney, annual conferences, a newsletter and a journal publication. The Society is truly international in its close affiliation and formal incorporation with New Zealand col- leagues as well playing a substantial role in the formation of the Australia ICOMOS Burra Charter (Marquis-Kyle and Walker 1992). Graham Connah has published an excellent text titled 'Of the Hut I Builded': The Archae- ology of Australia's History (Connah 1988) and there are attractive volumes on things, places and landscapes which have popularised colonial and industrial archaeology. Philosophical and theoretical considerations have been formulated (Pearson and Temple 1984; Murray and Allen 1986), investigation and conservation guidelines prepared (Department of Planning 1989, 1993b), a code of practice drafted (Department of Planning 1993a), a handbook released (Birmingham and Murray 1987) and an archae- ological procedures manual has been published which details site excavation practices (Davis and Buckley 1987). These documents provide a strong and respectable opera- tional framework for historical archaeology in Australia. Historical archaeology has to overcome a weakness in- herent in a restricted university base which has been propelled by individuals who are ageing and retiring. It is suggested that the financial stress on universities may see small programs become more and more marginalised and thus less and less effective. In public archaeology, the field is either maintaining its position within government structures or weakening, depending upon ones perspective. There is no driving force in public archaeology as was once present both in the Victoria Archaeological Survey and the New South Wales Department of Planning. Concern was expressed by J. Birmingham and D. Jeans (1983) and reiterated by J.V.S. Megaw in 1984 that arch- aeologists were excavating a lot of rubbish without any clear-cut idea of what it means. The situation may not have changed markedly since that date and is compounded by the vexing problem that there is a substantial body of unpublished reports relating to the large urban excavations which generated the rubbish. Shanks and Tilley (1987:17) emphasise the 'centrality of publication to the science of archaeology*. One wonders if we need yet another heap of artefacts from a pub, mill or working class neighbourhood if that material does not yield information which can &amp;l££SŒS^^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 3</page><page sequence="5">From Swiss Family Robinson to Sir Russell Drysdale: be focused upon matters which concern Australians. Is bringing to light quaint artefacts and relating history from a subterranean perspective sufficient to justify the presence of historical archaeologists? The central assertion of this paper is that historical archaeology is established and has perfected operational instruments but may have failed to make a sufficient intel- lectual contribution to issues of interest to our contempor- ary society. As such it is suggested that social historians are leaving archaeologists behind in the race for academic and museum positions. Archaeologists were at the fore- front of American studies (Schuyler 1978) but few if any are involved with Australian studies programs. Colonial paradigms Australian historical archaeology has drawn inspira- tion from theories developed in the eastern United States, in particular the school founded by James Deetz with its linkages to American studies such as those of Henry Glassie (197S) and culminating in the Pulitzer prize win- ning literary woik by Rhys Isaac (1980), The Transforma- tion of Virginia. Murray and Allen (1986) bemoan the failure of Australian historical archaeology to evoke a similar incorporation into the popular writings of Austra- lian authors. No doubt James Deetz (1977) has made a significant contribution to American archaeological studies (Yentsch and Beaudry 1992), but it could be argued that when his colonial focus was brought to Australian shores in the form of the Swiss Family Robinson model we inherited all of the defects of a European ethnocentric approach. This diminished severely our willingness to embark on studies which focus on the nature of encounters between Aborigi- nals and Europeans (Mulvaney 1989). Deetz and Isaac say little of the indigenous people of Virginia, giving one the impression that they melted away, like snow in the spring rains, and are not worthy of consideration by his- torical archaeologists. One of the 'small things forgotten* by Deetz was the First People and their voice was not heard until the publication of the collaborative work First People: The Early Indians of Virginia many decades later (Egloff and Woodward 1992). To get a sense of the impact of Europeans on the North American landscape one must read Changes in the Land: Indians, Colonists and the Ecology of New England by W. Cronon (1983). Clearly Deetz and Isaac were not con- cerned with the process of encounter as it impacted on First People and for the most part neither are the historical archaeologists of Australia. Dare one suggest that the focus of Deetz's woik was saying what Americans wanted to hear at their bicentennial and that we have also taken refuge in the safe colonial high ground. Prehistorians could well be accused of seeking comfort in the far distant Pleistocene past and dealing effectively only with the Aboriginal people of the outback. Historical archaeolo- gists could similarly be chastised for taking the lead of our American colleagues and constructing a 'Readers Digest' view of Australian historical archaeology and forgetting altogether the First People of this continent. People and place Aboriginal Australians stress their relationships with the land as being central to the concept of Aboriginality (Beckett 1988). A perusal of the historical archaeology literature in both North America and in Australia reinfor- ces the impression that there is little concern for environ- mental conditions which followed on from the encounter of indigenous people and places with minds and tech- nologies from the European continent However a few historical archaeologists have investigated the remains of events which featured Aboriginal people (Fels 1990; Rhoads and Stocks 1985; Brockwell et al. 1989). And more recently publication of studies by Judy Birmingham (1992) at Flinders Island and Tim Murray (1993) in northern Tasmania have brought to light particularly in- teresting facets of the encounter between black and white Australians. Currently Judy Birmingham and Andrew Wilson BBSiiiii^ 4 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="6">Egloff (1993) are working on the 'Central Australian Archae- ology Project1 near Alice Springs in the Northern Terri- tory, and the author of this article is renewing research in the Jervis Bay area of coastal New South Wales (Egloff 1990). Both of these projects involve close liaison with, and participation by Aboriginal custodians and elders. The latter study, The Historical Archaeology of the Jervis Bay Region', considers the environmental changes brought about by European colonisation and the strategies adapted by Aboriginal communities to counter those blows to essential components of their culture, the land and the sea. Three relatively recently published collected woiks in- dicate how environmental studies are looking towards histories to provide information on the circumstances which have brought about our present Australian condition (Mulvaney 1991; Dargavel and Feary 1993; Dovers 1994). The paintings of Sir Russell Drysdale's 1940s sequence of drought in western New South Wales appear on the covers of two of those volumes. Those works and others by Sir Russell convey an image of Australia which is stark and grim. The painting of the all but abandoned gold mining town of Sofala is a well known representation in this genre as is The Drovers Wife who stands solid in a realistic pose and expression with a few skeletal trees in the distance. The same is seen in the setting of the family grouping around mother washing the youngest in Sunday Evening. It is set yet again in a desolate wasteland with people and places under stress (Smith 1962:242-53). Painting Aus- tralia as he saw it in the 1930s and 1940s, Drysdale used media such as asbestos cement board and duck on hard- board to convey his message, that the people and the land were under stress. The Australian environment as we know today, and the situation of Aboriginal and European peoples within it, cannot be fully comprehended without reference to the immediate historical past Wyss did not anticipate that in 200 years much of the 'island' that the Swiss Family Robinson settled would be changed beyond all recognition and despoliation would become widespread leading to the disenfranchisement of the indigenous people and the ex- haustion of many new communities as they battled, instead of conserved, nature and the land. The relentless process continues with the drought of 1994, a past which intrudes into the present. Trash and theory building In 1984, Damans Bairstow asserted that Australian historical archaeology was at a crossroads. Tim Murray, in a review of Bairstow's article, discusses the broad theoretical framework within which archaeology as a whole is positioned as well as stating that 'archaeology does not provide the totality of the research agenda* (Bairstow 1984; Murray 1985). Like any other discipline, historical archaeology has strengths and weaknesses while drawing heavily upon other fields of inquiry for inspiration and support. But what fields are most appropriate? Amer- icans frequently draw upon anthropology while Austra- lians seem to have their strongest ties with history and geography. It could well be argued that if historical archaeologists are to flourish within both the academic field of historical archaeology and within the professional arena of heritage management they will need to become community-centric. Archaeologists in the Southwest of America (Reid 1973; Rathje 1977) have developed methodologies and theories which can be applied to situations of stress rela- ting to environmental factors which are linked to, or re- flected in, social and economic structures of communities. Originally developed to explain the demise of small com- munities of agriculturally based prehistoric people, their work became applied to contemporary urbanités of Tucson. A decade or so ago the leading North American proponent of this approach, Bill Rathje, came to Canberra, climbed a trash heap with the boys and was photographed. Unfortu- nately, his visit did not produce the slightest change in thinking. However Englehardt (1994) and Rogers (1994) when working with Thai coastal communities in Southeast Asia have considerably advanced our thinking.

B. Gammage (1994) refers to Australia as an environ- ment of 'sustainable damage* severely mishandled by Euro- peans both in terms of people, flora, fauna and place. It is suggested that through forming partnerships with environ- mental and Aboriginal studies, rather than confining our links to history and geography, a new approach to histori- cal archaeology could develop. For example, an innova- tive approach was applied by Dorothy Tunbridge (1988) in her Flinders Ranges Dreaming where a linguistic study was redirected to look at loss of faunal resources brought about by grazing and drought through the knowledge based in contemporary Aboriginal settlements, combined with museum specimen collections. This style of inquiry could equally look at the archaeological signature and material culture of stress on both European and Aboriginal communities within the context of the Australian envi- ronment. There are many situations where the values of envi- ronmentalists have come to clash with those of cultural heritage specialists (Griffiths 1991, 1992). The Australian Alps with its heritage of the high country cattlemen and its notable biodiversity is an excellent case in point where a rich cultural heritage is openly in conflict with natural values (Domicelj and Marshall 1993). Jim Russell (1993) believes that it is through a common interest in history that the environmental movement and the historical con- servationists can bring their interests together, instead of remaining in opposition to each other when it comes to the management of cultural and natural resources. Shanks and Tilley (1987:14) emphasise that archaeol- ogy is an exercise in capitalism without any concern for the links with social conditions in the past and what is happening today. They advocate forming an active rela- tionship between the past and the present (Shanks and Tilley 1987:2) stating that the tone of archaeology is criti- cal. 'Our claim is that a great deal of archaeology is ideo- logical practice, practice which sustains and justifies the capitalist presence1 (Shanks and Tilley 1987:62). As the values of archaeology cannot be eradicated Shanks and Tilley advocate that they must be brought out into the open, clarified. The Editor of Antiquity in introducing 'The Childhood of William Lanne: Contact archaeology and Aboriginal- ity in Tasmania1 by Tim Murray (1993) stated the follow- ing: Yet one hears a higher moral tone and a preach- ing attitude in these difficult issues more often from European intellectuals where personal contact with the dispossessed is slight or nil; Australian Archaeologists studying Aboriginal matters have to go on with working alongside native Australians and on some common ground of shared interest (editorial statement by Chris Chippendale) (1993:473-4). This fits well with the call by Aboriginal leaders for Australians to study history to better understand the 'white problem1. Is a realignment from the colonial mind-set to environmental and Aboriginal situations too uncomfort- able to be achieved? I believe that it is not, as Aboriginal Australians are manifestly interested in speaking out about their history and there certainly is a need to better under- stand the processes which brought about the all too fre- quent tragic encounters. If historical archaeologists are to become involved with Aboriginal communities a substan- tial component of their education will need to be devoted to Aboriginal studies and consider addressing value con- flicts and management issues (Egloff 1993). The thesis of this paper is not to demand that the estab- lished Swiss Family Robinson paradigm be abandoned in favour of a model based upon environmental and indige- nous concerns. Most likely there will always be room for the highly productive colonial model as it makes for well illustrated coffee table reading and is comforting, not as disturbing as reflecting on a damaged environment and a nation torn apart and seeking reconciliation.

MARITIME ARCHAEOLOGY OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS Kieran Hosty1 and Iain Stuart2 This paper attempts to give an overview of Australian maritime archaeology since 1974. Our main interest is the growth and incorporation of maritime archaeology into cultural resource management (or 'heritage') studies and procedures. We have charted this growth as well as examined what has happened to research programs over that time. Finally we will conclude with some thoughts on future opportunities and challenges in the field. Our datum is not arbitrary; it was given as 1974, the year that Australian Archaeology was first published; pro- bably when many of us were still at school. Fortunately, we have been able to use the papers from the first and second Southern Hemisphere Conferences on Maritime Archaeology and The Bulletin of the Australian Institute of Maritime Archaeology to trace the changes from 1974 to 1994. And of course we have lived part of it as well. First, however, some clarification of definitions is nec- essary. Maritime archaeology in Australia has evolved to cover virtually any underwater archaeology and anything to do with wrecked ships and watercraft. As such it is technically not exclusively marine-based. In some re- search areas, such as the Murray-Darling river system, ships and watercraft are studied using maritime archae- ological techniques mainly, yet inland rivers are not strict- ly marine environments. The term 'hydroarchaeology' has 1 National Maritime Museum, GPO Box 5131, Sydney 2001 , Australia. 2 Department of Prehistory and Historical Archaeology, University of Sydney 2006 and ENVIROSCIENCES Pty Ltd, Australia. ÏÏSSIS^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 9</page><page sequence="11">Maritime Archaeology Over the Last Twenty Years been suggested as an alternative (Gale 1993). This term is intended to embrace the process of study, the subject of study and the sources of study and as such has some merit in avoiding confusion. Events leading up to 1974 Although the practice of diving on shipwrecks has been going on for a long time (e.g. witness the recovery of some guns from the Mary Rose wreck site in 1836) (Rule 1983:42-7), it is only in recent years that wrecks have be- come accessible to a large number of divers. The devel- opment of Self Contained Underwater Breathing Appara- tus (SCUBA) by the French in the early 1940s and its commercial development in the 1950s has resulted in an increasing number of people taking up diving as a recrea- tion (Cousteau and Dumas 19S4). In Australia, SCUBA sets and instructional records were being sold in some sports shops from the mid-1950s (Coleman 1987:5). This was followed by the development of specialised 'dive shops' and 'dive clubs' for those with the enthusiasm and stamina to withstand the rigorous mili- tary style dive training courses. Diving instruction and practice initially concentrated on the dive experience and the killing of fish, but as divers discovered wrecks, these became popular diving localities. Interest in shipwrecks developed in a number of ways. There where those who enjoyed exploring the sites, those interested in the treasure and booty from the wrecks and those interested in the wrecks as archaeological sites. There was a degree of resistance in mainstream archae- ological circles to the concept of maritime archaeology (Bass 1966) and it was not until George Bass's work in the Mediterranean in the early 1960s that maritime archae- ology began to be recognised (Green 1990:2-4; Muckelroy 1978:10-22). By this time many wrecks in Australia had been looted by the casual diver, well-meaning clubs and historical societies, or professional salvors aiming to sell antiquities on the commercial market. In Western Australia there has been a longstanding interest in the Dutch wrecks of the Vereenigae Oost- Indiscne Compagnie (VOC) or Dutch East India Com- pany. The VOC had extensively explored the Western Australian coast. At least four VOC vessels were known to have been wrecked and several missing vessels re- mained unlocated. As post-contact settlement spread along the Western Australian coast, relics of these ships were encountered. In 1840, for example, the surveying party on HMS Beagle, under the command of Captain John Lort Stokes, discov- ered the remains of the camp of Zeewijk (1727) on Gun Island in the Abrolhos Islands. In more recent times, 1931, a find of coins indicated the location of Ver guide Draeck (1656). Earnie Drage, an Aboriginal stockman, discovered relics from Zuytdorp (1712) in 1927 (Playford 1959:23; Robinson 1980:37). In the 1960s, divers found the wrecks of these three ships, plus the fourth, the Batavia, either by accident or after deliberate searching based on documents and evi- dence found on land. The archaeological result was disastrous. For example the first of the wrecks to be discovered, the Vergulde Draeck, was located in April 1963 by a group of divers on a spearfishing trip. Grahame Henderson described the dis- covery's effect as a 'sensation', prompting an expedition to the site where a cannon, an anchor and other artefacts were raised. Less publicised looting continued. In Octo- ber 1963 reports began to emerge that explosives had been used on the wreck in an indiscriminate attempt to obtain loot (Henderson 1986:69-71). Reports of looting on the Batavia and on the Trial (1622), the earliest wrecks known on the Australian coast, caused concern as it was clear that the shipwrecks were at least of national interest and significance. Moreover, it was clear that the wrecks could be studied by the nascent discipline of maritime archaeology and may have an im- portance beyond being repositories of cannons, anchors and coins. The question asked in 1963-64 was, 'How best to protect the wrecks?' pBIBiiiH 10 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994</page><page sequence="12">Hosty and Stuart Early legislation Apart from the Northern Territory Native and Histori- cal Objects and Areas Preservation Ordinance 1955-1960 there was no heritage legislation in Australia in 1964 (see the papers in Edwards 1975 for details of other legisla- tion). The finder of a wreck was (and still is) required under the Commonwealth Navigation Act (1912) to report the find to the Receiver of Wrecks. The Receiver had no brief to protect the archaeological significance of wrecks, and neither the Western Australian Museum nor any other academic institution was very well equipped to deal with maritime archaeology, either with facilities or intellectu- ally. In this climate it is somewhat surprising that, in 1964 the Western Australian Parliament modified the West Aus- tralian Museums Act to protect shipwrecks. Responsibility for the Act's implementation was given to the Western Australian Museum, but without adequate resources to protect all pre-1901 wrecks. The Museum therefore could do little work on the wrecks. While undoubtedly this was a good decision for the long-term stability of the wrecks, it did cause resentment in the diving community that their previous rights of access had been denied with no advancement for either party. Although the Act was amended in 1969, it was not until the early 1970s that the Museum obtained sufficient resources, in the form of Jeremy Green as Curator of Mari- time Archaeology and Colin Pearson as Head of Conser- vation, to become pro-active about maritime archaeology and wreck protection (Crawford 1977:32). The Act was complemented in 1973 by the Maritime Archaeology Act (1973). Commonwealth involvement One of the difficulties with the West Australian legisla- tion was the question of whether the state of Western Aus- tralia had the power to pass legislation concerning Com- monwealth waters. The question raised the tricky issue of Commonwealth/State powers and the boundaries of State waters, leaving the potential to challenge the West Aus- tralian legislation on constitutional grounds. As 'owners' of the Dutch shipwrecks, due to their posi- tion as successors in law to the VOC, the Netherlands Government had an interest in their salvage or excavation. Consequently, an agreement between the Australian and Netherlands Governments, ANCORDS, was made in 1972 which established a committee to oversee the division of excavated material for display and scholarly research between museums in Australia and the Netherlands (Bach 1982; Bolton 1977). The ANCORDS committee was in a fairly influential position where it could concern itself with the nature of the archaeological collection as well as the on-going protec- tion of the Dutch shipwrecks. It served to draw the Com- monwealth into the realm of historic shipwrecks. Apart from the Committees and Museums, there was the continual and on-going involvement of 'amateurs' in maritime archaeology. The term amateur is a little diffi- cult to apply since it has a negative tone. In the 1960s there were few professional maritime archaeologists. The 'amateurs' in Western Australia and elsewhere produced good quality products in the form of wreck inspection reports, historical research and excavation reports. Sev- eral, including Grahame Henderson (one of the discovers of Ver guide Draeck) and Mike McCarthy, undertook train- ing and emerged as maritime archaeologists. Developing a program of maritime archaeology in which non-archaeologist divers could participate was an important innovation. By including the diving community in maritime archaeology, a body of support for the spirit of the legislation developed, as wrecks were no longer per- ceived as being locked away* for the exclusive use erf governments. Not everyone was happy with the way maritime arch- aeology developed in Western Australia. The most promi- nent critic was Alan Robinson, a diver and marine salvor, who claimed to have located the Vergulde Draeck in 1957 then lost it, only to rediscover it while spearfishing with iL^^SÊÊ^^^M^^^S^^^^^^^^^S^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^S1 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 11</page><page sequence="13">Maritime Archaeology Over the Last Twenty Years the Henderson family in 1963 (although opinions vary on this matter [Henderson 1982]). Robinson catalogued his story of the difficulties and injustices handed out to him by the Authorities in a bode called In Australia Treasure is not for the Finder. Although others may have different versions of events, Robinson's book serves to remind arch- aeologists that not everyone shares our values and ideol- ogy. Robinson was tireless in pursuing what he saw as his right to salvage and display material from shipwrecks. This involved launching a High Court challenge to the Western Australian Government's right to legislate to pro- tect shipwrecks. From 1974 to the mid-1980s In 1974, as Australian Archaeology was being born, the maritime archaeology scene was quite interesting. There were major excavations on the Dutch shipwrecks, with fieldwork on the Batavia and the Vergulde Draeck being completed, and woik planned for the Zeewijk. A fieldwork season on the Trial had also just been com- pleted. Planning was underway for a world-class Mari- time Museum at Fremantle. Since 1970, research on so-called colonial wrecks had been occurring, with excavation work on the Eglington (1852) and on-going woik on the James Mathew (1841). The James Mathew, a rare surviving example of a former slave ship, was the first major excavation of a 'colonial* wreck in Australia (Henderson 1977). The Western Aus- tralian Museum also implemented an active wreck inspec- tion program designed to comply with the Western Aus- tralia Maritime Archaeology Act's requirement that the Museum investigate sites within twelve months of their being reported (Sledge 1977). Further progress occurred at about this time on several fronts: in Western Australia, Jeremy Green began teaching an evening course on maritime archaeology; the Western Australian Maritime Archaeological Association was formed (Robinson 1977); in South Australia a similar society was formed (Broek 1977); South Australian and Tasmanian Government officials began to be concerned about the need for legislation to protect some historic ship- wrecks; and the Commonwealth too, through the Interim Committee on the National Estate, began to consider its legislative options for wreck protection. A measure of the rapid growth and confidence in mari- time archaeology at the time was the First Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology held in Perth in 1977 (Green 1977a). The papers were a mix of cultural resource management and research papers, given by professionals and amateurs from Australia and over- seas. This set a pattern for papers and speakers that continues in Maritime Archaeology conferences today. The 1977 conference highlight was the opening-day announcement of the High Court's decision on the Robin- son challenge to the Western Australian Maritime Arch- aeology Act. By a majority decision of three to two the Act was found to be invalid. Thus while the conference discussed, and to some degree celebrated the achievements of the Western Australian maritime archaeology program, the program's future was in serious doubt for a time. The Commonwealth had passed the Historic Ship- wrecks Act (1976) and among its mechanisms was the pro- vision for the Act to be implemented as each state request- ed the Commonwealth to declare the Act operational for waters adjacent to that state. This had not been done for Western Australia prior to the High Court decision, but the necessary proclamations were made and the Act was im- plemented during the Conference. The Commonwealth Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 ap- plies to all Australian waters adjacent to all states and territories. The day to day administration of the Act is carried out by each state and territory by a delegate ap- pointed by the Commonwealth Minister of the Arts assis- ted by an advisory panel and the maritime archaeologist from each State. Delegates are drawn from Museums (National Maritime Museum, Northern Territory, Queen- sland and Western Australia) and from Heritage and Plan- ning Departments (New South Wales, South Australia, 1||§|H 12 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="14">Hosty and Stuart Tasmania and Victoria) (Mclntyre 1992). The years between 1976 and 1984 were marked by the gradual development of state based maritime archaeology programs. The development of these took a remarkably similar form. A wreck would be discovered and threat- ened with looting. State legislation would be developed and a maritime archaeology program established. State legislation would be passed and the Commonwealth legis- lation proclaimed to operate in the waters adjacent to that state. Once established, the maritime archaeology unit would be pressured to undertake an excavation of a site to demonstrate the virtues of archaeology and to involve amateur diving groups (see Jeffery 1993). This approach is well illustrated by the maritime archaeology programs operating in South Australia and Victoria in the early 1980s. In Victoria, the Maritime Archaeology Unit of the Vic- toria Archaeological Survey (VAS) was forced by per- ceived public pressure to commence a salvage archaeology program on the William Salthouse (1841), only a few months after the Unit was established (Staniforth 1987:23; Staniforth and Vickery 1985). In South Australia, the newly appointed State Maritime Archaeologist was en- couraged to issue a permit to an amateur group to excavate the wreck of the Tigress (1848), after the site was threat- ened with looting. The difficulty with this approach is that it locked both States into using all available resources to concentrate on a single site, before the full extent of the shipwreck resources and threats to them were known. Later years have seen more of a shift to education as the primary method of protecting archaeological sites. By working with local communities, the diving industry and divers, a number of above- and below-water interpretive trails have been developed. In Victoria for example, several land based wreck trails were developed around Port Phillip Heads and along the West Coast (Victoria's shipwreck coast). These were sup- plemented by the production of an underwater guide to wrecks that included histories, site plans and diving in- structions so that the diver could visit the wreck and un- derstand the archaeological evidence exposed. A display of artefacts from the wrecks, called Time and Tide1 was developed by Maggie Barron and Shirley Strachan from VAS, to give the non-diver the feel of maritime archae- ology. This toured to great acclaim around the museums in Victoria. New South Wales and the Northern Territory, which established maritime archaeology programs in the mid- to late 1980s, have adopted the educational approach. The New South Wales program for example, has produced a magnificent atlas of shipwrecks and recently sponsored a publication on the clipper, Walter Hood. The commencement of a post-graduate diploma in Maritime Archaeology at Curtin University (formerly The West Australian Institute of Technology) in 1980 also caused a re-evaluation in the way maritime archaeology was practiced. For the first time the traditional practi- tioners who taught the course and who tended to have backgrounds in science and history, came into everyday contact with students who tended to have a background in archaeology. The courses which were held in 1980, 1983, 1986 and 1989, stressed field techniques rather than the much needed archaeological theory and cultural re- source management practice. There is a growing aware- ness among maritime archaeologists that the post-graduate diploma does not provide sufficiently broad archaeological training for today's expectations and that the discipline requires its practitioners to have a good grounding at an undergraduate level. Surprisingly no university has sought to include maritime archaeology as part of their under- graduate teaching although it would no doubt be a popular course. Development of national priorities By the mid-1980s it was clear that aspects of mari- time archaeology needed improvement and more focused attention. While the diver education and enforcement pro- grams, wreck trails and diving community associations ■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■a Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 13</page><page sequence="15">Maritime Archaeology Over the Last Twenty Years have worked very well, the growth of archaeological theory, the publication of reports and catalogues and the development of a consistent national approach to the ship- wreck resource had not occurred (Mclntyre 1992:1). The concern for an Australian strategy on maritime archaeology and its future directions can be traced back to the formation of the Australian Institute for Maritime Archaeology (AIMA) in 1982. In 1987 AIMA proposed the formation of a committee to advise the Commonwealth Government on research directions and future funding of projects. This led to the then Department of the Arts, Sports, the Environment, Tourism and Territories which administered the Commonwealth Act commissioning a re- view of the maritime archaeology program across Austra- lia and the effectiveness of the Historic Shipwrecks Act. The review report led to the development of a national program with specific objectives and strategies (Kendall 1990). The four specific objectives of the national pro- gram were: 1. To conserve and protect historic shipwreck sites and associated material as a cultural resource of the nation. 2. To develop a comprehensive register of historic ship- wrecks and associated material. 3. To obtain the support of an informed public for historic shipwrecks as a cultural resource. 4. To promote the commitment by Government authorities (at all levels) to the protection and preservation of his- toric shipwrecks and associated material. Over the last four years the majority of the recommen- dations of the Kendall report have been adopted by all State agencies involved in the management of underwater cultural heritage. Perhaps the most controversial recom- mendation has been the blanket declaration of all ship- wrecks over 75 years of age (whether located or not) as historic shipwrecks, thus bringing them under the protec- tion of Commonwealth legislation and extinguishing sal- vors' rights. This was carried out in April 1983. This change to a more cultural resource management orientation was accompanied by an increased awareness of the role of maritime archaeology in the broader heritage conservation movement. In part this was caused by many State maritime archaeology programs being loca- ted within heritage organisations together with cross fer- tilisation between land- and sea-based heritage practi- tioners. At the same time, the International Committee of Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) was developing policy on the ethics and problems of managing underwater sites. The executive of ICOMOS approached the Australian Chapter to develop a proposal for an International Com- mittee on Underwater Cultural Heritage. This drew on the expertise of AIMA in the area of maritime archaeology. AIMA was also the driving force behind the development of Guidelines for the Management of Australia's Ship- wrecks and Public Access Guidelines for Historic Ship- wrecks for the Commonwealth Government Where have the research programs gone? So far we have emphasised the cultural resource man- agement aspects of maritime archaeology. Looking back over the last 20 years, we could also ask 'What have we learned?' On a national basis there is the National Shipwreck database; a catalogue and record of wrecks in Australian waters. This is an invaluable research tool that has not been fully realised. As the database develops it will form a solid basis for investigating broad questions about the type of shipping wrecked, age of ships at wrecking, typical wreck occurrences and so on. The database in most States is backed-up by extensive files on shipwreck history. There have also been a number of regional shipwreck surveys and particular studies on wrecks. For example there are surveys of wrecks in Tasmania (Nash 1988), World War II wrecks in Darwin (McCarthy 1992), as well as historical based studies, such as Foster's work at Port Phillip Bay. Particular studies on wrecks include Stani- forth's work on the Monumental City (1986) and Harvey's study of the Clonmel (1985). ŒIHŒ^^ 14 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="16">Hosty and Stuart There have been major excavations of a wide variety of wrecks, such as the Sydney Cove in Bass Strait (Strachan 1986), the William Salthouse in Port Phillip Bay (Staniforth and Vickery 1985) and the Xantho (McCarthy 1989). Work on the Sirius, wrecked on Norfolk Island in 1790, was published as a popular book as part of the bicentennial celebrations (Henderson and Stanbury 1988). Most excavations have at least been published in prelim- inary form and the collections are readily available for more extensive study. One area of research that has developed into a broad research program has been the study of Australian built ships. Maritime historians have made some negative comments on the quality of Australian built ships and this prompted an archaeological investigation of the ships themselves. Peter Harvey carried out a well designed archaeological investigation of the Clarence (1857), an Australian built ship wrecked in Port Phillip Bay. He was able to expose a section of the hull to examine the method of ship construction to evaluate its quality. Harvey was able to demonstrate that the ship was built to the accept- able standards of the time (1989). Later, this theme was taken up by Coroneos who reviewed the statistics of shipwreck and argued that the apparently large numbers of Australian built ships wrecked was a function of a danger- ous coast plus the sheer number of Australian ships in the coastal trade (1991). Several conferences have attempted to deal with re- search questions on an Australian and international basis. Typical was the 'Iron Ships and Steam Shipwrecks' semi- nar held in 1985, just after excavations on the SS Xantho had concluded (McCarthy 1989). This brought together a number of archaeologists and historians to discuss the known iron and steam shipwreck resource in Australia, techniques for fieldwoik and conservation, and the histori- cal context of iron and steam shipwrecks. The collected papers are notable for the fine contributions of non- professional archaeologists. A similar seminar on Asiatic built ships was held in 1986 and the results published by the Australian Institute of Maritime Archaeology. The Dutch Wreck Program was a natural outgrowth of the extraordinary interest in these sites as well as the discovery and excavation of a number of Dutch shipwrecks around the coast of the United Kingdom (such as Amster- dam, Hollandia and Kennermerland). Green has assessed the contribution of the Dutch shipwreck program as contributing knowledge in the areas of ship construction, fittings and layout as well as ship's cargoes (1977a). Green has published the results of the work on the Batavia and the Ver guide Draeck (Green 1977b, 1989). Other pre-colonial wrecks investigated have been the Trial (Green 1971) and the Pandora. The Pandora has particular interest due to its association with the Bounty mutineers and the excavation of the wreck has yielded important information about the ship and its crew and prisoners (Gesner 1991). One area that has begun to be explored is that of ship- ping in rivers and lakes. There has been considerable work in the Murray-Darling system in understanding the history of the riverboat transportation network. Sarah Kenderdine has undertaken research into Murray ship- wrecks in South Australia and New South Wales (1993), as well as convening a conference TMuddy Waters' (1992) where aspects of Murray-Darling shipping were discussed. Most of these studies and achievements have been made within the overall structure of cultural resource management. Because of this, rarely has the work ex- tended beyond the initial discovery and recording phase. Little in-depth research has followed. Indeed such re- search in the cultural resource management context may have low priority, as the sites may not be threatened and limited resources are probably better spent to protect threatened sites or educate the public on the benefits of maritime archaeology. Such an approach, while understandable, seems to be ultimately self-defeating. Archaeological significance is based on research potential yet there are few programs to establish what that research potential might be. Similarly, !!^£îï2ï2^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 15</page><page sequence="17">Maritime Archaeology Over the Last Twenty Years recycling material from the same few excavations to educate divers about the benefits of archaeology will soon leave everyone bored or assuming a sameness about wrecks and archaeological programs. Part of the problem is the lack of a strong theoretical base in maritime archaeology, which seems to be related to the nature of the formal training in maritime archaeology (discussed above). Despite the work of George Bass in Archaeology Underwater (1966), it was not until 1978 that the first major publication on maritime archaeology theory and practice was published. Keith Muckelroy's Maritime Archaeology (1978) tried to define the scope of the disci- pline and to develop a theoretical base by relating site formation processes, the environment and history, to produce a typology of shipwreck sites. Unfortunately with Muckelroy's tragic death in a diving accident, this area of development was cut short. Richard Gould, a well-known 'new archaeologist* from the USA developed an interest in maritime archaeology after meeting Muckelroy and pro- duced his own theoretical approach, arguing for an an- thropological emphasis on shipwreck material and the development of theoretical and scientific approaches that develop and test hypothesis (Gould 1983). Post-processual archaeology seems not to have reached the sea despite some excellent historical and anthropologi- cal works in maritime history that fall into this category. Of note is Rediker's study of maritime labour in the 18 th century, Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea (1993). Greg Dening's Mr Bligh's Bad Language (1992) is another outstanding work which highlights the richness and com- plexity of social and political relationships on-board ships, that have an expression in material culture and spatial arrangements on the ship. Such works demonstrate how having a solid theoretical base can lead research even of such well worn topics as the Bounty mutiny into new in- sights and directions. Links and challenges There have been a number of attempts to build links from maritime archaeology with other forms of archae- ology. The most obvious link is that between maritime archaeology and historical archaeology. Because of its known context and date, a shipwreck and its contents can form an important source of comparative information for historical site analysis. These links have been explored in several projects. In 1990, Peter Morgan, an honours student from La Trobe University undertook detailed research on the glass bottles from the William Salthouse shipwreck (1841) (Morgan 1990). This aimed to describe the glass bottles, look at questions of function and morphology and to discuss them in the context of use of glass bottles in Victoria. Iain Stuart undertook a similar project on the glass bottles from the Loch Ard (1878) shipwreck (Stuart 1991). Tony English, an honours student from the University of Sydney used the remains of the salted meat recovered from Wil- liam Salthouse (1841) as part of his study on butchery techniques (English 1992). All these studies use the control given to the material culture by the known context of a ship, its cargo and the suddenness of its wrecking, to answer archaeological ques- tions that are difficult to address on land sites. There is considerable potential to expand these studies further. One area of potential is more research into ships' cargoes. Viewed as a cargo, ships' contents can be linked into broader patterns of trade which can be established through the study of the colonial statistics as well as documents surviving from merchants and importers and exporters. Questions of cargo stowage on-board as well as the devel- opment of loading and unloading facilities onshore can be examined. This approach would serve as a link between maritime archaeology and land-based industrial archae- ology. It is also important not to divorce ships from the infra- structure established to facilitate navigation. On the NSW coast for example, there were considerable difficulties for ships trying to enter coastal rivers such as the Tweed, Cla- rence, Macleay, Manning, Hastings and so on. Pilot sta- ll PIPP2|otœ 1 6 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="18">Hosty and Stuart tions and navigational markers were established towards the late 1890s, a series of training walls and other works at the river entrances were constructed to improve the navi- gability of the rivers. To understand these works, ships and navigation must be understood. To understand the pattern of shipwrecks in the area, the economy and land- use patterns in the area also need to be understood. Winds of change Maritime archaeology has come a long way since the first modest attempts in Western Australia in the 1960s. The discipline has managed to create a strong com- munity awareness of the need to protect historic ship- wrecks and has an enviable reputation in the areas of pub- lic programs, education, conservation and interpretation of historic shipwrecks. The work of the archaeology program (particularly that of the West Australian Museum) is world recognised and well regarded. However maritime archaeology still has improvements to make. Its isolation from the other branches of archae- ology, lack of a strong theoretical approach, inadequate representation in tertiary education, the ad hoc attitude to- wards individual sites, lack of overall management strate- gies and the lack of interdisciplinary exchange all need to be addressed. This review therefore comes at a most interesting time in the growth of the discipline. One of the major strengths of maritime archaeology in Australian has been its ability to take stock of itself and change with the times. Hopefully this will continue as we head into the next millennium.

Morwood and C.E. Smith In 1969, John Mulvaney wrote that: It is difficult for a prehistorian to assess Abori- ginal art. Until recently it possessed no time depth ... Neither can an Australian prehistorian escape the conditioning influence of ethnogra- phic data. A prehistorian may infer the meth- ods of application or techniques of engraving from observation, but comment concerning mo- tivation and meaning is beyond the scope of normal archaeological activities. Despite some later qualification (Mulvaney 1975:275), this Department of Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology, University of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia. statement aptly sums up feeling towards archaeological research on rock art that existed in the archaeological community in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Rock art was seen as irrelevant to the major issues then being ad- dressed by Australian archaeology. Times have changed. Nevertheless, Mulvaney was justified in his opinion. Indeed, a range of ethnographic sources had shown that the specific meanings, or even identification of subjects, in rock art cannot be reconstructed without knowledgeable informants (e.g. Elkin 1961; Maddock 1971; Macintosh 1977) and that, in addition, a specific motif or rock art panel may have many meanings depending upon the particular context of interpretation. Differential access to esoteric knowledge, including the 'stories' encoded in art, !f£5?^^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 19</page><page sequence="21">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 is a basic mechanism in the creation, maintenance and perpetuation of status and decision-making hierarchies in Aboriginal society (Morphy 1977; Taylor 1987). The idea that there is a complete, definitive and unchanging mean- ing for a rock painting is not tenable. However, the solu- tion to the apparent problem of using rock art assemblages as archaeological evidence was pointed out by Elkin (1961), when he cautioned that the 'meaning* of Abor- iginal art was best considered, not in terms of superfi- cial narrative content, but in the light of its functional relationship with ideology, social organisation, rights to resources and the general inheritance of culture. There is now general acceptance that 'meaning* in the latter sense - that is, as systems of meanings - is the proper target for both anthropological and archaeological study of Aus- tralian Aboriginal art (e.g. Morphy 1991:6; Rosenfeld 1992:232). The purpose of our paper is to provide an historical overview of Australian rock art research over the past twenty years. We emphasise major turning-points in method, theory, personnel and peer acceptance and at- tempt to relate these to more general developments in anthropology, archaeology and social attitudes. Major factors affecting the development of Australian rock art studies over the last twenty years have included the influence of overseas researchers and ideas; the ap- pointment of people with a professional commitment to rock art research at Australian universities and other institutions; a cumulative increase in the number of known rock art sites, as well as evidence for their diversity and antiquity; the passing of Federal and State Heritage legis- lation; the emergence of the Aboriginal Land Rights movement; the founding of the Australian Rock Art Research Association and its journal Rock Art Research, and technological advances. These factors set the histor- ical context for developments in rock art research, but the part played by individuals at particular times has been critical. Historical overview Personnel The 1970s saw an increasing professionalisation of rock art studies in Australia and consequent changes in approach. A similar phenomenon had occurred in Austra- lian archaeology generally in the previous decade and this led to an increase in the pace and calibre of research, and to greater emphasis upon quantification by researchers, such as Lesley Maynard and John Clegg, in their studies of rock art in the 1960s and 1970s. The arrival of Peter Ucko in Australia in 1972 to take up the position of Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies (AIAS) was a definite turning point. He was primarily responsible for the 1974 'Schématisation in Art' symposium, which was highly influential in the development of Australian rock art research. In addition, he also promoted a change in AIAS funding priorities so that rock art was given greater precedence than previously and encouraged other Euro- pean researchers with a commitment to rock art studies, such as Bob Layton and Michel Lorblanchet, to come to Australia. At around the same time, the appointment of Andrée Rosenfeld to The Australian National University (ANU), was another benchmark. Ucko and Rosenfeld had already established international reputations in rock art research (e.g. Ucko and Rosenfeld 1967) and after her ap- pointment at ANU Rosenfeld moved quickly to initiate an archaeological project in southeast Cape York Peninsula which attempted to relate rock art to changes in excavated evidence (Rosenfeld 1975). The appointment of academics with a commitment to rock art research at Australian universities and other institutions was crucial to the development of rock art stu- dies in two principal ways. Firstly, these appointments were a necessary precursor to the establishment of (rock) art studies as a sub-discipline within archaeology since they were the means by which this field of study was made available to students. As a result, there has been a signifi- cant increase in numbers of archaeological and anthropo- 'W^^^^^^^ÊW^^MW2S. .XEè?.? ^.^ 20 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="22">Morwood and Smith logical research theses into Australian Aboriginal art, especially at the ANU2 (e.g. Morphy 1977; Morwood 1979; Green 1982; Taylor 1987; Taçon 1989; Lewis 1990; Officer 1994; McDonald 1994) and Sydney University (e.g. Maynard 1976; Clegg 1978). This interest is also evident at other universities (e.g. Franklin 1992; David 1994; Smith 1994). However, archaeological courses in rock art are still only taught at three Australian universi- ties - ANU, Sydney and University of New England (UNE). Secondly, the increase in the numbers of studies of Australian Aboriginal art was associated with use of new methods and theories - some of local origin, others influ- enced by work overseas. A healthy aspect of this work was the continuing high level of interaction between anthrop- ological and archaeological approaches in these analyses. This was particularly apparent at the ANU, where John Mulvaney, as Professor of Prehistory, actively encouraged such interaction. Theory In the 1960s and 70s a general reassessment of arch- aeological theory and research methodology took place. The focus of this reassessment was the work of the Ameri- can researcher Lewis Binford (e.g. 1972) and other propo- nents of the now inappropriately entitled 'New Archae- ology' (or processualism), which advocated an emphasis on cultural process rather than culture history; the explicit 'testing' of ideas using deductive logic; quantification; and the investigation of contemporary processes as a means of better understanding the archaeological record. Changes in Australian rock art research closely follow those result- ing from the triumph of processualism in Australian arch- aeology. Notably there has been a shift from an emphasis on cultural diffusion as the explanation for chronological changes in Australian Aboriginal art (e.g. McCarthy 1968), to investigations which seek to understand the inte- grating function of art in Aboriginal society; how a range of social and economic information is encoded in art and its distributional characteristics; and how it may reflect fundamental changes in social organisation, group inter- action and the pattern of land use. Such investigations require information on the cultural and natural contexts of rock art production, whereas previous studies had tended to be more focused on rock art in isolation. Important steps in the development of current perspec- tives on the study of Australian rock art were taken by Maynard (1976 [1979], 1977) and Clegg (1978, 1979). Both called for a purely archaeological approach to the analysis of rock art. Maynard (1977:86) contended that meaning is always 'highly specific and usually esoteric1 and, as such, is 'probably completely intractable*. Clegg (1978) extended this position to argue against attempting to construct the meaning of motifs on the grounds that it is impossible to securely ascertain either the subject or moti- vation of the artists. In order to indicate that he was allo- cating names, not labels, to motifs Clegg developed the typographic convention of an exclamation mark before his own categorisations of motifs. He refers to !fish, ! tracks and so forth. This convention has been adopted by some other researchers into rock art (see for example, Franklin 1984; Layton 1992) and his fundamental point has been long absorbed into the Australian rock art literature. How- ever, the problem of intentionality is an issue still under debate in some of the overseas literature (e.g. Davis 1992). As well as general changes in theoretical perspective, the work of particular individuals in Europe and South Africa have been very influential on Australian rock art research. For instance, the publications by Leroi-Gourhan 2 We note here only postgraduate theses but a fuller range includes - at ANU (Taylor 1979; Papajohannis 1980; Forbes 1982; Lewis 1983; Officer 1984; Tier 1986; Thompson 1987; Dickins 1992); at Sydney University (Jones 1982; McDonald 1982; Smith 1983; Franklin 1984; Sefton 1988; Bell 1989; Drew 1991; Sale 1992) and elsewhere (West 1976; Turner 1981; Rola- Wojciechowski 1983; Hatte 1984; Nagle 1984; Bullen 1987; Cole 1988; Collins 1989; Hale 1989; Rudolph- Borger 1989; Smith 1989; Sonter 1989; Scott 1992; Bursill 1993). WÊSB^^^^^^^ê^^^^^^^^^^^^^Ê^^^^^^^^^^^^^S Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 21</page><page sequence="23">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 (1968) on European Palaeolithic art and later Vinnicombe (1976) on South African rock art both indicated the value of structural approaches to analysis - of quantitatively demonstrating how rock art assemblages could be non- random in their distribution within sites, portrayal of ani- mal species and so on. Such structure in rock art clearly reflected the ideological concerns of the artist. The work of Leroi-Gourhan and Vinnicombe set the agenda for a number of Australian studies which have extended the basic principle and examined within-site structure in rock art (Forbes 1982), the distribution of motifs between sites within the same artistic system (David 1994) and selectiv- ity in the cultural context of rock art (Morwood 1979, 1984). Another turning point in rock art studies generally, which is very apparent in Australia, was when style be- came reconceptualised as a means of communicating in- formation. The theoretical foundation for this was semio- tics, the study of signs. This reassessment of the potential uses of style in archaeology was partly attributable to the increasing influence from anthropological studies of cul- tural material (e.g. Adams 1973; Forge 1973; Munn 1973; Morphy 1977; Taylor 1979, 1987; Megaw 1982; Layton 1991 [1981]), which demonstrated the communicative capacity of style. The first major manifestation of this was the 'Schématisation in Art1 symposium at the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies Biennial Conference in 1974, later published as Form in Indigenous Art (Ucko 1977). The thematic and interdisciplinary focus of the symposium provided a unique forum for the exchange of ideas between people working on different aspects of Australian Aboriginal art. The increased emphasis on social explanations that emerged in archaeology in the 1980s (e.g. Lourandos 1984) manifested in rock art studies primarily as a concern with information exchange theory. The seminal paper in archaeology using this theory was that of Wobst (1977) in which he suggested that the main functions of style are related to cultural processes, such as group integration and differentiation and boundary maintenance. This notion was extended by Gamble (1982), whose ideas were shaped in part by ethnographic information on the role of art in Central Australia (e.g. Strehlow 1970). There was a time-lag of several years before rock art researchers in Australia started to use the concept of infor- mation exchange as an explicit theoretical tool for inter- preting rock art but since then it has been used to interpret a wide range of rock art (see Morwood 1984, 1987; Lewis 1988; Taçon 1988; David and Cole 1990; Smith 1992). Morwood (e.g. 1979, 1992a) developed a contextual ap- proach to the archaeology of art which integrates the func- tion of rock art with regional archaeological sequences. Through co-examining the characteristics and chronology of economic, technological and artistic evidence, he has been able to identify a tightening of social networks through time. His general approach is based on the notion that the functional interdependence between art and other cultural components which is so evident in ethnographic case studies suggests that art, and changes in art (both spatial and chronological), can tell much about the com- plexity of prehistoric cultural systems. This same func- tional interdependence indicates that archaeological stu- dies of art need to be undertaken in the light of all avail- able evidence for systemic context, one basic component of which is resource use (see Morwood 1992b:424). Funda- mental to this approach is the notion of style as informa- tion. Another early foray into this area of research was made by Lewis (1983, 1988), who related changes in the per- ceived degree of regional homogeneity in rock art in nor- thern Australia to changes in environment, population densities and alliance networks. He argued for the exis- tence of a relatively open social network in the Pleistocene on the basis of stylistic similarities in the early rock art of the Kimberley and Arnhem Land and contrasted this with the greater stylistic heterogeneity of more recent rock art, SBH MMBBMBHBMMM HttBBMMMBMMMiHHMnMMMHiBiH.BBiBflBBiBiBBBBBBBBBBBBBB B BBBBBBB BBBBB B B BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB BBB BBBB BBBBBB BBBB BBB BSB SBBBB BBS MS SBBBBSB BS M BBS 22 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="24">Morwood and Smith which he linked to an increase in territorial bounding through time. The important point about the use of infor- mation exchange theory in Australian rock art studies is that it moves beyond a simple correlation between stylistic similarity and social interaction to consideration of the causes underlying these interactions. However, the lack of independent dating evidence is still a major problem in many studies. Increase in the database By itself, growth in the number of recorded Australian rock art sites did not lead to associated changes in method and theory. But it helped. By the 1970s there was detailed information from many parts of Australia on rock art num- bers, diversity and character. There was also some evi- dence for rock art chronology. Overwhelmingly, these records resulted from the activities of committed indi- viduals, rather than institutions. The same trend continues today (e.g. McCarthy 1960, 1961, 1962, 1976; Crawford 1968; Wright 1968; Trezise 1971; Brandi 1973; McBryde 1975; Chaloupka 1977, 1994; Quinnell 1976; Lewis 1988; Walsh 1988, 1994; McNickle 1991; Gunn 1992; Welch 1993). These reports provided the basis for continental- wide overviews of the geographical and chronological variation in Australian Aboriginal art (e.g. McCarthy 1968; Maynard 1979). In many cases, extensive site recording programs led to more specialist woik on rock art chronology and excavations of associated cultural deposits. For instance, the recording woik of Trezise in southeast Cape York Peninsula over the past 30 years has provided a platform for all later researchers in the region (e.g. Rosen- feld et al. 1981; Hood and Horsfall 1986; Hood 1987; Cole 1988; Morwood and Hobbs 1994). In a few instances, rock art recording programs have also been initiated as impact assessments. This occurred in the Pilbara in response to industrialisation of the Burrup Peninsula (see Vinnicombe 1987) and in western Arnhem Land in relation to Uranium Mining (Edwards 1979; Cooper 1987) and as part of the assessment of cultural resources in the region by the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service (e.g. Gillespie 1983; Jones 1985). In other cases, funding has been obtained to 'take stock1 of previous site records and other documentary sources by organisations with statutory authority for site management (e.g. Walsh 1984a; McDonald 1985, 1987, 1990b). These syntheses have provided a stimulus to further woik and in some cases have shown inadequacies in the database to be rectified in future site recording programs. For instance, rock art site researchers and managers now require a higher quality of contextual data and more accurate site locations. There is thus a feedback apparent between the increase in the database on Australian rock art, the amount of research initiated, and further developments in method, theory and the database. Technological developments More than anything else, the problem of dating rock art has been the major impediment to its acceptance as useful archaeological data. The advent of radiocarbon dating in Australia in the 1950s allowed absolute dates for some rock art to be estimated but only in a very restricted range of circumstances. For instance, engraved fragments and 'buried* panels or fragments of rock engravings have both been found in archaeological excavations (e.g. Mulvaney 1975:289; Rosenfeld et al. 1981). Rock art can also be stratified when covered by mineral or biogenic coatings, which may be dateable using the standard radiocarbon technique (e.g. Dragovich 1984; Watchman 1987). The development of the Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) for radiometric dating has allowed the ages of ex- tremely small samples of organic matter to be calculated, and significantly increased the number of dating options for rock art (Nelson et al. 1977). From the early 1980s the possible application of AMS to dating of organics in rock art pigments was realised (e.g. Van der Merwe 1982). The first actual results came several years later (e.g. Hedges et iililis A ustralian A rchaeology, Number 39, 1 994 23</page><page sequence="25">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 al. 1987; Van der Merwe et al. 1987). There was another delay before the AMS technique was first applied to Australian rock art assemblages (e.g. Loy et al. 1990; McDonald et al. 1990), but there has since been an accel- erating pace here in both application and the development of technical refinements for dating of rock art and associ- ated materials (e.g. Watchman 1989/90, 1991, 1993a; David 1992; Nelson et al. 1993; Watchman and Cole 1993; Morwood et al. 1994; Cole et al. 1995). The dates for rock painting, for instance, have now been pushed back to a minimum of 25,000 years (Watchman 1993c). For the first time, there is also the possibility of obtaining well dated rock art sequences for comparison with other evi- dence for cultural and palaeo-environmental changes. The establishment of the first high precision AMS facility in Australia at the Australian Nuclear Science and Tech- nology Organisation in 1993 should accelerate this pro- cess. One of the major aims for the facility is dating rock art (Tuniz and Watchman 1994). Cation ratio dating is another technique by which ex- tremely small samples of rock varnish overlying engrav- ings may be dated. Cation ratio and AMS dates back to 40,000 BP have been obtained for varnishes covering peck- ed engravings at the Olary site, northeastern South Aus- tralia (e.g. Nobbs and Dorn 1988, 1993). This is the old- est direct dating of Australian rock art, but the processes by which rock varnish accumulate are not well understood and these results have been questioned (Watchman 1992a, 1992b). Research is also in progress on the use of Opti- cally Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) for dating rock art (Morwood et al. 1994). New techniques for analysis of geological samples have also been applied to rock pigments and associated mineral coatings. These techniques include X-ray Diffraction Spectrometry (XRD), X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy (XRF), Proton Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) and use of the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). Such techni- ques can be used to study the processes of rock art deterio- ration, identify the composition of paints and track paint sources, (e.g. Cook et al. 1989; Watchman et al. 1991; Cole and Watchman 1992) The increased availability of computers and software for mathematical analysis and display of data has revolu- tionised the way all categories of archaeological evidence, including rock art are processed. Mainframe computers were first utilised for rock art analysis and production of graphics in Australia in the late 1970s and early eighties (e.g. Morwood 1979, 1980; McDonald 1982). Mainframes were relatively difficult to use but gave access to software packages, such as the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), few frequency calculations, crosstabula- tions between variables, cluster analyses, factor analyses and so on. The development of user-friendly personal computers with the power to undertake such analyses over the past ten years means that multivariate analyses are now standard fare in most academic theses concerned with rock art (e.g. Sefton 1988; Drew 1991; Franklin 1992; David 1994; McDonald 1994). Sometimes these ap- proaches have yielded very useful results for the interpre- tation of rock art variability. In other cases, a black box approach to computer and software use has resulted in rock art analyses of appalling standard. At this stage computer based Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are being increasingly used by State and Federal Authorities concerned with management of cultur- al and natural resources (National Parks and Wildlife Ser- vice 1989). GIS allows the spatial distribution and context of sites to be viewed at many levels, and therefore would seem ideally suited to contextual analyses of rock art sites as a research tool. This is a likely development in the near future. Technological developments are also affecting the way in which rock art sites are recorded. Computers are now routinely taken into the field both to archive information and begin analysis of the data. Hand-held Global Position- ing Systems (GPS) are also becoming more common for BlillE 24 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="26">Morwood and Smith accurate pin-pointing of rock art site locations - a major problem apparent in many previous (rock art) site record- ing programs. AURA Another turning point in the development of rock art research in Australia was the founding of the Australian Rock Art Research Association (AURA) in 1983 and the publication of the first issue oiRock Art Research in May, 1984. Robert Bednarik was the motivating force here and acted in response to his perception that interest in rock art research was not being met by the journals of the day (Bednarik 1994 pers. comm.). AURA currently has 850 members and has been instrumental in encouraging a higher level of Aboriginal participation in rock art re- search. The basic aims of AURA are: The principal objectives of the Australian Rock Art Research Association are to provide a forum for the dissemination of research findings; to promote Aboriginal custodianship of sites exter- nalising traditional Australian culture; to co- ordinate studies concerning the significance, distribution and conservation of rock art, both nationally and with individuals and organisa- tions abroad; and to generally promote aware- ness and appreciation of Australian's prehistoric cultural heritage. The stated commitment to Aboriginal custodianship of sites was considered quite radical at the time that AURA was established and is indicative of the fact that AURA, along with the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Tor- res Strait Islander Studies (formerly AIAS), has been in the vanguard in recognising indigenous rights in cultural heritage (see also discussions in Bednarik 1993; Rowland and Franklin 1993; Ward 1993). This influence can be perceived in some of the research now being carried out with indigenous people in other parts of the world (e.g. Querejazu 1994). An International Congress convened under the auspi- ces of AURA is held every four years. The first was in Darwin in 1988 and saw the establishment of the Interna- tional Federation of Rock Art Organisations (DFRAO). The second was in Cairns. Both were very successful, with the Darwin congress attracting 340 registered partici- pants and the Cairns congress 450, including 59 Aborigi- nal delegates. These meetings have resulted in a number of important publications (Bahn and Rosenfeld 1991; Pearson and Swartz 1991; McDonald and Haskovec 1992; Morwood and Hobbs 1992; Ward 1992a; Lorblanchet and Bahn 1993; Steinbring et al. 1993). Rock Art Research and the AURA Occasional Series of publications have become the major international publication outlets for rock art studies. It is notable that the current pace of rock art research in Australia is not reflected in the two mainstream arch- aeological journals in Australia - Australian Archaeology and Archaeology in Oceania. Out of 401 major articles that have been published in AA over the last twenty years only thirteen were on rock art. AO also published thirteen. In addition, there has been a delay evident between the appearance of breakthroughs in rock art method, theory or results, as reported elsewhere, and its reporting in these journals. In the early days, this probably reflected the relatively marginal place of rock art studies in archaeology but more lately may be due to publication in other forums, such as Rock Art Research and Antiquity. Legislation/Conservation In the mid-1960s Robert Edwards was instrumental in the establishment of a major site recording program fund- ed by the AIAS. The passing of Federal and State legisla- tion during the 1960s aimed at protecting cultural heritage sites led to the establishment of administrative bodies with professional staff and archives for site documentation. One important role of these bodies was the funding of site recording programs. !&amp;IIIS!1^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 25</page><page sequence="27">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 In the mid-1970s and early 1980s heritage institutions became increasingly concerned with conservation issues, including those relating to rock art. Under the auspices of the Joint Academies' Committee on the Protection of Pre- historic Places a symposium on rock art recording, man- agement and conservation was held in Sydney in 1980, while a smaller meeting of the people most closely con- cerned with these matters was held in Canberra in 1981. The Canberra meeting formulated a number of proposals concerning directions and priorities in rock art conserva- tion (Rosenfeld et al. 1984). One of the recommendations was for a study of the behaviour of tourists visiting rock art sites in Kakadu National Park and this was eventually con- ducted by Fay Gale (see Gale 1984, 1985; also Gale and Jacobs 1986, 1987). It was funded in part by MAS. Another recommendation was that funds be sought to commission a review of the present state of knowledge on rock art conservation applicable to Australian conditions. This study for the Australian Heritage Commission was undertaken by Andrée Rosenfeld (1985). It was an impor- tant first step which drew together all existing research and experimental data that had a bearing on rock art con- servation in Australia. The report was designed for those concerned with, but not necessarily working in, the field of rock art conservation. Ward and Sullivan (1989:56) point out that around this time the Federal Government was encouraging public discussion of Aboriginal demand for land rights. A public opinion survey commissioned in 1985 found that rock art was one of the very few Aboriginal associations which were viewed favourably by the public (ANOP 1985:19, 44ff., cited in Ward and Sullivan 1989:56). Ward and Sullivan suggest that this survey was one impetus for the Federal Government's decision in 1986 to provide AIAS with supplementary funding to develop a rock art conser- vation program. The three main aims of this program were the physical preservation and management of endan- gered sites including those threatened by the natural ele- ments, interference from humans or other animals; survey and documentation of new and major sites; and research into the Aboriginal significance of sites. Since then, that program has been funded annually at $150,000 and has been used to support around twelve to fourteen major projects each year (Ward 1989, 1992b). The rock art protection program funded publication in the Institute Report Series of two important studies com- plementary to the seminal woik of Rosenfeld (1985). The first of these was a regional study of Victoria River rock art that focused on the significance of rock art sites for the local communities. An important conclusion of this study was that 'physical intervention by Europeans has the potential to seriously undermine Aboriginal cultural signi- ficance' (Lewis and Rose 1988:68). The authors then out- lined a series of conservation proposals with the view of protecting both the sites themselves and their cultural sig- nificance to their Aboriginal owners. A second volume in this series (Lambert 1989), recognised the needs of people actively working in the field of rock art conservation. It has been especially useful to 'the Aboriginal site officers, rangers and others who are increasingly taking on respon- sibility for managing their own communities' sites' (Dix 1989:vi). More recently, Pearson and Swartz (1991) have edited a volume on the conservation, management and recording of rock art which is part of the AURA series of occasional publications. In response to a request from the Australian Joint Academies, a one year full-time Graduate Diploma Course on the Conservation of Rock Art was conducted at the Canberra College of Advanced Education in 1989 (Pear- son 1991). Financial assistance was provided by the Getty Conservation Institute. The course, under the direction of Alan Watchman, attracted 14 Australian and overseas stu- dents. Despite the intensity, depth and breadth of the cur- riculum and an emphasis on practical experience, few of the Australian graduates are now actively involved in rock art conservation and none have permanent jobs in this IBiiiiiS 26 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="28">Morwood and Smith field (Ross Brown, Katharine Sale 1994:pers. comm.). There are two obvious lessons to be learnt here. Firstly, State and Commonwealth agencies responsible for rock art management should change their priorities in order to em- ploy qualified rock art conservators on a permanent basis. Secondly, the need for long-term planning and funding to meet future rock art conservation requirements is not met by one-off training courses or sources of funding. This year the Australian Cultural Development Office allocated $500,000 towards a program aimed at the pro- tection of indigenous cultural heritage sites, with particu- lar emphasis on rock art (Truscott 1994). The project, which is being overseen by the Australian Cultural Devel- opment Office, Australian Heritage Commission and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islan- der Studies, is structured so that it includes a high level of input by indigenous Australians. The principal consul- tants involved are Kate Sullivan, Katharine Sale and Nicholas Hall. The three main components of the pro- gram are to prepare guidelines for protection, management and use of indigenous cultural heritage sites; to run a training course on site management; and to conduct an exemplar site management project. Despite unreasonable constraints on the time initially envisaged to carry out the work and negotiations with Aboriginal communities, as well as other concerns (see Watchman 1994), this level of funding indicates a strong political commitment to cultural heritage matters and a high public profile for Australian rock art. Indigenous involvement The level of Aboriginal management and control of rock art sites has increased greatly over the last twenty years. However, this has to be seen in a wider sociocul- tural perspective, especially in terms of the changes in community attitude and legislation, which have effected Aboriginal land rights. Although a detailed analysis along these lines is beyond the scope of this paper, events of particular importance include - the beginning of the mod- ern Aboriginal land rights movement in 1966, when the Gurindji walked off Wave Hill Station; the 1967 referen- dum, which overwhelmingly supported the inclusion of Aboriginal people in Australian census figures; the 1972 election of the Whitlam Labour Government with its plat- form for major changes in Aboriginal social policy; the setting up of the well publicised Aboriginal Tent Embassy in the grounds of Parliament House in 1972; the passing of Land Rights legislation by the States, beginning with the Northern Territory in 1976; and the recognition of native title to land by the High Court of Australia in 1992 (the Mabo Decision). Property and political rights are both fundamental as- pects of land rights (Peterson 1981:3), and increased con- trol of cultural heritage sites is just one manifestation of the empowerment of Aboriginal communities. The trend is likely to continue at least partly because of on-going Aboriginal concerns with the legislative processes that affect their cultural material and the high level of indige- nous politicisation in Australia (Allen 1983; Ucko 1983; Davidson 1992; Burke et al. 1994). Rock art has been im- portant to the reaffirmation of Aboriginal corporate iden- tity in many regions. As such, rock art sites can be seen to be integral to indigenous political processes. In addition, rock art sites have been an important component of Abori- ginal land claims in the Northern Territory since the pas- sage of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 (e.g. Layton 1992:22, 30) as often these sites are the material embodiment of aspects of the Dreaming. Aborigines, with the support of archaeologists and anthro- pologists, have worked to establish the legal validity of these indigenous relationships to land. However, there is also potential for conflict between the Aboriginal significance of rock art sites and other heri- tage values. Some of the complexities of this issue are ap- parent in a recent example - that of the 1987 repainting of Wandjina sites in the Kimberley, northwestern Australia. ËMIffi!!^^ Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 27</page><page sequence="29">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 This project was funded with a grant of $109,019 under the Community Employment Project (Mowaljarlai and Peck 1987; Mowaljarlai et al. 1988). It involved senior custodians and young Aboriginal people from Derby in the repainting of several major rock art galleries in the Gibb River area, about 300 km to the northeast. The original proposal included consultation with traditional site custo- dians and on-site supervision of the rock art renewal by elders. However, there were complaints from Lorin Bishop (1987), the non-Aboriginal lessee of Mt Barnett Station, over the level of consultation with local Abori- ginal people and the standard of repainted art. Eventu- ally, the project was discontinued and funds returned on the initiative of the Aboriginal people involved. This generated much subsequent debate both locally and wider afield. The matter is still controversial and no consensus on the merits of the project has emerged, either in academia (e.g. Bowdler 1988; Clarke and Randolph 1992; Vinni- combe 1992; Ward 1992c; cf. Walsh 1992), or in local Aboriginal communities (e.g. Mowaljarlai 1992; cf. King 1992; Unghango et al. 1992). This is not a Black versus White issue. In Kimberley Aboriginal communities the fundamental concern is the relative custodial rights and responsibilities of different Aboriginal people to cultural heritage sites. For instance, David Mowaljarlai (1992:8), a Ngarinyin elder and Chairman of the Wanang Ngari Resource Centre, Derby, states that: We need to teach the young men and women; to teach them about bush learning, the old stories and about the messages of the images, so that they can continue to look after the country. That's why we, the old men, started to train the young people. A very important part of this training was for them to learn about repainting - body painting for ceremonies and to renew the painted images on rock. However, Billy King (1992), a Ngarinyin elder and Chair- man of the Kupungarri Community at Mt Barnett presents an alternative Aboriginal perspective: When these kids were brought from Derby we didn't know they were a painting crew and they just ruined all our paintings, we've got no de- cent paintings to take our kids for learning our law. We doing now our own law during the wet In addition, European reputations and finances suffered. For instance, Nick Green, an anthropologist with the Western Australian Museum successfully sued Lorin Bishop in a defamation suit resulting from the latter's comments on the project (West Australian 9 June 1990). The controversy surrounding the Gibb River Repaint Pro- ject is another reminder that rock art research and man- agement is not undertaken in an ethical or political vac- uum. Public interest Over the past 20 years, there has been increasing pub- lic interest in Aboriginal culture and art. Relevant factors include legislative changes, increased leisure time, higher levels of population mobility and greater interest in 'eco- tourism'. In addition, Josephine Flood (1983, 1990) has recently produced a series of books aimed at a general audience that emphasise Aboriginal rock art and which have enhanced public interest Visitor census figures at major heritage sites, such as Uluru and Carnarvon Gorge, clearly show a compounding interest in Aboriginal cul- tural heritage sites during this period (Walsh 1984b:4; Gale and Jacobs 1987:33). Longer-term changes in the way people have used Aboriginal art sites and responded to rock art are evident in a study of dated graffiti at rock art sites (Morwood and Kaiser-Glass 1991; Morwood and Walsh 1993; cf. Godwin 1992). These reflect a progres- sive increase in visitor numbers from the 1950s, with a corresponding increase in vandalism until the passing of State Heritage legislation in the late 1960s, which pro- '■■■■■■■'■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■■aaasaaasaaaaaaBaaaaaasaaBSBSaBssasasaaaBaaaaaaaaaas" 28 Australian Archaeology, Number 39f 1 994</page><page sequence="30">Morwood and Smith scribed inappropriate behaviours. After this time, the proportion of visitors vandalising sites fell abruptly. Rock art sites remain a focus of public interest in Abor- iginal culture. However, heavy visitation or scientific investigation can constitute a serious threat to rock art sites. Some recent rock art research has been directed towards monitoring the effects of visitor impact and de- veloping methods through which this might be minimised (e.g. Dragovich 1986; Gale and Jacobs 1986, 1987; Mor- wood 1994). Trends and developments Anthropological and ethnoarchaeological studies of Australian Aboriginal (rock) art have been very influential on archaeological investigations of art here and elsewhere in the world (see Jones 1967). This continent remains one of the few places where it is still possible to obtain detailed information on the function of indigenous art and how this may be manifest in the archaeological record. The an- thropological emphasis in Australian rock art research will therefore continue, although the political context of re- search in Aboriginal communities has changed substan- tially. Sale (1992) has highlighted some of the social and political complexities involved in the practice of re- marking (or renewing) rock paintings, while Smith (1994) has analysed the influence of social and material context on style in an Aboriginal artistic system in the Beswick- Barunga region. Other such woik in progress includes that of Taçon in Western Arnhem Land (e.g. 1988), Rosenfeld (pers. comm.) in Central Australia and Flood in the Victoria River District (e.g. Flood et al. 1992). These studies are establishing a more fine-grained understanding of Aboriginal artistic systems. Many show greater concern with forms of social identity, especially as influenced by processes associated with contact. They also demonstrate an indeterminate boundary between archaeology and anth- ropology in rock art research (see also discussion in Layton 1992). This trend is likely to continue, in contrast to the general tendency noted by White (1994:95), which is a divergence between social/cultural anthropology and archaeology. The emphasis on regional studies, involving contextual analyses and the dating of rock art continues, and such studies are conducted in an increasingly more sophistica- ted manner. Taçon (1988, 1989), for instance, has shown that the recent rock art of Arnhem Land is more stylisti- cally complex than earlier rock art in the region. He inter- prets this as reflecting a change in the character of group identities, involving an increase in territoriality and an associated need for rock art to encode more levels of mean- ing. Other recent or in-progress work along these lines includes that of Lewis (1990) on the stylistic manifesta- tions of local and regional patterns of social interaction in the Victoria River District; David (pers. comm.) in a multi-disciplined investigation of Aboriginal land use in northeast Queensland which emphasises rock art evidence; Cole (pers. comm.) on regional and chronological varia- tion in the rock art of southeast Cape York Peninsula; and McDonald (1994) in her investigation of the contextual problems posed by a dual media rock art system in the Sydney region and the different degrees of homogeneity exhibited by local rock paintings and rock engravings. An associated trend is to establish well dated regional rock art sequences for comparison with other evidence for cultural change and palaeo-environmental fluctuations (e.g. Morwood et al. 1994; Morwood and Hobbs 1995). Further developments in technology, minimal impact sampling and on-site measurements, will accelerate this trend. On a broader scale, Huchet (1993) is currently undertaking a thorough and comprehensive overview of regional styles in body art and rock art with the aim of assessing the relationships between patterning in these art forms and prehistoric and post-contact Aboriginal regional identity. New systems of classification are being developed. Officer (1991, 1994) has developed a new approach to &amp;BES Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 29</page><page sequence="31">Rock Art Research in Australia 1974-94 motif analysis that crosses the artificial boundary between figurative and non-figurative that Rosenfeld (1992:236) feels has been a fundamental problem for Australian rock art studies since Maynard's seminal research in the 1970s. Franklin (1986, 1992) has also focused on Maynard's work, using an analysis of spatial variation in Australian rock art bodies to reassess Maynard's stylistic categories. McDonald (1992a) has incorporated gender into her analy- sis of Sydney Basin rock art and has evidence that men, women and children participated in the stencilling of hands and implements. This is important because records indicate that most recent rock art in Australia was the business of men (e.g. Spencer and Gillen 1899[1968]:614; Love 1936:24; Gould 1969:154 but see Smith 1991). McDonald's work provides a timely reminder that the function and production context of Australian Aboriginal rock art over many thousands of years is likely to have been far broader than is currently documented. The nexus between art and ideology means that rock art has been, and will continue to be, important to the ways in which indigenous people conceptualise their iden- tities. It is likely that Aboriginal people will take a closer interest in rock art sites than in, say, stone tool assem- blages (cf. David Horton in Burke et al. 1994:17). A number of universities have recently established courses in Aboriginal site management and this is indicative of future developments. The increasing participation of Aboriginal people in rock art research, conservation and management will engender important changes in method and theory. (Rock) art data is now highly relevant to some funda- mental problems in (Australian) archaeology, including the colonisation of the continent, the emergence of lan- guage and changes in social organisation and land use. The recovery of high quality pigments from the basal levels of the earliest occupation sites excavated in Austra- lia shows that people were engaged in some type of artistic activity between 53,000 and 60,000 bp (Roberts et al. 1990:153). This has implications for human cultural and evolutionary development worldwide (e.g. Davidson and Noble 1989, 1992). Similarly, Pleistocene dates for Aus- tralian rock art and later evidence for régionalisation of rock art systems provide important evidence for major developments in Aboriginal land use and the emergence of corporate landowning groups (see Smith 1992; Rosenfeld 1993:77; David 1994). Conclusions In the last 20 years rock art research has emerged as a distinct and viable sub-discipline of Australian archae- ology. As part of this general development, there has been a marked increase in the number of archaeologists who are recording, managing and researching rock art. In 1994, rock art studies are an exciting and important part of Aus- tralian archaeology. The high standard of rock art re- search in Australia is recognised internationally. For in- stance, the 1991 annual report of the Rock Art Association of Canada (quoted in Bednarik 1992:113) states that: Australian scientists have become the leading authority on nearly every issue of prehistoric rock art studies, including: conservation, site management, research ethics, Native involve- ment issues, scientific dating and recording, educational articulation etc. There is not an organisation in the world which could embark upon formulating their particular rock art stra- tegies and policies without due consideration of the Australian experience.

As a primary structuring principle of all human societies, gen- der relations are now one of the most important constitu- ents of human experience. The archaeology of gender places gender at the centre of questions about the past, but because the majority of theoretical research into gender has come from feminist research into women's experiences rather than men's, the emphasis in most archaeological research of gender has been on women. This work is about both women and gender, about both research into women as archaeologists and into women in prehistory. Gender in archaeology is one of the newest and most actively researched areas in the discipline with over 50 conference papers having been presented in Australia since 1991 (Balme and Beck in prep.; duCros and Smith 1993a). The focus in this review is on Australian Abori- ginal archaeology, but gender research has also been un- dertaken in Australian historical archaeology (e.g. Bick- ford 1993; Birmingham 1993; Hartley in prep.; Lydon 1993) and work has been done by Australians on the arch- aeology of gender elsewhere in the world (e.g. Europe: Moser 1993; Middle East: Webb and Frankel in prep.). Two main areas of research into the archaeology of gender have been identified (Beck and Head 1990; du Cros and Smith 1993b): 1. Women as archaeologists. This area includes issues of gender equity and women's experiences as archaeolo- gists. For example, papers in Claassen (1994) and, in Australia, Beck (1994), Clarke (1993), Goulding et al. (1993), Hope (1993) and Truscott and Smith (1993). 2. Women and gender in the archaeological record. For example papers in Gero and Conkey (1991) and in Australia, Donlon (1993), Ellender (1993) and Smith (1993). In this review we are concentrating on the second of these two areas - finding women and gender in the arch- aeological record. Our aims are: to document the brief history of gender studies in Australian archaeology; to illu- strate the diversity and richness of approaches to gender in Australia; and how these approaches contribute to Abori- ginal archaeology as a whole. Finally we consider some of the reasons why mainstream archaeologists are reluctant to consider researching gender in archaeology. The development of the archaeology of gender The recognition of the archaeology of gender began with the publication of Conkey and Specter's 1984 review 'Archaeology and the Study of Gender'. In this paper the authors pointed to the dearth of studies on gender and they analysed the implicit male bias of much of the archaeology from the late 1960s, which had persisted into the 1970s. They criticised in detail archaeological case studies and concluded that women's contributions and activities were stereotyped or ignored. In all of the studies examined, contemporary models of the sexual division of labour were assumed to be universal and projected back into the past (Conkey and Spector 1984:14). This, they argued, was in part because much of the archaeology reflected the per- spective of the researchers as white, Western males in Department of Archaeology and Palaeoanthropology, University of New England, Arm i da le, NSW 2351, Australia. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmumummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmummmmumm Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 39</page><page sequence="41">Gender in Aboriginal Archaeology: Recent Research dominant social positions. Conkey and Spector (1984:19) drew attention to the particular relevance to archaeology of recent anthropological work emphasising the relationships between gender organisation and culture change. How- ever, it was not until the late 1980s that these issues were taken up by archaeologists (Wylie 1991a). By the late 1980s and into the 1990s the archaeology of gender was firmly established in the United States (see review in Claassen 1992a). A diversity of topics, methods and world- views is illustrated in the explosion of collected papers published at this time, including Claassen (1992b, 1994), Gero and Conkey (1991) and Walde and Willows (1991). As well, contributions exhibit a very wide range of archaeological data and cover many geographic regions (see Hanen and Kelley's 1992 review of 103 contributions to the 1989 Chacmool Conference). Although these vol- umes include research on prehistoric, early agricultural and recent societies, Hanen and Kelley (1992) note that published papers tend to focus on recent periods of time, usually with ethnographic or historic documentation, and that synchronie approaches with reliance on analogical reasoning are the most common. During the 1970s and 1980s there was no explicit 'archaeology of gender1 in Australia (see Beck and Head 1990 for a review) and there were almost no papers pub- lished on the topic. Observations about women and gen- der did appear in ethnoarchaeological work, particularly in the division of tasks between men and women (e.g. Hay- den 1979; Meehan 1982; O'Connell 1974) but were not used in mainstream explanations of cultural change. For example, women have been universally associated with shellfish collection and Meehan's extensive and detailed study comparing Anbarra men's and women's food gather- ing performance provides prime ethnographic data that women collect 85% (by weight) of some shellfish species. Yet the implications of change in the activities of men, women and children, in terms of the social organisation of collection units, or of subsistence scheduling have not been considered in subsequent archaeological midden analysis. Gender has not been used as an archaeological category. The explicit discussion of gender in Australian archae- ology is very much a 90s phenomenon triggered by the 1991 Women in Archaeology' conference (duCros and Smith 1993a). The history of why gender appeared as an analytical category in Australian archaeological research in the 1990s is documented in du Cros and Smith (in prep.) but like gender research in archaeology elsewhere, it was lar- gely stimulated by Conkey and Spector (1984) and by negative workplace experiences. Contributing factors out- side of the archaeological intellectual climate include an awareness of women's issues and gender equity legislation and the associated shifts in the participation of women in archaeological education and employment (Wylie 1991a: 20). Du Cros and Smith provide an additional reason for organising the 1991 Women in Archaeology Conference saying that it 'came about through a gradual realisation that Australian archaeology needed to become more self analytical, particularly with respect to discipline-wide as- sumptions on the nature of gender' (du Cros and Smith 1993b:xvii). Gender in Aboriginal archaeology Many papers on 'gender in archaeology' from the Aus- tralian Women in Archaeology conferences (Balme and Beck in prep.; du Cros and Smith 1993a) are very much concerned with traditional archaeological databases de- rived from materials such as stone artefacts, fauna, human skeletal remains and art. Papers are concerned with tradi- tional archaeological interests like site settlement patterns, technological organisation of stone working and ethno- graphic analogy. However, as we show below, by placing gender as a central concern of archaeological enquiry, researchers are able to improve on earlier archaeology by ifHlliSilllPl^ -1994 96 40 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994</page><page sequence="42">Beck and Balme exposing the previous conceptual and empirical errors and by posing questions which will expand the explanatory power of archaeological interpretations. In other words, the archaeology produced by these researchers (whether feminist or not) can be more convincing than previous ex- planations (Wylie 1992). We have selected three examples from Aboriginal archaeology to illustrate this point. Two of these papers derive from the conference volume and the third was published in Australian Archaeology. Smith's (1993) study is concerned with the question of the causes of variation in art. She analysed the motifs rep- resented on 290 acrylic paintings from the Western Desert, collected between 1972 and 1988. The motifs on the paintings are derived from ground and body art and have close links with those likely to be found in rock art (Smith 1993:162). Although men and women in the Western Desert paint the same motifs, the combinations and pro- portions in which they occur in art clearly varies with the gender of the artist. For example, simple roundels and arcs occur in 42% of women's paintings but only in 5% of paintings by men, whereas the complex roundel and arc appeared in 23% of paintings by female artists and 34% of men's paintings. Smith suggests that this stylistic dif- ferentiation is causally linked to the dichotomy between the genders in other economic and ideological aspects of Western Desert society. However, the overlap of motifs between genders also suggests that there is room for the negotiation of gender structures through art and this is demonstrated by changes in motif use through time. As pressures from European art buyers became more impor- tant, the re-negotiation of what was thought of by the Aboriginal people as men's or women's art was apparent. Smith's systematic collection and analysis of data illus- trate firmly that gender difference in artistic motif presen- tation exists and may be linked to gender differences in other aspects of social structures. This corrects a widely held archaeological view that all art is painted by men (e.g. Gould 1969:154; see also Smith 1991 for further ex- amples). This view has previously prevented archaeolo- gists asking questions about the relationship between gen- der and variation in Aboriginal art. Smith's study provides a clear implication that gender may be central to some kinds of stylistic variability and that the archaeological study of rock art variation should be expanded to answer new questions like 'how does rock art vary with the gender of the painter?' Indeed she specifies a program of research needed to answer these questions for the Western Desert and elsewhere (Smith 1993:167-8). Smith's research also shows that changes in gender structures may occur through time and how they influence material culture. This provides an explanation (rather than merely a description) of how art changes through time. Recent studies of Australian art which examine changes in motif representation over time have stressed environmental explanations, which look to change in cli- mate and foraging behaviour for older art and changes in the nature of group territorial identification in more recent art (Layton 1992). Such interpretations usually don't con- sider internal social structures as a motivator of change. Smith's contribution shows that gender is not fixed in time, that it may be negotiated through material culture and is an active agent in diachronic artistic variability. Use of gender as an analytical category recognises this important source of variation in art and will produce a more inclusive picture of human behaviour. The second example is McDonald's (1992) identifica- tion of the presence of prehistoric women at a rockshelter site and the influence of this identification on her interpre- tation of the site's function. Her comprehensive analysis of excavated materials from a painted rockshelter in Ku-ring- gai Chase National Park indicates that there are two pha- ses of occupation, both post-dating the most recent sea level rise (c. 5000 bp). The older layers contained only stone artefacts which were possibly contemporary with the production of large red hand stencils. The later phase con- sisted of shellfish, fishhooks, fish and small animal re- mains and the more recent art assemblage included white stencils of hands and digging sticks. By analysing the sizes of the hand stencils, which she associates with an intensive phase of occupation between 480 and 220 years ago, McDonald concludes that both women and men as well as babies were present at that time. Direct ethnohis- toric evidence and analogies with Meehan's (1982) shell- fishing site formation processes are also documented to support the argument. McDonald proposes that during the earlier occupation period the site might have been used as a shelter by men, while hunting on the ridge-tops but that the function of the site changed and in the later period it was either a shelter for gatherers during the day or a base camp for a family group (McDonald 1992:48). Thus a change in function of the site is proposed, based on the relative frequency of men's and women's activities. By considering gender as central to her analysis McDonald is able to be much more specific about the functions of the site, and how it changed over time, than she would have been had she not included gender as an analytical variable. The analysis of individual site function in terms of gendered activities is very rare in Australian archaeology (McKell 1993). The only example that McKell found is the interpretation of the upper levels of the Anbangbang 1 rockshelter, as a base camp for a community: In summary, we may say that within the top dusty part of Level 1, the artefacts - of stone, bone, shell, ochre, wood, fur and fibre suggest the activities of a community of people of both genders. (Jones and Johnson 1985:63). It is much more common for analyses of site function to be couched in terms of non-specified 'populations' or 'occupations', or indeed for people to be entirely absent from analysis, for example - this site demonstrates the use of marine resources. As Tringham (1991:97) describes it 'archaeologists produced a prehistory of genderless, face- less blobs'. This de-gendering of the archaeological record serves to exclude the small-scale interpersonal interactions from consideration and produces a sterile and partial ac- count which focuses only on large-scale entities of subsis- tence systems and information networks. McDonald's account shows that a more 'human' archaeology which brings personal everyday activities to the forefront, is pos- sible. Again further questions can be asked: how might Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994 41</page><page sequence="43">Gender in Aboriginal Archaeology: Recent Research the activities of men, women and children have changed through time? how might social units have been re- organised to accommodate these changes? With one nota- ble exception (Bowdler 1976) such questions are not asked by Australian archaeologists. In addition McDonald was also able to show from an archaeological database that the production of Aboriginal art in the past was not restricted to men, nor was it pro- duced only in non-domestic contexts. In the Ku-ring-gai area most of the occupation shelters have art and are also located close to important natural resource zones (McDon- ald 1992:49). This is further evidence which serves to correct the previously held archaeological misconception that painting = male = sacred, referred to by Smith (see above). Our final example is Bird's (1993) examination of the role of gender in the organisation of lithic technology in Australia and New Guinea. Bird summarises the ethno- graphic representations of men and women's stoneworking from Central Australia, the Kimberley, Melville and Bathurst Islands, southeast Australia, Tasmania, southwest Western Australia and New Guinea. Ethnographically, women both made and used a variety of stone tools, inclu- ding stone hatchets, stone barbs for death spears and they procured stone for working. There are also accounts which suggest women were involved in various aspects of men's stone artefact production, such as transporting stone material, collecting wood for artefacts and manufacturing hafting resin (Bird 1993:26). Firstly, this research exposes the androcentric bias of previous researchers who have assumed either that stone tool users and manufacturers were always male (e.g. White and O'Connell 1982:87) or that women were less skilled at stoneworking (e.g. Witter 1987). Bird documents various forms of gender organisation of stoneworking in order to challenge these views. Men and women seem to have dif- ferent choices of raw materials, toolkits, methods of manu- facture, quantities of stone consumed and frequencies of using stone tools. In general therefore it can be suggested that men consumed more flaked stone because they made a wider range of implements than women and because women's equipment tended to be replaced less frequently (Bird 1993:26). Secondly, an alternative framework of questions is pro- posed by Bird to assist in understanding the archaeological record. She proposes that the organisation of stone arte- fact production is interdependent on other divisions of eco- nomic labour and that changes in how stoneworking is organised could be explained in gendered terms. While the organisation of lithic technology and its effects on regional stone assemblages is an issue of interest to many Australian archaeologists (e.g. Hiscock 1986) very little attention has been paid to the social context of the manu- facture and production of artefacts (other than axes e.g. McBryde 1984). Bird's analysis points to a whole range of new social questions which need to be asked about the division(s) of labour and their effect on stone artefact pro- duction sequences, such as: what are the implications of dividing stone artefact production into differently gendered tasks? what does specialist/non-specialist in artefact pro- duction mean? The answers to these questions should eventually produce a more complete explanation of the process of production. None of these three examples are particularly radical in their approaches. All collect data and analyse it in a posi- tivist way and are therefore methodologically within the mainstream of the discipline. They have produced straightforward answers, either by restructuring their own data (McDonald 1992) or by reformulating familiar re- search questions along new lines (Bird 1993; Smith 1993). These examples represent the beginnings of a gendered archaeology in Australia, and there is a large potential for asking further questions. Why is the archaeology of gender marginal? Despite the obvious contribution that a gendered arch- aeology can make, very few of the publications resulting from the work appear in the two major Australian archae- ology journals, Australian Archaeology and Archaeology in Oceania. Given this, the archaeology of gender would appear to be marginal. This trend is evident outside Aus- tralia too where, although there is an abundance of re- search in the field, most of the work is published in edited volumes (e.g. Claassen 1992a, 1994; Gero and Conkey 1991; Walde and Willows 1991) rather than in main- stream journals, such as American Antiquity or Antiquity (Victor and Beaudry 1992). Despite the encouragement of editors (e.g. Meehan 1993), so far there seems to be a reluctance by researchers in this field to submit their work to the mainstream journals. The lack of representation in major publishing venues suggests to us that gender in archaeology may be also un- fairly characterised as appealing only to marginal groups with little to contribute to mainstream issues. There are several possible reasons why this field is considered mar- ginal to the discipline: 1. Gender studies are only done by low status archaeolo- gists (du Cros and Smith 1993b) 2. Gender in archaeology is supposed to be 'just political1 or 'just feminist* (Wylie 1992) 3. Gender is thought not to be recoverable using archae- ological methods (Wylie 1991b) and therefore to be ir- relevant to archaeology (Claassen 1992b; Wylie 1992). 1. Status Archaeologists who study gender are often women, for example, only three out of the 36 authors in du Cros and Smith (1993a) are men. There is evidence which suggests that many women in archaeology hold lower status posi- tions than men, earn less and publish less (Beck 1994; Wylie 1993). For example, in a study of women's employ- ment in Australian archaeology in 1991, Truscott and Smith (1993) found that in museum and university em- ployment, only 14% and 16% respectively of higher level archaeological jobs (i.e. curator 2/3 and senior lecturers) were held by women. This may be an important factor in the low rates of publication in the field as writers of arch- aeology are most likely to be employed by these institu- tions. Women authors made up only 35% of the authors of papers in Archaeology in Oceania in 1989 and 1990 42 Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1994</page><page sequence="44">Beck and Balme (Beck n.d.) and only 22% of authors in Australian Arch- aeology in 1987 and 1988 (Beck and Head 1990). Also, the average annual income of women archaeologists in 1990 was found to be $3000 lower than that of male arch- aeologists (Goulding et al. 1993). While women may be better represented in cultural resource management (47% of senior managers are women [Truscott and Smith 1993]), there is research which suggests that overall, cul- tural resource management may be of lower status when compared with other kinds of resource management (Clarke 1993; Hope 1993). So, recent research supports the contention that gender studies are done by lower status archaeologists. 2. Politics The political motivation of many writers of gendered archaeology is readily acknowledged and made explicit (e.g. Balme and Beck 1993). However, it does not follow that the archaeology of gender is necessarily, or at all, 'just political*. Similar observations about the kinds of interpre- tations that a gendered archaeology produces have been made by Wylie: social and political factors are crucial in direct- ing attention to questions about gender but ... these do not account for the successes of the research that they inspire or inform. It is the substantive results of this research that make it a serious challenge to extant practice, and these results are to a large degree autonomous of the political motivations and other circumstances responsible for the research that produced them. (Wylie 1992:22). Similarly, in the three published examples discussed above, we have demonstrated that the archaeology of gen- der contributes substantively to the discipline as it offers not just further explanatory options but improves on pre- vious interpretations either empirically or conceptually. Indeed it can be argued that all of these explanations are probably more objective than previous explanations be- cause they are more inclusive and more self critical. The examples are convincing within the paradigms of the dis- cipline not just to those who share a feminist understand- ing of gender relations (Wylie 1992). 3. Methods The notion that women are invisible in the archaeolo- gical record may in part be related to the general belief that Aboriginal women in the past were associated with material culture made of perishable materials while men were associated with stone and bone which are more dur- able (Bird 1993). This idea rests on two assumptions - first that there is a strict division of labour and the second is that the only way to find gender in the archaeological record is to find evidence of women's work and men's work (Conkey and Gero 1991). We know from Bird's paper that even in the recent past women's and men's tasks overlapped but we want to make the point that gendered archaeology is not necessarily about attributing particular artefacts to male or female activities (although this may be one of several routes to finding gender from archaeological remains [e.g. McDonald 1992]). The archaeology of gen- der is about identifying the effect of gender roles, ideolo- gies and relations on the archaeological record and Smith's (1993) article provides one avenue for doing this. All of the three papers discussed above make gender visible and support Conkey and Gero's assertion (1991) that finding gender is no harder than finding a 'subsistence system1 or an 'exchange system'. Thus the argument that gender is invisible is not supported and there are few methodological obstructions in its identification. Perhaps another reason why gender is considered ir- relevant is because it is assumed to have always existed. But the existence of gender (unlike sex) can not always be assumed because it is symbolic behaviour made possible by language, itself something that has an origin in space and time (Conroy 1993). Conroy (1993) considers how the female figurines from the Upper Palaeolithic exhibit a convention for the depiction of women. She suggests that the cultural categories represented by these and other figurines are not necessarily 'women' versus 'men', but per- haps 'women' versus 'other'. 'Other' could include men and children, and could signify a rather different kind of gender distinction to that of modern Australian society. The implications are that there is no evidence for the exis- tence of gender in European prehistory until the Upper Palaeolithic, that gender may have taken various forms in the past, and that 'the archaeological recognition of the emergence of gender is linked to the use of symbols which can be seen to be part of an institutionalising pro- cess' (Conroy 1993:153). This provides a clear illustration of the new and important research which can be generated by questioning the categorisation and origin of gender itself. In Australia, not only is it usually assumed that gender has always existed but there is also an assumption that gender relations in Aboriginal society have not changed through time. This has lead to the view that 'gender in archaeology' is irrelevant and that the gender of the people who left the material remains found in archaeological con- texts is unimportant because their gender is already known from the ethnography of the region. This attitude is especially obvious in research pub- lished in the 1970s and 1980s. The very first Australian Archaeology Association Newsletter in November 1974 in- cluded an essay by Peter White entitled 'Man in Australia: present and past'. The essay summarised the main issues in archaeology at the time and included a relatively large section on 'the Ethnographic Present1. The main point of that discussion was to show that in contemporary Aborigi- nal society there is a division of labour whereby men hunt and women gather but some space was devoted to the rela- tive importance of men's work compared to women's. For example: While the hunted meat and the speared fish that men contributed were usually more highly val- ued socially - and were of course, essential to the diet - it was the women's reliably regular provision of gathered foods which enabled the continuing existence of every Aboriginal group. (White 1974:30) Australian Archaeology, Number 39, 1 994 43</page><page sequence="45">Gender in Aboriginal Archaeology: Recent Research The inclusion of detailed descriptions of gender struc- &lt; tures in the essay must have been thought to be relevant to \ the archaeology, implying that little change had occurred \ in such structures over time, even though White noted the conservative view of Aboriginal society held by archae- ologists (White 1974:42). In her history of archaeological views of the past Bowdler (1993) has shown that despite the variation in the archaeological record, archaeologists in the 1970s continued to believe that 'Aboriginal society ' changed only sufficiently to allow it to continue without change1 (Bowdler 1993:129). In the 1990s most archae- ologists still downplay the long-term effects of such changes as the introduction of the dingo and new tool types and continue to regard Aboriginal society as funda- mentally untransformed by such changes (Bowdler 1993). A prominent example of this kind of conservatism about gender relations is evident in the discussions over recent re-painting of rock surfaces containing Wandjina figures in the Kimberley of Western Australia. Women were involved in the re-painting of rock art, and Walsh (1992) has argued that such repainting was non- traditional, as 'traditionally' women were not involved in painting Wandjina rock art. This criticism was made des- pite the fact that Aboriginal people were willing to train men and women to 'ensure that our country continues' (Mowaljarlai et al. 1988). Even if Walsh's interpretation of the ethnography of rock art is correct, and it almost certainly is not (Layton 1992:47), there is no reason to suggest that such changes in gender relations did not occur in the past. However this social change is in a direction which archaeologists are unwilling to accept (Mowaljarlai et al. 1988). Contrary to Walsh's conservative perspective, this exemplifies how gender is not static through time. There are a number of reasons why gender is marginal- ised, but the foregoing discussion indicates that there are no intrinsic theoretical or methodological barriers to en- gaging with gender in archaeology. Rather, it is apparent- ly a willingness to 'do gender' that is required. Will gen- dered archaeology remain marginal? This is as yet an un- answered question, and perhaps it is too soon to tell, but we suspect that it will not. Conclusions In this review of 'gender in archaeology' we have pointed to its present active and diverse interests which include stone artefacts, rock art and settlement patterns. This activity has largely developed in the 1990s, beginning in Australia with the 1991 Women in Archaeology Con- ference at Albury. The examples we have discussed dem- onstrate that research in this Held contributes conceptually and analytically to the current paradigms of mainstream archaeology in Australia and challenges longstanding con- servative views of Aboriginal society. Some archaeologists still consider this field of research to be marginal to mainstream interests, but we have shown that the main arguments used to justify its marginal attrac- tion cannot be sustained. Much archaeology can be 'done' by making explicit the assumptions about the specific na- ture of gender and gendered activities. But, the danger for the future is 'allowing feminist-like scholarship to be re- duced or contained as "just another approach" with gender as "just another variable"1 (Conkey 1993:8). Instead, gen- der must be seen as a central agent of behavioural change with material consequences. Acknowledgements We wish to thank L. Conroy, I. Davidson, M. Mor- wood, H. Burke, C.
