It would have the merit, at least, of corresponding to an immense reality ? a reality that strikes me every day of my life. Henry James, Notebooks 147-148 In his project for the tale "The Death of The Lion" (1894), Henry James envisaged the mythical, and distinctively modern, fate of the artist as celebrity. Besieged by journalists, lionizers, and autograph-hunters, the celebrated writer is subjected to a voracious desire for knowledge concerning his life, whilst, conversely, the work, upon which his literary fame supposedly rests, is neglected. The work of the author is displaced from its position as the privileged object of literary interpretation by a proliferation of new cultural prac tices which construe the "life" as a more vital source of meaning. Through such media as advertising, journalism and photography, authors, like the texts which they produce, are marketed as commodities, as products to be circulated and consumed. If James's characterization of his contemporary era as "this age of advertisement and newspaperism, this age of interviewing" is mythopoeic in its creation of sympathy for the embattled position of the "artist" in modern society, it recognizes, nonetheless, a signifi cant historical shift in nineteenth-century conceptions of the cultural status of authorship. In this essay, I wish to pursue James's perception further by exploring some of the ways in which authors were constructed as figures of public recognition in late-nineteenth century journalistic discourse. During this period, as most historians recognize, Victorian journalism underwent significant changes in its organizational and technological basis, as well as in its discursive forms. These changes were of importance in shaping contemporary representations of authorship, and, more widely, in encoding a popular iconography of 159</page><page sequence="2">160 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE literary culture that was both distinctive and far-reaching in its effects. As a primary example of this shift in journalistic representation, I will focus, in particular, upon the technique of the interview, which James refers to in his fictional scenario. If the journal istic interview is now an entirely familiar cultural phenomenon, unquestioned in the assumptions which it harbours within its form, its earlier practice was less habituated. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, indeed, the interview was a subject of frequent debate, engaging a number of prominent literary figures besides James. The proliferation of literary interviews during this period bore witness to the increasingly pervasive defini tion of authors as celebrities, and thus, for some observers, seemed to threaten the cultural distinction of authorship itself. / ALTHOUGH SIMILAR JOURNALISTIC FORMS may be located earlier in the century, the interview was first self-consciously practised in the American press of the 1860s. It was only in the 1880s and 90s, however, that the technique became widespread, and widely discussed, in both Britain and the United States. James's observation that the 1890s was an "age of interviewing" registers the disturbing modernity of this journalistic innovation and its status as a symptomatic phenomenon of contemporary culture. Indeed, one of the most striking and recurrent features of contemporary interviews was the anxiety and uncertainty which interviewers themselves manifested towards their own task. The unfa miliarity of the genre was clearly palpable to its practitioners, and this often resulted in an extraordinary self-reflexivity within the parameters of the interview itself. This sense of disorientation within literary interviews of the period may be under stood, first of all, as a response to a radical etymological transformation which was taking place. As Nils Gunnar Nilsson has noted, the term "interview," prior to its journalistic usage, signified "a meeting of persons face to face," usually for the purposes of private conversation (710-11). Derived from the French "s'entrevoir," the interview was literally conceived as an event of mutual seeing. In this sense of the word, there is no functional differentiation between the speaking positions of the two participants, although such distinctions invariably operate in practice. An interview of this kind, in other words, may well be (and is perhaps always) structured by the asymmetries of its given social context; but these asymmetries are not actively inscribed within its dialogical form. In principle, at least, the function of the private interview is to facilitate a space for the reciprocal exchange of confidence between the two participants. By contrast, the journalistic inter view disrupts this symmetrical exchange by interposing a third syntactical position: namely, the position of the reader or addressee to whom the interview is communicated. This form of interview presupposes the (absent) presence of an auditor who participates vicariously in the dialogue. Hence, it not only makes public a formerly private mode of communication, but also, and in the same process, transforms the relationship between the direct participants. According to the O.E.D., there is no recorded usage of the transitive verb "to interview," nor of the active and passive nouns "interviewer" and "interviewee," before 1869. In other words, the journalistic practice of interviewing institutes an asym metrical differentiation of functions between its two immediate participants. In place of an intransitive dialogue, expressed in the form of an interview with or between two equal</page><page sequence="3">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 161 subjects, the interviewer is positioned as the definitive subject of discourse, whilst the interviewee is situated as the object of investigation and display. A similar process of differentiation may also be witnessed in the newfound divergence between the physical event of the interview and its retrospective transcription on the part of the interviewer. Yet since the term "interview" could now be used to designate both speech and writing, it tended to elide the ambiguities which often existed between the two. As a written text, the interview invariably claims to recapture the immediate presence of the speech upon which it is founded. Thus, paradoxically, the formative intention of this text is to efface the mediation of its own writing, and so re-present the interview as a concrete event of speech. It is not by chance that one of the most frequent criticisms of interviews during this period was their alleged fabrication after the event. In 1887, for instance, an anonymous American critic, apparently alluding to Julian Hawthorne's infa mous "interview" with J. R. Lowell, observed that an individual's refusal to be interviewed did nothing to prevent the publication of private conversations which were subsequently labelled as "interviews" ("The Interview" 128). Lowell himself had protested that Haw thorne "knew that I didn't know he was interviewing me."1 Here, the interviewer's manipulation of the parameters of the interview is not merely the result of personal duplicity, but also evidence of a widespread epistemological confusion over what precisely did constitute an "interview." Contemporary interviewers were able to exploit or mis-rec ognize a slippage between earlier and more recent meanings of the term, which co-existed until at least the end of the century. As late as 1901, for example, a contributor to the Cornhill Magazine wrote of her experience of being interviewed "before the invention of the present fashion of demanding from perfect strangers answers to questions which one's most intimate friend would hesitate to ask" (Broome 473). By the term "interview," however, this writer refers to meetings of an official character in which an "interviewer" approaches an "interviewed" for civic advice. This definition is almost entirely opposite in meaning to that of the new journalistic practice, in which it is the interviewer, rather than the interviewee, who represents a quasi-institutional authority. Thus, while claiming the relevance of such past experience to the topical subject of the interview, the article in fact reveals an absurd discontinuity in its various cultural forms. The anxiety which surrounded the epistemology of the journalistic interview, how ever, was not restricted to the blatant manipulations or mis-recognitions, exemplified by Hawthorne's interview with Lowell. In their modern form, interviews persistently evoked and encouraged fantasies of illicit intrusion and surveillance, even in those cases where the interviewer had not intentionally betrayed the private confidence of his or her subject. Such texts self-consciously positioned the interviewee as an object of knowledge, thus drawing attention to the epistemological status of the interview itself. Rather than natu ralizing the interview as a transparent medium of communication, contemporary inter viewers repeatedly parodied, fictionalized, or even denied their role in the conduct of the interview. An interview with the American author Bret Harte, published in the Idler Magazine in 1892, offers a fascinating example of at least two of these strategies, and of the textual opacity which they tended to produce. In fact, two "interviews" with Harte were published adjacently in the magazine: firstly, an "Ideal Interview" written by Luke Sharp ? a pseudonym for the magazine's co-editor Robert Barr ? and immediately following this, "The Real Interview" by G. B. B?rgin. Sharp's "interview" is a transparently fictional</page><page sequence="4">162 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE account of a meeting with Harte in the exotic American setting of the author's tales. Evidently intended as a humorous backdrop to Burgin's "Real Interview," which takes place in the prosaic setting of a London hotel, it offers a parodie version of the interview's project of revealing the celebrated author's "authentic" self. Ironically, though, this oppo sition between "real" and "ideal" interviews is undermined by Harte's own observations on the question of the ideal interview which B?rgin quotes in "The Real Interview." Harte notes an antipathy towards the interview in England that contrasts with its native success in America: "I agree with you in thinking that people ? English people ? are growing a little tired of interviewing. In America the system flourishes; but Englishmen appear to have a rooted dislike to the whole thing. Every now and then, a man who is interviewed contrives to convey the exact impression which he wishes to produce, but very rarely. When a man is interviewed he, consciously or unconsciously, prepares himself for it, and isn't at all natural. Now, the ideal interview would be one when the victim wasn't aware that it was taking place." (Sharp 303) Sharp's comic fantasy of self-disclosure, in which Harte's "real self" is unveiled in its "natural" milieu, apparently originates here in the author's own words. Harte proposes a strategy for overcoming the artificial medium of the interview which echoes Lowell's complaint that his interviewer "knew that I didn't know he was interviewing me." If the subject of the interview is to reveal his true personality to the interviewer, then he must be denied the inhibiting knowledge that an interview is taking place. The interviewer must conceal his own knowledge of this project in order, more effectively, to know his "victim." As these examples suggest, the celebrity interview was conceived, above all, as an hermeneutic practice: as a medium through which both the journalist and the reader might hope to discover the authentic "nature" of famous individuals. But the possibility that this revelatory strategy might be thwarted by the design or repression of the subject also meant that the interview was a scene of hermeneutic conflict and desire. In an article entitled "The Art of Interviewing" (1890), Frank A. Burr, for instance, envisaged the conduct of the interview as a form of pyschological "by-play" "between the two combatants" (401). Burr advised prospective interviewers on the best means of interpreting the signs of the subject's inner thoughts ("one has to watch the action of the eyes and the countenance, intently," he wrote), and of overcoming his or her resistance to questioning (401). Reading accounts such as these, it is possible to understand the interviewer's incitement of herme neutic desire and resistance ? of concealment and revelation ? in terms of Michel Foucault's familiar model of the workings of "disciplinary" power: a form of power which operates by exercising and withholding the privilege of social invisibility. The interview, it might be argued, functions precisely as a means of "imposing] on those whom it subjects a principle of compulsory visibility," while, at the same time, attempting to efface its own discursive procedures (Foucault 199). The point is, however, that this fantasy of power was rarely accomplished. In the first place, visibility may also be construed as a sign of cultural distinction which the interview confers upon its subject. The image of the celebrity is not so much an object of surveillance (although, as I will be suggesting, it was often imagined in such terms) as a spectacle upon which it is deemed to be a privilege for the reader to gaze.2 Secondly, moreover, the interviewer's strategy of self-effacement was invariably contradicted by its open acknowledgement within the confines of the interview itself. In</page><page sequence="5">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 163 Burgin's interview with Bret Harte, for example, the fantasy of an ideal, transparent mode of self-revelation is comically displaced, since, in this case, it is the interviewee who apparently conceals his identity from the interviewer, while proposing the opposite. The somewhat laboured joke upon which the "Real Interview" turns is that the interviewer himself is unaware of Harte's identity at the time of the interview, and so fails to realize that he has been conducting an interview at all. The identity of Burgin's interlocutor is revealed only at the end of the narrative when it becomes apparent that Harte's alleged comments on the "ideal interview" undercut the interview's own scenario. The artifice of this ironic d?nouement calls into question the authenticity of "The Real Interview," and blurs the distinction between this text and the manifestly fictional "Ideal Interview." In "The Real Interview" we are led to believe, it is the "victim" who manipulates the epistemological framework of the dialogue, thus simultaneously mimicking and subvert ing the strategy of the "ideal interview" which he himself espouses. What finally emerges from this morass of mutually displacing ironies is not the proposed seamless effacement of the interview's investigative project, but, on the contrary, a highly self-conscious the matization of the techniques by which the interview does or does not verify its status as a form of knowledge. The tension between these two opposing models of the interview ? as a self-effacing or self-reflexive form ? was explicitly acknowledged in another of Robert Barr's inter views for the Idler. In "A Chat With Conan Doyle" (1894), Barr (writing as an anonymous "Tdler' Interviewer") translated Bret Harte's distinction between American and English responses to the interview into a fundamental divergence of practice. In England, he observed, "The successful interviewer blazons forth as much of his own personality as possible; using his victim as a peg on which to hang his own opinions" (Tdler' 341). By obtruding his own "personality" into the frame of the interview, the English interviewer exhibits a self-promotional impulse which, in Barr's view, misinterprets the proper func tion of the genre. In America, on the other hand, the interviewer transparently "reflects" his subject by rendering himself invisible: In America you get the real thing, and even the youngest newspaper man there understands how it should be done. An interviewer should be like a clear sheet of plate glass that forms the front window of an attractive shop through which you can see the articles displayed, scarcely suspecting that anything stands between you and the interesting collection. (Tdler' 341) Barr's metaphor of the shop-window is particularly significant in revealing the cultural assumptions which shaped the epistemological claims of the interview. For like the shop window, the celebrity interview is also constructed as a cultural site which frames its subjects as so many "articles displayed" for consumption.3 According to this analogy, the interviewer functions as a "clear sheet of plate glass," a literally transparent medium, channelling the reader's vision onto the commodified figure within the text. The assump tion of communicative transparency, moreover, invokes a code of journalistic neutrality in which the interviewer denies any part in this process of mediation. As Michael Schud son, amongst others, has shown, this rhetoric of neutrality was characteristic of the dominant professional ethos of journalism during the late nineteenth century. Even in the personalized form of the so-called "New Journalism," which emerged in the 1880s, it was</page><page sequence="6">164 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE supposed that the journalist could function as a mechanical conduit of objective reality. In 1889, T. P. O'Connor, one of the foremost practitioners of the New Journalism in Britain, defined its primary aim as to convey a "photograph of the outward man"; by which he claimed the possibility of an exact reproduction of the characters of famous individuals (428). The technique of the interview was usually associated with this wider shift in journalistic practices. Although it was often heralded as a form of "personal journalism," the interview was also capable of claiming an impersonality from the manner in which it recorded the "personalities" of its subjects.4 Again, however, in Barr's interview with Conan Doyle, it is interesting to note that this schematic opposition between English and American practices of the interview breaks down. Precisely by raising these questions about the proper function of the interview, Barr undermines his own assertion of the need for a transparent reflection of the interviewer's subject. As the interview proceeds, it lapses further into the obtrusive narrative strategies which Barr claims to deplore. Moreover, this contradiction is not simply a result of the interviewer's desire to broach the question of the interview itself. In addition to this, Barr wishes to evoke his intimacy with Conan Doyle, and does so precisely by projecting his own "personality" into the narrative field of vision. Thus, the recorded dialogue appears to give equal weight to both participants, with the interviewer asserting his own claims upon the reader's attention. This self-promotional impulse is also signalled by the accom panying photographs which illustrate the written text. Here, the interviewer himself is photographed alongside the subject of the interview, thus dramatizing the moment of their encounter (Fig. 11). Barr's identity as the interviewer was even more openly recognized in the American text of the interview, which was published in McClure's Magazine under the heading "A Dialogue Between Conan Doyle and Robert Barr." In this instance, the equality of the two participants is such that it erases the differentiation of discursive positions which constitutes the very function of the journalistic interview. Ironically enough, Barr's approval of the American interview as a transparent, asymmetrical me dium of cultural visibility is even further removed from his own practice in the American version of the text. The interviewer's evocation of intimacy with his subject, however, was neither simply an exercise in self-promotion nor due entirely to the "dialogue" format required for American publication. As its use of photographic illustration shows, this self-reflexive model of the interview was capable of generating its own revelatory strategies. The drama tization of the actual event of the interview works as a means of exhibiting the celebrity in the intimacy of a relaxed conversation or "chat." By re-enacting the moment upon which it is founded, the text of the interview appears to come closer to embodying the immediate presence of its subject, without effacing the means by which it does so. Such a strategy also facilitates the reader's sense of being present upon this intimate occasion. Thus, in spite of its potential for displaying an uneasy awareness of the artifice of the interview, this tech nique was prominent throughout the 1890s. Of central importance to this practice of interviewing was its physical location within the home of the literary celebrity. // As richard ALTICK HAS SHOWN, biographical interest in the homes of famous authors dates back to the 1840s at least (117-18). Towards the end of the century, though, this</page><page sequence="7">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 165 Figure 11. Robert Barr and Conan Doyle, from An "Idler" Interviewer, "A Chat with Conan Doyle," The Idler Magazine 6 (1894).</page><page sequence="8">166 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE interest was manifested on a much wider scale, as volumes documenting the "homes and haunts" and "literary shrines" of canonical authors began to proliferate on both sides of the Atlantic. Titles such as Home Life of Great Authors (1887), A Literary Pilgrimage Among The Haunts of Famous British Authors (1895) and Homes and Haunts of Famous Authors (1906) (to name only a few) indicate both the generic proportions which this literature reached and the entirely habitual character of the iconography which it de ployed. From around the 1870s, similar texts began to be centred around the homes of living authors, and to assume the character of interviews. By the 1890s, most literary interviews were conducted "at home." It is clear that the home of the author was not merely a convenient or neutral site for the staging of the interview. On the contrary, the home encoded the distinctive cultural and epistemological assumptions of the interview in the material substance of its location. Even before the first question was asked, the presence of the interviewer within the "private" space of the celebrity inscribed its investigative project. Indeed, the topography of the home was often explicitly read as a domain of revelatory signs. Expressing the very essence of the subject's "personality," the home was both a sanctified space (a "literary shrine") and a world composed of familiar domestic icons. In this respect, even the most mundane object might be invested with a unique significance. Alluding to these fetishized descriptions of the homes of celebrities, the author of an 1892 article entitled "Interview ers and Interviewing" observed sarcastically that: Some of the possessions of "Our Notorieties" we love as though they were our own. Are they not as familiar in our mouths as household words? Are they not the dearest of old friends? ("Interviewers" 425) The proprietorial familiarity with which readers were invited to view the material posses sions of the celebrity was, indeed, one of the most noticeable features of these texts. Through their exploration of the home, interviews constructed the celebrity as a figure of popular cultural recognition. Yet the effect of this cultural code was not so much to dispel the aura of fame as to produce and reinforce it. Commenting upon American repre sentations of the "author at home," Daniel H. Borus has accurately suggested that "the more knowable the author became as a datum of information, the more remote and mysterious literary activity seemed as a possible experience" (127-28). While interviewers constantly invoked the intimacy of their relationship to the literary celebrity, they were not, as some critics of the genre supposed, simply lacking in respect for the "sanctities" of privacy. Indeed, for the anonymous critic quoted above, the interviewer was more damningly characterized as "the ideal literary man ... the 'hero-worshipper' among the moderns ... the concentration of the modern spirit of reverence" ("Interviewers" 426). In Britain, probably the earliest and most systematic codification of these journalistic techniques was produced by Edmund Yates in a series of articles entitled Celebrities At Home (1877-79). In this serial, first published in his weekly newspaper the World, Yates pioneered many of the rhetorical strategies that came to distinguish the interview as a discursive form. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of Celebrities At Home, however, was the literal-mindedness with which Yates mapped his exploration of material signs onto the psychologized space of the celebrity. In each narrative he conducts a systematic penetration of the celebrity's home, which betrays both his reification of "personality" and</page><page sequence="9">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 167 anthropomorphic response to objects. Describing Mark Twain's home in Hartford, Con necticut, for instance, Yates observed that: The mansion with its quaint old English architecture and its exquisite tiles and mosaics, the rich ferneries and half-tropical hothouses, are no mere extraneous accumulations such as any man of wealth might create, but a gradual and organic outgrowth of the owner's mind which gives you a delightful peep into the inner recesses of his character. (3:135) Here, Yates's careful rejection of the possibility of a merely "extraneous" relationship between Twain and his material "accumulations" shows his desire to endow the celebrity with an aura which emanates organically throughout his property. This organic conception of property relations enables Yates to deny the charge that he is simply consecrating a vulgar display of wealth and privilege. In this respect, Yates's understanding of the sanctity of the celebrity's home exemplifies a "taboo" which Emile Durkheim, writing later in the century, saw as the founding instance of Western private property rights. According to Durkheim, the "sacred character" which is attached to private property is derived from a sense of its "contagious" transmission. Thus, the "characteristic that makes a thing the property of a certain subject or individual exhibits the same contagiousness. It tends always to pass from the objects in which it resides to all those other objects that come in contact with them" (148). Similarly, in nineteenth-century representations of the author at home, a sediment of the celebrity's sanctified "personality" seems to gather in the objects which he (or, more problematically, she) appropriates. In reinforcing this assumption, literary celebrity bears an especially privileged func tion. For as Yates constantly insinuates, the revelatory capacity of objects allows insights, not merely into the worldly success of the celebrity, but, more importantly, into the (supposed) inner nature of the creative mind. His explorations of the author at home generally proceed from a surveillance of the exterior of the house, pass through various interior scenes, and culminate in an epiphanic glimpse of the study or work-room ? the inmost recess of the author's "private" space. An example of this narrative teleology occurs in Yates's description of his entry into the "literary workshop" of Mary Braddon: Having been admitted to the privilege of seeing Mrs Maxwell at work, we hardly feel justified in revealing a secret without which the information we have supplied would be worthless. There is "copy" all over the room, as there are pictures, as there are books, as there are receipted bills and housekeeping accounts, but the "copy" is merely the outward expression, the visible sign, of work. Where is the hidden spring? In a small drawer carefully locked repose the "skeletons" of the novelist. (1: 320) In this instance, the scopic design of Yates's narrative assumes a specifically and visibly gendered character. His progression through the various stages of surveillance, penetra tion and revelation is evidently charged by a phallocentric economy, even down to the archetypal signifier of Braddon's "drawer." Yet this passage also exhibits a number of rhetorical tropes which Yates deployed throughout the series in investigating the homes of both male and female authors. The topos of the "secret," for example, functions, here and elsewhere, as an apparent sign of resistance to the journalist's intrusion, whilst, in fact, merely deferring and intensifying the voyeuristic impulse of the narrative. While claiming</page><page sequence="10">168 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE to unveil an essence that is inscribed within the material objects of the "workroom," Yates's revelation of Braddon's "secret" is itself a form of "outward expression," which only demarcates the existence, and not the putative content, of the "secret." This inability to penetrate beyond the "visible sign[s]" of the authorial space is not surprising, however, since it is through the rhetorical imperative of secrecy that the apparently opposing rhetorical imperative of revelation is sustained. In their fascination with the homes of literary celebrities, journalists such as Yates sought both to exhibit and, at the same time, to preserve this space of authorial "privacy." Here, "privacy" performs a function which Leo Braudy has seen as characteristic of the modern experience of fame. In his book The Frenzy of Renown, Braudy shows how the opposition between a fame that is conceived of as immanent and otherworldly and a celebrity that is dismissed as merely ephemeral is central to the very strategies which it appears to condemn. From the nineteenth century onwards, the "private" experience of the celebrity is often figured as a realm of authenticity which underlies public visibility (Braudy 406-25). Thus, what appears to elude or resist visibility is precisely that which defines it. Yates offers a perfect example of this oxymoronic strategy of modern publicity when he begins his article on Tennyson's home by picturing a "mansion of welcome solitude away from the haunts of the crowd and safe from the intrusion of the curious" (1: 23): Like the better-known house at Farringford, whence the poet has been almost driven by the vulgar curiosity of mobs of tourists, this at Haslemere stands close to the ridge of a noble down, and there are groves of pine on either hand; but instead of forming vantage-points whence, by the aid of telescopes, the poet might be seen wandering in the careless-ordered garden, these groves dip suddenly down into deep gorges. (1: 24) Encoded within Yates's topography of Tennyson's home is a rhetoric of obstruction, similar to his apparent reluctance to divulge the "secret" of Braddon's study. The land scape of Haslemere physically prevents the acts of surveillance which the poet has been forced to endure in his previous residence on the Isle of Wight. Yet Tennyson's "mansion of welcome solitude," his concealment within the folds of the surrounding countryside, and his avowed hostility to personal publicity, only serve to reinscribe the privileged moment of vision which is constituted by the narrative itself. Yates's audacity lies in his attempt to distance himself from the "vulgar curiosity of mobs of tourists," while covertly reproducing the very same impulse in the writing of his article. Hence, the resistance to publicity which Yates appears to endorse becomes an operative moment within his own strategy of publicity. This can be seen from the way in which Yates's remarkably casual reference to the telescopic surveillance of the poet disavows a practice which, in truth, provides a fitting metaphor for the panoramic focus of his own text. Yates's reproduction of this telescopic vision allows the narrative to span distance and proximity as it carries the reader into the heart of the celebrity's intimate space. While Yates himself did not refer to Celebrities At Home in terms of the nascent practice of interviewing, the hermeneutic strategies deployed in this series proved remark ably durable. In particular, Yates's minute attention to the revelatory capacity of objects such as Braddon's "small drawer" or Tennyson's furniture became a standard means of charting the investigative claims of the interview. In a memorable caricature of this</page><page sequence="11">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 169 technique, the author of "Interviewers and Interviewing" perceived the extent to which the "personality" of the celebrity had become recognizable as a collection of material artefacts: Have you noticed how the ordinary interview, as it is known in England, is apt to read very much as if it were a catalogue of furniture? Some of the interviews ? and some of those, too, which seem to be the most widely appreciated ? are practically nothing else. The interviewer, in these cases, appears to have interviewed the house, not its owner. ("Interviewers" 425) Here, we are alerted to a grotesque contradiction in the interview's figuration of the celebrity. Paradoxically, for all their hyperbolic insistence on discovering the unique signs of "personality," interviews typically display a serialized "catalogue" of commodities which the "interviewer advertises freely, right and left." While these texts are ostensibly concerned with consecrating individual difference and distinction, it becomes possible to note "how much the interviews are like each other" ("Interviewers" 425). Those familiar possessions which were presumed to mark the authenticity of the celebrity were invoked with a regularity which tended to announce the dissolution, rather than the integrity, of personal identity. Thus, as Jean Baudrillard has suggested of a more recent phenomenon of mass culture, the code of "personalization" appeals to a residue of value which is no longer sustained in the form of the appeal (10-11). To say that interviews of this kind were literally serialized would seem a banal observation, were it not for the nature of the claims which the interview habitually made. Hence, the fact that Yates's Celebrities At Home totalled more than three-hundred sepa rate articles and ran for over six years in the World is indicative, not only of its remarkable popularity as a series, but also of its oxymoronic construction of the status of celebrity. In the 1890s, magazines such as the Strand and the Idler followed Yates's example by serializing interviews at length, and thus, for some critics at least, adumbrating a seemingly endless repetition of the same motifs. That one "author at home" was much like any other ? and that the "personality" of one celebrity was equivalent to that of all others ? was recognized in another of Henry James's satirical tales. In "The Papers" (1903), a journalist named Howard Bight publishes an interview with a comically anonymous celebrity under the title: "Personal Peeps ? Number Ninety-Three: A Chat with the New Dramatist" (52). As this title suggests, James sensed the contradictory demands which accompanied the "democratization" of literary celebrity. If, on the one hand, the rhetoric of the interview insisted upon the intimacy with which it presented celebrities to the public, on the other hand this claim was itself contingent upon technological resources which proved to be antithetical in form. /// DURING the 1890s, developments in photographic technology and photomechanical re production were especially important in enabling the dissemination of visual signs which reinforced the signifying strategies of journalistic texts. Photographs of the author, the author's home, and the author posing inside the home, were commonly reproduced in interviews of this period. This use of photography produced a still more radical apprehen sion of intimacy between literary celebrities and their readers. For the first time, perhaps,</page><page sequence="12">170 VICTORIAN LITERATURE AND CULTURE readers were able to witness famous authors as they appeared in "real life," as opposed to the more formal guise of earlier photographic portraits.5 Modern photography, moreover, was capable of rendering the material contours of the author's home with much greater differentiation and density than other illustrative techniques. In his essay "A Small History of Photography" (1931), Walter Benjamin traced a similar historical trajectory of increasing proximity between the object of visual percep tion and its viewer. Through the mass reproduction of photographs in illustrated newspa pers, he argued, the "unique appearance or semblance of distance" which constituted the "aura" of an object was dispelled. Thus, Benjamin concludes that "The stripping bare of the object, the destruction of the aura, is the mark of a perception whose sense of the sameness of things has grown to a point where even the singular, the unique, is divested of its uniqueness ? by means of its reproduction" (250). In photographic representations of the author at home, it is possible to witness a similar conflict between two distinct perceptual codes. If the reproducibility of the photograph did not effectively supersede the perception of the celebrity as "singular" and "unique," it nevertheless contradicted it by translating uniqueness into "sameness," as critics such as James recognized. More precisely, the reader's newfound proximity to the celebrity simultaneously violated and reinforced the apprehension of distance by which the latter was necessarily detached from the world of mundane experience. In contemporary interviews, as I have already sug gested, the consecration of the "literary shrine" tended to incite the very desire for an illicit and intrusive intimacy which it claimed to disavow. Yet, conversely, it was through this ritualized scrutiny of the "private" domain that the uniqueness of the author was invoked. Thus, it is also possible to see how photography, as a technology of "transi toriness and reproducibility," positively enabled the apprehension of "uniqueness and permanence" to which, in Benjamin's account, it is opposed (250). In the 1890s, for example, it became increasingly viable (both technically and economically) to intersperse texts with photographs which were commissioned especially for the occasion, rather than being compiled from existing sources.6 In many literary interviews, the various rooms of the house were displayed in a sequential narrative form, emphasizing the singularity and spontaneity of the photographic gaze. These photographic narratives provided a visual counterpart to the written text, in which the interviewer systematically explored the topography of the home, and so authenticated his claim of having been a witness to the author's unique spatio-temporal presence. Rather than dispelling a belief in the aura of the celebrity, such photographs attempted, however paradoxically, to instil one. Likewise, the photographic facsimiles of authors' signatures and manuscripts, which also adorned many contemporary interviews, may be seen as having disseminated an anachronistic notion of the authenticity of authorship to a much wider public than the hunters and collectors of the originals. At the very moment when the cultural value of these signs should, in Benjamin's scheme, have been diminished, new conditions for their valuation were forged. It should not be assumed, however, that the technical capacity to produce increasingly naturalistic images of celebrities necessarily resulted in seamless narratives in which these ideological contradictions were simply concealed. For as I have been suggesting, the form of the interview was peculiarly susceptible to the kind of self-reflexive interrogation which consistently failed to hide the ambivalence and anxiety which surrounded its generic codes. Thus, one of the most acute contemporary observations on the cultural effects of</page><page sequence="13">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 111 these photographic representations occurred within the confines of an "author at home" narrative itself. At a first glance, George Moore's article "My Impressions of Zola," published in the English Illustrated Magazine in 1894, offers a paradigmatic example of the narrative forms which I have been discussing. At the outset of this article, Moore himself acknowledges that he has been invited to write an "intimate and personal" portrait of his celebrated literary acquaintance (477). Without being an interview as such, the text reproduces some of the standard motifs of this genre through personal reminiscences of visits paid to Zola's home. Moreover, Moore's emplotment of the archetypal "author at home" narrative is supplemented by the text's accompanying illustrations: a portrait photograph of Zola, a sketch of his home at M?dan, engravings from photographs of Zola's bedroom, dining-room and study, and the facsimile of an "Autograph letter from M. Zola." In its visual aspect, the article is thus virtually identical to V. R. Mooney's 1893 interview with Zola, published in the Idler series, "Lions in Their Dens." Against this likeness, however, some significant differences between the two texts emerge. In Mooney's interview, the relationship between the visual and written narratives is purely complementary. The photographs are harnessed to the illustrative task of reinforcing a message which is encoded within the text. This complementary relationship is explicitly signalled when Mooney draws attention to the accompanying photographs of Zola's luxuriously-furnished home, in which "Taste presides in everything; choice, disposal, grouping, and colouring" (503; Fig. 12). With this verbal gloss the interviewer establishes a bridge between the two narrative media, and so ensures their mutual support. By contrast, in Moore's article, the relationship between the two media is marked by an equally explicit distantiation of meaning. While the visual narrative reinforces his initial project of an "intimate and personal" account of Zola's domestic life, Moore perversely disrupts this function by reading against the grain of his own "illustrations." As if in direct riposte to Mooney's interview, composed from almost identical photographic evidence, Moore comments upon Zola's lack of taste, as well as rebuking his acquiescence at being reduced to the status of a mere celebrity. Observing, sardonically, that Zola seems to spend more time being interviewed than writing novels, Moore implicitly questions the cultural codes governing the production of his own text. The pre-eminent sign of Zola's status as a celebrity is the photographic reproduction of his "interior," as Moore acknowledges by parenthetically noting its ubiquity in similar journalistic texts: "has it not been described by reporters and reproduced in photography in every illustrated periodical?" (483). For Moore, however, Zola's passion for collecting "general bric-?-brac" is analagous to the false economy of his recent fiction. In both instances, Zola's exhaustive accumulative energies are manifested at the expense of a proper aesthetic discrimination: The quality of the work does not concern him anymore than the quality of the draperies, the carved wood-work, and the iron-railings with which he has furnished his house. The iron-rail ings may not be finely wrought, but they photograph just as the finest specimens of medieval handicraft; and the photographs inspire in the ignorant awe of a literature which is carried on among such luxury. In these photographs Zola leans pensively over his writing-table; it is impossible to say that the table is not fifteenth century work, and it is impossible to say from the expression on the face whether the brain is engaged on a work like the Dialogues of Plato or on a work like La Terre.

At this point in his argument, Moore seems to be referring directly to the illustrations which accompany his own text, as well as to those in other articles. Of these images one depicts the baroque "iron-railings" of Zola's bed, while another shows the novelist reading at a desk in his study. In the latter, the figure of the author is exhibited in a moment of absorbed, "private" contemplation (Fig. 13). Amidst the "luxury" of his surroundings, however, this image of solitary authorship is designed to induce a sense of "awe" at the</page><page sequence="15">s &lt;* 2 S' S 5, S' OQ Figure 13.

Rather than bringing the reader into a democratic proximity with the celebrity, as would appear to be their function, such images mystify his status by couching social distinction in terms of private experience. In his essay "The Rhetoric of The Image," Roland Barthes countered a similar mystification by proposing that the visual image be conceived as a twofold signifying structure which modulates between denotative and connotative functions. Thus, even in the photographic image (with its peculiar denotative force, which Barthes elsewhere acknowledged),7 "the discontinuous world of symbols plunges into the story of the denoted scene as though into a lustral bath of innocence." The "denoted message," Barthes argues, "'naturalizes' the system of the connoted mes sage" by immersing it within the continuity of a syntactic unit (51). Likewise, in Barthes's terms, one might say that the image of Zola in his study registers the immediacy of a "denoted scene" while abstracting from it a "connoted message." For all its intimacy, this image, as Moore observes, prevents its viewer from identifying the precise nature of Zola's work, or the material texture of the space in which it is enacted. Within the naturalistic scene, connotations of luxury and profundity are released, while the possibility of banality ? what is really behind "the expression on the face" of Zola? ? is precluded. Certainly, Moore's critique of this prevailing representation of literary celebrity is not without its own problems. Besides participating in the very strategies which he rebukes, his disdain for the reverence that is accorded to the celebrity is grounded in a distinction be tween the authentic objet d'art and the mere fake, which the medium of photography passes as genuine. By implicitly claiming to possess a privileged knowledge of the "original," Moore ultimately reinscribes the attitude of "awe" which he wishes to reject. Nevertheless, by disputing the transparency of the photographic image, he also challenges the generic ico nography of which it is an element. The effect of Moore's ironic commentary upon the illus trations which accompany his own text is to subvert a conventional reading of their signification. On one level, the reader is now invited to view these images as corroboration of Moore's observations on Zola's lack of taste, in direct opposition to their intended mean ing. Yet rather than simply reclaiming the visual image for an alternative illustrative task, Moore's disjunction of image and text questions the illustrative relationship itself. The arti cle as a whole is riven by two antagonistic narrative codes, each of which preserves an ironic distance from the other. This distancing is reciprocal since it can also work against the criti cal strategies which, in this instance, it appears to serve. The visual image is allowed to stand free from the burden of its supplementary function, and constitute a recognizable generic signifier in its own right. Thus, during the 1890s, visual representations of the author at home began to appear with no immediate illustrative context. In 1892, for example, the Idler began publication of "My First Book," a series which purported to record the early profes sional experiences of a number of leading contemporary novelists. Alongside these tales of hardship and obscurity, though, photographs of the authors' luxurious homes told a some what different story. These visual narratives providentially unfold the eventual rewards of literary celebrity, offering a comforting reassurance as to the essentially bourgeois charac ter of modern authorship. In this series, the distantiation of visual image and written text is complete: not only is the former not illustrative of the latter, but, unlike Moore's article, there is no recognition of its failing to be so. This entirely casual and tacit deployment of the "author at home" narrative indicates the extent of its diffusion as a means of representing and recognizing literary celebrity in the late nineteenth century. From Edmund Yates's pioneering narrative explorations of</page><page sequence="17">The Literary Celebrity in the "Age of Interviewing" 175 the 1870s the genre had developed into one of the most popular forms of journalistic and biographical discourse by the 1890s. Finally, as this last example shows, the iconography of the "author at home" extended beyond the confines of the interview in which it was primarily shaped. Yet in spite of this trajectory of increasing cultural familiarity, neither the interview nor the narrative of the author at home were able entirely to naturalize their presence during this period. As I have suggested, the practice of interviewing frequently clouded the naturalistic transparency which it claimed as its theoretical project. The self-reflexive character of many celebrity interviews was capable of registering genuine anxieties about the effects of this modern cultural phenomenon, even if the thematization of resistance to publicity may also be viewed as a powerful strategy of incorporation. Until at least the end of the nineteenth century the interview remained an unsettled, convoluted form, which was yet to subside into the unquestioned familiarity of its later guise. It is for this reason that interviews of the period provide insights into their own troubled concep tion. At this formative historical moment, when the cultural assumptions inscribed within the discourse of the interview were still all too apparent, it is possible to witness the conflicts out of which our own mass culture has arisen. University of Leeds NOTES 1. This comment is quoted by Matthiessen and Murdock in The Notebooks of Henry James (83-84). James was prompted by Lowell's experience in writing his novel The Reverberator (1888), a satire of the methods of the New Journalism. For the interview which sparked this controversy, see Hawthorne (9). 2. More schematically, Sontag has claimed that there are two distinct modes of social visibility "essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers)" (178). Sontag's reminder of the.function of "specta cle" in modern culture provides a useful corrective to Foucault's emphasis upon a mode of surveillance in which power is virtually contingent upon the privileged exercise of invisibility. 3.
