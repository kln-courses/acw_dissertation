<plain_text><page sequence="1">IDOLATRY AND SCULPTURE IN ANCIEN REGIME FRANCE Anne Betty Weinshenker The issue of idolatry is located at a complex and controversial intersec- tion of the visual arts with theology. It has been confronted by some of the world's major religions, been the cause of tremendous destruction, and occupied a crucial position in the Iconoclastic Controversy and the Protestant and Catholic Refor- mations. The concern with veneration of idols that developed in France during the last few decades of the seventeenth century and lasted through the middle of the eighteenth has been less observed, yet is so widespread as to require investiga- tion. The term "idolatry" was used many times as a metaphor, but that is not the focus of the present study, which is instead focused on the attention that both texts and visual images devoted during this period to the practice of the worship of false gods. Some approached it from the perspective of conformity to Judeo- Christian stigmatization of idolatry, others in response to curiosity about reli- gious observances in classical antiquity and non-European societies. It also fed into political and religious argumentation. Whatever the viewpoint being advanced, discussion of idol-worship, was also connected with sculpture. As yet, there exists no account of this phenomenon, although it was unquestionably significant from both art-historical and cultural perspectives. The sculpture of this era has usually been studied merely in terms of stylistic developments or the accomplishments of individual artists, although a few scholars have investigated the political signifi- cance of royal public monuments and their reception.1 In delineating the ramifi- cations of the connection between statuary and idolatry that was so often af- firmed during the period, the present study is intended to shed light on the range Anne Betty Weinshenker is Professor of Art History at Montclair State University, New Jer- sey. She has published on eighteenth-century French art and art theory. Her current research is concerned with the role and reception of sculpture during the ancien r6gime.

It also explores some of the sculptural responses engendered by those readings. In order to understand why this linkage of sculpture with idolatry could be employed as a tool to promote a variety of viewpoints, it is first useful to examine the visual prominence of sculptural works and their availability not only to those living in large cities, especially Paris, but to visitors as well. The first part of this essay deals with the most visible forms of sculpture and the kinds of loca- tions in which they could be seen. The next portion provides an outline of the many texts and works of visual art that associate statues with idolatry. Such an overview demonstrates the breadth of perspectives brought to bear on that rela- tionship. The final section is concerned with the differing ways that such groups as Huguenots, Jansenists, and philosophes pressed the much-acknowledged con- nection between this art and the worship of false deities into service. It is intended to demonstrate that sculpture-both as abstract concept and as concrete embod- iment-was made to serve as a means of communicating some of the most impor- tant religious and political concerns of the time. WHERE TO SEE SCULPTURE By the middle of the eighteenth century the growing numbers of art col- lectors were acquiring sculpted works ranging from tabletop to lifesize dimen- sions for their cabinets and gardens. Patrons were also increasingly commission- ing portrait sculpture. As in the past, the majority of the populace still had no more access to these works produced for private consumption than to the paint- ings owned by the wealthy and privileged. While most people could as a rule see paintings only in churches or during the relatively brief duration of an exhibition, they could view a great deal of sculpture on an ongoing basis. Those entering ecclesiastical buildings would encounter it inside, where figurative and decorative carving adorned altars, church furnishings, and tombs, and there were also free- standing sculpted figures and groups. Large numbers of individuals would come upon it, in the form of statues, busts, narrative reliefs, and decorative designs, on the facades of churches, palaces, administrative buildings, and private residences. They could see the reliefs and sculpture in the round that fronted-and backed- triumphal arches and adorned public fountains. Those who entered the parks and gardens open to the public would find statuary there, and in public squares and other prominent areas they would be able to look up to larger-than-life royal monuments on tall pedestals. The ubiquity of sculpture lent to it serviceability as a means of mass com- munication, whether it were employed to reach those who regarded it actively or, on a subliminal level, those who accepted it as a customary feature of their daily surroundings. Since the early seventeenth century the Bourbon monarchs, begin- ning with Henri IV, had been celebrated by means of equestrian or pedestrian statues in the largest cities. Each monument was sited so as to form the firm climax of an imposing spatial arrangement, often in a Place Royale, and generally included inscriptions, reliefs, and subsidiary allegorical figures.2 The royal ad- ministration directly initiated some monuments, a few others were at least osten- sibly sponsored by individuals, and the majority were commissioned by munici- 486</page><page sequence="3">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 487 pal governments although the royal administration furnished encouragement and sometimes funding for them.3 During the course of the period beginning with the 1680s and continuing for some eighty years or so, these monuments advertised the victories and glory of Louis XIV, and then the achievements and benevolence of Louis XV to generations of their subjects. Ancient Roman imperial productions provided the thematic source for these works and the model for the armor worn by all of the royal statues. The references to this heritage proclaimed that the kings supported, renewed, and embodied the great traditions of western civilization. Classical mythology and the classical practice of personifying abstract ideas and entities supplied the sub- jects for countless works of decorative sculpture. The large, dignified, and ideal- ly-proportioned figures that characterize them exemplify admired antique formu- lae. This style was also adopted for the production of religious sculpture. Church officials continued to commission religious statuary throughout this period. Among those structures in Paris for which new works were made were the Cathedral of Notre Dame, the Invalides, St. Sulpice, and St. Roch. The tombs located in churches furnished sometimes more dramatic examples of sculp- ture. Allegorical figures representing such concepts as Death, Sorrow, Faith, and Time-here too recalling the classical tradition-appeared on many tombs to- gether with the statue of the deceased. Authors of guidebooks to Paris devoted a great deal of attention to the sepulchral monuments to be seen in ecclesiastical buildings: Piganiol de la Force, for example, frequently wrote about churches largely in terms of the tombs within them.4 The table of contents in Dezallier d'Argenville's guide to the city lists fourteen collections of paintings, thirty-four churches, fifty-six townhouses and seventy-four tombs. He described many of the burial monuments in considerable detail, and four of the five engraved illustra- tions in this volume are of tombs.5 With the urban environment offering so much opportunity for the view- ing of sculpture, different examples would have stimulated various responses. The sightseer might have eyed certain productions with curiosity; the bereaved might have viewed sepulchral monuments with emotion. Some individuals might have reacted to public monuments with civic pride, others with resentment and many with total indifference. At the same time, several writers dealing with or touching upon the visual arts found the art of sculpture to be inextricably bound up with the practice of idolatry. THE SCULPTURE-IDOLATRY CONNECTION: TEXTS AND IMAGES Among publications dealing with the closeness of the connections be- tween sculpture and idolatry were examples by literary men, ecclesiastics, anti- quarians, and writers particularly concerned with painting and sculpture. In the article "statue" of his Dictionaire universel Furetiere included a sentence serving as an example of the use of the word, "All the Gods of Paganism were only Statues," thereby demonstrating that the concept had become a commonplace.6 While generally affirming this relationship, some authors introduced modifica- tions that inflected or expanded on the idea. Their sources were the Bible and texts by antique writers and early theologians.</page><page sequence="4">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 La Fontaine made use of the sculpture-idolatry nexus as the basis for one of his observations of mankind's foibles. His fable of "The Sculptor and the Stat- ue of Jupiter" focused on the human tendency to manufacture false values and then cling to them,7 although at the same time it did specifically refer to the widespread existence of pagan error (idolatry). While his primary interest lay in utilizing the tale of the statue of Jupiter and its creator, he also introduced the legend of the sculptor Pygmalion and his beautiful statue, thus reiterating his observation of humankind's determination to pursue self-developed desiderata. At the same time the suggestion of incest ("Pygmalion became the lover of the Venus he fathered"), while underscoring the repellent nature of the erroneous behavior also served further to cast a negative light on the art of sculpture. La Fontaine accentuated the materialist, non-spiritual quality of the false beliefs by beginning his verse with the sculptor contemplating his block of marble and try- ing to decide whether to make it into a god, a table or a basin. The shocking combination made of these nouns, together with the description of the artist's choices and actions, brought out the falsity of the religious awe that the complet- ed statue generated. Bishop Bossuet, in his Discours sur l'histoire universelle of 1681, made many references to the idolatry-sculpture pairing, such as "man came to worship the very work of his hands. He believed himself able to enclose the divine spirit in statues, and forgot so completely that God had done it that he believed himself able to make a God."8 The antiquarian scholar Charles-C6sar Baudelot de Dair- val (1648-1722), citing ancient sources including Plutarch and Varro, alleged that the first statues created the first pagan gods, causing the abandonment of monotheism. He quoted Cicero's claim that the freedom to make statues multi- plied the divinities and, in the words of Aristophanes, referred to sculptors as "makers of gods."9 Relying on Josephus and Lactantius, his text also remarked that the statues by the most skillful artists were especially responsible for the flourishing of idolatry (96-7, 101-3). As in the passages by La Fontaine and Bossuet, this text held the art of sculpture responsible for the promotion of error. Authors particularly concerned with the visual arts concurred that sculp- ture bore its share of guilt in the matter of idolatry. Andr6 F6libien (1619-95), an official of the Academie royale de peinture et de sculpture, maintained that sculp- ture was invented for the adoration of a divinity.10 Yet some of these authorities' words also transmit a certain satisfaction, even pride, in the accomplishment. Charles Perrault (1628-1703), literary man and principal assistant to Colbert in the Surintendance des Bitiments (royal buildings administration), put into the mouth of an engraved personification of sculpture a verse boasting that "former- ly I was even able to make the proudest of humans, to whom the entire universe rendered homage, worship the work of my hands."11 Perrault's Parallele des an- ciens et des modernes added the observation that "there were extraordinary re- wards attached to the success of [making statues], going so far as to giving gods to entire nations and even to the princes of those nations, and when the sculptor had succeeded he was scarcely less honored than the god who came from his hands."12 As a determined moderne Perrault adopted a euhemerist argument in an effort to combat what he saw as excessive regard for antique achievements; by means of this rationalist explanation for the origins of idolatry he also shifted the burden of blame away from the sculptors: 488</page><page sequence="5">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 489 Princes possessed of extraordinary virtues made their people happy. . .. They were blessed during their lifetimes, and their memory was revered by posterity, but in the course of time it was forgotten that they were men, and offerings of incense and sacrifices were made to them. The same thing happened to the men who excelled the first in the Arts and Sciences.13 Eighteenth-century texts continued to point out the linkage between sculp- ture and idolatry.14 A witty accent inflected this idea in a review of a Salon exhi- bition (1749) by Baron Louis Guillaume Baillet de Saint-Julien (active 1748-83); using Varro as source, it described the difficulty faced by the inhabitants of the island of Scycione in choosing a winner from among the three sculptors compet- ing for the opportunity to make the statues of the three muses for the Temple of Apollo: When their figures were finished they were found to be so perfect that all nine were placed in the temple. As a result, instead of the three muses formerly known, one for Poetry, another for Painting, and the last for Music, after that nine were worshipped. If the three original ones . .. owed their origin to the imagination of the poets, it must be agreed that the last six were only created by the skill of the sculptors.15 Visual artists during this period also created many works depicting the linkage between idol-worship and sculpture, matching the textual reiteration of this topos. They introduced it into scenes drawn from the Bible and the legends of the saints; in the decades around mid-eighteenth century they also derived subject matter from increasing archaeological knowledge based on such publications as Bernard de Montfaucon's Antiquite expliquee (1719) or the Recueil d'antiquitis (1756-67) by the comte de Caylus.16 Depending on the specific narratives, their works ranged from playful and amusing to dramatic and violent. Many of their images of idol-worship were selected from episodes in the Old Testament and illustrated or implied the guilty character of the rituals. The individuals or peo- ples revering the false gods were represented as having turned away from the true faith to this wicked practice. Paintings by Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665) of the Israelites worshipping the Golden Calf (c. 1633-1637) serve as a major mile- stone.17 Another biblical story, of King Solomon sacrificing to idols, was por- trayed several times by S6bastien Bourdon (1616-71) and was taken up in the eighteenth century by a number of artists. The popularity of this episode may be due to its piquancy. The text in the Old Testament (Kings, III: 11) recounts how the aged, supremely wise monarch was diverted from worshipping the true God to adoration of false idols as a result of his immoderate passion for his seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines, among whom were many foreign women. The combination of foolishness and sexuality inherent in this story was well-suited to providing amusement and also served as an ongoing affirmation of the corruptive influence of the Other, and particularly of the female Other. In a drawing (fig. 1) by Jean-Baptiste Pierre (1714-89) the aged ruler, urged on by a female companion, eagerly waves a censer before a statue of a goddess while other women participate in the rites. Some of the themes chosen by the Academie for student prize competi- tions also dealt with stories of idolatry in the Old Testament, but on a level less</page><page sequence="6">490 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 Figure 1.

Among them were Joachim, King of Judah, tearing up the book in which Jeremiah reproaches him for idolatry (1729), and Jeroboam sacrificing to idols (1752)."8 In this last competition, the Grand Prix de Peinture was won by the twenty-year-old Jean-Honore Fragonard (1732-1806).19 The com- petition theme for 1728, Ezechias destroying idolatry in his kingdom and rees- tablishing worship of the true God,20 focused on an attack on the reprehensible practice, a subject paralleled by those of still other early eighteenth-century works portraying Biblical episodes of retribution for idol-worship. In a different vein, there were also portrayals of worship offered to gods of the Greco-Roman pantheon. Often tinged with a mildly erotic tone, many of</page><page sequence="7">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 491 these were calculated to please the tastes of collectors. Numerous examples were created by artists such as Fragonard, Jean-Baptiste Greuze (1725-1805), and Clo- dion (1738-1814). More baneful and violent aspects of idol-worship in societies outside of the Judeo-Christian tradition also received attention. The Treatise on Statues (1688) by FranCois de Lembe refers to "monstrous" foreign idols, specif- ically those made in ancient Egypt, in India and Mexico, and includes remarks on the horrifying materials, such as human blood, used in creating some of them.21 The multi-volume Histoire generale des ceremonies, moeurs, et coutumes religieuses de tous les peuples du monde, compiled by the erudite abbe Antoine Banier (1673- 1741) and first appearing in 1723-37, devotes a great deal of space to the practic- es of foreign idolators.22 A considerable number of its plentiful illustrations by Bernard Picart display statues of deities; worshippers are shown with some of them (6: 16-7, 296-7, 432-3). Exotic animal-headed and multi-armed Asian fig- ures of gods are portrayed, and there are images of such practices as "various methods of drowning oneself in honor of Amida," who appears as a statue. Bloody and horrific human sacrifices to "idols of Campache, lucatan and Tabasco" are described and depicted visually (6:158-9). Guillaume de M6hegan (1721-66), in his book Origine, progres et decadence de l'idolatrie (1757), asserted that idola- try leads to all sorts of vices and crimes, as when parents "wash the altar of a hideous statue with the blood of their son."23 Paintings also incorporated the dreadful consequences of idol-worship. They were generally altarpieces in the Baroque line of grisly martyrdoms, with the statues depicted as the ultimate causes of the Christian saints' suffering. Per- haps the most gruesome example from the earlier seventeenth century is again found in a painting by Poussin: the Martyrdom of St. Erasmus (1628-1629), which features a prominent statue of Hercules whose priests try to break the resolve of the saint as he is being disemboweled.24 French artists active during the ancien regime continued to carry out commissions for altarpieces illustrating scenes of martyrdom. The refusals of the saints to worship statues of pagan gods are depicted as causing their deaths; the statue is visible in most instances. Among them are works by Charles Le Brun25 as well as the much-admired paintings by Jean-Baptiste Deshays (1729-65) of St. Andrew Condemned to Martyrdom for Refusing to Worship Idols (1759; fig. 2), and St. Victor Before the Tribunal (1761; now lost).26 In the St. Andrew, the gaunt body of the aged victim is prepared for execution while a priest of Jupiter gestures forcefully toward the statue of the god. The zig-zagging diagonals in the painting emphasize the pagan-Christian confrontation. Later works continued to take up such themes: a variant based on virtuous behavior described in an Old Testament episode appears in a painting of the Constancy of Eliezer (1787-1789), exhibited at the Salon of 1789) by Jean- Simon Berthelemy (1743-1811). Eliezer preferred death to being forced to sacri- fice to idols.27 A painting by Fragonard on a classical theme presents a different context for a scene of violent death involving an idol, in this case in a non-Christian context. A study for his reception piece, The High Priest Coresus Sacrificing Him- self to Save Callirhoe (c. 1765) in the Museum at Angers includes a somewhat hazy but prominently placed statue of Dionysos, before whom the ritual is to be performed. Fragonard eliminated it when composing his final version of the nar-</page><page sequence="8">492 EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 Figure 2.

That the pagan idol was generally envisioned as a piece of sculpture was undoubtedly the result of long-standing western European fa- miliarity with antique anthropomorphic statues of gods. The appearance of illus- trated texts, like those by Montfaucon and Banier describing religious rituals per- formed before statues, served further to stimulate this imagery. The long series of visual depictions of the veneration of pagan statues formed a counterpart to the many texts that dealt with the same subject. RELIGIOUS AND POLITICAL INTERPRETATIONS During the same decades when publications and works of art repeatedly proclaimed and explored the connections between statuary and idolatry, actual examples of sculpture came to be involved in related issues. In general, those who denounced the monuments as idolatrous were motivated by political or religious</page><page sequence="9">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 493 positions. Huguenots, Jansenists, and philosophes adopted the sculpture-idolatry linkage in order to promote their views. The religious and political dimensions of this concern with sculpture were not isolated, but instead widespread. Corre- spondingly those who commissioned public monuments responded by sponsor- ing the creation of statues that defended their politico-religious viewpoints. In his Treatise on Statues, Francois de Leme went to great lengths to exculpate the art of sculpture from the wicked practice of idol-worship; his text dwelled on antique beliefs and practices that differentiate between statues and idols. Stating that the profession of sculptor is not so worthy of blame and pro- scription as claimed by Tertullian and Lactantius, he affirmed that idols are only "afterward made of statues, in themselves completely indifferent and that be- come objects worthy of praise or execration, like the wood of which they are composed, according to their usage for impiety or for righteousness."29 Leme's treatise was dedicated to the duc de la Feuillade in recognition of his having com- missioned the pedestrian monument of Louis XIV in the Place des Victoires, Par- is. A good deal of the insistent distinction made between sculpture and idolatry in Leme's text of 1688 seems to be a response to the widespread and ongoing crit- icism of this work that had been sculpted by Martin Desjardins (1637-94), and dedicated two years earlier, in 1686. The inscription "Viro Immortali" (To the Immortal Man) located on the figure's pedestal had been met with shock and protest in many quarters: it smacked of blasphemy. A response to the work repre- sentative of many others came from Robert Challes: "the whole world has been astonished to see that to the shame of religion there are Christian souls base and impious enough to have ascribed to him the title of immortal in the monument of the place des Victoires."30 This statue served as the most concrete and blatant evidence of what has been called "the cult of the king." Numerous testimonies exist to Louis's identifi- cation with divinity: the monarch was portrayed not only in the guise of Apollo, Hercules, and St. Louis, but also as the Good Shepherd.31 French texts from the era include such extravagant phrases as "In the person of kings [God] has ... carved the most perfect characters of divinity"32 and "[sovereigns] present in their per- sons the visible divinity."33 Nicolas-Joseph Foucault, intendant of Poitou, wrote of a proposed monument to Louis XIV for Poitiers that it "should not only be an ornament for the city but that the inhabitants should also regard it as their pro- tecting god. . . ."34 This statement supported the promotion of divine status for the king, echoing phrases used in connection with earlier royal statues.35 Not only was the statue of the Place des Victoires severely criticized, but so was the ceremony of its dedication, conducted by La Feuillade. In addition to the traditional parades, speeches, music, musket salutes, fireworks, and distribu- tion of commemorative medals, the duke, according to Lemee, "dismounted from his horse .. . and saluted [the statue] with his pike. . . . The other officers of his regiment did the same."36 The account of the abb6 de Choisy presents the festiv- ities in a different light: "La Feuillade rode his horse three times around the stat- ue, at the head of the regiment of guards... and made all the prostrations that the pagans used to make before the statues of their emperors."37 It must have been to counter such interpretations of the ceremony that Lemee contrasted the enforced worship of imperial statues in antiquity with Christian usage: "the ded-</page><page sequence="10">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 ication or consecration of royal and purely honorary statues among the Christians ... did not attribute to them and still today does not attribute to them any religion and consists only in the first honors rendered to them, which are among us to greet them several times and in different manners."38 Perhaps mindful of his official position in the royal buildings administra- tion, which supervised the creation of monuments as well as of architecture, Charles Perrault-despite his proclamations of sculpture's link to idolatry-also made a point of relieving it of the responsibility for idolatrous worship: There is no art that men have abused so much, and in a more criminal manner than the Art of Sculpture. It was given to them by Heaven so that they could preserve the memory of great men and their actions .... However they have unfortunately used it to make Gods, and to give honor and worship that are only owed to the Creator to wood, to stone, and to metal. But this horrible disorder that made men so sinful must in no way be imputed to the Art itself since it was only an innocent contributor.39 The statue in the Place des Victoires was only one of a series of almost twenty monuments erected in the mid-1680s to the glory of Louis XIV. Toward the end of his reign a very different kind of public sculpture group reminded the world of his unique status. More than his predecessors or the kings who succeed- ed him, he was associated with the concept of divinity, from the very moment of his birth. His parents had been childless after more than twenty years of mar- riage, and when the queen became pregnant, Louis XIII dedicated his kingdom to the Virgin in hopes that a male heir to the throne would be born. From the time of his birth, the answer to the parental prayers had been called Louis le Dieudonne, the gift of God.40 Many years afterward, the vow of Louis XIII was commemorated in a sculpture group commissioned during the later portion of his son's reign. By then, Louis XIV was more than sixty years old, had suffered some severe health prob- lems, and had experienced military defeats and intensified political opposition. Begun in 1699 on the designs of the architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1645/6- 1708), and resumed under the direction of Robert de Cotte (1656-1735), the redecoration of the choir of Notre Dame in Paris was mainly completed more than fifteen years after its inception (fig. 3). This elaborate ensemble consisted of many statues, reliefs, and decorative elements, whose surviving parts are in Notre Dame. Among them are a marble Pieta (1712-1728) by Nicolas Coustou (1658- 1733) set in a niche behind the high altar. The kneeling figures of Louis XIII offering his crown to the Virgin (1712-1715), by Nicolas's brother Guillaume Coustou (1677-1746), and Louis XIV (1713-1715), by the Coustous' uncle An- toine Coysevox (1640-1720), flank the central group.41 The septuagenarian Lou- is XIV, not long before his death, is represented giving thanks to the Virgin for the gift of his life, while he and his father exist in the same angel-enclosed space as the holy image of salvation. This arrangement is reminiscent of the traditional inclu- sion of donor portraits with the divine figures, but those are most often found in paintings. The total tableau also suggests portrayals of Mary and Christ flanked by saints, so-called "holy conversations," in which saints who lived in different eras are juxtaposed, reminding the viewer of the eternal nature of the religious 494</page><page sequence="11">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 495 Figure 3.

The equal adulthood of the two kings, father and son, contributes to the similar timelessness of the roles they fulfill. Unlike the monument in the Place des Victoires, this ensemble was not accompanied by any inflammatory inscrip- tion and did not arouse protests. Some of the most intense criticism of the cult of Louis XIV had earlier come from the Huguenots after the king revoked the Edict of Nantes in 1685, thereby closing their churches, banishing their ministers, and effectively forcing them to abjure their religion or to flee France despite the prohibition on their leaving.42 A leader of the Huguenots, the pastor Pierre Jurieu, published many tracts protesting the Revocation and attacking the Catholic religion. In one he expresses indignation at a Catholic publication that "exaggerates the apotheosis of the King in so impious and scandalous a manner that he is compared to the true God and twelve times all the praises that the Scriptures give to the Divine Majesty are conferred upon him."43 Of the French Protestants who were convert- ed to Catholicism as a result of the Revocation Jurieu says, "as a crowd they have left the religion of Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, in order to enter that of a mortal Prince, where . . . they kneel before the idol."44 It was not only worship of the monarch to which the Protestants object- ed; it was the Catholic veneration of statues of saints, which they considered idolatrous. This claim represented a continuation of the conflict and violence occurring at the time of the Protestant Reformation. Protestant theologians de-</page><page sequence="12">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 nied the importance of worship of the saints. In response, the Council of Trent (1545-63), organized to further the Catholic Counter-Reformation, had affirmed the significance of their roles and the necessity of venerating them. The Council specifically emphasized the employment of works of art in furthering this wor- ship, so that unlike Protestant churches, those of the Catholics housed many stat- ues of saints and other holy figures. Protestant iconoclasm had caused the de- struction of large numbers of religious images, with sculpture having suffered greater damage than painting.45 Following the Revocation, Huguenot charges of idol-worship directed at the Catholics were strong and bitter: Jurieu pointed out a parallel between the present enforced conversion and the behavior of the pa- gans under the rule of Antiochus, when the Jews were forced to participate in processions and sacrifices to idols (16). He avowed that there is "nothing more contrary to the word of Jesus Christ and to the spirit of the Gospel than the worship of images,... which today comprises almost the entire devotion of the Papists," and complained, "after these holy places [the Huguenot churches] were taken away from our people, they are forced to profane this holy day [Sunday] by being dragged into temples and chapels, where idols are the main ornament, and forced to prostrate themselves before wood and stone."46 Huguenots escaping from France went to England, the Netherlands, and Germany, and from those countries came many writings attacking Catholicism together with Louis and his policies.47 One tract from England published shortly before the Revocation claimed to be a translation of "the Work undoubtedly of a French Divine; tho the author has not thought fit to set his Name to't."48 Like Jurieu's text, this Protestant example stated that: Our adversaries [fill] their Temples with the Images, not only of True, but diverse of their own Imaginary Saints,... that are the Issue only of a Superstition.... They have transferr'd God's... Praise to Graven Images .... What can be expected, but that instead of the Holy Bread of the Word of God, these pretended Fathers should give them [the worshippers] only Wood and Stone? (74) The Revocation was one tactic in the drive for centralization of power that was a prime goal of Louis XIV's regime. At the same time that the Protestants were attacking it, the king's achievement of a single religion for the entire nation was promoted in France as one of his major successes. The "destruction of here- sy" was praised in many art forms, including poetry, orations, journal texts, paint- ings, medals, and musical productions.49 Considering the Protestant attacks on idolatry, it is perhaps particularly significant that the Revocation should have been extensively celebrated in Louis XIV's France in the form of sculpture or have been associated with statues. Immediately after the event it was recorded in in- scriptions or allegorical reliefs to be placed on monuments erected to the mon- arch in many cities throughout the kingdom.50 Some of the statues portrayed the king destroying the hydra of Heresy, while other allegorical works of sculpture extolled the victory of religion without including his portrait. The bronze relief by Coysevox of Religion Triumphant Over Heresy from the pedestal of the mon- ument to Louis XIV made for the City Hall, Paris (c. 1687-9; fig. 4), is among this latter series of monuments.51 Although each of the works in this category has some individual features, they share certain major iconographic elements, among 496</page><page sequence="13">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 497 Figure 4.

This figure is derived from prescriptions for the representation of allegorical figures in the popular manual of iconology by Cesare Ripa, which had been published in a French translation, the Iconologie, in 1644. The instructions for the portrayal of "Foy Chrestienne" and "Religion" describe each as a veiled woman carrying a cross.52 The Coysevox relief also portrays an angel actively seconding her as well as the vanquished but still-frightening hydra and the erroneous books associated with the foe.53 The names on the books in the Coysevox relief are "Martin Luth- er," "Theodore de Beze" and "Bernard Occhin."54 Heresy was specifically targeted by the Society of Jesus, the monastic order founded by Ignatius Loyola to combat the effects of the Protestant Refor- mation. The Jesuits were extremely active in France, where they ran many schools, the Bourbon kings had Jesuit confessors, and members of the Society carried on effective campaigns of preaching throughout the country.55 Another of the Jesu- its' major thrusts was the extirpation of idolatry; they were devoted missionaries, carrying Catholicism to the "idol-worshipping" peoples of Asia and the Ameri- cas. An altar in the large chapel dedicated to the canonized Loyola in the church of II Gesui, the order's mother house in Rome, celebrated these two fronts on which the Jesuits actively furthered their religion. The San Ignazio chapel was designed in 1695 by Andrea Pozzo, and groups of larger-than-life figures were</page><page sequence="14">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 commissioned at that time for each side of its altar; both were completed in 1699. The two sculptors were French-born and both had been in residence at the French Academy in Rome. The group by Pierre II Legros represents Religion Triumphant Over Heresy (fig. 5); its counterpart, by Jean-Baptiste Theodon, is of Faith Crushing Idolatry (fig. 6).56 The two groups have much in common, and also share a great many features with the Revocation reliefs including the example by Coysevox.57 The combat against idol-worshipping religions is imaged in forms very similar to those used in portraying the struggle against the Protestant heresy. Religion and Faith, each a voluminously robed, hooded woman, stand at the summits of the group- ings, above their conquered antagonists. Each woman is assisted by a cherub; Religion holds a cross similar to the one in the relief by Coysevox and, like the angel in that relief, she wields a shaft of lightning. Faith raises a chalice, while her cherub-assistant brandishes the lightning bolt. A serpent or dragon writhes around the lower portion of each work. The semi-nude male figure entangled with the reptilian coils and tumbled at the bottom of most of these works possesses fea- tures of the figure of Sin as described in the manual by Ripa: a blind and nude young man with serpents wrapped tightly around the middle of his body (1: 144- 5). The relief by Coysevox and the two groups in the Gesu accompany the male figure with an old woman recoiling in terror from the triumphant figures of Reli- gion and Faith. Suggesting Ripa's image of Heresy as nude, the old women in these sculptures are only partially draped and those in the works by Coysevox and Legros have the dishevelled hair that Ripa described (1:157). As in the relief by Coysevox, both of the groups in the Gesu include the books that represent the erroneous beliefs coming under attack: in Legros's embodiment of the destruction of heresy the cherub is tearing the pages out of a volume labelled "Zwingli," and those under the defeated figures carry the names "Luther" and "Calvin," while in Th6odon's group the book under the serpent's head lists the names of Far Eastern religions on its spine.58 As pendants, the two sculptures in the Gesiu understandably share simi- larities of composition and conception. The only elements differentiating the group by Th6odon concerned with idol-worship from its companion are the names on the book and the non-Caucasian faces of the two figures below Faith. There is no reflection of Ripa's description of Idolatry as a kneeling woman swinging a censer before a brass statue of a bull (2: 158), nor is there any portrayal of an idol. No object resembling a statue represents the false religion to be combatted by faith. The two groups instead, with their large size and prominent placement, embody a proclamation of the efficacy of sculpture in assuring the triumph of the true reli- gion. They serve as a resounding response to the Protestant charge of Catholic idol-worship, demonstrating both the defeat of Protestant theology and also that idolatry exists only among peoples of distant lands who can even themselves be brought to recognize Christianity. Fifty years later, the Jesuits again affirmed the positive value of sculpture in the combat against idolatry. They commissioned Jean-Joseph Vinache (1696-1754) to sculpt Faith Destroying Idolatry, for place- ment in the chapel of St. Francis Xavier in their church in Paris. The plaster by Vinache (fig. 7), of which a terracotta version was exhibited in the salon of 1745, differs from all the previous reliefs and groups in the greater specificity of some of 498</page><page sequence="15">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 499 Figure 5.

The broken remains of architecture represent the destroyed temples of the idol-worshippers, and the head and upper body of an idol are clearly to be seen at the bottom center of the grouping, in the location where the earlier allegorical works had placed snakes. The Salon livret includes a note that this idol is from the Indies.59 The reference to such a distant locale, also seen in the idol's exotic headdress, suggests that the purpose of this work is celebration of the Jesuits' missionary efforts in non-European lands. Countering the critics of Jesuit practice, it is intended to make very clear the concept that idolatry is the practice of faraway peoples, and 500</page><page sequence="17">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien Regime France 501 thus has nothing to do with Catholic worship. As in the case of the groups in Rome by Legros and Theodon, the Jesuits again chose to employ the medium of sculpture for this work in order to underscore the legitimacy of its use in their service. It was not only the French Protestants who leveled charges of idolatry against Catholic worship. The austere and ascetic Jansenist branch of French Catholicism made similar accusations.60 Relentless foes of the Jesuits, the mem- bers of this group deplored the lavish and dramatic Baroque forms of visual art adopted for display in Jesuit churches.61 A Jansenist document of 1728 denounced the "idolatries committed by common Christians and even by some from more distinguished [social] stations, who believe that after burning a candle in front of a stone or marble statue they have done the best action possible to do."62 By the mid-eighteenth century, philosophes and their supporters were also making use of the connection between idolatry and sculpture in order to further their agendas. In a review of the Salon of 1753, the early art critic Lafont de Saint-Yenne de- plored the idol-worship of the ancients. He applauded the waning of idolatry by his own era, when "reason has.. . finally arrived... at its perfection in the last century and this one" and referenced Voltaire and d'Alembert in a note.63 In 1757, Voltaire submitted an entry on "Idole, Idolitre, Idolitrie" to d'Alembert for inclusion in the Encyclopedie, and also published it in 1764 in the Dictionnaire philosophique.64 The essay presents his version of the established topos that the sculptors had created the gods. Incorporating an anecdote reminis- cent of the fable by La Fontaine, he revealed its source: Horace makes a statue of Priapus speak, saying "I was formerly the trunk of a fig-tree; a carpenter not knowing whether he should make me into a god or a bench, finally decided to make me a god ...." The same can be said of all statues: from a block of marble a basin can be drawn as well as a figure of Alexander or of Jupiter. ... Are a throne, an altar less venerated because the workman could have instead made a kitchen table?65 Contrast Voltaire's designation of the artist with La Fontaine's, who had referred to the creator of the idol as "sculptor." Voltaire instead qualifies him as a "car- penter" (after Horace) or a "workman." This makes the origin of the venerated "deity" appear all the more ludicrous; if such people created the gods, as had long been alleged, then the gods had been the products of individuals from a low so- cio-educational level. In the same article, Voltaire repeatedly juxtaposed the forms of Greek and Roman worship with the Christian practices of his own culture. His ostensi- ble goal was to prove that the ancients were not idol-worshipers. But that they instead venerated the actual gods who were merely represented by the statues, but the effect of his words was the reverse, serving to demonstrate the idolatrous character of contemporary religious observances. Having ingenuously asked how the ancient peoples regarded the false divinities in their temples, he answered, the same way ... as we look at the images of the true objects of our veneration. The error was not in adoring a piece of wood or of marble, but in adoring a false divinity represented by that wood and by that</page><page sequence="18">EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY STUDIES 38 / 3 marble. The difference between them and us is not that they had images, and that we don't have any, that they prayed before images, and that we don't; the difference is that their images were of fantastic beings in a false religion, while ours are of real beings in a true religion .... The Romans and the Greeks knelt before statues, gave them crowns, incense, flowers, paraded them in triumph in public squares; we have sanctified these customs, and we are certainly not idolaters.66 Voltaire characteristically blamed the priesthood for the promotion of idol-vener- ation: "the priests attached the most possible divinity to their statues in order to be given more offerings."''67 Voltaire voiced this ironic attitude toward the established national reli- gion at about the same time as the publication, in 1757, of the Origine, progres et decadence de l'idolatrie by Guillaume de M6hegan. Apostate abb6 turned philos- ophe, M6h6gan also proclaimed that reason and true religion had come to pre- vail, so that idolatry was gone (203-4). His book proposed a euhemerist ap- proach much like that in Perrault's Parallele of more than sixty years earlier. Referring to leaders who procured great benefits for their societies, Meh6gan stated that after their deaths superb tombs were erected for them, accompanied by their statues: "these tombs were little by little converted into kinds of temples. . . . Any movement makes men, especially unsophisticated ones, imagine that the spirits attached to the ashes somehow remain with them, and still dwell in the same places."68 Ultimately the statues are brought out of the tombs, the images are changed into gods, and altars are raised to them.69 Sculpture plays a major role in his view of the beginnings of idolatry, with the tomb statues of respected leaders transformed into gods. It appears that this allegation was part of an effort to desacralize the political leaders to whom he referred in the abstract, but who may well have represented more specific recent and contemporary rulers.70 Having spent a year in the Bastille as a result of one of his publications, he advised that philosophical speculations be "revealed with prudence." Under the partial veil that he recommended as necessary to cover the truth71 can be glimpsed his contribution to the multi-pronged movement toward removal of the aura of divinity from the monarchy. Dramatically merging politi- cal with religious idols, he claimed that "idolatry had become allied with the constitution of nations. Time had made of it a kind of foundation of empires," and it received "the most marked protection" from them.72 "The spirit of domi- nation found powerful means in it. The superstition of the people was a sure way of holding them in the chains forged for them."73 Like Voltaire, M6h6gan was among those who saw sculpture as a neces- sary accompaniment to idolatry, with attacks on it thus emanating from among the philosophes as well as from the Jansenists and earlier from the Protestants. It appears that a number of French citizens during much of the ancien regime con- ceived of sculptural monuments as tainted by undesirable associations on politi- cal or religious grounds, or on both. CONCLUSION It has been noted on a number of occasions that the sculpture produced in France from the later seventeenth century through much of the eighteenth is as 502</page><page sequence="19">WEINSHENKER / Idolatry and Sculpture in Ancien R6gime France 503 a rule more traditional and less innovative, in terms of style, form, and subject matter, than the painting of the same period. It has thus seemed less worthy of attention. While the observation of its conservative nature is generally accurate, this viewpoint has not taken account of a different kind of importance inherent in so much of the sculptural production: its role as a public art. In this capacity sculpture was present in the consciousness of the educated members of society, who were aware of texts dealing with it as well as with ancient and modern statuary, but also in that of the population as a whole. As an inescapable part of the daily environment, it served as a constant series of reminders of the power of the first two Estates. The coupling of sculpture with idol-worship, that was devel- oped throughout the period, and the range of forms that it took-literary, artistic, political, and religious-reflect some of the deepest tensions in the society. The mass destruction of sculpture at the time of the Revolution: royal monuments, church decoration, and tombs, was an iconoclastic movement, the outcome of the recognition of their idolatrous status.

David Mitchell, The Jesuits: A History (New York: Franklin Watts, 1981) refers to Theodore Beza (1519-1605) as a Huguenot spokesman (91) and describes Bernardino Ochino (1487-1564) as Vicar-General of the Capuchins who was converted to Protestantism (41). 55.

"Horace fait parler une statue de Priape: il lui fait dire: j'etois autrefois un tronc de figuier; un charpentier ne sachant s'il feroit de moi un dieu ou un banc, se determina enfin a me faire dieu. ... On en peut dire autant de toutes les statues: on peut d'un bloc de marbre tirer tout aussi bien une cuvette, qu'une figure d'Alexandre ou de Jupiter.... Un trone, un autel en sont-ils moins reveres, parce que l'ouvrier en pouvoit faire une table de cuisine?" The text to which Voltaire refers is Horace, Satires, Book I, Satire 8, 11. 1-3. 66. Encyclopdie, 8: 500-1. "Du meme oeil... que nous voyons les images des vrais objets de notre veneration. L'erreur n'6toit pas d'adorer un morceau de bois ou de marbre, mais d'adorer une fausse divinite represente par ce bois &amp; par ce marbre. La difference entre eux &amp; nous n'est pas qu'ils eussent des images, &amp; que nous n'en ayons point; qu'ils aient fait des prieres devant des imag- es, &amp; que nous n'en faisions point: la difference est que leurs images figuroient des etres fantastiques dans une religion fausse, &amp; que les notres figurent des etres reels dans une religion veritable .... Mais les Romains &amp; les Grecs se mettoient a genoux devant les statues, leur donnoient des cou- ronnes, de l'encens, des fleurs, les promenoient en triomphe dans les places publiques: nous avons sanctifi6 ces coutumes, &amp; nous ne sommes point idoldtres." 67.
