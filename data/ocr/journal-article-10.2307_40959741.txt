Introduction The process of evolution is largely absent from philosophical legal literature, to the extent that the possibility of a genetic origin of rights has not been explored. A possible reason for this is that rights theory has focussed on 'human' rights while Darwin's theory of natural selection applies to nature, or humans, animals and plants. As a result, the idea that behaviour which has led to the creation of a legal system of rights could have a biological basis has not been studied by biologists or jurists, although recently such proposals are emerging.

Furthermore, the existence of legal practices which correspond to human rights throughout the world, and from the earliest evidence of social organization, would suggest common psychological processes which could have their root in genetics. On the surface it may seem desirable to link rights to genetic research, providing a stable and universal source or justification. However, attempts to explain rights in terms of biological processes could undermine criticism of genetic research and risk subordinating rights-based analysis to a problematic scientific endeavour. Section 2 traces the emerging congruence between human rights and genetic research, characterizing this view as 'law as evolution'. It also introduces the discourse on 'geneticization', or the questioning of the production of genetic truths beyond the framework of bioethics. Section 3 looks to the drafting history of two major international instruments, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Nuremberg Charter of the International Military Tribunal, and investigates the role the concept of nature has played in the foundation of international law. The section asks whether there are doctrinal underpinnings that justify an evolutionary approach to legal theory. Section 4 describes research in evolutionary psychology, which seeks explanations for human behaviour through evolutionary processes, including theories of cooperation and justice. Criticism of deterministic conclusions, notably over-reliance on genetic markers over the environment, is stressed. Section 5 isolates violence as a problematic area of genetic research, investigating the role of the 1986 UNESCO Seville Statement on Violence which sought to counter growing research into the biological origins of violent behaviour. It also engages further with geneticization critiques as a means of highlighting the socio- cultural conditions under which such research is operating. Overall, the article stresses that it is inevitable that human rights, with its focus on individual protection mirroring the ascent of the individual and subsequently the gene as the unit of natural selection, will become a focussed subject of evolutionary biology, probably through psychological study. However, it also presents the underlying philosophical arguments that reflect the need to locate genetic research within a broader understanding of social conditions and power structures. It is argued that if law is to become a subject of evolutionary study, it should maintain its independence from genetic research by extending beyond the boundaries of bioethics. 2. Law as Evolution Conor Gearty notes that 'the great breakthrough in equality was achieved by Charles Darwin'.2 Yet Darwin's theory of natural selection is largely absent 2 Conor Gearty, 'The Holism of Human Rights: Linking Religion, Ethics and Public Life' (2004) 6 EHRLR 605-9, 608.</page><page sequence="3">autumn 2010 Survival of the Fairest 469 from jurisprudential considerations of the meaning or origins of law or human rights. For example, Shestack's survey of 'sources of human rights' lists religion, natural law, positivism, Marxism, sociology, utility, justice, dignity, culture and equality, all as potential sources, with no role for natural selection.3 Any brief overview of texts on jurisprudence, or the philosophy of law, will find that Darwin is rarely, if ever, mentioned. While much of jurisprudential thinking pre-dates The Origin of Species (1859), other disciplines have synchronized earlier thought with evolutionary theory. Indeed much of biology pre-dates Darwin, but this has evidently not prevented it adapting to his theory. Richard Dawkins has strongly attested that all attempts to answer the moral question of how humans ought to live and act, prior to 1859, are 'just plain wrong',4 yet it is apparent that legal scholarship has not attempted to discuss the potential origin of law as an evolutionary strategy. While the explanatory philosophies of law exclude evolution, there is a growing branch of legal study on the contemporary interaction between law and evolution.5 As traditional considerations of ethics cede to legal regulations, national and international rules governing scientific behaviour are growing. The intervention and manipulation of the genetic heritage of the individual through gene-therapy, or other practices such as patenting genetically modified plants and animals, raise juridical and ethical problems.6 These issues of bioethics, or biojurisprudence,7 are already amounting to a considerable volume of legal process and discussion. At the regional level, the Council of Europe has enacted a Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine,8 and at the international level, UNESCO's Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights (UDHGHR) recognizes the need for regulation of biological practice through international law.9 This growing area of research can be distinguished, much as law in literature has distinguished itself from law as literature when these two disciplines first began to explore common territory. Law in literature is concerned with representations of law in literature, through books like Kafka's The Trial, while law as literature applies existing literary techniques, such as deconstruction, to legal criticism.10 In regard to evolution, law and evolution (perhaps a more 3 Jerome Shestack, 'The Philosophic Foundations of Human Rights' (1998) 20 Hum Rts Q 201-34, 205-33. 4 Richard Dawkins, The Selfish Gene (OUP, Oxford 1989) 267.

Law as evolution asks whether post-World War II international law, as represented through the development of individual rights and responsibility, could be viewed as a process of evolution and indeed could be said to have genetic origins. This latter branch would necessarily subordinate human rights to evolutionary processes, and would seek genetic explanations of rights-based systems and behaviour. A recent research paper by Edwin Fruehwald makes this link between evolution and rights, outlining a 'biological basis of rights'.11 The argument is that rights 'come not from God or externally from nature, but from human behaviour - how our minds evolved'.12 He quotes Bernd Graefrath, who believes that 'complex aspects of human culture [can] be explained by the mechanism of evolution that consists in differential copying success of genes'.13 Fruehwald proposes that rights can be based on anthropomorphic truths, with the fundamentals of rights derived from how our brains reacted to different geography, ecology and social conditions that affected survival. Natural selection can be the source of rights.14 This proposal fits within an overall pattern of research into the evolutionary origins of justice.15 Prima facie the parallels between law and natural selection are apparent. As Darwin observes as a starting point, natural selection operates at the level of the individual, not at the level of the species or genus. That legal and political philosophy also led to the conclusion that the individual possessed inherent rights echoes the biological process. Pound has pointed out that the history of law could be written largely as an increasing recognition of individual rights.16 Van Dyke traces the 'atomistic individualism' found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and related Covenants, which, with the exception of the right of 'peoples' to self-determination, do not grant collective rights to groups such as minorities.17 Even Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), which expressly sets out the rights of ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities, confines those rights to 'persons belonging to such minorities', or individuals as members of such groups. The wording of the UDHR and the international bill of rights seems to preclude the granting of legal status to groups qua groups, and a 11 Edwin S Fruehwald, 'A Biological Basis of Rights', Hofra University Legal Studies Research Paper 9/17 &lt;http://papers.ssm.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=l 440247 &gt; accessed 9 April 2010. 12 Ibid.

Group selection was an important explanation for cooperative behaviour put forward in the 1960s, associated with Wynne-Edwards, an ornithologist who advocated through observations of rooks that individual interests could be subordinated to the interests of the community. His argument was that rook flocks rather than individual rooks compete with each other.20 This proposition was proven to be false among animals, whereby very few ever put the interests of the group or the species before the individual. Animals were better off in herds because it provided safety from predators, but this was still at the level of the individual.21 Ridley distinguishes between individual behaviour within a group (what he calls 'groupishness') and group behaviour: Group selection occurs when individuals cooperate against their own self-interest but in the interest of the group ... All we have identified in human beings is a powerful tendency to be groupish in the pursuit of individual goals, not evidence of putting groups before individuals. A mind that has been selected to gain the advantages of living in groups is not the same as a mind that has evolved by group selection. Groupishness can enhance individual selection - but that is not group selection . . . preferring the morality of group selection to the ruthlessness of individual struggle is to prefer genocide over murder.22 Inherent or inalienable rights could be perceived as the evolutionary logic of law. The universality of rights and the universality of genes may implicate the two. There is evidence of behaviour which corresponds to rights in all human societies. Shestack sees a 'universal cultural receptivity' to such fundamental rights as freedom from torture, slavery, arbitrary execution, due process of law and freedom of movement.23 Brown, an anthropologist, saw hundreds of universal behavioural traits in some form in all societies, some of which correspond to legal rights, and which he believed to be biological.24 Finnis notes: All human societies show a concern for the value of human life ... in none is the killing of other human beings permitted without some fairly definite 18 Ibid 741. 19 Nigel Rodley, 'Conceptual Problems in the Protection of Minorities: International Legal Developments', (1995) 17 Hum Rts Q 48-71, 64, citing UNGA, Declaration on the Rights of Persons Belonging to Ethnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities (18 December 1992) UN Doc A/RES/47/135. 20 Matt Ridley, The Origins of Virtue fVikine, London 1996Ì 176. 21 Ibid. 22 Ibid 188.

In all societies there is some prohibition of incest, some opposition to boundless promiscuity and rape, some favour for stability and permanence in sexual relations. All human societies display a concern for truth, [and] all societies display a favour for the values of cooperation, of common over individual good, of obligation between individuals, and of justice within groups ... All display a concern for powers or principles which are to be respected as suprahuman.25 Lauren describes 'thoughtful and insightful visionaries [who] in many different times and places have seen . . . rights or fundamental claims by persons to obtain just treatment as stemming from nature itself'.26 The title of Lauren's book is The Evolution of International Human Rights, and many other authors speak metaphorically of human rights in terms of evolution. Perhaps there are also empirical biological or evolutionary markers analogous to certain identi- fiable rights. As Fruehwald argues, the fundamentals of rights derived from how our brains evolved while the details of rights arose from environmental factors in varying cultures.27 Darwin's theory of evolution was developed without knowledge of genetics, and the subsequent 20th century fusion of evolution and genetics has come to be known in biology as the 'great synthesis'.28 Antoinette Rouvroy provides a reading of the dangers inherent in the rise of genetics as a new perceptual regime, what she terms the 'geneticization' of society.29 The word refers to the ways in which the science of genetics is influencing medicine in particular and society in general.30 Popular faith in genetics has proven extraordinarily resilient in light of the modest practical impact it has had. Rouvroy begins by pointing out that representations of what we call our genes are at least partly linguistic fictions. The idea of the gene predated its material discovery, with Wilhelm Johannson the first to use the term in 1909. The reification of the concept of the gene did not take place until genes became defined as sequences localizable in chromosomes, and the double-helical structure of the DNA molecule was discovered by Crick and Watson in 1952.31 The subsequent Human Genome Project, the most commercially driven science project in history, has claimed to offer a 'blueprint' on the information that makes us 25 John Finnis, Natural Law and Natural Rights (Clarendon Press, Oxford 1980) 83-4. 26 Paul Gordon Lauren, The Evolution of International Human Rights (U Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia 2003) 1. 27 Fruehwald (n 11).

Discussions of legal, ethical and social issues around human genome research employ received metaphors as if they were true, with no questioning of the nature of genocentric belief or the privileging of genetics over the rest of biology, including the environment. There is a presumption that genetics only discovers pre-existing truths when it is also creating new truths. The Human Genome Project enjoys an 'a priori positive perception of scientific purity that silences questions concerning the way they have come to control the framing of enquiries about human nature and biology'.41 The encroachment of this frame of reference into the realm of human rights is apparent. The existence of a universal system of rights is leading to theories of how that system can be understood in terms of genetic self-promotion. 32 Ibid 17. 55 Ibid 19. ™ Ibid 20-1. 35 Ibid 21. 36 Ibid 22.

The embracing of genocentric representations by the law results in the concept of identity being mainly defined in biological rather than in social terms.42 The title of the UDHGHR mirrors the 'universal' reach of the UDHR, emphasizing the supposed link between universal rights and the human genome. These documents could lead to an understanding that universal rights somehow derive from universal genes, freeing genetic research from founda- tional questions as to its function and meaning. Arnhart asks: 'how can there be human rights if there is no human nature?'43 As the search for the biological basis of rights begins, the role of the concept of nature in international law will come under increased scrutiny. The question is whether the 20th-century relevance of the individual, rather than the state, as the holder of rights and responsibilities in international law, grew as an organic reflection of our genetic composition. There is no reference to evolution in any international law document, but it can be read into the interpretation of nature that has seen major advances in terms of individual protection against the state. 3. Nature in International Law Tuck traces the emergence of the natural rights doctrine to Hugo Grotius, who he considers to provide the first reconstruction of a legal system in terms of rights rather than laws.44 Grotius is considered a founder of an emergent international law, with natural law an authority for the international system.45 In Introduction to the Jurisprudence of Holland, Grotius embraced rights as the necessary subject-matter of justice, and 'rights have since come to usurp the whole of natural law theory, for the law of nature is simply, respect one another's rights'.46 The renaissance of natural rights theory is reflected in the UDHR 1948,47 as evident from its opening statement: 'recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world'. The spirit and philosophy of the UDHR is focused on the individual rather than the state, leading Martenson to describe it as 'fundamentally 42 Ibid 99. 43 Arnhart (n 24) 157. ** Tuck (n 1) 66. 45 Henry Sumner Maine, Ancient Law (John Murray, London, 1866, reprinted by Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick, NT 2002) 100. 46 Tuck (n 1) 66, 67. 47 UNGA, Universal Declaration of Human Rights (10 December 1948).</page><page sequence="9">autumn 2010 Survival of the Fairest 475 supra-national or ... pre-national', a status apparent in the change of its title by the General Assembly from an 'international' to a 'universal' declaration.48 Article 1 UDHR reads: 'All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in the spirit of brotherhood'. Lindholm analyses the drafting process of Article 1, highlighting its philosophical nature and the resulting view that, if it were to be included, such a statement would be better placed in the Preamble. For example, Bogomolov (Soviet Union) in the Working Group considered the then Draft Article 1 to have a 'pompous and ridiculous effect', asking for its deletion.49 A roll-call vote that the draft Article 1 be transferred to the Preamble was eventually defeated, with Cassin (France) noting that such a move would have upset the whole concept of the declaration, leading 'public opinion' to conclude that the UN General Assembly 'had been afraid to proclaim its ideals'.50 Draft Article 1 in the report of the Commission to the Economic and Social Council read in its second sentence: 'They are endowed by nature with reason and conscience . . . '51 The word 'reason' had been added to Cassin's first draft by Malik (Lebanon) while 'conscience' was proposed by Chang (China), who explained it as a rendition of a Chinese notion of 'two-man-mindedness', the English equivalent of which might be 'sympathy'.52 The locution 'by nature' is explained as probably having been added by Cassin and Romulo (Philippines) acting as a team.53 It was not intended to imply that human beings were endowed with reason and conscience by some entity beyond themselves. However, a Brazilian amendment seemed to emphasize this interpretation, calling for a re-wording which would include the phrase 'created in the image and likeness of God. . . '54 De Wiart (Belgium) took this proposal to have been triggered by the 'nature' aspect of the draft, and warned that the words could be ambiguous and lead to long philosophical arguments. Deleting the words 'by nature' would mean that the draft could find general acceptance. Chang (China) reinforced this view, arguing that the phrase presented metaphysical problems in its association with Western Christianity and civilization. Brazil withdrew its amendment, and Belgium's proposal, that the words 'by nature' be deleted from Draft Article 1, was carried.55 48 Jan Martenson, 'The Preamble of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights' in Asbjorn Eide (ed), The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: A Commentary (Scandinavian UP, Oslo 1992) 17-30, 20. The proposal for the tide came from the French delegation, following a Haitian resolution calling for an affirmation of the universal character of the declaration of human rights.

In this regard it can be contrasted with the 'admirable and pioneering' Virginia Declaration of Rights 1776, which drew directly from natural rights foundations and contract theory. While Article 1 UDHR is partly cast on classic natural rights predecessors, its drafting history portrays an explicit rejection of appeals to divinity, nature, reason or self-evidence.60 The advantage is that in years to come, human rights issues may to a considerable extent turn on their cross-cultural intelligibility and justifiability, which is supported by the open-ended combination of moral and socio-historical rationales provided by Article I.61 Johannes Morsink questions certain assumptions in the phrasing of the preamble and Article 1 UDHR. He begins by acknowledging the linguistic similarities between natural rights philosophy and the UDHR, noting that Article 1 is almost identical to the first article of the French Declaration.62 In this regard he assesses the meaning of the terms 'nature' and 'reason' as used by 19th century Enlightenment philosophers such as Paine, Locke, Rousseau and Jefferson. These thinkers interchangeably appealed to God, nature and reason, with the secular members of this triad, nature and reason, also capitalized in writings of the time. Thus 'Nature' and 'Reason' were kept in proximity to 'God' as the secularism involved was 'of a rather mixed kind'.63 The American founding fathers appealed to the 'laws of Nature and of Nature's God', the 'Supreme Judge of the world' and 'divine Providence', while the French declaration, although more secular in tone, also juxtaposed God and Nature, referring to 'natural rights' in the presence of the 'Supreme Being'.64 56 Iindholm Cn 49) 47. 57 Iindholm (n 49) 50. 58 Ibid. 59 Ibid 51. 60 Ibid 52. 61 Ibid. 62 Johannes Morsink, The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Origins, Drafting and Intent (U Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia 1999) 281. 63 Ibid 282. 64 Ibid.</page><page sequence="11">autumn 2010 Survival of the Fairest 477 Morsink discusses the drafting process of Article 1 UDHR with the reference to 'nature' in the early draft perceived as a possible substitute for God. A later interview with the drafter Malik revealed that it was indeed Romulo who had introduced the phrase £by nature', and who had intended it to refer to Christian natural law theory. The removal of the phrase was a bargain to avoid a reference to God.65 This does not mean that the drafters saw no connection between human rights and human nature. The words 'inherent', 'inalienable' and 'born' add up to what Morsink terms an 'inherence view of human rights'.66 There is evidence that the deletion of the phrase 'by nature' was a trade-off to ensure the UDHR remained a secular document. Latin American states just a few months earlier had voted for the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man, which speaks of the 'essential rights of man', and included in its first recital the phrase 'by nature endowed with reason and conscience'. This phrase was not objected to in Bogota, yet those same Latin American states voted against the phrase in the reading of the UDHR. The motivation in the UDHR was to avoid a debate on God, but these states often made clear their continued belief in the link between human rights and human nature. The Uruguayan delegation voted to delete 'by nature' but stressed that 'rights were derived from the nature of man'.67 Morsink's 'inherence view' is that while 'nature' was removed from the text, the drafters clearly still saw a connection. He holds that this view conflicts with Lindholm's interpretation, which is that the UDHR does not connect human nature and human rights as a result of the debates on Article 1 presenting future generations with a 'metaphysical clean slate'.68 Instead the drafters assigned inherent or 'extra- legal' moral rights which are not the result of extraneous acts of governments, legislatures or courts.69 In a reverse of their presentation, the Preamble and Article 1 were not drafted and discussed until the rest of the document was in place. The drafters had no need for examples or references from the Enlightenment thinkers. The cause of world peace provided sufficient justification for the proclamation of a universal system of human rights. Indeed Cassin found that the violation of human rights in one nation could in fact be a preliminary attack on the independence of other nations.70 Nevertheless, and regardless of consequences for world peace, the rights in the UDHR have an independent grounding and are possessed as birthrights. If this were not so, a government could torture or violate any other right as long as it were shown to serve the cause of world 65 Ibid 284-5. 66 Ibid 290. 67 Ibid. 68 Ibid 294. 69 Ibid 295. 70 Ibid 319.</page><page sequence="12">478 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies vol. 30 peace. This is precisely how governments often justify human rights violations.71 Morsink argues for greater recognition of the UDHR as the 'mother of more than 200 regional and international human rights instruments', with a profound moral impact that requires contemporary theorists to be held accountable to their founding document.72 He calls for engagement with the metaphysical origins of the UDHR, instead of imprisoning human rights in the political or juridical sphere. Activists need to explain and defend the universality of human rights. In particular he underlines that rights have a quasi-scientific validity: 'the great majority of the drafters of the blue booklet [the UDHR] believed that just as a scientist in a California research lab can make a discovery that is valid the world over, so the rights in this booklet are possessed by all people everywhere'.73 He locates his argument for universality in an inherence doctrine rooted in metaphysics. It has two complementary theses: the first is that people everywhere have rights that are not man-made but inherent in the human person; the second is epistemological, in that people can come to know in a natural manner that they have the moral birthrights spoken of in the first universality thesis. The first is broadly intimated by the concepts of 'inalien- ability' or 'inherence' and the second by 'reason' and 'conscience'. He detects a deliberate asymmetry between rights and duties in the UDHR. The drafters were not overly concerned with identifying duty-bearing agents for the implementation of human rights, because rights-holders and duty-bearers ought to be distinguished.74 The Declaration is in fact a 'detailed map of the realm of moral rights without giving us similar details about the realm of duties that correlate with these rights'.75 The 'fallacy of implementation' is that without practices to implement human rights, they do not exist. This is to ignore the ontological distinction between the proclamation of inherent human rights and the construction of an international system for their realization.76 Human rights are rights that people have by virtue of their humanity or nature.77 There are two paths charted by the UDHR towards the recovery of inherent human rights; reason and conscience. Human rights were not created in 1948 but rather, as the UN Charter states, 'reiterated'. One UDHR drafter described it as a 'major expression of human conscience'.78 The elaboration of rights in the past 60 years can be viewed as 'the conscience of humanity stirring in people everywhere and prodding them to set up these [rights] regimes'.79 71 Ibid 320. 72 Ibid 4.

The Allies ratified the London Agreement on 8 August 1945, appending the Charter of the International Military Tribunal (IMT) for the Trial of the Major War Criminals, which identified 'crimes against humanity' in its Article 6(c) as: murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, and other inhumane acts com- mitted against any civilian population, before or during war, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds in execution of or in connection with any crime within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, whether or not in violation of the domestic law of the country where perpetrated. It was the first instance in which 'crimes against humanity' was identified and defined.81 The principal technical problem faced by the drafters of the IMT Charter was that the acts deemed 'crimes against humanity' were either commanded or justified pursuant to the Führerprinzip) at the time considered a valid legal defence under customary international law, raising the question of the retroactivity of criminal laws as a violation of the 'principles of legality'.82 Bassiouni argues that no specific positive international criminal law on such acts existed in 1945, as the facts that gave rise to 'crimes against humanity' were too barbarous or momentous to foresee - 'they were so unlawful in nature, the law had simply not referred to such atrocities specifically'.83 By contrast the Swiss jurist Jean Graven believes that crimes against humanity are as old as humanity itself.84 International law evolved out of state consensus, and by 1945 there was a sharp divide between a view of international law as superior to national law and international law as a mere product of states' will. A prevalent position was that sovereign states were only bound by obligations they freely and voluntarily assumed.85 Rights emerged under international law with the necessary implication that the individual was a subject of such a body of law.86 The Nuremberg trials recognized that individuals and not just states are responsible for violations of human dignity. They started the process of the international protection of individuals from the abuses of their own governments.87 80 Ibid 58. 81 M Cherif Bassiouni, Crimes Aeainst Humanitv in International Criminal Law CKluwer.

The drafting debates on Article 6(c) were either not reported or did not take place, so the original philosophical justifications or intent behind the provision are not apparent.89 Bassiouni suggests that this was deliberate, so as to avoid handing the defence any unnecessary advantages.90 These debates must have recognized the 'threshold' at which international law stood, characterized as 'between law and morality', where to uphold strict legal positivism would be to give greater weight to a legal theory than the substantive harmful outcome of a gross abuse of power.91 In choosing to follow morality through natural reasoning, the Tribunal did not reference Grotius but was 'certainly moved by the same philosophical conception' that certain truths remain immutable throughout time.92 According to Bassiouni: the issue was whether the laws under which these crimes, positively defined by the Charter after the fact, were only the positive embodiment of pre-existing unwritten law, and thus legally valid, or simply an exercise in ex post facto victor's vengeance, which would be legally invalid. If one adopts a naturalist view, it would be undisputable that a higher law existed which prohibited what occurred. Consequently the Charter would be valid positive law embodying the higher law which overrides any contrary positive law, in this case the laws of Germany.93 This laicized naturalist philosophy was developed by the Charter drafters out of pragmatism rather than doctrinal purity, as a common ground for the differing legal traditions and backgrounds. The debate around the Charter is whether it was declarative of existing international law which had not yet been formally recognized, or innovative in its elaboration of a new category of international crimes. The absence of pre-existing positive law affirming 'crimes against humanity' means that for strict positivists, Article 6(c) is an innovative provision in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws. This position has been characterized as 'juridical schizophrenia caused by the separation of the brain of the lawyer from that of the human being'.94 All other philosophical 88 Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, 'Trial of Major German War Criminals' (Cmd 6964, 1946^17) 4L 89 Bassiouni (n 81) 31. 90 Ibid: 'It is logical to assume that an extended record of discussions would have been beneficial to the defense, ergo, the absence of any record that would have supported the defense's contentions in any way, even after the proceedings'. 91 Ibid 108. 92 Ibid 109. 93 Ibid 103, 107. ** Joseph Keenan and Brendan Brown, Crimes Against International Law (Public Attairs lJress, Washington 1950) v-vi.</page><page sequence="15">autumn 2010 Survival of the Fairest 481 views would seem to invalidate post-1935 Nazi laws which mandated Article 6(c) acts.95 The Charter can be viewed as 'recognizing the evolutionary nature of international law'.96 The Nuremberg Charter and UDHR present nature as a central notion to the allocation of rights or responsibilities beyond the sphere of existing positive law. Although neither document refers to 'nature', both rely on a secular model of natural or inherent rights and responsibilities. Both documents repressed their debt to a legal understanding of nature for practical reasons, but its trace is still there in the drafting history or commentaries. This early role of nature in the development of contemporary international legal institutions, and the heritage of natural law and natural rights reasoning, will attract researchers who are studying the genetic origins of behaviour in areas such as morality and justice. The human rights discourse has repeatedly seen claims for the source of inalienable rights as stemming from human dignity,97 or universality, or self-evidence, or other traits or characteristics that belong to all persons. Morsink writes of a 'real presence of human rights in the human person',98 and his analysis could be seen to be on the border of the viewpoint that the ultimate source of rights is biological or genetic. The author repeatedly intimates his belief that human rights are part of our constitution. Yet his text does not discuss the process of natural selection, or the potential for an evolutionary reading of the development of an inherent rights doctrine, so this must be considered only a potential mode of interpretation. It is primarily through applied psychology that such theories for a biological origin of rights are emerging. 4. Evolutionary Psychology and Cooperation As Haught surmises, 'the leap from 'Darwin got it right' to 'Darwin tells the whole story' has proven irresistible'.99 Contemporary evolutionary theory has seen a remarkable bloom of theoretical and empirical work in psychology and related fields, what is described as a neo-Darwinian 'revolution' in the social or behavioural sciences.100 Evolutionary psychology describes a branch of 95 Bassiouni (n 81) 118. 96 Ibid 116.

Frans de Waal blames a generation of anthropologists for presenting a false view of whether it is culture or nature that makes us act in a certain way. Natural selection has produced our species, including our cultural abilities.107 Consequently 'culture does not deserve equal footing with nature'.108 Furthermore, the standard notion of humanity as the only form of life to have made the step from the natural to the cultural realm is incorrect. The transition has been gradual and is not complete, in that human nature was never left behind. In particular, Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene (1976) proposed that the unit of selection is the gene itself, in the sense of affecting the organism to make its own replication likely, an insight considered a foundation of evolutionary psychology.109 Evolutionary thought evidently cannot divide man from animals, and human culture, although much more pronounced, is perceived as not different in kind from behavioural traditions seen in other animals.110 Language has been used to criticize Darwin, with the belief that evolution cannot account for its existence or its absence among animals. Müller wrote that 'the one great barrier between man and brute is language. Man speaks and no brute has ever uttered a word'.111 However, while there is no question there is a gap between human language and what is found in other animal species, signals and 101 Terry Cooper (n 99) 60. Cooper quotes Richard Dawkins: 'I think it's awfully easy to exaggerate the difference between evolutionary psychology and sociobiology.

De Waal accepts the prevailing reluctance outside the scientific community to equate humans and animals: CI often get the impression of being surrounded by two distinct categories of people - those who do and those who don't mind being compared with animals'.114 According to evolutionary psychologists, behaviour is related to sexual and reproductive competition and must be advantageous in terms of natural selection, a strategy to be used where it aids survival or fitness.115 For example, religion can be seen as advantageous, historically helping us to continue to survive by providing protection against the anxieties of cosmic aloneness, a deception that protects us against the 'survival-threatening despair of mean- inglessness'.116 Thus religion is viewed as having adaptive significance and functional importance, aiding gene survival.117 Psychological research into humour has led to similar conclusions on genetic origins of the production and appreciation of humour.118 Evolutionary psychologists are careful not to over-emphasize the role of genes. Workman and Reader explain: When evolutionary psychologists discuss the effect of genes on psychology they think in terms of predispositions rather than causes. Genes do not cause men to commit violent acts; if they do anything they predispose men to such acts; whether men actually carry them out will depend on their life-histories, cultural contexts and other genetic predispositions (such as conscience) . . . Critics . . . rarely discuss the fact that evolutionists also propose predispositions for cooperation, conflict resolution, morality and altruism.119 Despite the nuances of predispositions rather than direct correlations, the approach can result in a certain deracinated attachment to genes as the ultimate determinants of behaviour. A common outcome has been the infusion of inanimate genes with qualities of personhood, with metaphorical descrip- tions of gene attempts to 'survive'.120 A subjective striving and ambition is 112 Skyrms, ibid. 113 de Waal (n 107) 32. 114 Ibid 10. 115 Cooper (n 99) 74, 99.

Yet she argues that irrespective of whether or not they believe in such one-to-one correlations, the 'reification of such traits in genes naturalizes the results of conjecture, [and] cloaks them in the authority of scientific truth'.128 Dess summarizes the debate as a dichotomy in which genetic determinism is pitted against radical environmentalism.129 In science, this question is irrelevant as genetic endowment and environmental influences are 'inextricably intertwined'.130 Yet many psychologists insist that nature is undermined in the social sciences, with excessive deference given to environment or culture. The refusal to acknowledge human nature is distorting science and the study of human beings.

Rouvroy counters that the scientific validity of most behavioural genetic research is highly questionable.133 Furthermore, its desirability is even more uncertain. Linking behaviour to genetic characteristics is political in nature, despite the attempts at objectivity. She identifies three underlying assumptions in all such research: genetic reductionism, that genes are crucial in programming prospects such as health and disease; genetic essentialism, that genes are the fundamental definitional resource of identity; and a 'blind confidence' in genetic technology allowing human beings to control interven- tions on genes.134 She describes this research as operating in an atmosphere 'saturated with genomic mythology'.135 A growing number of researchers are arguing that Darwinian algorithms, or the interaction between genetic and environmental information, underlie our sense of justice, arising from the cooperative nature of humans through evolution.136 For example, Dennis Krebs argues that the key to understanding the origin of justice is identifying the adaptive functions it evolved to serve. The overarching function of justice is said to be cto induce members of groups to uphold fitness-enhancing forms of cooperation'.137 In order to account for the acquisition of a sense of justice, 'we must identify the mental mechanisms that produce it and explain how they originated and became refined in the course of human evolution'.138 Much of this research began with attempts to explain the broader idea of 'altruism' in evolutionary terms, beginning with Darwin himself. Darwin was concerned about cooperative behaviour and what it implied about his theory of natural selection.139 The Origin of Species outlined cooperative and altruistic tendencies and instincts, and he found that such behaviour was a 'special difficulty, which at first appeared to me insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory'.140 The concept of altruism in biology has been defined as 'behaviour that benefits another organism, not closely related, while being apparently detrimental to the organism performing the 131 See Steven Pinker, The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature (Allen Lane, Penguin, London 2002) vii-viii, in which he extracts quotes from The Bell Curve, A Natural History of Rape and other controversial texts that emphasise the dual role of nature and the environment. 132 Ibid viii. 133 Rouvrov (n 29) 106. 134 Ibid 108-9. 135 Ibid 109. 136 See further Fruehwald (n 11). 137 Krebs Cn 15) 232. 138 Ibid 230. 139 Lee Dugatkin, Cooperation Among Animals (OUP, Oxford 1997) 5. 140 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species (John Murray, London 1859) 236.</page><page sequence="20">486 Oxford Journal of Legal Studies vol. 3o behaviour, benefit and detriment being defined in terms of contribution to inclusive fitness'.141 It would appear to be 'counter-selective' - how could an organism benefit by giving up resources to another? Genes that coded for such behaviour would appear to be a competitive disadvantage.142 At the start of the 20th century, Kropotkin, a founder of the anarchist movement and ardent natural historian, believed it an injustice to Darwin's theory to emphasize struggle as the dominant characteristic. Based on his observations of animal life in Eastern Siberia, and his own dramatic escape from a St Petersburg prison with the aid of his friends, he recognized the 'extreme severity of the struggle' but also saw 'mutual aid and mutual support carried on to an extent which made me suspect in it a feature of the greatest importance for the maintenance of life, for the preservation of each species'.143 The views were expressed in a series of letters responding to propositions from 'Darwin's bulldog', Thomas Huxley, who described life as a 'pitiless struggle' and a 'continuous free fight ... on about the same level as the gladiator's show'.144 The letters were developed into the publication Mutual Aid - Factor of Evolution (1908), arguing that Darwin's proponents often deliberately ignored the cooperative aspects of his theory.145 Kropotkin stressed the wider meaning of 'struggle' employed by Darwin, wherein cooperation results in the development of the intellectual and moral faculties which secure the best conditions for survival.146 He viewed the two dominant currents in evolution as mutual aid and self-assertion of the individual. The latter has been 'glorified from time immemorial' with the former 'hitherto totally lost sight of, a practice he believed was apparent in the reactions to Darwin's theory.147 Mutual aid can be traced to the beginnings of evolution and is the origin of our ethical conceptions.148 Dugatkin suggests that of all the books on cooperation, Mutual Aid has had the most profound effect on biologists.149 In a 1932 study on the causes of evolution, Haldane noted that 'altruistic behaviour is a kind of Darwinian fitness, and may be expected to spread as a result of natural selection'.150 Similarly Pinker believes that altruism may be heritable.151 In 1964, Hamilton provided mathematical formulae by which he measured the degree of shared genes between the benefactor and recipient of 141 Robert Trivers, 'The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism' (1971) 46 Q Rev Biology 35-57, 35. 142 Ibid 36. 143 Quoted in Brian Skyrms (n 111) 46. 144 Thomas Huxley, The Struggle for Existence and its Bearing upon Man (1888), quoted in Dugatkin (n 139) 6. 145 Dugatkin (n 139) 7.

In 1971, Trivers suggested a theory of 'reciprocal altruism', whereby an organism may engage in altruistic acts if it would receive similar acts in return, with both the donor and eventual reciprocator benefitting more than if they had remained 'selfish'.155 He referred to the role of game theory, in particular the Prisoner's Dilemma,156 which he felt re-formulated his idea of reciprocal altruism.157 The point of game theory is to find the universal prescription, known as the Nash equilibrium, defined as when each player's strategy is an optimal response to the strategies adopted by other players.158 The application of game theory to biology was pioneered in the early 1970s by John Maynard Smith, an engineer-geneticist who called an evolved instinct that met the Nash equilibrium an 'evolutionary stable strategy'. Trivers' claimed that these were models 'designed to take the altruism out of altruism'.159 In the wake of a paper on the 'evolution of cooperation', biological evidence of 'reciprocal altruism' was found among unrelated individual animals in vampire bats, coral reefs and African vervet monkeys.160 The conclusion was that reciprocity may be an instinct or inevitable part of our natures because natural selection has chosen it.161 Economics and selfish-gene biology seemed to combine on the view that cooperation or altruism had genetic implications, and that genes evolved only to enhance the chances of their own replication. Dawkins clarified that he was not recommending selfish behaviour but alerting us so that we can be aware of the need to overcome it.162 152 WD Hamilton, 'The Genetical Evolution of Social Behaviour' C1964Ì 7 T Theoretical Riol 1-16 153 Ibid 22-3. 154 Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species C1859), auoted in Dueatkin (n 139Ì 6.

The dilemma arises because if neither defects on the other, the police can convict them both only on a lesser charge so they would both be better off if they stayed silent.

By contrast there was strong evidence that reciprocity abounded in human society. Further explan- ations from economic game theory, including the 'ultimatum' and 'dictator' games, sought to explain whether there was an innate sense of fairness in humans, but struggled to definitively identify such a trait.164 Matt Ridley writes that although our minds have been built by selfish genes, they have been built to be social, trustworthy and cooperative.165 Instinctive cooperativeness is not a universal feature of animal life, as Kropotkin proposed, but rather the distinctive trait of humanity. Consciously or implicitly, all humans share a belief in pursuing the greater good, praising selflessness and decrying selfishness. Therefore Kropotkin and others who emphasize the genetic role of cooperation over violence have it the wrong way round - the essential virtuousness of humans is proved not by parallels in the animal kingdom but by the very lack of convincing animal parallels.166 Our obsession with virtue marks us out from other animal species. Evolutionary biologists continue to trace 'inequity aversion', or a 'sense of fairness', which is shown to prevail in a wide variety of circumstances despite significant cultural variations, with the conclusion that it is probably a human universal.167 It has been ascribed an early evolutionary origin and appears so established in human societies that researchers are turning to the study of animals to see if they also display awareness of inequity - remarkably, one recent study on Capuchin monkeys concludes that they have a sense of justice.168 Research on cooperation and justice is relatively uncontroversial, which ensures that it will be the focus of calls for greater recognition of the potential biological origins of legal systems of rights. It is in the area of violence that the difficulties arise. 5. Violence and Geneticization The evolutionary psychology of aggression and war has attracted growing interest on the basis that intergroup conflict has not been considered from an evolutionary viewpoint.

How is this predisposition exploited by politicians?'170 The aim is to ascertain whether the evolutionary roots of warfare and peacemaking can be found, thereby forming the basis for culturally determined behaviour in humans that leads to war.171 Proponents argue that 'adopting a gene-based evolutionary perspective for ethnic conflict may prove illuminating, especially in the light of the conspicu- ous failures of environmentalist theories'.172 Bloom sets out four routes towards a generic evolutionary psychological perspective on violence, involving an admixture of the biological, psychological, cultural and environmental pathways.173 In 1986, UNESCO sought to counteract what it considered to be dangerous assumptions emerging from the nascent research into violence and genetics. It issued the Seville Statement on Violence, a document which challenges a number of alleged biological findings that could be used to justify violence and war.174 It is divided into five propositions, which all begin with the phrase '[I]t is scientifically incorrect...'. According to the first proposition, it is scientif- ically incorrect to say that we inherited a tendency to make war from our animal ancestors. War is 'biologically possible but it is not inevitable'.175 According to the second proposition, it is scientifically incorrect to say that war and violence is genetically programmed into our human nature. While genes are co-involved in establishing our behavioural capacities, they do not produce individuals predisposed to violence; neither do they determine the opposite.176 According to the third proposition, it is scientifically incorrect to say that in the course of human evolution there has been a selection for aggressive behaviour over other forms of behaviour. Violence is neither an evolutionary legacy nor in our genes.177 According to the fourth proposition, it is scientifically incorrect to say that humans have a 'violent brain'. While we have the neural apparatus to act violently, it cannot be triggered automatically by certain stimuli.178 169 Dan Jones, 'Human Behaviour: Killer Instincts' (2008) 451 Nature 512-15, 512.

Although these tasks are mainly institutional and collective, they also rest upon the consciousness of individual participants for whom pessimism and optimism are crucial factors. Just as 'wars begin in the minds of men', peace also begins in our minds. The same species who invented war is capable of inventing peace. The responsibility lies with each of us.180 It has been suggested by evolutionary psychologists that the Seville Statement is 'totally uncontroversial' as few scientists would advocate the claims it attempts to rebut. It represents £a denunciation of ideas that no-one really had in the first place'.181 It has been misunderstood as implying that there are no links between genetics and violence, meaning that science has disproved something which it clearly has not. Beroldi has proposed that the Seville Statement is a political rather than a scientific text, challenging biological determinism even though such views largely stem from outside the scientific community. David Adams, who contributed to the drafting of the Statement, noted in 1989 that 'we have received remarkably little criticism'.183 This seems to be no longer the case. Jones' 2008 article in Nature opens with a quote from the Seville Statement, and claims that the decades since have not been kind to these cherished beliefs.184 It concludes that humans may have what the Seville Statement called a Violent brain', in that evolution may favour those who go to war. The murder of members of one group by those of another could be an adaptive behaviour that has been encouraged by evolution.185 However, we have also been furnished with a moral sense, and it is understanding the relationship between morality and violence that future research should explore.186 Adams declares that the Seville Statement is part of a 'psychological war'.187 The historical contribution of the document is reflected in the fact that it confronts biological determinism: 'The myth that war is part of human nature ... is the end result of a campaign of psychological propaganda that has been promulgated in the mass media in order to justify political policies of militarism'.188 He charts its historical significance and how the initial idea for 179 ibid. 180 ibid. 181 R Fox, 'On the Seville Statement on Violence' (1988) 5(5) Human Ethology Newsletter 4. 182 Workman and Reader (n 28) 19. 183 David Adams, 'The Seville Statement on Violence: A Progress Report' (1989) 26 J Peace Research 119 &lt;http://www.culture-of-peace.info/ssov/title-page.html&gt; accessed 12 April 2010. 184 Tones Cn 169) 512. 185 Ibid 513-14. 186 Ibid 515. 187 Adams (n 183) 120. 188 Ibid.</page><page sequence="25">autumn 2010 Survival of the Fairest 491 the project came from the UNESCO Statements on Race 1950. 189 These statements gave a scientific foundation to the political work of the UN against racial discrimination, by challenging the notion of biologically determined racial categories. However, they were equally bitterly contested among scientists. Adams draws cogent parallels between the genetic roots of violence and myths that surrounded race: It would be interesting to compare the present situation to earlier use of racist myths to justify slavery and colonialism. There was a great deal of racist propaganda in mid- 19th century US at the time of the abolition of slavery and in mid-20th century at the time of the dismantling of colonialism. Such racist propaganda may be seen as a last-resort effort by those who had a vested interest in slavery and colonialism to defend these institutions by appealing to the vulnerable belief systems of individual psychology at a time when they could no longer justify the institutions by economic or political arguments. Does today's propaganda about the biological basis of warfare derive from a similar effort by those with a vested interest in militarism and who can no longer justify it on economic and political grounds?190 These parallels are illuminating. For example, a discipline related to evolutionary psychology, psychiatric genetics, has seen proposals for the existence of a 'violence gene' known as MAO-A.191 The original context of the 'discovery' of the gene in 2002 was childhood abuse and the likelihood of the abuser to engage in violent behaviour.192 The research was carried out in New Zealand, where attention shifted to the Maori who reportedly have a high incidence of the gene, subsequently dubbed the 'warrior gene'. The 'warrior gene' was held to be responsible for gambling, addiction and aggression.193 The New Zealand Herald quotes Nicola Poa of the Christchurch School of Medicine: 'It is pretty contentious to be tagging a gene, especially with that type of behaviour, to an ethnic race... I was appalled'.194 Maori political leaders stated that the 'warrior gene' reports demonstrated unbalanced treatment of the Maori in the media.195 The production of genetic truths evidently raises fundamental questions of justice, fairness and equality.196 Arneson and Hjorleiffson critically examine the concept of geneticization, which warns of the dangers of researchers becoming preoccupied with the transformative effect of genetics, calling for 189 ibid. 190 Ibid 121. 191 Victor Limjoco, 'The Violence Gene' Discover, April 2006 &lt;http://discovermagazine.com/2006/apr/ violenco accessed 12 April 2010. 192 Avshalom Caspi and others, 'Role of Genotype in the Cycle of Violence in Maltreated Children' (2002) 297 Science 851-54.

In this regard, and returning to the distinction outlined in Section 2, while bioethics could be seen as forming part of the law and evolution discourse, geneticization is the more appropriate term for a discussion of law as evolution, because of its broader explanatory and critical aims. Bioethics is perceived as providing a legitimating cover for biotechnology while claiming to regulate its application, and as a result is too narrow in its parameters. Geneticization has been used by philosophers and social scientists for around two decades, with its origin attributed to a 1991 paper by Abby Lippman.199 The broad arguments posited by Lippman and other researchers who have continued her ideas, is that the ideology accompanying the current rise of genetic research technologies promotes injustice, including racial discrimin- ation,200 with a corresponding weakening of 'socio-cultural resources needed to grapple with challenges of human existence'.201 While the discourse has many empirical strands, such as investigation of the presentation of genetic discoveries and advances in the media, it is primarily a philosophical tool designed to oppose the growing belief that genetics are decisive of who we are.202 While earlier genetic studies tended to over-emphasize simplistic expressions of the absolute power of genes in the public sphere, at present more complex or multivalent portrayals of genetics are being presented and analysed.203 Many authors in the area conclude that research into the process of genetics, as well as the meaning of geneticization, has hardly begun.204 Arneson and Hjorleiffson see no inherent tension between mainstream bioethics and the geneticization discourse, with the former regulating technol- ogy and research and the latter requiring that we delve beneath accepted rules and ethical boundaries to discuss the wider socio-cultural context. They point out the potential for underestimating the extent to which genetic advances already integrate past philosophical critiques. Nevertheless they utilize the language of hermeneutics to argue that greater focus is needed on what they term 'upstream' issues, beyond present bioethical regulation of advances in technology and research. They state: £In the spirit of the hermeneutics of 197 Arneson and Hjorleiffson (n 30) 417. iyB Ibid 429. 199 Abby Lippman, 'Prenatal Genetic Testing and Screening: Constructing Needs and Reinforcing Inequities' (1991) 17 Am J Law Med 15-50.

The beginning of this process may see a concerted focus on rights as representative of the evolutionary origins of law. From a jurisprudential viewpoint, it is essential that legal thought keeps pace with the biological research by widening the discourse from bioethics to geneticization, involving a greater philosophical engagement with the effects of genetics as an explanatory concept in society. 6. Conclusion The identification of the individual as the unit of protection, and the inherence, inalienability and universality of human rights, will lead to arguments for a potential biological foundation. Behaviour which corresponds to rights has not as yet formed a significant part of the evolutionary psychology project, although it should be presumed that it will. Indeed arguments are beginning to be made for a biological formulation of rights. The intuitive understanding displayed in 1945 and 1948 in designing international legal foundations of individual rights and responsibilities will raise theories that this could be a reflection of genetic behaviour. The reliance on the concept of 'nature' to proclaim universal rights and crimes against humanity will lead to suggestions that it could have resulted from a process of natural selection, with the consequent search for genetic codes that map rights behaviour. This article has had two related aims. The first is to signal the impending emergence of law as evolution as a distinct area of research. The potential for evolutionary origins of law will form part of biological investigation, and jurisprudential thinkers will need to engage with this field as an explanatory source of law. The second is to point towards the discourse of geneticization as a means of analysing the socio-cultural environment under which such research is taking place. Law has thus far concentrated on regulating the ethical sphere, and this will become (or has already become) too narrow an approach. While jurists can accept advances in genetic research, including the potential application of such research to justice or international human rights, the existence of an overarching discourse of criticism of genetic explanations is an important tool. 205 Ibid 428.

Jurists can welcome genetic research into the origins of law, but must also question the socio-cultural conditions and power relations that produce this research and its relevance for challenging structures of inequality; the traditional domain of human rights, wherever they come from.</page></plain_text>
