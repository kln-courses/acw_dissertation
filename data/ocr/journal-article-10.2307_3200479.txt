<plain_text><page sequence="1">"More Spiritual Terrors". The Bible and Gothic Imagination in Moby-Dick KRIS LACKEY THE LITERARY TRADITIONS contributing to the Gothic atmosphere in Moby-Dick are so knotted and interdependent, the range of allusions with Gothic thrust so extensive, that selective studies of these subtexts necessarily skew our appreciation of Mel- ville's imaginative eclecticism even as they illuminate it.' The Shake- spearean influence does not operate, in this context, apart from that of crude Gothic fiction; Melville's knowledge of Zoroastrianism apart from his knowledge of freemasonry; Byronic elements apart from Miltonic; classical myth apart from American folklore. Neither is the novel's Gothic atmosphere (discontinuous as it is) the sole end of these influences, which may in various situations generate lyric festiveness or indeed serve, at times ironically, as correctives to the Gothic outlook. Amid this rich profusion of Gothic substance contributing to various designs within Moby-Dick, one encounters snatches of biblical material turned to Gothic purposes; and I think most readers would agree that these biblical-Gothic passages are peculiarly chill- ing. In this brief study I would like to probe the dynamics of biblical- Gothic intertextuality in Moby-Dick in order to find out how such a conjunction provided Melville a medium by which he could reinforce the "spiritual terrors" pervading his narrative. The Gothic strain of American literature, which has proven so durable in part because it can be adapted to darker artistic visions of vastly dissimilar cultural circumstances, had by the mid-nineteenth century already undergone a variety of transformations in the works of American writers who modified its conventions to accommodate their fictional aims, as Donald Ringe has amply demonstrated in a recent study. Charles Brockden Brown concentrated on the psycho- logical consequences of Gothic terror; Washington Irving usually</page><page sequence="2">38 Kris Lackey exploited the comic potential of the Gothic tradition; and Fenimore Cooper resituated Gothic conventions in American landscape and manner. Both Brown and Cooper, along with a number of compara- tively minor American authors, employed the Gothic to examine the role of imagination in perception, and in so doing, Ringe argues, "foreshadowed the kind of fiction that would focus intensely on the problem of perceived realities and opened the way for the further development of the American Gothic" in the works of Poe, Hawthorne, and Melville, each of whom discovered peculiar methods and purposes for using Gothic material (127). For Melville, though typically less interested than Poe in studying hallucinatory derangement and less rigorous than Hawthorne in developing an allegorical pattern of Gothic imagery to depict nuances of psycholog- ical change, the Gothic mode served (as it did for the other two writers) as a means of altering the atmosphere or external conditions of a narrative in such a fashion that the reader participates in the skewed perception of characters. To cite three instances of this operation of the Gothic subtext, each of which, pertinent to this study, features a biblical allusion, we may turn to sections of Pierre, Israel Potter, and "Benito Cereno." The narrator of the first work, when generalizing about human behavior, often adopts the bombastic Gothic rhetoric indicative of Pierre Glen- dinning's outlook, as in this passage concerning Pierre's anticipated humiliation at the loss of Lucy: "It is not fear; it is a pride-horror, which is more terrible than any fear. Then, by tremendous imagery, the murderer's mark of Cain is felt burning on the brow, and the already acquitted knife blood-rusts in the clutch of the anticipating hand" (336). With such an accounting of motivation the narrator generates sympathy for Pierre's grim outlook. The brief Gothic interlude early on in Israel Potter, apparently designed to sustain the fugitive's picaresque exploits, features a history of the cubicle in which Potter is immured, for "what seemed all the prophetic days and years of Daniel" (71), at the home of Squire Woodcock; again, the narrator elaborates on those details of the cell's original function (as a niche wherein Templar penitents were entombed alive) that ground Potter's claustrophobic frenzy: "Here, in this very darkness, centuries ago, hearts, human as his, had mildewed in despair; limbs, robust as his own, had stiffened in immovable torpor" (71). In similar fashion, the narrator of "Benito Cereno" supplies Gothic imagery in descrip- tions accompanying Amasa Delano's vagrant suspicions, just as those Gothic images are supplanted by images of bucolic peace when Delano represses his forebodings. For instance, when Delano first</page><page sequence="3">South Atlantic Review 39 approaches the Spanish slave ship, "Her keel seemed laid, her ribs put together, and she launched, from Ezekiel's Valley of Dry Bones" (675), but when the obtuse American wishes to shunt his fears, he can look at the hatchet-polishers and see "the benign aspect of Nature, taking her innocent repose in the evening; the screened sun in the quiet camp of the west shining out like the mild light from Abraham's tent" (731). In none of these works does the Gothic mode control the narrative without intermission; rather, as in Moby-Dick, it may be ascendant when Melville wishes to develop sympathy for a character's gloomy or paranoid cast of thought. In Moby-Dick, however, the Gothic carries over into the treatment of broader metaphysical questions about the nature of the physical world and the power of the imagina- tion to shape that world. Thus the operation of the Gothic imagination, in Ishmael or Ahab, is itself a central issue in Moby-Dick as Melville dramatizes the problematic subject-object dynamic. While Melville employed biblical allusion elsewhere in Gothic contexts, as we have seen, he did so relatively infrequently, perhaps because he was not so concerned in those works to draw out the biblical content of the American Gothic imagination - or, to put it another way, the inter- textuality of Bible and Gothic. The value of a study of this intertex- tuality lies, I think, in an appreciation of Melville's recognition that the American imagination fused the two texts, and of his exploration of the consequences of this fusion, which may range from an enhanced perception of the sharkishness of nature to a delusive demonic teleology. Among the subtexts coinciding to various degrees in the larger Gothic subtext of Moby-Dick, the Bible may be placed with popular Gothic fiction as sources having the greatest resonance for a general American audience. One difference between these two texts is that the Bible was, for a large section of the nineteenth-century American population, a privileged text, and popular Gothic fiction was not: although images from either text were to occupy the same imagina- tion, biblical images might be afforded the status of historical truth, whereas images from Gothic fiction were plainly make-believe. A collateral difference between the two texts is that the public often encountered the Bible by way of exegesis and polemic, whereas it encountered the popular Gothic novel without explicit gloss; one issue of this difference might be that where the Bible is concerned, the imagination works simultaneously on the text of the preacher/ denomination and on Scripture, whereas the popular Gothic novel is relatively unmediated - at one level, anyway. For example, consider,</page><page sequence="4">40 Kris Lackey on the one hand, the passages from The Castle of Otranto concerning Isabella's subterranean flight from Manfred, and on the other, Jona- than Edwards's text for "Sinners," Deut. 32.35, "their foot shall slide in due time." Walpole's narrative generates terror in and of itself (again, relatively speaking), whereas Edwards (via deduction) invests the biblical text, an excerpt from Moses's song of warning to the Israelites before his death, with terrifying similes designed to drive home his message with a familiarity and immediacy missing in the biblical text. A third difference between the two texts lies in readers' expectations: a popular Gothic novel titillates; the Bible edifies, chastens, inspires. In short, then, the text of the popular Gothic novel is unmediated, unprivileged, and "untrue"; conversely, biblical text is mediated, privileged, and, for some readers, "true." The popular Gothic elements of Moby-Dick normally dissolve into the larger Gothic text of the novel, whereas biblical allusions (like most allusions) announce themselves as such. Rarely, one finds Poe fingering a Gothic source, or even Melville alluding, for instance, to the psychological mysteries of "Radcliffian romance," as he does in Billy Budd (ch. 11), but in general this difference in presentation holds. Only readers familiar with the historical development of liter- ary Gothicism could point to "The Candles" chapter and say, "That is Gothic fiction," whereas most readers know (or, in the nineteenth century, would have known) the story of Ahab and its source. The reader encountering biblical allusions in a Gothic context could thus sense the "otherness" of these allusions while accepting the Gothic atmosphere as the norm because the prevailing conventions of a certain passage are Gothic. The "otherness" is created by several conditions: as usual, biblical text is mediated (by the narrator and the demands of Gothic conventions); biblical text announces itself as such by style and/or content; biblical text leads away from and back into the narrative; biblical text, because it is (for some readers) "true," may in a Gothic context sensationalize a scene in the same way we are more fascinated by a grisly tale when it is said really to have happened; biblical text, because it is privileged, may elevate the level of discourse, even in the Gothic mode (just as, conversely, it may be employed irreverently to heighten the comedy of satire, as it does in the Hosea Hussey episode); and biblical text, as Joel Porte has pointed out, when it appears in a Gothic context, makes explicit the kinship between Gothicism and protestant religious terror.2 In these respects, biblical text appearing in a Gothic context creates an interpretive tension: the reader may be pulled between a sensational reading (focusing on emotional effect) and an exegetical reading</page><page sequence="5">South Atlantic Review 41 (focusing on interpretation). Thus the appearance of biblical allu- sions in a Gothic passage signals the deliberate mediating, via the Gothic impulse, of biblical text, a text that in itself heightens the authority of the narrative voice and privileges the Gothic text so that the reader understands that the terror has ulterior possibility - that the level of discourse is being raised above mere sensationalism. As Nathalia Wright has shown, Moby-Dick contains more biblical allusions in proportion to its length than any other of Melville's prose works, a fact supporting her observation that "It was in his most profound thought and his most distinguished style that he relied most heavily on Scripture" (9). With apparent facility he drew upon the Bible some 250 times in Moby-Dick for a variety of uses: illustration, characterization, atmosphere, imagery, style, and theme. But despite the ease with which he intuited connections between a subject at hand and a bit of Scripture, Melville was aware that he was not merely reaching into the cracker barrel, for the Calvinistic influence in his upbringing, tempered as that influence was by his father's relatively liberal theological persuasions, not only introduced Mel- ville early to the poetry and narratives of the Bible, both of which he would draw from (often irreverently) throughout his career, but also undoubtedly awakened him to the potency of Scripture as a cultural currency pervading American thought and speech. Employed in the service of a social moralist like White-Jacket, biblical injunctions and style lent divine authority to secular polemics; as a "Holy Guide- Book," the Bible informed the responses of young Redburn to the heartless world he discovered. But whether in the hands of the preacher or of an author working in the Gothic tradition, the Bible could also be a source for soul-fright, a repository of tales depicting grisly retribution, and evoking spiritual terror. Scripture contained things potentially more terrible than the best laid Gothic figment, owing to its privileged status as sacred text, "true" to varying degrees for different readers, especially if it had haunted the imagination of early childhood. As a privileged text, the Bible served as the stoutest culturally shared connection between mid-nineteenth-century America--its consciousness geared for settlement, commerce, and other signs of material progress-and a lost world of myth and mystery. It afforded access to a universe in which the powers of light and darkness intervened palpably in human affairs and natural occurrences, and in which superstition merged with "accurate" per- ception. A good many biblical allusions in Moby-Dick heighten its Gothic atmosphere by evoking the primitive wonder and terror of the Scrip-</page><page sequence="6">42 Kris Lackey tures. Melville thus fused the popular texts of Gothic romance and holy writ, not only to touch his readers nearer the source of their own (perhaps repressed or vestigial) spiritual fears, but as well to move nearer one another the world of nature and the universe of shifting powers that seem to batter it. Melville was not the first writer working in the Gothic tradition to employ biblical allusion to intensify a narrative. Among those Gothic authors he probably read, we find William Godwin, the doctrinaire atheist, making use of Scripture a half dozen times in Caleb Williams, though in that novel Godwin euphemizes references to God. For example, Williams wonders of his victimizer Falkland, "Did his power reach through all space, and his eye penetrate every conceal- ment? Was he like that mysterious being, to protect us from whose fierce revenge mountains and hills, we are told, might fall on us in vain?" (332). A similar biblical-Gothic hyperbole occurs later in Williams's narrative, again with reference to Falkland: "He cannot, like those invisible personages who are supposed from time to time to interfere in human affairs, ride in the whirlwind, shroud himself in clouds and impenetrable darkness, and scatter destruction on the earth from his secret habitation" (411; amalgam of Exod. 13.21 [?] and Job 38.1). And at one point Williams, out of great despair, echoes Job: "The voice of no man upon earth echoed the voice of my conscience. 'I called aloud; but there was none to answer; there was none that regarded" (427; Job 19.7). Although biblical allusions are rare in The Castle of Otranto, Walpole's "Translator's Preface" voices a regret that the "author" (Walpole himself) had not "grounded his plan on a more useful moral than this: that the sins of the fathers are visited on their children to the third and fourth generation"--a tidy biblical parallel to Otranto's portentous determinism (7; Exod. 20.5, etc.). But elsewhere in Melville's probable Gothic reading there is only a smattering of biblical allusions (with slight concentrations in Carlyle's translations of Musaeus and Jean Paul Friedrich Richter) - few of which contrib- ute significantly to Gothic atmosphere. Among the Gothic conventions Melville encountered in his read- ing is the cryptic message - "certain strange unintelligible characters, circles and lines" in Tieck's "The Goblet" (Carlyle 1: 368); a tapestry woven in fire in the same author's "The Elves" (Carlyle 1: 351); a mysterious inscription on the sword Ferdinand unearths in Walpole's Otranto (90); a mysterious parchment in Beckford's Vathek (42). The semiotic import of such images varies as characters either decipher a message as a prophecy or bit of instruction, or wonder at the enigma the message presents. For Melville, who savored nature's cryptic</page><page sequence="7">South Atlantic Review 43 messages, the latter response, informed by ardent speculation, held greater promise. Indeed, John T. Irwin, surveying a collateral source of Melville's fascination with obscure encryption - the stir created by the deciphering of Egyptian hieroglyphics in the 1820s-has ob- served that "indeterminacy is the essential characteristic of the hieroglyph for Melville" (286). The scriptural hieroglyph, a cryptic message written in a biblical tongue, at once strikes the Gothic note in that it evokes the numinous,3 and connects natural phenomena with scriptural mystery to reveal their interplay in the epistemological quest. Such is the case when Ishmael, stymied by the cryptic phy- siognomy of the sperm whale, wonders how he can "hope to read the awful Chaldee of the Sperm Whale's brow" (169). And in one of the great Gothic scenes in Moby-Dick, "The Candles," Ishmael conveys with an Old Testament image the general alarm occasioned by the appearance of the premonitory corpusants: "Seldom have I heard a common oath when God's burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His 'Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin' has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage" (415; Dan. 5.5, 25-28). Starbuck, wont to perceive the divine warning in things, says that Ahab, viewing the Ecuadorian doubloon, "seems to read Belshazzar's awful writing" (360); this inaccurate surmise, anticipating the first mate's own abortive interpretation of the coin's engravings as symbols of the intolerable truth that "the great sun is no fixture" (360), weds Gothic dread to spiritual terror as it defines the quality of projection inherent in a fundamentally Christian mind that is nonetheless "given to a certain superstitiousness" and is susceptible to the "spiritual terrors" (104) generated by Ahab. More to the point, all three allusions share a common scheme: biblical enigma displaces phenomenal enigma when a character turns exegete of malevolent nature. That is, in these instances, when Ishmael or Starbuck feels threatened by objects or events, he comes to know that threat by writing it, in Old Testament characters. Thus Ishmael and Starbuck use the Bible to write Gothic dread. Though each makes his own sense of this Bible- Gothic connection, their conflation of these texts shows how Gothic perception may issue from religious terror. Employing the Gothic manner in Moby-Dick to enliven an aware- ness of malevolence at work in the world, Melville drew upon the Bible's store of frightening images, many of which his nineteenth- century readers (few as they ultimately were) might have imbibed from conservative sermons. Ishmael makes use of such an image while discoursing on the precariousness of life at sea: "Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews, when under the feet of Korah and</page><page sequence="8">44 Kris Lackey his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up forever" (235; Num. 16.33). And in "The Whale Watch" Ahab is awakened from his dream of hearses when "A sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air" (410; Gen. 13.10, etc.). Just as this event anticipates the Parsee's elaboration of his own prophecies regarding Ahab's fate, a foreboding sound (evoked in a ghastly simile that beggars the stock moan or clap of thunder) arouses the crew's super- stition, in "The Life-Buoy": "The watch - then headed by Flask - was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthly--like half-articu- lated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod's murdered Innocents" (428: Matt. 2). Ahab assures Flask, who has informed him of the sound and hinted at its "dark meanings," that it emanated from seals and not drowned sailors, but the crew's superstitions are apparently vindi- cated when later the same day the first sailor to go aloft to look out for Moby-Dick "on the White Whale's own peculiar ground" (429) plum- mets from the masthead and drowns. Melville summons these bibli- cal ghosts to haunt the reckoning of the Pequod's crew - to suggest the play of imagination over natural phenomena. As is so often the case in Moby-Dick, superstition transforms event into symbol; whether or not superstition actually proves prophetic remains a moot point if it allows, say, an appreciation of invisible agency. Conjoined with the Gothic gesture, biblical allusions, recalling a universe in which real- ity is genuinely metaphorical, can lend Gothic terror a provisional credibility beyond its value as sensation, for Melville is blurring the distinction between irrational subjectivity (superstition) and objective interpretation to recover the metaphorical quality of experience. As a Gothic hero-villain bearing a scriptural name, Ahab is a compound of Gothic and biblical elements: in appearance and character he is a beetling titan, in namesake a God-defying idolater. He bears the sensational aspect of Godwin's Falkland, whose face "suggested the idea of its being burnt and parched by the eternal fire that burned within him" (388), and he rivals Beckford's Vathek in megalomaniacal fervor. But in adding the biblical twist--joining Quaker idiom to the cruel name --Melville not only accessed the "lofty language" and Gothic mien afforded by such a plausible anach- ronism as the Quaker whaler, he also, to a modest extent, equalized the typically distinct attitudes with which his readers would approach a biblical narrative and a narrative of nineteenth-century commerce. I qualify this generalization because it obtains for the most part in only those passages where metaphor overtakes reasonable causation, a condition incipient in Peleg's informing Ishmael: "he's Ahab, boy;</page><page sequence="9">South Atlantic Review 45 and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!" Ishmael, like Melville's nineteenth-century readers, also knows that Ahab was "a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did they not lick his blood?" (77; 1 Kings 21.19). And with the (perhaps superfluous) reinforcement supplied by the squaw Tistig's hint that "the name would somehow prove prophetic" (77), the reader's expec- tations concerning Ahab's role in the ensuing narrative are freighted with the biblical metaphor. Captain Ahab's defiant worship of the "clear spirit of clear fire" (416), for instance, is rendered more terrible, its consequences potentially more disastrous, by the divine retaliation attending King Ahab's idolatry in the biblical narrative: the judg- ment pervading the narrative of King Ahab - that he "did evil in the sight of the Lord above all who were before him" (1 Kings 16.30)- may bear only partial relevance to Melville's judgment of Captain Ahab's actions, but there can be little question that the sense of foreboding elicited by the biblical association heightens Captain Ahab's gesture to a Gothic pitch. To like effect, Ahab is depicted, near the conclusion of "The Candles," brandishing his freshly wrought harpoon, which glows with corpusant flame and is yclept "the fiery dart" (416)- a Pauline phrase imaging the weaponry de- ployed by "the wicked" against Christians who must protect them- selves with "the whole armor of God" (Eph. 6.16). By intertwining Gothic and biblical texts in his creation of Ahab, Melville created two kinds of interpretive tension. One, which I have already mentioned, is the tension between a purely sensational reading of his character and an exegetical reading. A second kind of tension arises from the exegetical reading itself, for a reader who tries to make sense of the parallels between Captain Ahab and King Ahab must suspend the biblical text, wherein King Ahab defies God and is punished for it, when the analogy between King Ahab and Captain Ahab ceases to serve - that is, when Captain Ahab's defiance is metaphysically different from King Ahab's: when it is not the God of the Old Testament that Ahab defies, but the "wall" of an inscrutable universe. But this suspension remains partial and intellectual because Melville, having drawn upon vestigial religious terror to intensify Ahab's Gothic aura, transfers that fear to Ahab's quest to sustain its porten- tousness. Melville's use of biblical material to enhance Ahab's Gothic bearing may be observed as well in the allusions connecting the material object of Ahab's quest and Job's Leviathan, that terrifying creature that God holds up to the patient sufferer as a corporeal example of His omnipotence: "Lay thine hand upon [Leviathan],</page><page sequence="10">46 Kris Lackey remember the battle, do no more" (Job 41.8) - a sample of what Ish- mael calls "The awful tauntings in Job [that] might well appal me" (118). Beyond worshiping in defiance, then, Captain Ahab assaults the symbolic incarnation of God's creative power by "chasing with curses a Job's whale round the world" (162); and the Gothic revenge motif, such as that developed in a (nominally) secular context in Caleb Williams--wherein Williams sees something "fiendlike in ... [Falkland's] hunting me round the world, and determining to be satisfied with nothing less than my blood" (380)- accrues the peril of sacrilege. As in other conflations of biblical and Gothic texts in Moty- Dick, Melville here is transcendentalizing the narrative, if you will; he invokes a privileged text that both elevates the terms of Ahab's revenge to distinguish it from its banal, purely personal varieties and raises the stakes of that revenge to generate intrigue. Preceding and accompanying Ahab's revenge quest, the riddling prophecies of its failure may at times partake of both Gothic and biblical traditions. Melville's Gothic reading yielded a stock of such portents, including the sighing portrait of Manfred's grandfather in Otranto and the ghost inhabiting the Rummelsburg castle in Mu- saeus's "Dumb Love"-"a long lean man, with a black beard, in ancient garb, and with a gloomy countenance, his eyebrows hanging down in deep earnestness from his brow" (Carlyle 1: 61). Despite his comparatively prosaic aspect, Melville's pocked and ragged Elijah, though in his initial appearance a mock-Gothic element like the Angel of Doom in the black church, provides with his "diabolical incoherences" (109) yet another suggestion of the interpenetration of biblical narrative and nineteenth-century whaling narrative, insofar as an intrusion of the former may serve, in Gothic fashion, to suspend and resituate the natural laws whose operation a reader would expect in the latter. When Elijah says, "it's all fixed and arranged a'ready" (87), he may, as Ishmael assumes, be full of humbug, but he has evoked the prophecy given to his namesake that dogs would lick the blood of King Ahab (1 Kings 21.19), and the progress of the novel must seem to absorb the determinism of the biblical narrative, just as, for instance, the supernatural forces at work in Otranto conspire to vindicate the prophecy concerning the fate of Manfred's house. In similar fashion, the Jereboam's prophet-in- residence, a mad Shaker prophet who calls himself Gabriel, reintro- duces, in his peculiar visionary idiom, the awful tauntings in Job, for he holds Moby-Dick to be "the Shaker God incarnated" (267) and considers any attack on the White Whale a sacrilege. Gabriel has secured the superstitious reverence of theJereboam's crew by "prophesy-</page><page sequence="11">South Atlantic Review 47 ing" the death of the mate Macey, who dared assail Moby-Dick. In recalling the mate's boat crew from its pursuit of the whale, Gabriel had threatened apocalyptic consequences should they persist, shriek- ing, "The vial! the vial!" (268)- an allusion to the seventh and final vial of wrath, containing various calamitous plagues, poured out by an angel of God in Revelation 16.17. Although Gabriel's prophetic gift, like that of Elijah, is soundly debunked by a skeptical narrator, Gabriel's extension of the warning to Captain Ahab - "Beware of the horrible plague!"; "beware of the blasphemer's end!" (267, 269)- revives the specter of invisible agency, again enlisting "superstition" prefabricated in Scripture so that for the reader aware of the biblical import of Gabriel's warning, such superstition provisionally obtains, no matter how cracked its author. But despite the fact that Melville succeeds, in his creation of Elijah and Gabriel, in once again suggest- ing the entanglement of biblical and whaling narratives, these two figures show the technique at its most strained. In fact, these brittle caricatures, so vulnerable to Ishmael's skepticism (which must have a stout opponent in credible superstition if the Gothic elements of the novel are to be at all affecting), may to some extent expose the factitiousness of Bible-Gothic interplay and draw untoward attention to the novel's Gothic paraphernalia. In two last illustrations of Melville's Bible-Gothic conflation we discover grisly images rendered bizarre by Melville's outlandish ma- nipulation of context. When Stubb and Flask kill a right whale, the sharks that had been feasting on the carcass of a sperm whale moored to the Pequod "rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock" (274-75; Exod. 17.6). What may seem a gauche simile actually depends, in its evocation of human sharkishness (an eminently Melvillian meta- phor), on the crisis of the biblical narrative: in the wilderness of Sin the Israelites were prepared to stone Moses because they had no water and because they demanded a sign that the Lord was among them (vv. 5-7). In "The Sphynx," a chapter that concerns the hoist- ing of a sperm whale's head against the Pequod's waist and Ahab's subsequent interview with the head, Ishmael, in depicting the scene, draws from the book of Judith in the Apocrypha: "that blood- dripping head hung to the Peqoud's waist like the giant Holofernes's from the girdle of Judith" (263). The anthropomorphic slant of this allusion throws a savage light on the triumph of the beautiful heroine who brought the Assyrian captain's head back to her people in a meat bag. Ishmael thus suppresses the emphasis of the biblical narrative</page><page sequence="12">48 Kris Lackey on Judith's courage and cunning as he evokes the ghastly theater of Old Testament retribution. In the foregoing passages we have seen the merging of two subtexts of Moby-Dick- the Bible and the Gothic novel. For Melville, who had been "inscribed" by these texts, and likewise for the reader who "writes" Moby-Dick with them, this mixture of codes of meaning at once sensationalizes metaphysical inquiry and arouses superstition grounded in Scripture. If Gothic conventions supplied a nominally secular medium by which Ahab's gestures and the frightful side of creation might be energized so as to lend credence (and add specta- cle) to his assault on the malign inscrutability of nature, the Bible, as a comparatively privileged text brought into play alongside the text of popular romance, supplied images and narrative invested with the authority if not of spiritual truth then certainly of cultural esteem, and it thus served as a source of those "more spiritual terrors" attending Ahab and his quest. In joining these two popular texts Melville did not merely concede to vulgar taste; he compounded the stoutest elements of American superstition to create in Ahab, victim and advocate of Gothic percep- tion, an estimable opponent, rare in the extent of his charisma and intellect, for the skeptical Ishmael, who for a time succumbs to the terms of his mania, and for pious Starbuck, whose untried fideism renders him powerless against Ahab's marshalled superstitions. The Gothic-biblical passages haunting Moby-Dick, then, create in small the larger metaphysical tensions of the novel, for on the one hand they may point to the "tauntings" of God - the intervention of ap- parently malicious will--and on the other they may betoken a ca- veat - that he who acts on such a delusion misapprehends the terrors of creation and summons his own destruction. University of New Orleans NOTES 'In terms of its sources Melville's Gothicism in Moby-Dick is distinguished by a bold eclecticism, a vigorous amalgamation of diverse materials he had culled from his reading. Of the popular works circulating in America (and in England) that could be characterized, with varying degrees of accuracy, as Gothic, Melville certainly either borrowed, purchased, or had immediate access to Beckford's Vathek, a disjointed and phantasmagorically lurid tale of Faustian questing and damna- tion; Walpole's Castle of Otranto, with its portentous furniture and demented familial head; Godwin's Caleb Williams, set in a world where the corrupt individual wields</page><page sequence="13">South Atlantic Review 49 absolute power, through unbending social conventions, over good men and women whose escape through religion, sentiment, and justice is denied them; Carlyle's two-volume collection of his translations from the German, German Romance, a sampler of tales by Musaeus, La Motte Fouque, Ludwig Tieck, E. T. A. Ho- ffmann, and Jean Paul Richter; Schiller's Ghost-Seer, a fragmentary story compris- ing mysterious pursuit and bogus spirit-rapping; and La Motte Fouque's Undine, a tragic romance (involving water spirits) in which the natural and supernatural worlds fuse (Sealts). An abbreviated survey of additional sources for Melville's Gothicism attests to the diversity of his interest in this regard. In a pioneer article on Melville and the Gothic, Arvin has discussed primarily Melville's debt to the landscape imagery of both the popular Gothic novelists and well-known romantic painters such as Salvator Rosa. Boudreau has tied Melville's knowledge of masonic ritual and Gothic architecture to Ahab's fire worship and his rejection of the Christian import of the Gothic form of the whale. In a study of parallels between Edmund Burke's formulation of a program for achieving the "sublime" and Melville's artistic prac- tices, Glenn has noted the manifestation, in the structure of Moby-Dick, of Burke's recommendations: "The juxtaposition of extremes of passion, the abrupt cessation of tension and terror for brief interludes, succeeded inexorably by the renewal of tension and fear" (166). Isari has discovered certain of the mysteries surrounding Fedallah (a Gothic character worthy of Beckford) to have had their origin in Mel- ville's knowledge of Zoroastrianism, and Cook has demonstrated that the grotesque in Melville's works often engenders "shock, confusion, and dread" in those who witness it, forcing them into new insights. Discussing Melville's Gothicism in Moby- Dick, Blackmur has characterized it as a strategic concession to popular taste, a "solemn fraud" redeemed (in better moments) by the subjects on which Melville made it turn. Although acknowledging that Melville "adapted outright the gothic convention of language with all its archaisms and rhetorical inflations," Blackmur astutely reminds us of the author's uneasiness with the Gothic, his refusal to assent unconditionally to its conventions, however successfully he employed them (140). Such qualifications do not diminish Melville's Gothic achievement; rather they sharpen our sense of the deliberateness with which he employed Gothic elements in Moby-Dick. Among other ends to which he directed these elements, as Mandel has demon- strated, is the book's portentous atmosphere, enveloping and sustaining an illusion of "deterministic entrapment" by inscrutable powers - an illusion to which Ahab is particularly susceptible: "Insofar as that imprisoned self projects its own perspec- tive onto a world created by its own psychological necessity, the world becomes its trap" (80). Mandel's study thus reveals how Melville at once drew upon the dark and claustrophobic imagery of the Gothic to charge his narrative with threatening mystery, and centered in this atmosphere a character who thinks Gothically, a strategy that complicates any search for the limits of Ahab's paranoia because the reader is often confined to a world quite similar to the one he envisions. 2In a similar vein, Fiedler has pointed out that Gothic writers in general "insist upon using the traditional terminology for the diabolic, betraying a certain vesti- gial doubt (even perhaps hope) that there may be in the old legends a kind of truth" (118). 3Varma characterizes the Gothic impulse as "a quest for the numinous," a drive to recover, after an age of rationalism, an "apprehension of Divine immanence penetrating diurnal reality," and a move toward "the beckoning shadows of a more</page><page sequence="14">50 Kris Lackey intimate and mystical apprehension of life" (211).
