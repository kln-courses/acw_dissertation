It functions as an a priori-producing history rather than as yet another regional history. Continuing an old tradition of rhetoric, we have begun to locate this a priori within the practice and economy of discourses: in the changing rhetorical relation of res et verba, things and words. It seems obvious that knowledge depends on—or is produced by—a discourse economy, but what is important in this economy is the negotiation and interaction of words and things rather than the gathering and storage of the fixed results or products of data to be gathered and stored. While, on the one hand, a formula like "how to do things with words" has shifted the emphasis from the firm meaning or content conveyed in words to the impact and performance of their transmission, on the other hand, the processing of knowledge still has to be brought to its own history producing capacity of a coming to know, and to conceive of what is accumulated as what is known, or seems to be known as known, at least for a while. The economy of discourses teaches us how and why, in practice and performance, not everything can be known at the same time and, as a matter of fact and use, many modes of not knowing (including what one can not very well not know) rule the day. In between words and things, the interaction of concepts and pictures predetermines and channels, mirrors and reinforces the ways of coming to know—and of being content with what we know—including the usefulness of forgetting and the necessities of repression. Let me proceed, without further delay, to an exemplary instance, the motif of the interaction in two pictures (figs. 1 and 2). This case should be able to illustrate—in the precise Renaissance sense of an illustratio—the point to be made. Both pictures display a conceiving: the Annunziata of Antonello da Messina and August Sander's Children Born Blind, a photograph from Sander's monumental documentary collection People of the Twentieth Century, one of the last pictures in the last volume, titled "The Last among Men."1 The similarity is evident, the point could not be clearer. The evidence of pictures—of these as of all others—follows from a theory that rediscovers the functioning of conception in them. This relation between theory and pictures, their reciprocal dependency upon each other, is my topic. I. Begreifensgeschichte—A history of conceiving: Antonello da Messina and August Sander Antonello's painting is famous for the surprise, even the wit, with which it casts light upon an elaborately complex iconographie tradition, which is illuminated in a flash by this annunciation. Zooming in on something that is usually found embedded in a narrative scenery— the interior setting of the story of immaculate conception into which the angel of the Lord sets foot, accompanied by the light-beam of God's paternal influence— Antonello's painting confines itself to the pointedness of a concetto, the point of a pun, through which the addressee becomes aware of the act that is performed on her in the annunciation.2 Her angel is only the words of the book she reads, and whatever may happen to her during the process of reading and cause her to look up, it is not the hallucination of the prophesied redemption, physically approaching her in the form of an angel, This is a Messenger University Lecture given in the Hollis Cornell Auditorium of Cornell University on April 24, 2008.The precise wording of the text as printed here has been worked through and polished beyond the author's own capacities by Peter Goodrich, Kirk Wetters, Daniel Hoffman-Schwartz, and Natalie Nagel, to all of whom I owe more than mere linguistic clarifications of the matter. Long before Francesco Pellizzi's unfailing support, I had to thank Gottfried Boehm and Vera Beyer in Basel, Philip Lorenz, Cynthia Chase, and Jonathan Culler in Cornell for their pertinent questioning of material and method. 1.

The hand, hesitating before it breaks through the surface, supported only by the minimal trompe l'oeil of the desk, takes and tentatively encloses the apple. Its roundness, prepared in the form of the desk, comprehends and makes comprehensible an emptiness, which is a pending and gathering form before the picture; it imagines the object of desire shared by Mary with Eve in that moment. In participant anamnesis, the mimetic partaking in Eve's curious act of wanting to know, the surprised embarrassment by sin loosens, is resolved. This may be Antonello's truly sensational point, whose subtextual quality can only be measured against the theology of the time. It is difficult to grasp, still flourishing in the refinement of scholastic quisquilia.3 Anselm of Canterbury's theory of satisfaction, which had refuted the latent drives of mythical, Gnostic holdovers, had little success in influencing the iconography of the constellation that preceded it, Augustine's wildly Gnostic theory of deception and its manifold narrative embellishments in popular images.4 Certainly, some of these mythic moments are still, or once again, in play in Antonello's picture, but they do not indicate a modern free-floating aesthetic fantasy. Instead, they bring a new theological point out of its state of latency, a point that could no longer be held in check by the Fathers and was far from being finally settled by Canterbury's anti-Augustinian reconception of man's free will and epistemic possibility.5 In Antonello, the latency of conflict can be recognized in the symptomatic form of a reversal—the impression that it had left in the mainstream of the interpretatio Christiana. Like Eve, who seized the apple from the tree 3. It is not my concern in this essay to do either justice to, or quarrel with, the problematic inconsistencies of a theological understanding of iconography in this case—a most balanced account of Mary's virginity (not to be confused with the dogmatic issue of her immaculate conception), which can be found in Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologica III, xxx, iii, Editio altera Romana (Romae: Forzani, 1894), vol. IV, pp. 257 ff. This was confirmed in 1891—in the wake of the dogma of 1854—by Pope Leo XIII, Enchiridion Symbolorum, ed. H. Denzinger, A. Schonmetzer (Freiburg im Breisgau: Herder), Ed. XXXV (1973), p. 3274. The nineteenth-century interpretation of this complex story is by no means to be projected upon the late medieval state of affairs, which reads today somewhat like an unintended theological irony not far from the punning strategy of Antonello's Annunziata. Understood along those lines, the immaculate conception seems to prefigure in sheer literality the Holy Ghost's intervention, which, in turn, offered a pictorial screen memory of the hidden dogmatic trajectory. 4. See Hans Blumenberg's reading of Cur Deus Homo, Canterbury's masterpiece, in Arbeit am Mythos (Frankfurt/M: Suhrkamp, 1979), pp. 276-281, with whose presentation I disagree for once. For Canterbury's immediate theological context, see M. Corbin, Prière et raison de la foi: introduction à l'œuvre de S. Anselme de Cantorbery (Paris: Cerf, 1992), pp. 217 ff. 5. Katherin Rogers' book, Anselm on Freedom (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), appeared too late for me [why?], but among the many recent attempts at a reformulation of Canterbury's achievement, this book seems to be the best, particularly with respect to Anselm's revision of the Gnostic guilt-historical construct that was left squarely behind by Augustine (pp. 133 ff.). Against this, the image theory of Cur Deus Homo I.4 offered an impressive early antidote. See B. Leftow, "Anselm on the Cost of Salvation," Medieval Philosophy and Theology 6 (1997):73-92.</page><page sequence="4">Haverkamp: To conceive of in pictures 269 of knowledge and whose name, Eva, is reversed in the Angel's Ave, Mary picks the fruit of her body, the grace of which—gratia plena—is announced to her by the angel. The notorious palindrome Ave/Eva—about as famous as Roma/Amor—carries a heavy anti-Gnostic weight, twisting back the snake's distorting rhetoric and returning it to the Logos of annunciation.6 As the dogmatically refined point of the pun shows, there is no mythical narrative of salvation staged in this picture; instead, it offers the working through of an episteme. This is what singles out Mary, alone of her sex, and Antonello's painting gives an impression of that excellence. What distinguishes Mary, blessed among women, is displayed by a hand that firmly comes to grips, and is pictured in that very moment of her coming to know: a recognition, which is at the same time the overcoming of an obvious and all too understandable ambivalence oscillating between refusal and grasping in an uncontainable skepticism all her own. Antonello's painting reconstrues epistemologically what needs to be remembered and remains memorable in Mary's reading of the book—still an open book for her—of the Old Testament. She comes to grips with what happens to her. Breaking through her passive submission before the word's conception, breaking the surface of the narrated event of salvation, she emulates what she must bear following the words of Genesis—albeit in a different manner than the one authorized by the iconic tradition. Her decisive part in the redemption corresponds directly to the debt incurred by Eve; she uses it as a mortgage or potential capital, which could not be redeemed back then, at the beginning of time, in the state of the original fallen-ness from which, consequently, Mary is considered exempt. The old story of original guilt and deception turns into the epistemology of a new time, according to the immense re-perception in this painting. According to Antonello, in the immaculate conception of the savior, Mary did not just encounter a prophecy that would come true by dint of her following the typological relation of the Testaments, but instead she re-conceived the Old in the New. It had been foretold that she would overcome the guilt; but instead of passively carrying out the promised salvation, she assumed it within an act of knowing, whose risk her predecessor, curious Eve, had boldly taken. This means (and here it means Re-naissance), that in the place of the narratively worn down allegoresis of the history of salvation prefigured in the Old Testament, a new kind of metamorphosis is proposed according to antique measures. Antonello paints an Eva triumphans in which the snake's mythic apple—no longer visible to us—becomes the corporeal fruit of the reconciled father in heaven. August Sander's photograph stands on the distant other end of this prehistoric piece of modernity. Once again the hand of a girl breaks through the narrative remnants of a wretched story in which the gains of knowledge are once more squandered, and blindness takes the upper hand. Let us momentarily leave aside the heart-rending subtext of the "Last Men," which is actually closer to the milieu of Mary's story than Antonello's Northern Italian ambience. Two blind children stand in front of the bare, solidly laid brick wall of the institution that has taken them in, in front of a wall that condenses the intransparency of their world. What had miraculously emerged in the silent coordination of Mary's hand and gaze—raised up from the book and following the hand, immersed, without an angel in sight, in the act of conceiving—has by no means been lost in the humility of Sander's relocation. A narrow triangle, hardly noticeable in its extent, precedes Mary's extended hand in its grasping at the lower edge of Antonello's picture, allowing an extremely abbreviated handhold, barely present and almost unmotivated. No angel, if ever he might succeed to set foot there, would be able to intrude in this moment of conceiving on her own. What remains, however, is the light whose ray has this solitary woman emerge from the darkness of ages. A photographer would have hardly been able to come closer in his effort than the light left by the angel in Antonello's picture. The triangle where the blind children stand runs in the opposite direction, from right to left, toward the center of the image. It fashions a space in whose most distant left corner an opening shows, through which the daylight of this world asserts itself. In this courtyard, two children make a resolute stand, especially the girl, who allows the second child, like a little brother, to hold tightly onto her hand. She does not possess the elegance that would hold a stola in place, but rather a composed stillness that guides the reaching of her left hand in the same way that this hand advances the conception of the Madonna. There is no fascinated gaze, ambivalent at first, which might be able to accompany the burden imposed and carried in conception. The blind are spared 6. See M. Werner, Die Entstehung des christlichen Dogmas (Bern: Haupt, 1941; 1954), the abridged English translation (London: Black/ New York: Harper, 1957), and comprehensive German edition (1959), p. 118, where Tertullian is cited for the palindrome Ave/Eva's mytho theological underpinnings: The snake had twisted her name.</page><page sequence="5">270 RES 59/60 SPRING/AUTUMN 2011 fc Figure 3.

Born blind, the miracle of Mary is renewed behind closed lids—renewed, reflected, reversed—bringing conception into knowing and knowledge to conception. There is a sense of "transfiguration" that prevails in Sander's photographs and is denied least of all to "the idiots, the sick and the mad" of the "Last of the People," including the dead who follow on the last pages of Sander's collection under the bare title of "Matter." Abandoned by all spirit, they emerge in the fullest possible radiance, as in the very last picture, of an old woman who lies transfigured in the light of photography's light-writing on her deathbed (fig. 3). It would hardly be too much to say that the old woman restitutes the discovery that Antonello inaugurated. We need not go so far as to recognize in her the virgin Mary on her deathbed; we would have to compare her to Caravaggio's inglorious version, which is left behind, surpassed and, at the same time, enforced in its worldly charm, in the light of Sander's photograph.8 It is not, however, the question of an interpretive result, which could enable a "transfiguration of the commonplace."9 The discovery of spirit in this picture (although not necessarily the Holy Spirit that may have initiated it) depends on a pictorial tradition whose crux has been described as "iconic difference." Iconic difference marks—I paraphrase the art historian Gottfried Boehm's pregnant definition—"an at once visual and logical power, which designates the peculiarity of the image as image, in so far as it irreversibly belongs to a material culture and is inscribed in matter in an unavoidable manner, but allows at the same time and in the same moment a meaning to shine forth, which simultaneously surpasses everything that appears to be merely factual."10 Within this simultaneity, a process of concept-formation and conceptual differentiation that has been named "metaphorology" by the philosopher Hans Blumenberg foregrounds the "logic" in which the material value of images underlies and is subjected 7.

Beginning with the first and minimal positing of a neutral surface limited by a frame, which provides the material basis of any picture, we read and are able to follow the movements and displacements of iconic difference in metaphorological terms: as a process of conceptual differentiation, in which image and language approach one another reciprocally, without any priority of the one over the other. They mutually illuminate each other through a "hidden categoriality" that allows something to be pictured and to appear as an image.12 Metaphorology aims at the technical center of iconic difference. Thus, it is the point of iconic difference to include and contain within the picture the differentiating moment that is thematized in the conception of metaphor and derives from the function of thematization itself.13 The reciprocal approach and its illuminating effect, therefore, require a more or less explicit mark. In the case of Antonello and Sander the mark is of a categorical, explicitly image-inducing nature and no question of mere visualization: The scene of annunciation is taken at its word, a word whose illocutionary power and performative force is visually staged on the canvas while its very revelatory value is exposed as pictorial. The metaphorological frame is simple in the case of conceiving, because it is literally manifest in the lexical variants of the word "conception" and, more tellingly, in the metaphorological divide that governs the lexicon of conceiving. While the German word Begriff, centerpiece of Hegel's conception of philosophy, conceives of concepts as active agents of a grasping, seizing, taking hold of, the conception in the Latin-derived forms of Romance languages and English imply or presuppose a passive moment of reception along with what is actively conceived and brought into the state of a firm and manifest concept. Thus to conceive of something is not yet, or no longer, a Begreifen that would take hold of something, but include a receptive completion. While the philosophical concept after Descartes (but also already in every scholastic mode of terminologization) is a relatively fixed entity, the latter kind of conception (which is by no means the historically later kind) exists mainly as completion: through completing—gratia plena—the act of conceiving. The pun is telling and by no means coincidental (although obviously not substantial): it is a question of coming to know. Austin spoke rather fittingly of something "happily brought off" in the moment of a successful conceiving.14 While the philosophical Begriff jumps to a conclusion that ultimately asks for a Hegelian solution, the field of conceptions lies prior to the solidified nominal existence of the concepts in waiting, which are the objects of conceptual histories. Upon reflecting on this pre-nominal field let us return to the evidence of the pictures. II. The space of conception: Giovanni Bellini, Caravaggio Antonello's Annunziata comes without a frame, and it seems that every attempt to make it part of a framing installation could only produce disappointment. Clearly, following the gaze of the Madonna, the angel is not in the picture. She could not possibly be casting her eyes at the feet of the angel that would be landing in front of her, as we find him—still in vibration—in Gerard David's Annunciation at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (fig. 4). This does not mean that we cannot in any way conceive of a history of installation for Antonello's painting, but it would require an extraordinary exposition of iconic • difference. In David's work, the original installation can still be traced through the raised finger of the angel, which points to the main altar between the two pictures and connects the annunciation scene to the primary narrative of the redemption and passion on the cross. For David, then, the announcement is part of a framing narrative whose installation introduces, serves, and supports that which is at stake on the altar and awaits performance. To redraw Antonello's epistemological point in broader strokes, I turn to Giovanni Bellini's Venice. The fit could not be better, but not (or not just), however, on account of Antonello's influence in Venice, so 11. H. Blumenberg, Paradigmen zu einer Metaphorologie (Bonn: Bouvier, 1960/Frankfurt/M: Suhrkamp, 1998). The complementarity of Blumenberg's "metaphorology" and Boehm's theory of "iconic difference" goes back to Heidegger's "ontological difference" whose historical unfolding in a History of Being—Seinsgeschichte—informs the backdrop of Blumenberg's method, as well as my conception of a Begreifensgeschichte instead of a Heideggerian Seinsgeschichte. 12.

Certainly, Antonello's Annunziata, which was probably painted in Venice in 1475-1476 (a poor copy of it is still to be seen in the Accademia), would be a crucial part of this influence. But more importantly for my purpose here are some of Bellini's innovations, which may be taken as reflections upon Antonello and could provide a contexture of installation for—if not following—Antonello's picture. In his conception ofVenetian altars, Bellini makes traceable the reflection of iconic difference with direct consequences to framing and installation. The prime example is the altar of San Giobbe, as we find it now reconstructed in the Accademia (fig. 5).15 m Figure 5.

Here it is possible to follow the perfect coordination and extension of the space of the church into the painted space of the sacred doctrine, into the expositio mystica, the mystical exposition of the mysterium that is enacted upon the altar. By extending the gaze beyond the altar, a liminal sphere is opened, which begins at 15. R. Goffen, "Bellini, S. Giobbe and Altar Egos," Artibus et historiae 14 (1986):57-70. P.

Bellini has thematized this enigmatic antechamber in a truly mysterious painting that can be seen in the Uffizi in Florence, a picture whose many riddles have never been solved and whose allegorical thrust has remained an enigma for professional iconographers up to now. Its historically acquired title is that of a Sacra Allegoria (fig. 6). Here the space of the sacred conversation—and that is the key to this picture—appears in a rotation of (virtually) 90 degrees, so that the mystical depth that opens up behind the canvas takes a space of its own and becomes graspable in the extension, which is skipped over in the continuity of the perspective of the altar.16 This space, which sets itself apart like the stage of some theatrical performance, is called a "Sacra Allegoria" not by coincidence: it is an allegory of mystical spacing, in which the figures of the sacra conversazione take over the space that extends beyond the ritual, displaying a state of heavenly transfiguration in their attributes (in the case of martyrs, through their wounds and the instruments that caused them, and in the case of the Church Fathers, through their scholarly tools of interpretation in the interpretatio Christiana). In the Uffizi, the poetics of the genre of sacra conversazione are exposed and the allegory is revealed: The children playing with the apples of paradise under the tree, the little Christ child among them, meditated by the virtuosi Saints, chaired by the Madonna. The self-irony of the old Bellini, who remained capable and keen to compete with his younger peers, has couched the scene in a superb parody of allusions to Giorgione and Carpaccio, applying the older schema of mystical meditation to the new medium of landscape. This consequence of his later years is of no small importance for his earlier design of sacred negotiation. The result in San Giobbe is an allegorical atrium of the mysterium, which lies between the actual performance on the altar and the pictorially illustrated dogmatic truth. Separated from the altar that lies beneath, expanding it within the picture, the use of perspective is mere illusion, so that the impression of the unbroken totality of space 16. Salvatore Settis, La Tempesta interpretata (Torino: Einaudi, 1978), p. 111. G. Robertson in Giovanni Bellini (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1968) came close to proposing "a meditation on the incarnation" (101 ), while the recent subtitle under the image, provided by some desperate curator at the Uffizi, has turned it into an ironic display of ignorance: "Unidentified cultural objects."

Their difference remains barely noticeable beneath the perception of the apparent continuity of spatial illusion, and the allegory of the surrounding figures amounts to no more than the shorthand of a canonical narrative, which could, in the case of Masaccio in Florence, extend itself from the altar as center towards the city and include the whole community.17 But such a modernist plausibility of the picture remains shortsighted and pragmatically biased. The conversion within that conversation, which transpires in the pictorial space beyond the altar, is hardly sensed by historians, although it occupies the whole space of the painting. It lies sealed within the picture, folded into the very iconic difference that it exposes. Using a notorious visual metaphor by Wittgenstein—his favorite metaphor—one might say: It is a matter of showing, rather than saying, since it shows itself sealed within it. This crypsis of space whose access is covered and exposed at the same time—escaping the secularized rationality of later viewers—is the definition of the altar as a locus, which in the performance displays and veils in one single stroke. The transitional objectivity of the sacra conversazione conceals with its narrative appeal the iconic differential that has been installed within it. This means that it stands in the way of what it signifies; it puts at risk and distorts the interior logic that is to develop beyond its figuration. The signifying office of these figures may have sufficed for the usual indoctrination from the pulpit ad recte credendum. The theological claim of these paintings, however, went beyond: The mystical space that is opened within the iconic fold is not one of narrative display and representation, but it is also not one of performance. It precedes, it seems, the performing of the performance. Another altar painting by the late Bellini—Ruskin once called it the high point of occidental art—takes account of this theoretical necessity, which establishes nothing other than the principal role of art for the theology of the cult, and not just art's explanatory function for the larger community.18 The Madonna of San Zacearía can still be found in its original location. It has been marked over time by alterations that came at the cost of impairment to perspective. But since perfect transparency is not at stake here, this is not an overwhelming loss. In this picture Bellini marks— minimally, but explicitly—what remains otherwise and elsewhere in an unmarked state of imperception (fig. 7). In order to deepen the illusion of continuity in space, the altarpiece in San Zacearía repeats the architectonic joint of the church within the image itself and does so, more radically than in San Giobbe, in a self-thematizing moment characteristic of the genre. In this particular painting, however, this moment of self-thematization is further marked—and this extra emphasis is decisive. Behind the space of the altar and extending into its Figure 7.

Unframed and without background, like an apparition in the artificial illumination of a writing—an early photograph avant la lettre—this Maria appears as if out of herself. As Bellini's more complicated construct explains, in Antonello she appears on the surface of the image, on a screen that makes a difference, that she herself mediates and whose ontotheological constitution is raised in her conception to the concept of an image that is the fruit of the art of painting. In Bellini, the picture exposes the iconic difference in the thwarted allegory of a salvation narrative that it ruptures; in Antonello this narrative did not even enter the picture any more. The trompe d'oeil of the protruding desk that stages the conception, jumping out of the surface of the painting—an effect which Caravaggio's Milanese Canestra would familiarize as a gesture of epiphany—refuses all depth, with the effect of coming to the fore in the act of conceiving (fig. 9). Quite differently from Caravaggio's transcendental ¡zed gloria, Antonello (as if in an effort to surpass this afterimage of his intervention in advance) puts all the investment of the esoteric reading, which Caravaggio uses in the lustrous symbolism of the fruits, in his Maria's attraction. Along with the face, whose gaze follows the hand, the painting exposes her throat and shoulder through an opening in the scarf, which remains the painting's sole invocation of an interiority beyond the canvas but does not stop there: It seems to lead behind the image more than into it. That which the cloth covers and shrouds in darkness—while allowing an extremely corporeal presence to shine through—is not the dark background of the canvas, into which the world sinks at this moment. It is the cloaked mysterium covered in the hard shadow of her lightning-flash of recognition: the crypsis of the Word's becoming flesh, whose metaphorological other is the act of conceiving as an image. The bare wall upon which Caravaggio's fruits anticipate the iconic differential—and, thereby, rehearse the denial of a realism to come—is restricted to the lowly material behind which no mysterium remains.19 All that remains of the crucifixion, which the fruits of Caravaggio present as a worldly transfiguration, is the traces of the nails (difficult to see and almost never recognized), which (pretend to) affix this picture to the wall with the same literal brutality as the redeemer upon the cross. They represent (in the newest, truest sense of a re-presentation) the brutality of the suffering that they 19. N. Bryson, Looking at the Overlooked (London: Reaction Books, 1990), p. 80. A.

Such brutality would be inconceivable to an Antonello or Bellini: For them, it would have been like a return of that which had to be mastered by the cult, and in whose literal repetition the image would deny itself as image. Against this denial, Robert Ryman (to cite only one recent and most prominent example), who has treated surfaces with a similar degree of exclusivity, does not impede the accident of reflection but provokes it, asks for it, awaits it—collecting the possibilities of whatever light may be cast. In short, his pictures put a mirror of light in the place of the annunciation; this light does not show in the reproduction, but depends on the correct hanging in a suitable place (fig. 10).20 In order to break this effect, which amounts to an almost conditioned reflex, one must develop martial measures like Ryman's friend José Urbach, who literally cuts a window into the surface of the material (and not only, like Ryman himself, breaks up or damages occasionally the edges), and within this hole which no longer hides, but opens an absolute space of iconic difference (an empty space that is not a picture within the picture), he pounds the nail upon which the picture is hung. He makes no longer a painting but construes a mnemonic pause for reflection. The art of painting, whose fallibility Caravaggio once proved in the face of the work of redemption, does not require this proof. It does not need it, because of its conceptual force.21 The doubling of allegory in which, ever since Bellini, the sacra conversazione has presided over the space of a deeper mystery—conventionally that of anagogy, which preceded pastoral tropology—is exposed in San Zacearía. It is laid out upon the surface of the painting as a conceptual ambition that goes deeper. The Madonna is enthroned as an image that repeats the theological accomplishment of the image in which it is embedded, and in this way it is finally and for the first time really completed. Like Wittgenstein's fly bottle, which requires the awareness of the structural undecidability of the difference between the bottle and its opening (if we want to show the fly the way out), the iconic difference upon Figure 10.

The space within the space, which is cryptically registered in the image, is not that of another type of Being, nor would this existence be allegorically representable. But, in self-surpassing the space of conceiving, the act of conceiving which is called faith is co-conceived as the receptive mode of all conception. Ultimately, Antonello's frameless image provides a self-sufficient inner view in which the history of conceiving frees itself from the primal scenes of pictorial self-surpassing. An object of meditation, it is no longer embedded in the cult, whose pragmatism it escapes. The transcendental presumption in which the representation of transcendence has reflected itself in pictures and to which it from time to time sees itself relapsing or receding (in visual or pictorial turns), is that of concepts that would not be conceivable without reflecting their conditions of representability. Thus, no mystical foundation of pictorial thought becomes visible here, only the non-conceptual backdrop of a conceiving in pictures—fides quaerens intellectum was Canterbury's 20.

Through the radicality of its intervention, the picture has historicized the concept of conceiving to the deadening point of a paleonymic unrecognizability. But, in the same stroke, this same intercession has enabled a renewed conception. This is the caesura of the rememorative reiteration, which the cult attempts always anew in the word that is made flesh. Bellini's altars had redefined this undertaking not in its narrative content but in its mystic constitution. III. A phenomenology of distance: Blumenberg Allow me a brief moment of digression, if only in order to provide you with a first sense of a possible ending, and let me come back to the metaphorology of knowing contained in these pictures. None of the grounding figures of phenomenology could be better captured by the immaculate conception through an angel than the actio per distans proposed by Hans Blumenberg as the basic anthropological trait of all concept-formation. A blatant rhetorical paradox, the term actio per distans embodies the (almost magical) ability of persuasion to overcome distance, in physics as well as in theology.23 Blumenberg takes up the dubious old formula actio per distans and postulates it as an anthropogenetic principle, the decisive moment in the first use of concepts: What makes a rational animal human is acting from a distance.24 What is decisive for Blumenberg is how concepts surface from the undifferentiated ground of non-conceptuality and come to structure space. Thus, the double requirement of the Cartesian clare et distincte names a spatial achievement that rationalizes the gains and profits of space through a management of distance, which in turn renders concepts operable and enables conception. The anthropological hypothesis of a paleogenesis of conceiving tries to escape "Husserl's God"—Blumenberg's name for the historical coincidence of phenomenological reduction and the theology of incarnation. Instead, he proposes to work on a different myth, the heuristic fiction of an enlightened anthropology after Darwin. That much, however, may be clear: The intuition of an anthropogenetic phenomenology of distance is not less susceptible to ideological encumbrances than those the discarded histories of biblical interpretation had to face.25 No longer impressed by such narratives, the fascination with prehistory has to deal with other referential traps that it hides, of the fossils instead of the reliquaries. In any case, "Husserl's God" seems a laconic name for the trans-historical ambition of recent phenomenological research. Whether the interpretation of the fossils of an empirical origin or of the remnants of an immemorial myth offers a more enlightened version of the history of conceiving and coming to know than the interpretation of texts and images had offered, I find difficult to decide in the light of Antonello's Annunziata. It may be, again, the other way around, and Husserl's phenomenological reduction exposes the hard core of a theology that after centuries of secularizing revisions had turned opaque. This core also resists historicizing efforts such as Hans Belting's attempt to contain, and thereby deduce, the theological impact of the pictures as a pre-historical investment which, in the inexplicable "riddle" of Antonello's picture, could not very well have transcended itself, but was stuck in abysmal repetition. Thus, in Belting's monumental undertaking, Antonello's achievement turns into an allegory of new historicism: The "epiphany," which "prepares" its coming out in Antonello's "human woman Mary," draws on a cryptic enclosure of sacred icons "before art," an older tradition which is cited, and certainly alluded to, by Antonello who, as it were, according to Belting, had nothing but "de-sacralized" the older pictorial genre and stripped it of its religious mortgage.26 What would have been left, however, and would remain, is the "idol" purified, 22.

By comparison, Sander's undertaking is marked by the "heroic melancholy" of the modern age, namely that in this kind of knowledge no spark of redemption is left. In this heroism, Sander gave Walter Benjamin the greatest cause for admiration.28 Melanchthon's melencolia heroica, which Benjamin uncovered as Baudelaire's muse, is entirely consumed in the Ecce homo that comprises Sander's subtext. The space in which its picture is exhibited is that of the elided concept: The blind children live within this space as at the lost outpost of a representability without annunciation in sight, but with Antonello's intuition miraculously reasserting itself. Thus, Sander produces the image of a self-effacing kenosis that was prophesied by Hegel to all art after religion. In this kenosis, the transfiguration through conceiving is not denied to the idiots, nor can it be taken away from them. The cosmic order guaranteed by a God whose son is the logos may be withdrawn. In San Zacearía already the Father God was frozen for good to an unreadable mask: He was and remains now forever outside of the ages. The profane illumination that remains operative in Sander's photography does not need to mention him anymore. Like Antonello's annunciation without angel, it operates in the light of a feminine reason, which revokes the paternal law and sees through the nominal difference that finds itself, true to nature, represented in iconic terms. Soon the withdrawal symptoms of modernity made photography the fatherless society's symptom and hope. Against this, Sander, like Roland Barthes, whose theory of photography insists on the singular, irreproducible picture of the mother, resists of old.29 A first sense of an ending, then: Not only are the linguistic and the pictorial availability of the world co-originary, but each side presupposes the originarity of the other, with the effect of making the origin itself objectless. Because it is an economy that furthers the management of distance, it is suited to the status of an anthropomorphic meta-metaphor. Just as the a priori body of Maurice Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology has preserved the plausible trait of one last anthropomorphism, Blumenberg's idea of an "ontological distance" remains fascinated by an objectless origin that informs the economies of distance. It may just as well be a god like Husserl's or Bellini's or the geometrizing god of Plato. But that is not all there is to be said. Antonello's interpretation of Mary's immaculate conception as a recognition whose prohibition was cancelled is in more than one way instructive: Theology is not secularized or aestheticized in Antonello's picture; it is at its strongest possible position, in that it provides profane illumination. It connects the enlightenment, which we are ready to perceive in this painting, with the possibility of a new theodicy, in which God the Father of the Old Testament unburdens himself and his predicates from the history of guilt that had threatened him and his creation at all times and more urgently for the time that remained—at the cost, in short, of a final judgment. In place of the performative self-contradiction of a continual deferral that was to accompany the continuation of guilt, a coming to know emerged that was unburdened by guilt. Ever after Mary, a knowing grows out of the pre conceptual state of things that maintains and preserves itself the way images are conceived of: through the interruption of guilt and the annunciation of love even among those, and especially to them, who are blind and soon to be dead. IV. The supplement of perspective: Giovanni di Paolo There is a historical supplement to this sort of an ending to be added, which does not amount to another sense, but to some amplification of the first one. In short, Antonello's picture is a picture within a picture, but, unlike in Bellini, it is without that (second) picture. Unframed iconic difference brings it close to a photograph, a late genre that persuades by its essentially frameless state of existence. But as in Bellini, Antonello's frameless "being there" does not come without a mark, whereas for Sander it has become part of the apparatus that provides light automatically and renders visuality an unmarked tautology. In contrast to photography, the advancement in the process of knowledge recorded by Antonello and Bellini was closely connected with a 27. See Jean-Luc Marion's response to Derrida's "différance" in L'Idole et la distance (Paris: Grasset, 1977), p. 264, which he made in (an unwitting) conjunction with Blumenberg's "distance" and Boehm's "iconic difference." 28.

Cress Collection, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. heightened awareness of iconic difference, an awareness culminating in the refinement and sophistication of pictorial space. Hubert Damisch, Louis Marin, and Daniel Arasse have shown how the iconographie elaboration of annunciation is connected with, and acted out in the technical achievements of perspective. Antonello's painting seems to escape this development, although the perspective is not simply absent in the annunciation from Palermo; instead it is markedly reversed. Instead of leading into the picture, it is popping out of the surface like a trompe l'oeil. In Antonello's Virgin Annunciate, the retraction of perspective in the podium that juts outward supports the mysterium of the scripture that rests upon it in the form of the book, but also in the hand reaching out, presenting itself as a rupture of space before its perspectiva! encoding. This is something other than the known self-thematization of representation, which seeks to assert itself in the perspectival development.30 If anything, Antonello does the opposite, barring the entrance and thereby presenting the iconic difference that is the picture as such, in the virginity of conceiving. The exalted logic of self-representation that unfolds itself in perspective according to Marin and Arasse is effaced in Antonello's painting in an act bordering on self-effacement. Antonello and Bellini are untouched by the vanities of self-promotion. Arasse does not mention the Palermo Annunciation, which does not fit his thesis. But he uses an image that is suited to illuminate the accomplishment of Antonello indirectly; it contains an archeology of the motif of perspective. Giovanni di Paolo's Annunciation and Expulsion from Paradise in Washington frames the perspectival setting of the annunciation within the cosmological time-space of salvation: as a space capsule in the stream of time, an ark in the divine plan of salvation (fig. 11 ). Arasse rightly emphasizes the citational character of this setting, which manufactures the perspective of annunciation from the very stuff of the Garden of Eden. The counterpart of this annunciation in the Lehmann collection of the Metropolitan Museum shows how the historical design of salvation implies, if not necessitates, Antonello's consequence (fig. 12). The painting in the Lehmann collection compresses Creation and Fall in a telescopic abbreviation: The Creator God hovers above the clouds, his raised finger 30. L.

The painting of the annunciation, on the other end of the Old Testament, shows the telescopic connection of the ages from the perspective of the redeeming moment: It depicts the same God the Father above the same Garden of Eden, which continues to blossom uninterruptedly, while Mary not only views this primordial prediction from her very own windows of the time-unit of her epoch, but sees the angel of the annunciation, as if he were coming straight from the scene of the Fall, and this scene offers itself to her in the original state of temptation, the eternally golden apples of Paradise still hanging from the trees. Giovanni's telescopage of the Ages (which, by the way, offers a first cartographically correct spatial perspective of the globe, anachronistically enclosed by the heavenly spheres that shall keep surrounding it in the series of world pictures to follow) puts the perspective into place within the Creator's plan, pointing to March 25, the liturgical date of the annunciation.31 The painting's space is that of the eons, in which the space of perspective finds its place in and as the scene of the annunciation in its proper sense. The difference between these spaces is folded inward, marking the painting as the place of iconic difference in such a way that the emphasis falls on the moment of recognition as the precondition of redemption: its arrival in the form of the angel that steps out of the differential image. Cited out of paradise, he stands at the gate of the expulsion whose redemption he is always ready to announce. Giovanni di Paolo proves the possibility of Antonello. Maybe, more precisely, he helps to reconstruct the question to which Antonello provides a sublime answer on the highest level of theological sophistication. The theological condition of possibility may have been in the air—or maybe not. Mary's obedience, which the iconography of perspective reduced to the symbol of a lily on the floor, symbol of the pure maiden, did more than cover an account which had been pre-settled ages ago. That this was no sexual matter of this world is manifest, in Giovanni's version, next door, where Joseph comes into the picture, heating up a stove whose smoke rises to heaven like that of a burnt offering. Mary's purity is paradisiacal in origin, as Canterbury had underscored in his ontogenetic (and that meant, cosmogenic) argument against the gnostic mainstream; her purity was cosmic from the beginning. It attests to the maid's openness towards a knowing from whose anamnesis after the fall redemption could proceed. Certainly, this maid did not remove sin from the world, but the humility of the knowledge that was her conception rendered all sin inoperative for this moment. It cannot be measured by perspective; it lies folded within, like the grasping of the ones that are born blind. 31. See G. Didi-Huberman, Fra Angélico: Dissemblance et Figuration (Paris: Flammarion, 1990), p. 123.</page></plain_text>
