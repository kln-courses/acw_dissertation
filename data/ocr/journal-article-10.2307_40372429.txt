<plain_text><page sequence="1">JACQUES LE FATALISTE AND DIDEROT S EQUINE SYMBOLISM By Leon Schwartz In a little-noticed article by Diderot, inserted in Grimm's Correspondance littéraire, philosophique et critique in 1763, the author makes this comparison between the sculptor Bouchar- don and a horse he was sculpting : " II ressemblait tout à fait de caractere à Fanimal surprenant qui lui a servi de modele pour sa statue de Louis XV ; doux dans le repos, fier, noble, plein de feu et de vie dans Faction. "* The man-horse analogy suggested in this passage is a minor but none the less frequent and significant theme in Diderot's writings, where analogy and symbolism are devices whose importance is receiving more and more critical attention.2 The subject of the analogical or symbolic use of animals has been broached by Georges May in his study of three key Diderotian symbols in Jacques le fataliste, the third of these being the dog symbol.3 But Professor May's purpose is not to study Diderot's animal ana- logies per se, and he makes no reference to what must be iEd.

One is struck, on first reading Jacques le fataliste, by the number of incidents in which horses play a determining role. Of the fifty odd incidents and anecdotes that constitute the links in this novel that Goethe, in reminiscence of Rousseau's famous metaphor, once called " a chain of steel that a garland hides from our eyes, " no less than fourteen have a horse as a principal character, either as part of the story itself or as a determining factor in how the story is told.4 In the very beginning the reader is informed that it is because Jacques, intoxicated on bad wine, failed to water his father's horses that the chain of events leading him from his father's house to the Desglands castle, in the end of the novel, is unleashed.5 And it is because Jacques's horse abandons him at the scene of the slaying of Saint-Ouin by Jacques's master that he is imprisoned, meets the Mandrin gang, saves the Desglands 4 In the first category are the stories of why Jacques joined the army, the woman who fell from her horse, Jacques's chastening of the cut-throats, Jacques's and his master's knee injuries, Jacques's recovery of his master's watch and wallet, the theft of the master's horse, the funeral cortege of Jacques's captain, the hangman's horse and Jacques's head injury, the hangman's horse as an omen of Jacques's fate, the overturning of Père Hudson's carriage, the recov- ery of the master's horse, the master pulled from his horse by Jacques, Jacques arrested for the " murder " of Saint-Ouin. In the second category is the constant interruption by a horse of the story of Jacques's Captain. 6 " ... j'oublie de mener nos chevaux à l'abreuvoir. Mon père s'en aperçoit ; il se fache. Je hoche de la tête ; il prend un bâton et m'en frotte durement les épaules. Un regiment passait pour aller au camp devant Fontenoy ; de dépit je m'enrole. Nous arrivons ; la bataille se donne. Le Mattre - Et tu reçois la balle à ton adresse. Jacques - Vous l'avez devine ; un coup de feu au genou ; et Dieu sait les bonnes et mauvaises aventures amenées par ce coup de feu. Elles se tiennent ni plus ni moins que les chainons d'une gourmette " (CEuvres romanesques, éd. Henri Bénac [Paris, 1962], pp. 493-494).

Horses are therefore the first and last links in the chain of fate that constitutes the novel structure. But, even more significantly, the horse, as the bearer of Jacques and his master on the road to the enigmatic castle, symbol of man's earthly journey (p. 513), must be acknowledged as the third of the three principal protagonists in the novel. Georges May has said that Diderot was inclined to use other authors' works as a point of departure for his own literary creations, but that he had the gift of transmuting the borrowed subject into something new and characteristically Diderotian.6 Thus it is that, in borrowing the device of the mounted adventurers from Cervantes and the picaresque novel, Diderot infuses his principal characters - master, servant, and horses - with a multiple symbolism that one will not find in their prototypes.7 One recognizes in the allegory of the master and servant riding to their destiny on the animal of fate the primary symbolic use of the horse in this novel. The analogy between the horse and fate is explicitly drawn in the description of Jacques's careless manner of guiding his mount : " Son usage était de le laisser aller à sa fantaisie ; car il trouvait autant d'inconvénient à Farrêter quand il galopait, qu'à le presser quand il marchait lentement. Nous croyons conduire le destin; mais c'est toujours lui qui nous mène..." (p. 520). There are several incidents in the novel where the actions of horses are analogous to the workings of fate. When the master refuses to believe that Jacques's knee injury can be as painful as described, his horse stumbles and he hurts his own knee (p. 508). Again, when Jacques attempts to tell the story 6 " Diderot, artiste et philosophe du décousu," in Europäische Aufklärung: Herbert Dieckmann . . ., pp. 170-171. 7 In his article on Diderot's use of allegory and symbolism Professor Fabre has studied the various levels of symbolism in the characters of Jacques and his master. 243</page><page sequence="4">LEON SCHWARTZ of his captain, his mount, continually pulling him off the road, interrupts the story and finally carries Jacques away from his master, leaving both men helpless, for, as Diderot informs us, "...Jacques et son maítre ne sont bons qu'ensemble et ne valent rien separes non plus que Don Quichotte sans Sancho et Richardet sans Ferragus . . ." (p. 553). The interruptions of Jacques's stories, more than a literary trick of Diderot's, are symbolic of man's lack of control of his fate and are an important example of the fusion of form and content in Diderot's novel. When the master complains about Jacques's failure to complete his stories, the latter replies : " Je le veux toujours ; mais le destín, lui, ne le veut pas. Est-ce que vous ne voyez pas qu'aussitot que j'en ouvre la bouche, le diable s'en mele, et qu'il survient toujours quelque incident qui me coupe la parole? Je ne les finirai pas, vous dis-je, cela est écrit là-haut " (p. 536). That fate plays tricks on man when he attempts to foretell " what is written " is demonstrated by the horse carrying Jacques to the gallows, leading the master to predict that Jacques will die by the noose and suffer a " philosophic death " (p. 563). 8 That man ultimately cannot control his fate is implied in the final episode in the story of the lascivious Père Hudson, who, having outwitted by guile and brazenness all who have attempted to unmask him, is finally publicly exposed as a lecher by the accidental over- turning of his horse-drawn carriage (pp. 683-684). While the horse itself is curiously absent from Diderot's comic " ta- bleau " of the overturning of Père Hudson, and the visible agent of the monk's mortification is the coachman's dog, there seems to be a real, if not explicitly stated, analogy between 8 As is the case with many of the episodes in the novel, the incident lends itself to multiple interpretation. The fact that the behavior of the horse is later revealed to be due to his once having belonged to the hangman would indicate that, on another level, Diderot the empiricist, like Fontenelle in his " Fable of the Golden Tooth," was making fun of the idle speculations of the rationalistic philosophers, as symbolized by Jacques's master. 244</page><page sequence="5">diderot's equine symbolism the ultimate cause of the accident, a skittish horse that has bolted the scene, and fickle fortune, Lucretius' vis abdita.2 The horse as fate or as its instrument may be recognized as the primary equine symbol in the novel, a symbol possibly inspired by the horses of the Apocalypse or of Hippolytus' death chariot, but it is not without its ambiguities.10 For, if certain incidents suggest that man cannot control his destiny, others suggest that he is sometimes an active collaborator with fate. One such incident is that in which Jacques causes his master to fall from his horse to prove that man is not his own master : Jacques - ... Monsieur mon maitre en conviendra-t-il à present? Le Maitre - Et de quoi veux-tu que je convienne, chien, coquin, infame, sinon que tu es le plus méchant de tous les valets, et que je suis le plus malheureux de tous les maitres? Jacques - N'est-il pas évidemment demontre que nous agissons la plupart du temps sans le vouloir? . . . N'avez-vous pas été ma marionnette, et n'auriez-vous pas continué d'etre mon polichinelle pendant un mois, si je me l'étais propose (pp. 774-775)? 9 It is also pertinent to note that fate in Diderot's novels prank- ishly punishes the strong-willed or tjtie stubborn, those who, like Père Hudson, believe themselves masters of their fate, by falls from horses. One recalls the humiliating fall of the shrewish woman riding tandem behind a surgeon in an early episode (p. 496) and the fall of Jacques's master near the end of the novel (see below). 10 In his Lettre sur les sourds et muets (CEuures completes, éd. J. Assézat, M. Tourneux [20 vols. ; Paris, 1875-1877], I, 382) Diderot alludes to and defends the following passage from Racine in which Hippolyte is carried to his doom : II suivait, tout pensif, le chemin de Mycène ; Sa main sur les chevaux laissait flotter les rênes : Ses süperbes coursiers, qu'on voyait autrefois Pleins d'une ardeur si noble obéir à sa voix, L'ceil morne maintenant et la tete baissée, Semblaient se conformer à sa triste pensée (Phèdre, V, vi). The analogy between horse and man implied in this passage may also have influenced Diderot's similar analogy in his own writings (see below, p. 250. 245</page><page sequence="6">LEON SCHWARTZ Jacques the determinist thus argues paradoxically that he has freely served as fate's accomplice in controlling his master's actions. A man is here the active and a horse the passive instrument of fate. The philosophic hypothesis that a strong man may guide fate as the skilled rider guides his mount is a counter-theme in the novel to the deterministic hypothesis repeatedly enunciated by Jacques, and illuminates Diderot's philosophic motives in each of his stories.11 In spite of his materialistic determinism Diderot's pro- found emotional need to believe that man may exercise some control over his fate impelled him toward an almost obsessive preoccupation with the subject of human heroism and genius. His favorite metaphor for grandeur and génie was a fiery steed that only the great may ride. Thus, in a passage comparing the ordinarily slow pace of human progress to its astonishing leaps forward when a rare genius appears, Diderot writes : " L' experience, qui marche à pas lents, demande du temps ; et le génie qui, semblable aux coursiers des dieux, franchit un intervalle immense d' un saut, se fait attendre pendant des siècles." 12 The horse symbolizing genius in this quotation, and in the description of Bouchardon cited above, is a slight mutation of the horse-fate analogy. It suggests that though man is not " free," that though he is subject to the governance of fate (les dieux), some men are fated, like Bellerophon, to ride the winged steed of glory. Not surprisingly, there is an explicit reference to Pegasus as genius in Diderot's writings : " Si j'avais la critique à peindre, je la montrerais arrachant les plumes à Pégase, et le pliant aux allures de l'académie. II 11 In his article " Le Maitre, la chaíne et le chien . . . ," Georges May demonstrates how Diderot's stories illustrate the triumph of the strong over the weak : " Les hommes faibles sont les chiens des homines fermes " (p. 280). Also, on the doctrine of man's collabo- ration with fate, see Jean Thomas, U Humanisme de Diderot (Paris, 1938), p. 103. 12 Observations sur le Nakaz, in CEuvres politiques, éd. Paul Ver- nière (Paris, 1963), pp. 366-367. 246</page><page sequence="7">diderot's equine symbolism n'est plus cet animal fougueux, qui hermit, gratte la terre du pied, se cabre et déploie ses grandes ailes ; c'est une bete de somme, la monture de Fabbé Morellet, prototype de la méthode." 13 Thus, true genius is a fiery charger, unbridled by the harness of convention, while mediocrity is a beast broken to the burden of " method." There is a third equine symbol in Diderot's writings, the hippogriff. It first appeared in the dream episode of Les Bijoux indiscrets, a fantastic animal with the head and wings of an eagle, the feet of a griffin, the body of a horse, and the tail of a lion, on which Sultan Mangogul made an oniric journey to the never-never land of philosophic hypotheses (pp. 114-117). Diderot thus uses an equine freak as the symbol of perverted genius or wrong-headedness. The hippo- griff symbol is used again with similar import in the Paradoxe sur le comedien, where Diderot calls the perversion of the historical figures of Cinna, Cléopâtre, Mérope, and Agrippine in the French theater " les fantômes imaginaires de la poé- sie... [des] espèces d' hippogriff es sur la scene../'14 The sym- bols of Pegasus as true genius and the hippogriff as genius deformed may have been derived, as Paul Vernière indicates in a footnote to Diderot's Pensées déíachées sur la peinture, from the medieval deformation of Pegasus into a hippo- griff.15 It would have been only natural, then, for the hippo- griff to be associated in Diderot's mind with les siècles barbares, as the Philosophes were wont to call the Middle Ages, a benighted period when natural genius was marred by igno- rance. The sources of Diderot's equine incarnations of grandeur and of genie are often revealed to us by Diderot himself. He remembered the coursers of the gods and of the heroes of the 13 Salon de 1767, in (Euvres completes, XI, 132. 14 (Euvres esthétiques, éd. Vernière (Paris, 1959), p. 315. 15 Ibid., p. 762, n. 1. 247</page><page sequence="8">LEON SCHWARTZ Trojan War, Achilles and Diomedes, the latter of whom reduced Rhesus to impotence by stealing his horses and fatefully entered Priam's city ensconced in the belly of the Trojan Horse.16 He remembered also the equestrian statues in the Tuileries Gardens, described by Grimm as " ces êtres fantastiques, se cabrant, grinçant les dents, ayant les narines retirees en arrière et les crins dresses, et une contraction de muscles qui fait peine à voir." 17 Diderot had a particular fascination for equestrian statues, and not the least of his objectives in travelling to Saint- Petersburg in 1773 was to view the imposing equestrian statue of Peter the Great created by his friend Falconet. It is instructive to read his effusive letter to that sculptor in which he compares Falconet's horse to the coursers of Diomedes and Achilles and calls the hero and his mount " un beau centaure, dont la partie humaine et pensante contraste merveilleuse- ment par sa tranquillité avec la partie animale et fougueuse."18 The latter allusion to the horse as a part of the man, the part that acts instinctively, impulsively, the non-rational part of man as opposed to the rational, has its echoes in the drawing of Diderot's characters. Is there not a subtle connection between this equine analogy and Uncle Toby's hobby-horse in Tristram Shandy, the novel that Diderot acknowledged as the prime source of the story of Jacques and his master?19 And does not Toby's hobby-horse imply a non-rational impulse in man, a dominant passion, or, as Diderot calls it in Jacques, 16 In his Encyclopédie article " Cheval " he names the horses of Apollo and recalls the sacred oracle-horses of the ancient Germanic peoples. And in a letter to Falconet (see below, n. 18) he alludes to the horses of Achilles and Diomedes. 17 The horses of Fame and Mercury (Correspondance littéraire, V, 327). 18 (Euvres completes, XVIII, 332, 333. 19 For Sterne's influence on Diderot, see Alice G. r reaman, Diderot and Sterne (New York, 1955). 248</page><page sequence="9">Diderot's equine symbolism " un coin de folie ? "20 This " coin de folie " is a fundamental feature of human behavior that haunts Diderot's characters in all his novels.21 The centaur symbol, representing as it does the conflict between the two irreconciliable halves of man, the rational and the irrational, the philosophic and the poetic, the moral and the immoral, personifies the dilemma of homo duplex that Diderot struggled vainly to resolve in his philosophical dialogues. As to the source of this symbol, one suspects that, besides the obvious mythological figure, Diderot had in mind Buffon's description of the horse as " ce fier et fougueux ani- mal qui partage avec [rhomme] les fatigues de la guerre et la gloire des combats/' 22 Interestingly, there is a passage in BufFon that foreshadows the final metamorphosis of the horse symbol in Diderot's writings. It is a passage in which the naturalist equates the horse directly with man : " Le cheval semble vouloir se mettre au-dessus de son état de quadrúpede en élevant sa tete ; dans cette noble attitude il regarde l'homme face à face. . ." (p. 381). Recalling this passage, Diderot, in his Encyclopedic article " Cheval," 23 dwells on the close biological analogy between horse and man, a principle that was particularly attractive to this pre-Darwinian evolutionary materialist who was later to write, in his Reue de d'Alembert, " Tout animal est plus ou moins homme." 24 He might have added, " Tout homme est plus ou moins animal," for in his novels he portrays a menagerie of human varieties much as Balzac does after him.25 There is 20 " Mais laissons tout cela et disons que c'était leur coin de folie. Est-ce que chacun n'a pas le sien? " (p. 557). 21 Georges May believes that the analogy between genius and irrationality is " one of the most significant constants of Diderot's thought " (" Diderot, artiste et philosophe du décousu," p. 178). 22 (Euvres completes de Buff on, ed. M. Flourens (12 vols. ; Paris, 1853), II, 369. 23 Buffon was a prime source for the article. 24 (Euvres phüosophiques, ed. Vernière (Paris, 1961), p. 311. 25 " Jacques prétendit que le silence lui était malsain ; qu'il était un animal jaseur . . . " (p. 654). 249</page><page sequence="10">LEON SCHWARTZ therefore a tendency in Diderot to animalize his humans and to humanize his animals. Georges May calls attention to the love-story of the bitch Nicole and the miller's dog in Jacques. The same sort of humanized relationship is drawn between the horses of Jacques and his master : " Lorsque le maítre fut un peu revenu de sa chute et de son angoisse, il se remit en selle et appuya cinq ou six coups d'éperon à son cheval, qui partit comme un eclair ; autant en fit la monture de Jacques, car il y avait entre ees deux animaux la même intimité qu'entre leurs cavaliers ; c'étaient deux paires d'amis " (p. 508). This procli- vity for drawing analogies between humans and horses was manifested also in Les Bijoux indiscrets, which Diderot was writing just prior to the publication of BufTon's Histoire natu- relle. In Chapter XXX Sultan Mangogul tells Mirzoza that woman is but an animal, and he wagers that by turning his magic ring on the royal mare he can make her talk like a woman, a feat he performs in the following chapter, though not without some difficulty, as the transcriber of the mare's speech does not know how to spell in horse-language. The situation is saved by Gulliver, who has learned the language in the Swiftian kingdom of the Houyhnhnms, another ob- vious source of Diderot's anthropomorphic characterization of horses. The final metamorphosis of the horse symbol in Diderot's writings is therefore the horse as a symbol of man himself. There is an explicit statement of this when Jacques, observing a peasant beating a balky horse in a field, remarks : Je devine que ce sot, orgueilleux, faineant animal est un habi- tant de la ville, qui, fier de son premier état de cheval de selle, méprise la charrue ; et pour vous dire tout, en un mot, que c'est votre cheval, le Symbole de Jacques que voilà, et de tant d'autres laches coquins comme lui, qui ont quitté les campagnes pour venir porter la livrée dans la capitale, et qui aimeraient mieux mendier leur pain dans les rues, ou mourir de faim, que de retourner à ¡'agriculture, le plus utile et le plus honorable des metiers (p. 760). 250</page><page sequence="11">diderot's equine symbolism This ultimate analogy of horse to man himself is fortified, moreover, by the repeated symbolic use of the gourmette - a horse's curb-chain - symbol of the chain of fate, suggesting that as the curb-chain governs the horse so does a fatal enchalnement govern man.26 Thus do Diderot's symbolic uses of the horse image come virtually full circle, from the analogy of horse to fate ; then to grandeur or génie; then to the intuitive genius in man ; next, to human passion ; and finally to man himself, man bridled by fate. This gradual evolution of one of his prime symbols is revelatory of Diderot's literary method, a method parti- cularly consonant with his system of thought, his metaphysics if you will,27 in which " all is flux," " everything changes ceaselessly," 28 and the animal that begins its evolutionary journey as a lowly worm one day becomes a horse, then a man, and ultimately perhaps a worm again . . . but who can tell what is written ?
