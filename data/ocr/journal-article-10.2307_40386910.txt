Oceania 26 (1991) 41-57 Fern Cave, rock art and social formations: rock art régionalisation and demographic models in southeastern Cape York Peninsula BRUNO DAVID Abstract In this paper, evidence is presented to show that there have been significant changes in the distribution of rock art types in northeastern Australia during the mid- to late-Holocene. The observations are made that 1) the more recent art can be divided geographically into two distinct groups, corresponding to two relatively disparate, ethnographically documented trading networks, located to the north and southwest of the Walsh River, and 2) within each of these regions rock paintings are formally extremely régionalisée. The earlier art, on the other hand, shows a very different, more homogeneous spatial distribution. The antiquity of these art forms is first established, followed by a brief discussion of the ethnographic literature for clues as to the relationship between material behaviour and social formations during ethnohistoric times. It is concluded that the changes observed in the rock art from the region reflect relatively recent changes in patterns of interaction, including a régionalisation of social formations after 2500 years ago. These changes may express alterations of strategies related to systems of dispute management, which may be directly related to growing populations. The paper concludes with a brief examination of some of the implications of these observations. A few years ago, whilst doing fieldwork in Chillagoe (southeastern Cape York Peninsula), I decided to take a trip northwards, visiting rock art sites along the way. At the time I was recording the rock art of the Chillagoe region, characterised by a broad suite of patinated peckings and what appeared to be more recent paintings of geometric and track forms. In this sense the Chillagoe rock art was much like that from the arid and semi-arid zones to the west and southwest. But as I was driving northwards, a change in the character of rock art appeared somewhere between the Walsh and Mitchell Rivers (Figure 1). The change-over from a predominantly non-figurative painting tradition to a figurative one, dominated by anthropomorphs, was sudden. But the patinated peckings, some of which had been dated to the late Pleistocene by Rosenfeld (Rosenfeld et al. 1981) near Laura, remained much the same as the ones from Chillagoe. In other words, there appeared to be a change in the distribution of artistic styles through time as well as through space in southeastern Cape York Peninsula. This impression led to the current paper. Following these initial observations, I recorded rock art from various parts of southeastern Cape York Peninsula. My original impression of a dual division of painting forms through space, but not of engravings, was maintained. But a second, important Dept. of Anthropology and Sociology, University of Queensland, St. Lucia 4067. Ms. submitted February 1990, accepted October 1990. pattern began to emerge: the paintings, divided broadly into a northern figurative and a southern non-figurative tradition, were highly regionalised (again, this was not the case with the engravings). Clearly, if the engravings were from a different time to the paintings (which on the surface appeared to be the case), a major change in the spatial distribution of artistic conventions had take place sometime during the prehistory of Cape York Peninsula. This paper is an attempt to address this issue. It specifically addresses the antiquity of the various bodies of rock art documented in north Queensland and concludes with some preliminary discussions of the implications of the observed pattern.

It was W.E. Roth, the Northern Protector of Aborigines, who in 1902 stated that 'rock paintings are met with in many districts throughout North Queensland, and were systematic research to be made would probably be found to be of more common occurrence than is usually supposed' (Roth 1902: 12). Since these pronouncements, numerous other authors (e.g. Clegg 1978, Rosenfeld et al 1981, Flood 1987, Flood and Horsfall 1986, Trezise 1971, 1987, David and David 1988, David 1988, David and Cole 1990, Cole 1989) have undertaken detailed examination of regional bodies of rock art in the southern Cape York Peninsula. Some research has included excavation (e.g. Rosenfeld et al. 1981, Flood and Horsfall 1986, David 1989, Morwood 1989). Until now, however, no regional synthesis of the archaeology of rock art in north Queensland has been attempted. Theoretical framework I start by assuming that the material record reflects past human behaviour and that changes in the distribution of material forms through time and/or space imply changes in social landscapes. By using the term social landscapes I refer to the relationship between people and the environment in which they live (Gosden 1989). It is further assumed that different cultures share 'different structures of meaning, and ... these structures are carried by symbols which are likely to be different' (Schneider 1976:211). In the social landscape lie the symbols and structures of meaning by which people perceive their surroundings. By investigating the distribution of material forms through space and time, the identification of discontinuities in social landscapes is made possible. Therefore, an investigation of contiguous stylistic conventions through time and space is taken to reveal information on interacting social entities (irrespective of possible alterations in the meanings of material expressions through time and space). Unfortunately, little is known about the direct relationship between rock art and social formations in Cape York Peninsula. Southeast Cape York Peninsula today consists of a complex mosaic of different, interacting clan networks (Rigsby 1981). These are reflected in the division of land holdings into numerous different land units, each relating peoples to land via their Dreaming identities and relations. The framework underlying this paper considers rock art as a material expression of structured social phenomena, but this does not mean that we can reconstruct which particular system of social formation has changed in relation to changes in the rock art. For instance, differences in the distribution of rock art forms can reflect differences in the distribution of power between men and women or age groups (Hodder 1986), between disparate 'tribal' formations, or between relatively disparate interacting groups (alliance networks) (David and Cole 1990). In this paper I assume that the presence of highly regionalised bodies of rock art in Cape York Peninsula during late Holocene times reflects a regionalised (spatially discontinuous) social landscape. At what level these discontinuities operated, however, we have no idea (e.g. clan, language, etc.). Rock art is in this way considered a part of the social (territorial) landscape (cf. Merlan 1989). By investigating the dynamism of material expressions, we are directly facing demographic issues, some of which will be briefly addressed here. More specifically, I argue that the earliest rock art of southern Cape York Peninsula is characterised by peckings of a specific range of non- figurative forms, and that its homogeneity through space may reflect wide-spread information exchange networks. The antiquity of this art is first examined, including a description of the archaeology of the pecked sites excavated so far. A similar exercise is undertaken for the painted sites, which I argue to be a predominantly more recent conventsion. Unlike the earlier art, painting forms are highly regionalised, a feature which may indicate a relatively recent fragment- ation of social formations. I begin with an examination of the early, pecked sites, including details of Fern Cave, a newly re-discovered pecked Pleistocene site from north Queensland. Early, engraved sites Maynard (1977) once noted that a pattern of change in rock art could be identified throughout the continent. In particular she argued, following Edwards (1966, 1971), that there existed a widespread distribution of patinated engravings consisting almost entirely of non-figurative and track forms. This, Maynard (1977:106) believed, reflected a single, relatively time-bound tradition, evidence of an early pan- Australian cultural system. Her name for this tradition was taken from a site containing numerous examples of this art, Panaramitee. The art itself was characterised thus: Some time before 10,000 BP, the Aborigines living in most of the continent, including Tasmania, which was then attached to the mainland, made many engravings by the pecking technique. The range of motifs was very limited, consisting almost entirely of a small number of simple non-figurative designs of representations of the tracks of animals (mainly macropods) and birds. Lizards dominated the very few figurative motifs which were produced. Throughout a large tract of Central and South Australia some factors operated upon these artists to make the relative proportions of different motifs engraved at each site very constant. In other areas, for example northeastern Queensland and Tasmania, the relative percentages of motifs were not maintained, but the range of motifs, their technique, their form, and their size were identical. This phase of rock art probably persisted a very long time, although it is impossible to say whether it was contemporaneous throughout its enormous distribution. It could easily have died out in some areas while still spreading in others (Maynard 1977:196). 42</page><page sequence="3">Maynard's observations have generated considerable controversy, especially amongst rock art specialists (e.g. McCarthy 1988, Clegg 1988, MacDonald 1988, Rosenfeld 1988, Franklin 1988, David 1988). As Franklin (1988:28) has noted, the concept of the Panaramitee emerges as a means of situating a body of rock art, itself describing 'a homogeneous style of engravings, which occurs throughout the continent ... which reveals some regional variation in its more frequent motifs', within a broad chronological framework. In the following discussion I begin by substantiating Maynard's claim for an early, highly homogeneous rock art tradition in north Queensland, and attempt to arrive at some understanding of its antiquity by examining the excavated, pecked sites. I follow a similar procedure for the painted art, which is believed to post-date the majority of peckings. The chronology presented below itself relies mainly on circumstantial evidence. Rock art is notoriously difficult to date, and although excavations at the Early Man Rocksheiter (Rosenfeld et al. 1981) have revealed minimum stratigraphie dates for some of the art from this site, all other indications of antiquity come from studies of patination and weathering, superimpositions, deposition rates of in situ ochres, presence of datable fauna in the art (e.g. dingoes [dogs] and European fauna), and the presence of unstable ochre types (e.g. mud and kaolin) on cave walls. These various methods have revealed a consistent pattern for the antiquity of Cape York Peninsula rock art Fern Cave. Fern Cave is a large cave perched above the pediments of Spring Tower, a massive fossiliferous limestone karst formation 10km NW of Chillagoe (North Queensland) (Figures 1, 2). The cave overlooks Spring Creek, a seasonal waterflow bordered by vine thickets located some 30m beneath it. The cave consists of two high and domed chambers, the floors of which cover 1056m2 (Figure 3). Today, flowstone and clays cover the floor of the dark back chamber, whereas flowstone is restricted to a small area towards the rear of the main (entrance) room. Excavation of Fern Cave was undertaken in 1985 (three adjacent 50 χ 50cm pits) and in 1989 (four 50 χ 50cm pits). The following is primarily based on the analysis of a single Figure 2. Fern Cave.

Stratigraphy and dating. Layer 1: the top 1.2cm consists of loose, disturbed, dry (humidity = 0.1%), grey, ashy sediments, containing leaves, twigs, macropod faeces, and cultural materials. Layer 1 is slightly alkaline (pH = 8.5). Its boundary with the underlying Layer 2 is marked. Layer 2: moderately compact, greyish ashy sediments, containing some charcoal and organic materials. Like Layer 1 , Layer 2 sediments are dry (humidity = 0. 1 %), and contain large amounts of cultural material. Depth 1.2cm to 12.3cm below surface. pH= 8.5. Layer 3: the boundary between Layer 2 and 3 is not marked, having an intermediate zone of 3cm. Sediments are greyish-brown and ashy. Layer 3 is of moderate compaction but more compact that Layer 2. Cultural materials are present. pH = 8.5. Depth 12.3cm to 22.2cm below surface. Humidity = 0.2%. Layer 4: the basal cultural layer. It consists of compact gravelly clays with a pH of 8.5. Cultural materials are present throughout this unit. Depth 22.2cm to 33.4cm below surface. Humidity = 0.9%. Layer 5: the boundary between Layers 4 and 5 is marked by a large amount of flowstone detritus at the top of Layer 5. Bone and land snail decrease to virtual absence from the uppermost excavation unit in Layer 5 (XU10) down to XU16, the basal excavation unit. Although some stone artefacts occur towards the top of Layer 5, these are believed to be post-depositional intrusions from Layer 4. This is supported by the mean weights of stone artefacts which decrease from 0.29g in Layer 4 XU9 (basal occupation unit) to 0.18g in XU10, 0.04g in XU11 and 0.03g in XU12. No stone artefacts were found below XU12. There being no datable material, Layer 5 could not be dated. pH = 8.5. The excavation continued to 66.3cm below surface, but bedrock was not reached. Humidity = 2.9%. Four radiocarbon dates were obtained from Square 4, and one from the original 1985 excavation (Square 3) (Table 1).

X axis: years BP χ 1000; Y axis: centimetres below ground surface. Five points relating to the stratigraphy and dating need elaboration. 1. Occupation at Fern Cave began sometime before 26,000 years BP. Extending the depth-age curve to the base of occupation, 3.0cm below the 25,7 10 ± 490 BP date, suggests ca. 29,000 BP for the start of human use of the site (Figure 4). 2. Some 33cm of sediments accumulated in 29,000 years. Although the average sedimentation rate of 1.2cm/1000 years may appear surprisingly low, sedimentation rates vary from 3.3cm/1000 years during peak use times to 0.6cm/1000 years during periods of less intense use (see below). Since materials cannot enter the cave except through aeolian, animal or human agency (no scree slopes lead into the cave from above), such low sedimentation rates are not so surprising. Further, the excavation location is protected from aeolian activity by large boulders near the entrance, acting as natural traps for wind-blown objects. 3. Reliance on land snail (Xanthomelon pachystylum) dates, (a) A control sample of this snail from a nearby archaeological site in the same geological formation as Fern Cave was submitted for dating. It was collected from XU1 of Layer 1 (Square 4) at Echidna's Rest within the Queenslander Tower (David 1987). This excavation unit was previously dated to 690 ± 90 BP (ANU-4812) on good 44</page><page sequence="5">quality charcoal. The land snail gave a reading of 1150 ±60 BP (ANU-7015), suggesting a discrepancy ca. 450 years exists between the charcoal and land snail dates. I have not compensated for this in the analysis below, however, as the precise error factor which can be expected from Xanthomelon dates is still unknown (John Head has suggested that an error margin of up to 2000 years can be expected, pers. comm. 1989). Until samples of modern Xanthomelon can be submitted for dating, the use of a correcting factor could be misleading. b) The Pleistocene levels of Walkunder Arch Cave were also dated on land snail samples (Xanthomelon pachy sty lumi) (Campbell 1982). Walkunder Arch Cave is also located in part of the same geological formation as Fern Cave, so the error factor on land snail dates is likely to be of a similar order. The Walkunder Arch Cave land snail dates follow a long sequence of charcoal dates and appear to be of the correct order of magnitude (Campbell 1982). c) Nonetheless, the use of land snails for dating remains problematic: Xanthomelon pachy sty him is known to burrow. However, no evidence of this was noted/« situ. Further, no live shells have been excavated from any of the rocksheiter excavations I have undertaken in the region, although this species has been noted in wetter areas outside the dripline. Free-sealing snails usually secrete a calcified mucus membrane to stop dessication; X pachystylum, however, does not do this. It frequents humid areas, and generally avoids burying in dry sediments due to dangers of dessication. The Fern Cave sediments were very dry in the excavation area, and are therefore unlikely to have been conducive to the burrowing activities of X pachy stylum (P. Colman, Australian Museum, pers. comm. 1987; J. Stanisic, Qld. Museum, pers. comm. 1990). Finally, many of theX pachystylum used for dating were burnt. Unless they were burnt as a result of hearths overlying them (in which case they would be younger than their stratigraphie contexts), the snails are likely to have been deposited as burnt shells in the same stratigraphie contexts as found when excavated No hearths were noted in the Fern Cave excavations. 4. The dates used above have been adjusted to take into account 13C values (Table 1), which do not indicate significant amounts of contamination from carbon sources such as the local limestone. However, land snails need a constant intake of calcium, and may achieve this by consuming calcium carbonate from the local rocks, which contain ancient carbon. It is for this reason that J. Head has suggested that land snail dates can be expected to be up to 2000 years in error (also C. Murray-Wallace, pers. comm 1990). 5. The entire Holocene sequence is compacted into 6cm of deposit. A similar problem was faced at Colless Creek by Hiscock (1984), whilst numerous other sites in northern (mainly tropical) Australia have compacted early- to mid-Holocene deposits (e.g. Kenniff Cave and The Tombs - Mulvaney and Joyce 1965; Walkunder Arch Cave - Campbell 1982; Echidna Shelter and Green Ant Rocksheiter - Hood and Horsfall 1986; Early Man - Rosenfeld et al 1981). In most cases this is believed to reflect an erosional phase caused by a period of increased rainfall from 8000 to 3000 years ago. At Fern Cave, however, there is no evidence of an erosional phase. Cultural materials show no evidence of water damage, the mean size of sediment particles is no greater than underlying sediments and there are no signs of stratigraphie disconformities. It is likely that the Holocene simply saw slower sedimentation rates, possibly directly related to lesser occupational intensities.

The glacial maxima saw peak deposition rates of stone artefacts, bone, burnt earth/stone and mussel shell. High sedimentation rates accompanied the increased rates in die deposition of cultural materials, whilst charcoal is also present (but rare). Burnt and unburnt land snail QCanthomelon pacJrystylum) is also abundant during this time. It is not known whether these represent food residue or not, but it may be significant to note that Xantlionielon sp. land snails have been reported to have been a significant food item in the diet of Aborigines of the Blackstone Ranges (Western Australia) (P. Colman, pers. comm.). It is also eaten today in northeastern Arnhem Land, although it is a low ranked resource there (B. Meehan pers. comm.) (see David 1987). The period of peak deposition of cultural materials during the last glacial maximum (22,000 -17,000 BP) corresponds to the most arid time in the last 40,000 years in the region (Chappell and Grindrod 1983). In his palynological investigations in eastern north Queensland, Kershaw (e.g. 1985) has argued that rainfall at this time was less than half what it is today. Similarly, the formation of longitudinal dunes on exposed lake floor sediments at Lakes Woods and Gregory, Northern Territory, implies considerable aridity during the glacial maximum (Bowdler 1983). The presence of low sea levels at that time and the exposure of the Sahul Shelf, reducing convection around the present sea-board, resulted in the formation of drier air masses and decreased precipitation in the study region (Nix and Kalma 1972). Evidence for a wet period immediately preceding the arrival of humans in Fern Cave appears in the form of extensive flowstone detritus. Excavation Unit 10 (Layer 5), which immediately underlies basal occupation deposits, contains 48.6gm of flowstone per 10 litres of excavated sediment, implying significantly wetter conditions at that time. This period shows no signs of occupation by humans (apart from a few tiny, intrusive flakes). Similarly, the return of wet conditions following the glacial maximum (and especially during the early- to mid-Holocene) accompanies a marked decrease in the densities of cultural material at the site: bone deposition rates decrease six-fold, stone artefacts three-fold, land snails four-fold, whilst burnt , earth/stone disappear altogether after around 17,000 years ago (Figure 5, Table 2). With the exception of ochre (see below), these low levels are maintained throughout the period following the glacial maximum. Sporadic visits to the site nonetheless continued until the ethnohistoric present. The rock wall and a large boulder adjacent to the excavations at Fern Cave contain a number of heavily patinated peckings (Figure 6). Their cortex consists of a palimpsest of fine laminations (1 to 2mm thick), the chemistry of which are currently being examined by Allan Watchman (A.N.U.). Amongst these laminations occurs a fine layer of oxalates (organic compound), datable through AMS (cf. Appendix 1; Watchman 1989). Investigation of this is currently underway. At Fern Cave, the peckings consist of three four-pronged motifs (Tridents), one star- Figurc 6. Fern Cave, pecked Trident, length 29cm. shape and a series of loosely clustered pits. Similar peckings have been found in other sites from the Chillagoe region and all are heavily patinated (Table 3); they are reminiscent of Maynard's Panaram itee- type peckings. Discussion. In 1969, Woolston and Trezise (1969) proposed a general chronological scheme for the rock art of the Laura region. Their sequence, based on investigations of weathering, patination and superimpositions, identified a general progression from non-figurative to figurative engravings, and from stencils and outlined paintings to infilled monochrome and bichrome to 'mud man [sic]' paintings. Support for aspects of this sequence was provided by excavation results from the Early Man site, located 185km to the north of Fern Cave. There Rosenfeld in 1974 revealed sub-surface engravings many of which are like those of Fern Cave, and dated stratigraphically to over 13,000 BP (Rosenfeld et al. 1981). These consist of 'pits, tridents and their variants, rectilinear mazes, rings around natural depressions and rounded enclosures with internal designs' (Rosenfcld et al. 1981:86-7). Rosenfeld also noted that these engravings were similar in form to numerous other highly patinated engravings from the broader region (cf. Woolston and Trezise 1969; David and Cole 1990; Cole 1989), leading her to identify, on the basis of degrees of patination, location of the art at the Early Man site and superimpositions, three artistic traditions (Rosenfeld et al. 1981:85-9). These were: 47</page><page sequence="8">1. An early non-figurative tradition, as characterised by the buried engravings at the Early Man site and dated stratigraphically to the late Pleistocene; 2. A later non- figurative tradition, retaining elements of the earlier tradition but adding new, figurative peckings and paintings; 3. The latest tradition, consisting predominantly of figurative images (including bird tracks). One of the key issues of the Early Man engravings has concerned three- and four-pronged motifs ('tridents' and 'bird tracks') (Rosenfeld et al. 1981). In her analysis of the site, Rosenfeld has distinguished between tridents and bird tracks, the difference lying in the nature of the meeting point of the prongs and with trident prongs being often curved rather than straight; 'bird tracks' are also believed to have been a more recent art form. Flood (1987), following Rosenfeld, has also claimed that there is a total absence of bird tracks from the earliest part of Rosenfeld's chronological scheme, but Trezise (1987:124) has disputed this point, prompting Clegg (1988) to argue that the entire distinction between tridents and bird tracks needs to be reviewed. The issue is not merely one of terminology, but potentially addresses whether the Laura engravings followed a sequence from early, non-figurative forms to later, figurative ones via the inclusion of tracks in the art. If a chronological separation of pre- and post-track art can be established, then the implications for the dating of the art are obvious. As this has not been done, however, I will refer to all three- and four-pronged designs in this paper as Tridents without distinction.

The patinated peckings from all five sites are formally highly homogeneous, including Tridents, geometric shapes, linear designs, pits and, in some sites, macropod track forms (Table 3). The regions in which these sites occur (Chillagoe - David and David 1988; Laura - Cole 1989, Rosenfeld et al 1981, Trezise 1971 and Koolburra - Flood 1987) all contain an abundance of rock art which has formed the subject of separate and specialised regional studies. The similarities in the patinated peckings observed from the excavated sites arc a reflection of the great similarity in the patinated peckings of the three regions. All have high percentages of geometric, pitted and linear designs, although the occurrence of mazes (both rectilinear and curvilinear) may be more régionalisée! (Table 4). My preliminary investigation in the Mitchell- Palmer limestone belt, situated between the Chillagoe and Laura districts, have likewise revealed a comparable body of patinated engravings, further re-inforcing the case for an essential affinity between the four regions.

In all the pecked sites excavated and published so far occupation began in late Pleistocene or early Holocene times. These include Early Man (pre- 13,000 BP), Fern Cave (29,000 BP), Walkunder Arch Cave (19,000 BP), Green Ant (8500 BP) and Echidna Dreaming (7500 BP). The patinated peckings from all of these sites, and indeed from each region in general, consists of a narrow range of non-figurative forms, although in some sites unpatinated figurative peckings (including dingo forms) also occur. There is not only a strong resemblance between the patinated peckings of all of the excavated pecked sites, but also a close resemblance of the overall patinated art forms throughout southern Cape York Peninsula west of the Great Divide (cf. Cole and David in prep., for discussion of differences between coastal and hinterland patterns and their implications). As a number of authors have noted, on the basis of degree of patination and the nature of super- impositions, patinated peckings are likely to have considerable antiquity and I have tried to substantiate this by showing that all of the excavated sites from the broader region which contain such peckings have evidence of early Holocene/late Pleistocene human occupation. However, the peckings' antiquity now needs to be tested by direct dating. Recent, painted/stencilled/drawn art Ten sites containing pigment art have been excavated from five regions of southern Cape York Peninsula. These are each examined below for clues as to the antiquity of the paintings. Princess Charlotte Bay and the Flinders Group The rock paintings of Princess Charlotte Bay and the Flinders Group were first described by A. Cunningham, a member of Captain King's coastal expedition in 1821: [we came across] a horizontal stratum of black schistose rock ... upon the roof and sides of which 48</page><page sequence="9">mid-Holocene occupation deposits lend support to the recent antiquity of the paintings from both shelters. Koolburra Plateau The rock paintings of the Koolburra Plateau consists predominantly of anthropomorphs, zoomorphs and therianthropes (part animal, part human forms), which together account for two-thirds of the total painted art. Notable amongst these and characteristic of the Koolburra Plateau, are part human, part echidna forms (Figure 8). These are only found within the plateau and along the western periphery of the Laura sandstone escarpment (Flood 1987; Trezise 1987). tips Figure 8. Koolburra Plateau paintings. Biomorphs. After Flood (1987). Superimpositions occur infrequently in Koolburra art, and therefore do not provide information on the relative chronology of the different painted forms, although anthropomorphs painted in mud are repeatedly superimposed over other paintings (as at Laura, Flood 1987). This however, could merely reflect preservational characteristics rather than changes in painting techniques. Given the presence of significant amounts of ochre in the Green Ant excavations, some clue as to the antiquity of paintings in the region can be gained (Rood and Horsfall 1986; J. Flood, pers. comm.). Green Ant and Echidna Dreaming. These sites, both excavated by Flood and Horsfall (1986), contain long sequences of occupational deposits. As with other excavated, painted sites from the broader region, amounts of in situ cultural materials are low until the late Holocene at both sites and deposition rates increase significantly after ca. 2500 BP. A disproportional increase in amounts of ochre'is evident at Green Ant during the last 2500 years (Figure 9), an increase which may reflect a relatively recent age for the majority of paintings at the site. A similar pattern in the distribution of cultural materials is evident from the Echidna Dreaming excavations, although Flood (Flood and Horsfall 1986) does not give information on the weights of ochres for this site. The amounts recovered from the excavations were negligible (Flood, pers. comm), and consequently an ochre discard curve cannot be plotted. The overall pattern of change from the Koolburra Plateau excavations implies considerable increases in the deposition rates of all cultural materials after around 2500 BP, an increase which includes increases in ochre deposition rates at Green Ant It is also during this time that burren adzes make their first appearance in the archaeological record of both sites. some curious drawings were observed... They represented tolerable figures of sharks, porpoises, turtles, lizards ... trepang, starfish, clubs, canoes, water-gourds and some quadrupeds (King 1837:25-6). Since Cunningham's observations, others (e.g. Roth 1904; Hale and Tindale 1933, 1934; Walsh 1988) have made more detailed observations on the region ' s paintings, particularly noting the co-occurrance of the motjala (moth/butterfly) patrician and paintings of moth/buterfly forms, identified as motjala by Aboriginal informants (Hale and Tindale 1933-4; Cole and David in prep.) (Figure 7). It is possible that detailed archaeological investigations in sites containing motjala paintings may reveal the antiquity of such depictions (and by implication perhaps the antiquity of the patrician itself).

The cave paintings at Princess Charlotte Bay and the Flinders Group consist principally of marine zoomorphs, although terrestrial forms are present also, as are non-figurative and contact images.

Endaen and Waleimini Shelters. These shelters were both excavated by Beaton (1985), who reports basal occupation dates of 2500 BP and 4760 BP respectively. Both sites contain faded paintings. Walsh (1988 and pers. comm.) considers that much of the art is very recent and has noted that motifs which were recorded by Coppinger (an early European visitor) in 1899 have disintegrated considerably. Unfortunately, Beaton does not report on the occurrence of ochres from either shelter, although the absence of pre- 49</page><page sequence="10">Figure 9. Green Ant, deposition rates.

Laura As with Koolburra Plateau, the major painting forms in the Laura district include an extremely broad range of anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, although other painted forms are also found in the region (Figure 10). The echidna-human forms found commonly to the west are found only along the western margins of the Laura sandstone escarpment (Trezise 1987). Overall, Laura's paintings are extremely diverse formally, consisting of motifs ranging from life-size anthropomorphs to tiny forms of less than 10cm length and from polychrome to monochrome paintings (Cole 1989). Early Man Rocksheiter. Excavations at this site have revealed a pattern of cultural deposition remarkably similar to those of Green Ant and Echidna Dreaming. At the Early Man site, Rosenfeld reported significant increases in sedimentation, ochre and stone artefact deposition rates after 5100 BP and a curious decrease in bone deposition rates at this time. The latter w,as tentatively explained as partly reflecting taphonomic and sampling problems by Horton (1981), although Walters (1984) determined it to reflect the destruction of bones by dingoes, which arrived in Australia ca. 3500 BP (Gollan 1984; Solomon and David in press). Watson and Flood (1987) and Watson and Abbey (1986), on the other hand, have shown that termites are known to destroy in situ bone, and have therefore explained the 50</page><page sequence="11">relatively low proportions of bones from the recent deposits of Early Man as a result of termite-induced bone destruction. The problem of interpretation stems largely from the fact that Rosenfeld et al. (1981) present their data (and analyse the site) via raw figures which have not been converted to deposition rates. If these figures are converted to deposition rates (i.e. quantities of cultural materials deposited per unit time), the major change does not occur after 5100 BP as argued by Rosenfeld, but sometime between 5500 BP and 1800 BP (finer determinations are not possible).1 After 1800 BP, stone artefact deposition rates increase 8-fold, ochre increases 4-fold, whilst sedimentation rates increase 3-fold (Table 5). The high ochre deposition rates after 1800 BP probably reflect the time when most of the paintings at the site were created. It is during immediately pre-1800 BP times also, as in the Koolburra sites, that burren adzes make their first appearance, though a more precise date cannot be given.

Early Man deposition rates per 100 years (after Rosenfeld el al. 1981). Layer 7 consists of an Upper and a Lower zone. The ochre deposition rate for the Upper zone (5500-8650 BP) is 3.2 g/100 years, and for the Lower zone (8650-1 1,850 BP) it is 1.2 g/100 years. Mushroom Rock. This is a painted sandstone shelter near Laura (originally called the Laura Site), excavated in the 1960s by Wright (1971). Although the site remains largely unpublished, an occupation date of 6870 ± 150 BP (lab. number unknown) at a depth of 2m indicates thaKhe 4m deep cultural deposits may begin sometime during the late Pleistocene or early Holocene (Wright 1971:139). Interestingly, the only significant change in the stone artefact content of the sequence occurs about 3000 years ago, when blades, burren adzes and eloueras begin to appear. Unfortunately, there is no information about the distribution of ochre, beyond the fact that it is present throughout the sequence. Chillagoe The rock paintings of the Chillagoe limestone belt arc very different from their northern neighbours. Consisting predominantly of geometric, linear and track forms, they are highly reminiscent of the paintings of Lawn Hill (M. Morwood pers. comm.; A. Border pers. comm., pers. obs.), Mt. Isa (Morwood 1985) and even Olary Province (Nobbs 1984), 1700km to the southwest (Figure 11). The presence of dingo (dog)-like tracks amongst the Chillagoe paintings and of a large proportion undertaken in the unstable white (kaolin) pigment, implies a relatively young age for the majority of the painted art. The occurrence of in situ ochres from the published excavations from Chillagoe supports this interpretation. Figure 1 1 . Chillagoe paintings, from tracings. Fern Cave. The pigment art at Fern Cave includes 29 hand stencils towards the back of the main chamber, three hand stencils near the site's entrance (on a boulder near the dripline, and therefore subject to weathering by the elements) and a series of non-figurative marks on the back wall of the main chamber. The latter appear as weathered impressions on the wall: no ochre is visible, but the shapes of the marks are clear. Tridents and geometric shapes appear 'etched' into the wall (as if pounded). The cortex of the rock where the paintings were undertaken has disappeared, but the underlying rock surface is totally undamaged and unpatinatcd. The edges of the pictures are irregular. These points suggest that the pictures were originally painted, but that the ochre has exfoliated, taking the thin cortex with it. As already argued, peak occupation occurs at Fern Cave between 22,000 and 17,000 BP, followed by very low occupational intensities until ethnohistoric times, when the site was finally abandoned (Figure 5). In contrast to low deposition rates of all other cultural materials and low sedimentation rates after 17,000 BP, however, rates of ochre deposition peak during the Holocene. Unfortunately, because of the compressed deposits during that time, it is not possible to get better resolution as to the nature of this increase. It is not known whether it is largely a late Holocene phenomenon, or a general Holocene one. The significant point is that it increases dramatically during the more recent stages of prehistory in spite of evidence for decreases in occupational intensity at the site. Walkundcr Arch Cave. The paintings at Walkunder Arch Cave are predominantly non-figurative, geometric designs. Little is known about the excavations at this site, as Campbell (1982) docs not provide any information on in situ ochres or 51</page><page sequence="12">lithics. We are told, however, that the late Holocene (last 3500 yrs) deposits saw major changes in lithic deposition rates, as well as the beginnings of a new lithic technology based on the manufacturing of small tools ('Lesser Retouched Tradition': Campbell 1984). These points will be further discussed below. Echidna's Rest. The paintings consist of numerous charcoal and red ochre, linear and geometric pictures and a single hand stencil. Occupation at the site began shortly before a near-basal date of 2440± 150 BP (ANU-5155), with significant increases in deposition rates after that time. This includes a 3-fold increase in ochre deposition rates after that time and a 4-fold increase after 700 BP. Obsidian artefacts from two sources, each located over 30km from the site, appear throughout the deposit, although their number also increases after 700 BP. This marks the beginnings of burren adzes at the site (David 1987; David et al in prep.). Bare Hill Bare Hill is located on the western margins of the rainforest, in an ecotone between the savannah woodlands to the west and the wet sclerophyll and rainforests to the east. Excavations by Wright (1971) in a rocksheiter at Bare Hill remain unpublished, but Clegg's (1978) analysis of the rock art of six sites at Bare Hill (including the shelter excavated by Wright) has revealed a figurative painting tradition dominated by anthropomorphs with up-turned arms and down-turned legs. These motifs are particularly character- istic of this region. Following detailed examination of the Bare Hill anthropomorphs, Clegg (1978:12) concluded that there was evidence that the paintings had been painted by different individuals at different times, although the paintings from all of the individual sites were probably undertaken within the context of a single major cultural tradition. The main site (Clegg's Site 1) appears to have been the result of several painting events. Given the large numbers of paintings undertaken in white (the unstable kaolin paintings), and the presence of dingoes (dogs) in the art, a relatively recent antiquity is implied. Discussion In her detailed re-analysis of Trezise's recordings of the Laura art, Cole (1989) found that superimpositions involved all major techniques, although few engravings occur in superimposition with paintings, drawings or stencils. In the Jowalbinna region (part of the broader Laura region), where she undertook detailed recordings of 69 art sites, a single non-figurative engraving lies over a painting in one site, whilst all other superimpositions involving the two mediums have the paintings on top of the engraving (David and Cole 1990). Similarly, Flood (1987: Table 3) did not identify any pecking in superimposition over paintings in the Koolburra region. David and David (1988) likewise failed to identify any pecking in superimposition with paintings in the Chillagoe region, although one unpatinated, shallow set of pounded pits, of a form interpreted as very recent by Β . David (1988), was recorded overlying a painting. The patterning of superimpositions throughout the broader north Queensland region involves a suite of non- figurative pecked motifs, perhaps including track-forms, underlying pigment art of various characteristics. Although peckings appear to largely give way to pigment art in the more recent past, some continuity exists in the Laura district, where rare peckings have been noted over paintings (Cole, pers. comm, 1989; Rosenfeld et al. 1981:87). In the Chillagoe region, there may have been a total abandonment of pecked art, followed by the extremely recent beginnings of shallow pounded pits. The association of non-figurative pecked forms with early dates and their generally highly patinated character throughout northern Queensland and beyond (including the Mt. Isa and Law Hill regions), likewise support the patterning of superimpositions, all militating against the general presence of this form of art from the mid- Holocene to the present. Although it is likely that some rock paintings were undertaken in pre-mid-Holocene times, the distribution of in situ ochres from excavated sites throughout northern Queensland implies a dramatic increase in painting activity sometime after 3000-2000 years ago. It is possible that in situ ochres are a by-product of 'artistic' activities other than rock art. Yet the pattern of ochre deposition at Fern Cave does not reflect general occupational trends. Whereas occupation peaks during the late Pleistocene, ochre deposits peak during the uppermost (Holocene) excavation units, implying that similar ochre trends from other sites may not simply reflect changes in general occupation intensities. The implications, rather, are that there have been significant changes in the nature of Aboriginal life sometime during the mid- to late-Holocene, changes which involve not only a dramatic increase in the systematic creation of rock paintings throughout the north, but which also correspond to the beginnings of a new stone artefact technology (including the creation and use of burren adzes) and possibly also to the arrival of the dingo. More fundamentally, it appears to have involved the régionalisation of artistic activities throughout the region, an event which has been heralded by Flood (1987:117), with respect to her Koolburra work, as a 'flowering of the ... stencil and painting art'. These points are explored below. Discussion North versus South In this paper I have argued that the rock art of southern Cape York Peninsula can be divided into two major temporal categories: 1. An early (pre-mid-Holocene) relatively homogeneous tradition of peckings of non-figurative forms. These are found throughout the broader region, although proportions of the different forms vary through space. The main forms are characterised by geometric, linear and trident forms (including a very low proportion of macropod tracks), whilst mazes are present but more variable in their distribution. 2. A more recent (mid- to late-Holocene) heterogeneous painting tradition, with the continued creation of 52</page><page sequence="13">OLARY MT. ISA LAWN HILL J [ CHILLAGOE I I | CENTRAL QLD.

After David and Cole (1990). pecked art in some regions (e.g. Laura). The predominant painting forms can be sub-divided into two broad geographic zones. Considerable regional variation in the range of paintings occurs within each of these two zones. The two zones include: (a) a southern zone, which includes the paintings of the Chillagoe region and areas to the southwest (e.g. Lawn Hill, Mt. Isa).2 These are characterised by a suite of paintings reminiscent of the earlier pecked forms; and (b) a northern zone (e.g. Koolburra, Bare Hill, Laura, Mitchell-Palmer, Princess Charlotte Bay), character- ised by a range of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic designs. This dual division is perhaps best portrayed when the paintings from each region are compared statistically. David and Cole (1990) have categorised into nine motif forms all the paintings from the regions from which rock art has been systematically recorded. The data was then subjected to an Average Linkage Cluster Analysis (using CSIRO's PATN program, Belbin 1988), to reveal the nested structure presented in Figure 12. The resulting dendogram highlights the division between a northern and a southern art style as described above (see Figures 1,13). The recent (post-mid-Holocene) antiquity of the regional division itself cannot be taken in isolation, for within each of the stylistic regions there is an enormous degree of régionalisation (e.g. Koolburra Plateau paintings characterised by echidna-human forms, the Bare Hill paintings by a predominance of anthropomorphs with bent limbs; Laura paintings possess numerous large, often life-sized anthropomorphs; Princess Charlotte Bay contains numerous moth/butterfly forms, undertaken in dotted outline; the Mitchell-Palmer rock art consists almost entirely of infilled anthropomorphs). What do these changes imply with respect to structural changes in prehistoric human populations in southern Cape York Peninsula and beyond? Do they reflect general demographic alterations or can they be understood within the framework of stable population structures? One possible answer to some of these questions is presented by briefly examining the ethnographic literature ^ ^-^ ¿± ,8 ^ n) Figure 13. Diagrammatic representation of the regional distribution of characteristic painting types in north Queensland. 1: Princess Charlotte Bay and the Flinders Group; 2: Koolburra Plateau; 3: Laura/Jowalbinna; 4: Mitchell-Palmer; 5: Mt.

This issue has been reviewed in detail elsewhere (David and Cole 1990). Rock art and alliance networks in the ethnohistoric past In 1 897 W.E. Roth, the Northern Protector of Aborigines, published his classic ethnography on the Aborigines of western Queensland. In this work he documents over one hundred instances of trade events, some taking place between people whose homelands were over 200km apart. Central to this trading network, which links places as far apart as Lake 53</page><page sequence="14">using, residential group. To the Aborigines of the region, the land is constituted of a myriad of named countries owned by one or more patricians and land owning groups may have a series of non-contiguous territories (Sutton andRigsby 1982: 167). Each patrician owns totems, songs, dances, etc., which also identifies it and differentiates it from other patricians (i.e. other countries). Each patrician is identified by its own language, or rather, by its own language variation (this may mean that a few words separate different patricians linguistically). Individuals of one patrician, although multilingual, will usually speak the language of the country that they are in at any point in time (Rigsby 1981:93; see Meggitt 1962 for a similar point concerning central Australian Aborigines). Most languages or language variations are referred to by the names of the patricians with which they are associated, as the 'language of such-and-such patrician' (Rigsby 1981), but sometimes a language will have its own name. Yet at any point in time, a country will be occupied by individuals from many patricians and hence from numerous 'language' groups (also Anderson 1984). Sutton and Rigsby (1982) note that for people of both sides of Cape York Peninsula, the conscious management of land affiliation by people actively organises individuals through the landscape. They argue that both land owning and land using groups involve between 25 and 50 individuals and that as populations increase, groups split up into smaller units. This segmentation is a result of increasing conflict and results in a re-organisation of people through space: 'the political management of land divides over-sized land- owning groups into smaller segments and ensures that lands of extinct land-owning groups continue tobe owned and used by succession' (Sutton and Rigsby 1982:159). This takes place through increasing tensions in interacting groups, tensions which are managed (amongst other ways) by the restructuring of land affiliation. As the land is an important medium of social interaction, a re-structuring of land ownership serves also to restructure interacting populations. We cannot merely view land ownership in southern Cape York Peninsula in terms of static descent models where individuals are affiliated to their father's or mother's territories by virtue of their birth (patri- or matri-affiliation), but must be prepared to see ties to the land as being dynamic and subject to manipulation through 'politicking' (Sutton and Rigsby 1982; Myers 1986; Sutton 1978). It is also this dynamism which can offer the archaeologist a framework by which structural changes can be investigated for the prehistoric past. The changes in rock art which are believed to have taken place sometime during the late- to mid-Holocene may be an expression of restructuring of human populations through space. In short, increases in the sizes and/or frequency of interacting populations, which can be operationalised through population increases and/or structural changes in the organisation of populations, are taken, following Sutton and Rigsby, to result in the fragmentation of populations leading to demographic régionalisation. A low degree of regional variation in the rock art of pre-mid-Holocene times, followed by the presence of highly regionalised paintings throughout Eyre, Camooweal, Boulia and Normanton, was the native narcotic, pituri. Other important trade items at the time of Roth's observations were government blankets, human hair belts, bilbi tails, shields, stone 'knives', possum twine, human hair twine and spears of various designs. Importantly, these trading events operated in the context of prolonged ceremonial activities and as Roth (1897:136) noted, 'it happens that ideas are interchanged, superstitions and traditions handed on from district to district and more or less modified and altered in transit, that new words and terms are learnt and exchanged, just like any other commodities'. The periodic but sustained interaction of widely dispersed groups throughout western Queensland has resulted in the relative standardisation of widespread behavioural conventions (e.g. predominance throughout this region of non-figurative paintings of a narrow range of forms). This is well seen in the high proportions of similar non-figurative and track designs in the cave art of western Queensland, a region which corresponds geographically with the location of Roth's western Queensland alliance network. To the northeast, where this network gives way to a relatively distinct interaction sphere, rock are forms take on a different character, dominated by highly regionalised biomorphic forms. The region itself has been characterised by Anderson and Robins (1988: 186) as 'a larger cultural and linguistic bloc which included most of southeast Cape York Peninsula'. Trade relations in northern Queensland are characterised by short distance, intensive interaction between and amongst speakers of various dialects and there is no evidence of the extensive trading network noted by early observers for western Queensland. At the time of contact, numerous items (such as reed spears, iron scraps and European axes, melo shells, nautilus shell necklaces, stingray spears and fishing nets, bicornual baskets, red ochre, grass tree spears) were exchanged in an interacting sphere centred between Princess Charlotte Bay to the north, the Cairns coastal zone to the east and the Mitchell and Palmer Rivers to the west. This region included all of the areas described above in which rock art is characterised by a predominance of anthropomorphs and zoomorphs, although these are highly regionalised in character. In short, the division of rock paintings into a northern (figurative) and southern (non-figurative) group corresponds to a similar dual division of trading networks in northern and southwestern Queensland (see David and Cole 1990). Régionalisation Sometime around 2000-3000 BP the rock art became highly regionalised stylistically. The fact that this timing corresponds with the genesis of a dual north-south separation of rock art forms implies that the two events may have their origins in a single social phenomenon, which may have been expressed in different aspects of social life. Rigsby (1981) has argued that in the Princess Charlotte Bay, Laura and other districts of northeastern Queensland, a number of different types of social groupings should be recognised. For our purposes, two such groupings must be differentiated: the landowning group (patrician) and the land 54</page><page sequence="15">Cape York Peninsula after this time, may indicate that such changes were operating at a growing rate throughout the broader region from around 3000 years ago. Conclusion Sutton and Rigsby (1982) have argued that once the sizes of interacting populations get over a certain threshold point, populations split up into smaller groups, thereby resulting in a reorganisation of people through space. If such processes are common to human populations in general, then we have a framework by which to interpret the archaeological evidence presented in this paper. 1. The post-3000-2000 BP rock art of the region is divided into two formal sets, a northern, predominantly figurative tradition and a southern non-figurative one. The geograph- ical distribution of these forms reflects closely the spatial distribution of two, relatively disparate trading systems (interaction spheres). In contrast, the absence of a northern versus southern system of artistic conventions in the earlier art may imply the absence of two relatively distinct trading systems. The relative homogeneity of the earlier rock art of northern Queensland (and indeed, western Queensland) implies the existence of more widespread systems of information exchange in the more distant past, systems which have led to a standardisation of cultural traits throughout the broader region. 2. During the more recent past, the rock art of locales within each of the northern and southern zones were highly regionalised. In the northern zone, it has been argued (e.g. Sutton and Rigsby 1982) that social units were witnessing on-going processes of social fragmentation during the ethnohistoric past, processes associated with increases in the sizes of interacting populations. As the size of land-owning groups grew to populations exceeding 25 to 50 individuals, social units fragmented into numerous, smaller units, each behaving as relatively distinct social formations. It is such a process of growing interacting populations leading to the fragmentation of social groups which has been inferred to have been the cause of the régionalisation of artistic conventions in the later stages of prehistory. If the regional character of rock art reflects the regional nature of social formations such as in the association of a localised occurrence of the motjala (moth/butterfly) patrician and moth/butterfly designs in Princess Charlotte Bay art (Rigsby, pers. comm; Hale and Tindale 1933, 1934), then social formations in pre-mid-Holocene times were not as regionalised as they were during more recent times. In this paper I have argued that fundamental changes in the distribution of rock art forms through space have taken place sometime between 3000 and 2000 years ago. An important difficulty has been, however, in comparing an early engraving technique with a later painting technique. It is possible that these two techniques have intrinsic limitations which are different enough from each other to constrain the artist in different ways. For instance, it is possible that engravings are more amenable to the creation of geometric designs, whilst the greater plasticity of the painting medium provides the artist a broader range of formal choices. It is beyond the aims of this paper to test this possibility, but hopefully in the future we will have enough information to look at changes through time within a single medium (e.g. engravings) only. If the arguments presented in this paper are correct, the rock engravings of the late Holocene should be more regionalised in their distribution of forms than are those of the early Holocene/late Pleistocene. Finally, this paper has attempted to re-orient current demographic issues in Australian archaeology by investigating changes in the distribution of stylistic elements, rather than purely in changes in the amount of materials deposited in archaeological sites as has been the trend so far. In doing this, I have argued, as has Lourandos before me (1983), that sometime during the mid- to late-Holocene Aboriginal Australia experienced major cultural changes. This paper is an attempt to document the timing of changes in rock art styles. It now remains to be seen whether the chronological model presented here will stand firm in the face of new data from excavations, oxalate dating of wall cortex and the direct dating of paintings through analyses of organic binders. Notes 1 . A depth-age curve was constructed for the Early Man site by joining all dates on a depth-age diagram, except for samples ANU- 1564, which is clearly anomalous and ANU- 1442, which is located above a localised depression in the underlying bedrock. Samples ANU- 1441 and ANU-1566, located near each other stratigraphically, were meaned. All other dates were taken as reported in Rosenfeld et al. (1981:10-12). As the report does not present data on spit depths or mean layer depths, the latter were calculated with a ruler from the stratigraphie diagrams presented. Rates of sedimentation were calculated from these calculations, as were all deposition rates presented here. 2. Recording forms lodged at the Heritage Section (Brisbane) show that paintings from rockshelters located near Cloncurry and Georgetown, between Chillagoe and Mt. Isa, share similar formal characteristics with Chillagoe rock paintings. Appendix Preliminary description of cross sections of cortex from Fern Cave This cortex comes from the surface of limestone and ranges in thickness from lmm to 2mm. The basal 0.5mm contains calcium carbonate fragments from the underlying rock, calcium phosphate and small amounts of potassium, calcium and magnesium sulphate and chloride salts. Immediately above this layer is a thin band rich in silica which contains tiny particles of black fly-ash. Above this 55</page><page sequence="16">band is a thick unit, about lmm wide, which is made up of many fine laminations (the composition of which will prove difficult to ascertain), the bulk of which is composed essentially of calcium phosphate and trace amounts of calcium and potassium sulphate and chloride salts, with a small amount of quartz. This broad unit has been partly eroded and then covered with additional calcium phosphate-rich laminations which drape across the previous surface. The present surface is rich in calcium sulphate (gypsum). Trace levels of potassium and calcium phosphate, quartz and clay also occur on the surface. There is no evidence of red or yellow ochre in the form of paintings in the cortex. Alan Watchman References Anderson, C. 1984. The political and economic basis of Kuku- Yalanji social history.
