The generous financial support of the Department of Anthropology at Yale University, Sigma Xi of the Scientific Research Society, the So- cial Science Research Council, and the American Council of Learned Societies - through funds from the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation - made possible two years of fieldwork in Oaxaca between 1987 and 1989. It was during those years that most of the Zapotec inscriptions used in this study were documented. My sincere appreciation goes also to the Wenner Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, whose support allowed me to document additional Oaxacan inscriptions held in European museums during the summer of 1988, and to the American Mu- seum of Natural History in New York for awarding me a study-collection grant in June 1990 for gather- ing epigraphic and archival data from its Zapotec col- lection. The support of the Social Science Research Council, of the Department of Anthropology and the Peabody Museum at Yale, and of Pre-Columbian Stud- ies at Dumbarton Oaks gave me the opportunity to spend two years writing in New Haven (1989-1990) and in Washington, D.C. (1990-1991). Many people became involved in one way or an- other with my dissertation project. Foremost was the intellectual guidance and logistic support of John Pad- dock, my teacher, mentor, and friend. Michael Coe, my advisor at Yale, showed me alternatives when I felt trapped in seeming dead ends. Michael Lind was also instrumental in shaping some important ideas, as he continuously made me question my own assumptions. Joaquin Garcia Barcena, director of the Consejo de Arqueologia of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, granted official permits to conduct the field- work (Memoranda 401-7/149 and 401-7/39). Roberto Garcia Moll, former director of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, made possible the study of the Oaxaca collection at the museum in Mexico City, and Ernesto Gonzales Licon, former di- rector of the Centro Regional Oaxaca-INAH, put at my disposal the necessary facilities to study other im- portant epigraphic materials in Oaxaca, particularly the inscriptions from tomb 5 at Cerro de la Campana, in Santiago Suchilquitongo. Jose Ramirez, of the Archivo de Monumentos Prehispanicos in Mexico City, assisted me in locating several unpublished re- ports; and Cecil Welte, director of the Oficina de Estudios de Humanidad in Oaxaca City, generously loaned me much needed bibliographic sources that lessened the remoteness of fieldwork. Improvements of the dissertation that led to this book were also made possible through the feedback of sev- eral colleagues. Elizabeth Boone, Mary Elizabeth Smith, and Joseph Whitecotton provided valuable con- tent and editorial comments. Two roundtables orga- nized by Elizabeth Boone at Dumbarton Oaks, "Art and Writing: Recording Knowledge in Pre-Columbian America" (1991) and"Mesoamerican Histories" (1995), exposed me to an array of scholars working on di- verse issues about graphic forms of communication. Linda Scheie also merits special note for sponsoring four consecutive workshops on Zapotec writing dur- ing the Maya Meetings at Texas (1994-1997). These sessions made possible a productive exchange of ideas with John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman. The input of all these people is greatly appreciated, and I hope I have done justice to their suggestions. Yet, the views expressed here remain my sole responsibility. vii</page><page sequence="8">Special thanks go to Marc Winter for inviting me to participate as the epigrapher for the Monte Alban Proyecto Especial, 1992-1994 and to Arthur Joyce for enticing me to join the project Rio Viejo 1995. Mercedes de la Garza and Laura Sotelo kindly in- vited me to impart a productive seminar on Zapotec writing at the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in 1996. My involvement in museographic projects for five community museums in Oaxaca - which gave me the opportunity to increase the corpus of Zapotec inscriptions - is due to Teresa Morales Lerch. Marc Winter, Cira Martinez, and Michel Oudijk have also brought to my attention several inscriptions that have come to light since 1992. The relendess interest of Michel Oudijk on Zapotec historiography has been most stimulating. I owe special recognition to Mirka Prazak andTamara Bray for much of the initial editorial advice, and to Glenn Ruby and Robin Surratt, of the Dumbarton Oaks publications office, for their indefatigable help in carrying the project to its ultimate conclusion. Much appreciation goes to Lynley Becker for her commu- nications in rebus writing, and to Jane Beck for developing and printing the photographs included in this work. My deepest gratitude goes to my fam- ily for helping me in their own unique ways. Fi- nally, I owe much to the people of Oaxaca and to my friends in Mitla and Xaaga for sharing with me all that they have. viii</page><page sequence="9">List of Figures 1.1 Known geographic

southwestern Mexico, contributed significantly to the development of Mesoamerican civilization. Among their many intellectual accomplishments was the in- vention of a distinctive form of writing. The meaning of Zapotec hieroglyphs, one of a dozen or so different graphic systems so far identified in Mesoamerica, re- mains elusive. As far as currendy known, Zapotec writ- ing constitutes one of the earliest scribal traditions in Mesoamerica; it also has one of the longest evolu- tionary trajectories. It follows that an understand- ing of this script and of its historical development are important for elucidating the genesis of writ- ing in Mesoamerica. Its relevance for the compara- tive study of writing systems can hardly be exag- gerated. It provides another unique, independent, and original manifestation that could shed addi- tional light on the general nature of scripts and on the societal uses of early writing systems. The study of Zapotec hieroglyphic writing can also help us better understand the roles of pristine scripts in the development of social complexity. The geographic locus of the Zapotec script is in the central valleys of Oaxaca, a relatively small configura- tion of flat alluvial plains in the midst of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Most known examples of writing are from the ancient Zapotec capital of Monte Alban. This site was undoubtedly the main center of intel- lectual activity for scribes and the point from which the script spread to other parts of Oaxaca and Mesoamerica. The earliest evidence of Zapotec writ- ing consists of large carved monoliths, each weighing several tons. On the basis of archaeological associa- tions and stylistic affiliations, these monumental in- scriptions can be dated to between 500 and 300 B.C. - that is, the time of local transition from village life to urbanism and the threshold of state-level forms of social organization. Because of the nature of the archaeological record, one can assume that only a fraction of what was ever written has survived. The likelihood that Zapotec scribes began writing on perishable materials poten- tially limits our understanding of the origins of this script. Yet, from the fragmentary bits of writing per- taining to different periods and found in carved stone, incised ceramics, modeled stucco, painted murals, and engraved shell and bone, it is evident that the Zapotec script developed over more than a millennium. Throughout this long trajectory, the script shows marked conservatism in certain aspects and apparent discontinuities in others. Although its maximum areal extent through time has not yet been determined, Zapotec writing at times may have reached beyond the confines of the present-day state of Oaxaca. Given its 1400 years of historical development, pre- cocity, and known geographic extent, Zapotec writ- ing likely provided an important impetus for the de- velopment of other scripts in the southwestern and central highlands of Mesoamerica, in particular those from Teotihuacan, the Mixteca Baja (Nuine), Xochicalco, Teotenango, Cacaxtla, Tula, and the Mixteca Alta (Mixteca-Puebla). Its relationship to the Epi-Olmec script, which eventually led to Maya writ- ing (Coe 1976), might have been close in the early stages of both systems (Figs. 1.1 and 1.2). Examples of Zapotec script drop off dramatically after the tenth century a.d., a phenomenon undoubt- edly related to the political collapse of Monte Alban a century before. The subsequent transformation of the script cannot be currently outlined in detail, nor can I</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 1.1 Known geographic distribution of Mesoamerican scripts. 2</page><page sequence="21">â  V3 .

Very few inscriptions produced in the central valleys of Oaxaca between the tenth and fif- teenth centuries are known, in part probably because of uneven archaeological sampling. However, the pau- city of evidence for writing after the abandonment of Monte Alban also might be due to a major reliance on the part of patrons and scribes on perishable media such as bark and agave paper, cloth, and animal hides. The script that eventually became the predominant form of graphic communication in Pre-Hispanic Oaxaca has a style much different from that which characterized the political landscape of Monte Alban. This style, known as "Mixteca-Puebla," was actually in vogue through large portions of Mesoamerica be- tween the thirteenth and fifteenth centuries a.d. Al- though a few usages and conventions from the earlier Zapotec script prevailed in Mixteca-Puebla graphic forms, many conspicuous traits fell into disuse. Even though the relationship between the two scripts is poorly understood, the present evidence suggests that the discontinuities between them had little to do with forms of ethnic self-assertion (Zapotec versus Mixtec). Rather, they more likely imply differences with the sociopolitical milieus of usage. Although no Pre-Columbian books attributable to Zapotec speakers are known, writing in Mixteca- Puebla style was still in existence in the central valleys of Oaxaca on the eve of the Spanish conquest. Dur- ing the early colonial period, a seemingly vigorous production of genealogies and maps rendered in local styles took place in Zapotec Oaxaca (Whitecotton 1990; Konig 1993; Oudijk 1994; Oudijk and Jansen 1998). Eventually, because of suppression of the native script and literary traditions by the Spaniards, local scribes had to adopt the European script. In some in- stances writing, although based on the roman alpha- bet (Alcina Franch 1993), was surreptitiously used to represent the Zapotec language and assert native cul- tural identity, a movement that has been carried on until the present.1 Other evidence for the persistence of a native writ- ing tradition in Oaxaca through the early colonial pe- riod is found in several entries of a sixteenth-century Spanish-Zapotec vocabulary compiled by the Domini- can friar Juan de Cordova 50 to 60 years after the Spanish conquest.This vocabulary lists words for scribe, the scribe's specialty, desks and stools used by the scribes, ink repositories, the place where scribes exercised their specialty, distinctions between true and false writing, esoteric writing, native books, and readers (Cordova [1578] 1987: 182v, 241v, 244v).2 Although it can be argued that some of these lexical entries are more a reflection of European semantic categories, it is note- worthy that, as in the Mixtec, Nahuatl, and Mayan languages (Alvarado [1593] 1962: 102v, 168; Molina 1970: second pagination 120; De Ciudad Real 1984: 129v), the Zapotec term for writing, tozeea , is a syn- onym or a semantically derivative term from the word for painting and sculpting (Cordova [1578] 1987: 182v [escreuir generalmente] , 3 1 5 v 'pintar ] ) . The purpose of this book is threefold. One objec- tive is to present a sketch of how Zapotec writing might have worked - that is, its structural properties and its relationship to spoken language. Another goal is to elucidate the ancient Zapotec calendrical system that so prominently figures in the inscriptions. Finally, it explores the historical and social implications of what one of the most complete sets of inscriptions from the ancient city of Monte Alban apparendy intended to convey. These inscriptions, which were placed in monumental contexts, date between the fourth and the sixth centuries a.d. Current evidence suggests that Zapotec writing in- volves a combination of narrative pictography and a logosyllabic system. Because of their complementary relationship, these two components can be conceived of as veritable "texts." Whereas the first component 1 For instance, the newspaper Binigulazaa - devoted to "in- formation on and reflexion about indigenous resistance" - and the journal GuchachV Reza publish poetry, stories, and legends in Zapotec. 2 Throughout this study, the number in parentheses after each of Cordova's entries refers to the page in the 1987 facsimile edition of his Vocabulario. When a number is followed by a "v," it gives the verso pages. When there is only a number, it refers to the recto pages. 4</page><page sequence="23">consists of scenes depicting human figures engaged in some kind of activity, the second one is characterized by arrangements of signs in which each unit stands for words and perhaps, in certain contexts, syllables. The overall composition of both components must have a structure and, as I will argue, the arrangement of the glyphs in the inscriptions apparently reflects the syntax of the spoken language. The number of available Zapotec inscriptions is rela- tively small compared with the known corpora of other Mesoamerican scripts. In addition, the analysis of con- temporary Zapotec languages and the reconstruction of their ancestral form are still in the initial stages. Therefore, this study relies mainly on an archaeologi- cal approach, using comparative and contextual meth- ods. Application of the combinatory method, which is critical to testing the validity of phonetic values in diverse epigraphic contexts, is not feasible at this time because of a lack of data. Given that conspicuously pervasive features of the inscriptions are glyphs accompanied by numerals, and that these numerical signs appear to reflect directly or indirectly the way time was reckoned, I have used the comparative method to deal with some issues regard- ing the structure of the ancient Zapotec calendar. To resolve two problems related to the calendrical nota- tions, nearly 600 inscribed objects (mainly stone monu- ments) from central Oaxaca are compared. One of the problems is identification of the glyphs used to name the solar cycles (the so-called year bearers) and determination of their position in the 20-day list of the Mesoamerican calendar. The other problem is the synchronic and diachronic glyphic reconstruction of the entire 20-day list. Critical to this reconstruction is the use of sixteenth-century sources that render the Zapotec language and certain aspects of the calendar in the European alphabetic script. The solution to the first problem generates a model that could prove use- ful for determining the chronological framework given in some of the inscriptions. The solution of the sec- ond problem yields an initial list of signs that represent words whose approximate meaning, as derived from the sixteenth-century sources, is firmly established. Although many Zapotec monuments with inscrip- tions have been discovered in situ, it appears that most were reused in antiquity and are thus found in nonprimary contexts. By relying on the contextual method, I have traced patterns of use and reuse of the carved monuments that offer insights into the origi- nal way public inscriptions may have been displayed. The reconstruction of such "programs" allows analy- sis of the epigraphy and its associated narrative pic- tography as self-contained compositions.This enhances the possibility of determining aspects of the script s structure that are otherwise hidden. It also allows us to suggest the possible content of the messages and to explore the social and historical implications of such exegesis. In the remainder of this chapter, to provide a frame- work to discuss the Mesoamerican phenomenon in gen- eral, and the Zapotec script in particular, I outline a theo- retical approach to writing. I then describe in detail the methods and techniques used in this work. Chapter 2 is devoted to a historical and critical overview of the study of Zapotec hieroglyphic writing from the early nine- teenth century to the present. As this story unfolds, some of the problems the script presents as well as the differ- ences of interpretation among various scholars become more obvious. Paramount among the interpretive dis- crepancies are those concerning the calendrical inscrip- tions and their bearing on the structure of the Zapotec calendar. In Chapter 3, 1 present a concise exposition of these problems. A comparative analysis, relying prima- rily on epigraphic and linguistic data internal to the Zapotec tradition, is conducted in Chapter 4 to deal with the calendrical problems previously introduced. One of the main results of this analysis is a model of year bearers that can be used to derive the indigenous com- putation of time given in the inscriptions. In Chapter 5 the model of year bearers is tested by using a set of inscribed stones from Monte Alban whose original nar- rative configurations are first reconstructed by means of the contextual approach. As the test proceeds, analysis of the epigraphy yields additional evidence about the na- ture of Zapotec writing and substantiates the interpre- tation that the main content of the inscriptions deals with historical events as perceived by those who spon- sored or actually did the writing. Chapter 6 contains a succinct exposition of the conclusions derived from the studies in Chapters 4 and 5 as well as a further elabora- tion of some of their implications. 5</page><page sequence="24">Approaches to Writing The diversity and uniqueness of visual forms of com- munication attested all over the world have made it difficult to generate an overarching, unambiguous definition of writing. The problem is not only to ac- count for the known diversity but also to distinguish writing from nonwriting. What is common to the vari- ous definitions that have been proposed is that writ- ing is a visible form of communication that is rela- tively permanent. Hence, different kinds of sign lan- guages, and for that matter ritual or performance, al- though visible, do not constitute writing. What is more debated in defining writing rests on a distinction be- tween the two major principles underlying visual com- munication - namely, the direct perception of ideas (semantic) and their transmission through encoded speech (phonetic). To understand these distinctions and their bearing on different approaches to writing, it is important to examine the semiotics of signs in more detail. Forms of communication that are semantically based are usually referred to as semasiography (from the Greek word semasia, for "meaning") .The graphic units of semasiography are usually, but not exclusively, de- fined by a natural relationship between the sign and its referent and can be pictures, images, or pictographs. Although images and pictures are frequently arranged as narrative compositions (Fig. 1.3 A), pictographs ap- pear as discrete units, and each one of these units stands for a concept or a small set of ideas (Fig. 1.3B).With regard to semasiography that relies on images, Pulgram noted, This kind of visual communication is com- parable to a cartoon without captions. The translation of the picture into words is nec- essarily free, and does not infallibly convey the words the designer of the picture had in mind, nor do different viewers employ the same phrases or words in their attempts to render the sense. Worse still, they may not all derive the same sense from what they see, or even perceive the intent of the draughtsman. (Pulgram 1976: 6) Pulgram's comment assumes that, to understand pic- tures, it is necessary to translate them into words and that - to the extent that thought is bound by linguis- tic structures - semantic communication is not inde- pendent of language. Many processes of cognition cannot be entirely separated from language because concepts and ideas usually have linguistic tags - that is, they are closely associated with lexemes of a lan- guage and hence, when spoken, have a phonetic refer- ent. Following these premises, some authors view semasiography as a form of communication in which the relationship between pictures and speech exists but is not fixed. Because the relationship to spoken lan- guage is flexible, semantic systems are usually charac- terized as linguistically generalized modes of interac- tion, not only in terms of a given grammatical struc- ture but also in terms of the number of possible lan- guages that could be involved. In other words, semasiography is not language specific but rather cross- cuts linguistic boundaries. However, the linguistically generalized nature of semasiography is not universal, because the encoding and decoding of images and pictographs presupposes knowledge of cultural norms and conventions. To grasp the implications of the car- toon in Figure 1.3A, one must share knowledge of chess memory chips and of an eventful match between a human player and a computer. Sometimes the de- coding of semasiography within a given cultural tra- dition depends on context. For instance, it appears un- likely that the reader would make sense of the picto- graphs in Figure 1.3C without a hint. But for those who deal with photocopiers, the pictographs are quite familiar. These include (1) "add paper," (2) "remove copies," (3) "check closure," (4) "wait," (5) "add toner," (6) "toner collecting box full," (7) "paper jam," and (8) "maintenance call." Because semasiography often re- sorts to pictures representing entities or objects that are culturally specific, the possibility of them being identified by members of a different culture is limited. This is why semantic systems such as "petroglyphs" from all over the world, Teotihuacan mural painting, and Moche iconography are particularly difficult to understand. Semantic forms of communication can comprise graphic units that, rather than having a natural rela- 6</page><page sequence="25">Fig. 1 .3 Examples of semasiographic communication: (A) as a narrative composition, (B and D) based on pictographs, (C) based on isolated symbols, (E) as an articulated symbolic system. 7</page><page sequence="26">tionship between sign and referent, are based on arbi- trary links. Consider the sign for Red Cross. There is no natural relationship between its shape and color and its meaning - i.e., emergency medical attention. Symbols can stand alone (Fig. 1.3D) or they can be used as systems of aggregates where size, relationship, and distribution add supplementary layers of mean- ing. Mathematical, musical, and technical notations are examples of highly sophisticated, specialized, and self- articulated symbolic semasiography (Fig. 1.3E).The term "icon," which some scholars use as a synonym of pictograph, is applicable to signs that are based on a natural or an arbitrary relationship between sign and referent. Because pictographs, symbols, and icons con- vey semantic values that can be rendered as words, these types of signs are also referred to as logographs, the set of which comprises a lexic or logographic sys- tem. Glottographic systems (from the Greek word glotta, meaning "tongue") are forms of visual communica- tion that codify speech; when examined in more de- tail, these sound-based systems vary in the way they do so. The differences have to do not only with the unit of sound being encoded but also with the extent to which they can render other features of the spoken language. Syllabaries, for instance, are scripts whose signs represent syllabic sounds. These sounds are, for the most part, devoid of meaning. Syllabic scripts worldwide, although based on the same principle for encoding and compounding sound units, present spe- cific variations. Using the abbreviations C (consonant) andV (vowel), DeFrancis (1989:251) summarizes some of them as follows: Formula Example Sumerian Cx (V1 + Vt)C2 = C1V1C2 da + am = dam Mayan CjVj + C2(Vj) = CjVjCj ma + ca = mac Greek C^V,) + C2Vt = CiCJfi ti + ri = tri Japanese C(i) + y V = CyV ki + yo = kyo C(u) + wa = Cwa ku + wa = kwa In other glottographic systems, signs stand for the minimum units of sound capable of being produced by the human vocal cords. As in the case of most syl- labic sounds, these individual units, or phonemes, do not carry meaning. The writing systems whose graphs encode phonemes are variously classified as "segmen- tal" and "featural" (Sampson 1985), "consonantal" and "phonemic" (DeFrancis 1989), or "abjads" (scripts that denote only consonants), "alphabets," and "abugidas" (scripts whose basic characters denote consonants fol- lowed by a particular vowel and in which diacritics denote the other vowels) (Daniels 1996c). In the continuum from semantic to phonetic sys- tems, the more restricted and specific the phonetic unit being encoded in the graphs, the smaller the size of the signary or total inventory of graphs that are needed to create messages. Thus, logographic systems potentially could have large and open signaries, whereas syllabic and alphabetic scripts have small and closed ones. The different levels of phoneticism are also re- flected in the morphology of the graphic representa- tions. In logographic systems, the signs tend to be monographic; in syllabic and alphabetic scripts, mean- ing is conveyed by polygraphic arrangements of signs. The debate in defining writing stems from adopt- ing an exclusivistic or an inclusivistic approach. Some scholars consider that writing is limited to glottographic systems (Gelb 1963; Diringer 1968; DeFrancis 1989; Daniels 1996c), whereas others encompass semasiographic forms as well (Hill 1967; Sampson 1985; Galarza 1992; Brotherston 1992, 1995; Boone 1994). Although the more inclusivistic approach is ill equipped to deal with questions about the origin of phonetic writing, its advocates generally and implicidy acknowl- edge that it is a hallmark of higher levels of social or- ganization. Thus, Paleolithic cave paintings - although semasiographic - are presumably not considered writ- ing. Conversely, apparent odd instances of urban soci- eties without writing - like Moche, Wari, and Inca in South America - are resolved by taking into account the production of complex iconography and the quipus. On the basis of the premise that language is the most nearly complete and self-contained aspect of human communication, DeFrancis (1989) classifies writing systems according to the amount of verbal thought they are capable of conveying, ranging from those im- parting any and all thought (full writing, toward the phonetic end) to those that render only some of it (partial writing, toward the semantic end). Their range of applicability also varies. With "full writing systems," 8</page><page sequence="27">users can produce a fiction novel, a dissertation on proteolytic cleavage of capsid protein precursors, or a philosophical discourse about historicistic finitude and the hermeneutics of facticity. On the other hand, 4 'par- tial writing systems" have limited uses, as in the case of the set of semantic signs in airports whose only function is to inform travelers of the availability of services. Presumably then, this book would be unfea- sible if my only recourse were a semantic system of communication. It is generally recognized among those who embrace an exclusivistic definition that writing began sometime during the development of logographic systems. Spe- cifically, the threshold of writing is signaled when graphs are used not for their meaning but because of their sound value. This is accomplished by relying on the homophonic principle. It involves taking advantage of homophones in the language - that is, words that sound similar but have different meaning - and then using the sign for the word that is more easy to render graphi- cally. This is usually referred to as rebus writing. The fairly frequent occurrence of homophones in En- glish - a feature that varies among languages - allows us to illustrate the use of the homophonic principle by combining the pictographic signs for eye, can, knot, bee, maid, die (with two dots), pick, tie, knee, and flower to form the utterance "I can not be made to pick tiny flower(s)" (Fig. 1.4A).The nature and use of the signs in this example is diverse. For instance, most logographs represent monosyllabic words of the CV variety (bee, two, knee), and CVC type (can, knot, maid, pick). The word "flower" is an exception that combines both types of syllabic compounds. In one case, two monosyllabic logographs are used to form a bisyllabic word (tie-knee for tiny). All signs are pictographic, although the die includes the number two as a couple of dots, a repre- sentation that is in itself symbolic. Although based on natural relationships, some graphs are more culture spe- cific than others. Although the signs eye, knot, bee, knee, and flower could be universally identified as such, those for can, maid, dice, pick, and tie are more likely to be discerned only by someone with a contemporary western(ized) urban background. Also, in the logograph flower, meaning and graphic representation coincide, so it is a semantic sign that does not involve the homo- phonic principle. Whereas the homophonic principle is a trait of logographic systems, the acrophonic principle marks the existence of syllabic and alphabetic writing. The acrophonic principle comes into play when it is agreed that a given sign represents one portion of a word the sign stands for. In syllabic systems, the selected portion usually stands for the stressed syllable in a word inde- pendent of its position in it. A hypothetical example is the use of the pictograph of a telephone to stand for the syllable pho (S = /foe/). In defining the reper- toire of signs in alphabetic scripts, the acrophonic prin- ciple involves selecting the initial phoneme of the word that is being represented by a given graph. The example of the homophonic principle in Fig- ure 1.4A clarifies that "picture writing" is not the same as semasiography because pictographs can encode sound through the homophonic or the acrophonic principle; conversely, and as mentioned before, semasiographic systems can be based entirely on the use of symbols. The tendency to confuse picture writ- ing with semasiography arises from the fact that most if not all pristine writing systems have graphic reper- toires in which signs are based on natural relationships between sign and referent. Drawing a distinction be- tween semasiography and glottography in pristine logographic and syllabic scripts is equally difficult for the same reason. In the latter writing systems, the pic- tographic origin of signs is not apparent. But in many scripts (Demotic, Chinese, Latin), the graphs have been modified through time until they become highly con- ventionalized representations. We could view the let- ter A in our own script as a symbolic graph, but the sign presumably derives - through the acrophonic principle - from the rendition of the head of an ox (aleph in Phoenician) (Robinson 1995: 164-167). By clarifying the semiotics of signs and distinguish- ing the semantic and phonetic principles in visual com- munication, the disagreements about how to approach writing might now be more obvious. Underlying the debate of how to define writing and how to classify diverse forms are dissimilar notions of how cognition, language, and visual forms of communication inter- play with one another. At the core of many current definitions of writing and of the schemes to classify diverse scripts is the assumption that writing is a form of communication entirely subsumed under the realm 9</page><page sequence="28">Fig. 1 .4 Examples of (A) pictographs and the homophonic principle, (B) Western contemporary uses of semasiography in advertising, and (C) in technology manuals (reprinted from Sampson 1985 with permission of Stanford University Press). 10</page><page sequence="29">of language. From this point of view, the study of writing should be the domain of linguistics (DeFrancis 1989). That there is a close feedback between thought and language during much of the learning process is not denied. Yet, the extreme position of considering that cognition is limited by language - known as lin- guistic determinism - is untenable. There are thoughts, for example in the creative process, that cannot be ana- lyzed or explained linguistically (Polanyi 1966). There are also cognitive processes that can be conveyed visu- ally but that are nonverbal. For example, some forms of visual communication, like maps or renderings of complex technological devices, are based on percep- tive processes and do not need to make reference to verbal language (Arnheim 1969; Ferguson 1977). Equally pervasive among some students of writing is to equate cognition and language - that is, to assume that thought itself is merely a kind of internal speech. What is usually considered writing in the western in- tellectual tradition is only the interplay between lan- guage and visual communication, with the added cor- ollary of the relative material permanency of the end product. Yet, implicit in the work of those who have dealt with graphic forms of communication outside of the western tradition is the view that cognition, language, and visual communication do not consti- tute a set of neatly self-contained phenomena em- bedded one upon the other; rather, those phenomena are seen as partial overlaps. Such overlays provide a myriad of processes and manifestations, sometimes rendered more complex by the specific sociocultural settings in which systems of communication are used. Another issue that is much debated in the study of writing systems has to do with evolutionary trajecto- ries. Some scholars deplore unilineal paradigms (Boone 1994), and others have discussed multilineal models that do not espouse a teleological tendency toward "the alphabet" (Justeson and Mathews 1990; Sampson 1985; DeFrancis 1989). That alphabetic scripts are still discussed in final chapters of books dealing with writ- ing systems is simply because these are historically late appearances. Despite the fact that semasiographic and glottographic systems are based on different principles, scholars who equate semasiography with picture writ- ing maintain that the former could have been the fore- runner of writing (Gelb 1963; Pulgram 1976). Con- sequently, semasiography constitutes to them a prewriting stage. Yet, the fact is that semantic forms of communication have a longer history than phonetic systems and their use has not disappeared in contem- porary societies, regardless of whether these rely on syllabic or alphabetic scripts. Semasiography is perva- sive in contexts in which visual perception is critical (as in highway signs), in social spheres of interaction involving linguistic boundaries (such as airports), and in advertising, where images enticingly complement orthographic texts. Figure 1.4B illustrates the simple yet effective relationship between image and text that pervades in contemporary forms of communication. Aside from a visual pun between a small rodent and a device that facilitates the use of a computer, the tail of the mouse forms one of the letters in the text. In some limited and highly specific modern applications - as in manuals for modern technology - semasiography replaces entirely the glottographic component (Fig. 1.4C). Because semasiography has always coexisted with glottographic systems and is based on perception rather than linguistic encoding and decoding, it seems more likely that glottographic systems originated indepen- dently of semasiography. The development of pristine scripts is usually assumed to be slow and through a process of trials and errors, transformations, and im- provements. Yet, the rates at which the few histori- cally documented cases of new scripts - such as the Cherokee, Bamum, and Ndjuka - were developed (Daniels 1996a: 583-585) suggest that writing systems are inventions whose core characteristics can be set in place in a relatively short span. Although the inventors of these historically known scripts knew about writ- ing and borrowed the idea to apply it to their particu- lar languages, the results were invariably syllabaries with signs for CV syllables (ibid.: 583). This might be so because syllables are an intuitive way of segmenting words, whereas elucidation of phonemes and the in- vention of consonantal and alphabetic scripts require that the speech encoded in them was rigorously ana- lyzed by the inventor (s) (Hass 1976: 141). Today it is generally agreed that the evolution of scripts has been multidirectional. Thus, although semasiographic systems do not evolve into logographic systems, some logosyllabic scripts can be modified into ii</page><page sequence="30">a more phonetic script or can even be replaced by another logosyllabic system. Also, none of the attested syllabaries is known to have been modified into an alphabetic script (Justeson n.d.: 138). The widespread distribution of alphabetic systems today has litde to do with an inherent "superior" quality but rather can be accounted for in terms of various social, political, and technological factors. Ultimately, the type of writing system has some re- lationship with the language that is encoded in it (Justeson n.d.: 243; Sampson 1985: 16), but the affin- ity between writing and language needs clarification. I have previously noted how the distinction between semasiographic and glottographic communication means that, in the former, a message can be decoded by a monolingual person whose language is different from that of the person who encoded it. That is why logographic systems are linguistically international. Yet, once the homophonic principle is involved, the graphic system becomes language specific. Linguistic speci- ficity, however, is usually not a one-to-one correspon- dence between a script and a given language. Actually, the same script can be used to render different lan- guages. Cuneiform writing, for example, was used to write some 15 languages in the course of its three millennia of development (Robinson 1995: 91). In addition, a single language can be rendered with vari- ous degrees of accuracy by means of different scripts (DeFrancis 1989: frontispiece, 249). Written language, even in the case of alphabetic scripts, is by no means a straightforward transcription of spoken language (DeFrancis 1989: 50-51). Some scripts, for instance, are characterized as being more "phonetically efficient" than others (Robinson 1995: 14). A common trait of writing systems is that they do not provide representations for the whole range of phonetic and grammatical units in the spoken lan- guage, a trait referred to as incompleteness (Sampson 1985: 35-38). Whereas it is unlikely that any script attains total completeness, writing systems differ con- siderably in their degree of incompleteness. Accord- ing to Sampson (ibid.), early scripts are often quite incomplete because of their logographic component. Yet, alphabetic writing systems also share this trait. For example, the ancestral version of the Hebrew script included signs for consonants only, and the users had to supply the vowels on the basis of context (DeFrancis 1989: 170). A more familiar analogue in the United States that parallels a situation in which people have to figure out a reading based on context is the person- alized automobile plate. A plate that gives PCNRTH can effortlessly be read as "Peace on earth." In this example, however, the lack of signs for vowels is not an inherent feature of the English alphabetic script. Incompleteness is due to the limited amount of space on the plate. To illustrate how incompleteness varies in a logographic and a glottographic system, Figure 1.5 shows a sentence encoded in a hypothetical lexi- cal script and in the English alphabetic system. The logographic message in Figure 1.5A1 "cat walked over mat" is less complete than the version in Figure 1.5A2. Incompleteness in the English alphabetic transcrip- tion in Figure 1.5B is evident from the inability to distinguish intonation that would indicate, for instance, whether the statement is affirmative, a neutral ques- tion, or an affirmative inquiry. Mixed Logosyllabic Scripts Because the development of writing systems is not unilineal, and scripts tend to be accretions of several components, a common situation in the history of writing has been the existence of mixed scripts, par- ticularly those combining logographic and syllabic components. As mentioned before, unless it has lim- ited applicability, a purely logographic script seems unfeasible, and none of the writing systems attested worldwide is known to be based exclusively on logographs. That lexic signs are mixed with syllabic ones is due to the phenomenon of "double articula- tion" in language (Sampson 1985: 32-33). Thought is first articulated into a large range of meaningful units (morphemes), but because of human physical limita- tions in the production of different sounds (phonemes), it is not possible to provide enough distinct sounds for the several thousands of morphemes contained in a language.Thus, a second independent articulation based on sound and not meaning is required. With the ex- ception of onomatopoeic words, strings of sounds are then associated to morphemes in an arbitrary way - that is, without a relationship to the meaning of the semantic units. In the end, with a limited set of pho- 12</page><page sequence="31">Fig. 1.5 Incompleteness as a common feature of writing systems (adapted from Sampson 1985: 33, 36). nemes it is possible to generate enough combinations to provide the pronunciation for all the morphemes in a language. A parallel situation applies to the signary of a script. Because a language has thousands of words in its lexicon, a purely word-based script would equally require thousands of graphs. This in turn would ne- cessitate ample memory on the part of users and an extraordinary coordination among scribes to main- tain canons in the representation of signs. On the other end, because glottographic writing systems are founded on the second articulation of language, it is possible to invent unmixed syllabic and alphabetic scripts. Logosyllabic systems tend to have large signaries commonly ranging in the hundreds and exceptionally even in the thousands of graphs. For instance, the Chinese script has several thousand characters (Gelb 1963: 115; Sampson 1985: 161; DeFrancis 1989: 96). Approximately 800 signs are now known in Maya writ- ing (Stuart and Houston 1989: 86), and, of its syllabic component, about 100 of some 200 predicted pho- netic elements have been identified (Houston 1989: 41). In contrast, exclusively syllabic scripts have signaries of between 40 and 90 graphs, and segmentary scripts, either alphabetic or consonantal, have between 20 and 40 signs in their signaries (Gelb 1963: 164; Daniels 1996b: 142). Whereas the inventory of graphs in glottographic scripts can be characterized as closed, those of logographic systems are open. The signaries of logosyllabic systems, in which scribes and readers have to master a large number of graphs, are potentially prone to continuous modifications. Historically, to accomplish greater degrees of efficiency, users of such systems implemented ways to reduce the signaries to 13</page><page sequence="32">manageable sizes. One option was to use a given glyph to represent several morphemes. This is a phenom- enon known as polyvalency - that is, a single sign can have several different readings. Another alternative was to develop complex signs with two elements: a pho- netic base and a determinative element. The latter is devoid of phonetic value and indicates only the se- mantic category in which the word in question be- longs. This alternative could result in signs that, de- spite being identical, could stand for alternative mor- phemes. The reverse situation was also common - that is, one in which the same morpheme could be writ- ten in different ways. Two or more different signs that represent the same morpheme are called allographs. In the case of clusters of graphs, no signs function exclusively as phonetic bases or as determinatives. In other words, a given glyph may occur exclusively as an isolated phonetic base with a determinative, or as the phonetic base in a series of complex glyphs, or form the determinative in other sets of aggregates. In a logosyllabic system, a given logograph can stand for a range of different words.This usually applies to those words whose meaning is extended by metonymy - that is, to polysemous morphemes (e.g., sun-day or heart-love). The complexities in mixed logosyllabic scripts just noted (polyvalency, phonetic bases, determinatives, allographs, and polysemous mor- phemes) render obsolete any attempt of interpreting signs solely on the basis of their presumed semantic substratum. For such readings to withstand, the pres- ence of phonetic encoding first must be disproved. Writing in Mesoamerica An emphasis in defining writing as being exclusively phonetic has led to much confusion in dealing with scripts outside the western tradition. Authors working with African, Asiatic, and European scripts argued for the absence of "true" or "full" writing in Mesoamerica (e.g., Gelb 1963: 53-59). Ethnocentric biases among students of native American cultures also have been prevalent. With the exception of Maya script, other Mesoamerican systems often have been described as examples of "partial" writing (Prem 1973), "rudimen- tary," or "not highly developed" glyphic systems (Berlo 1983: 9, 14).The pervasiveness of a semasiographic com- ponent in Mesoamerican graphic systems also has led to the concept of "embedded texts" (Berlo 1983, 1989). The underlying premise of such a concept is that, by encoding meanings "normally" conveyed through ver- bal means in images, the phonetic component should be seen as subsidiary to the narrative pictography. Thus, the function of embedded texts "is to resolve the am- biguous nature of imagery" (Berlo 1983: 2, 17), a state- ment that might be more an etically imposed distinc- tion by scholars than an emically perceived difference by the users of the graphic systems. A radically different approach, espoused by Galarza (1988, 1992), is to main- tain that the distinction between image and text is un- warranted, because both are based on pictures.The two components, in his view, encode speech. If the homophonic and acrophonic principles are taken as thresholds of writing, then most if not all of the Mesoamerican graphic systems can be considered as legitimate examples of writing. Grouping them so does not deny striking differences among Zapotec,Epi- 01mec,Teotihuacan, Maya, Xochicalco, Nuine, Mixtec, and Aztec scripts (Figs. 1.6 and 1.7). Given this diversity, it seems appropriate to place the Mesoamerican ex- amples in a continuum, one in which the emphasis on either the semantic or the phonetic components varies. Semantic systems are thought to have limited applica- bility (Hass 1976: 143), yet Mesoamerican scripts are sui generis in the elaboration of semasiography and its use on a variety of scribal genres. Consequently, in the case of these graphic forms, it cannot be postulated that the less they rely on phonetic clues, the less their capability for and flexibility in transmitting large arrays of mes- sages. By encoding several layers of meaning, the highly developed semasiographic components in Mesoamerican writing systems seemingly convey con- siderable amounts of information.3 DeFrancis's (1989) exclusivistic definition that writ- ing encompasses only those graphic systems that con- 3 See, for instance, Kubler (1967) for a discussion of meta- phors in the graphic system of Teotihuacan,Monaghan (1990) and King (1990) for examples in the Mixtec writing system, and Galarza (1988) for an exposition of the expressive richness in Aztec writing. 14</page><page sequence="33">vey any and all thought does not account for the spe- cific social contexts of scripts.When the Mesoamerican examples are viewed in such contexts, and consider- ing that writing was imbued with a divine origin, only certain types of information were important to those who invented, patronized, promoted, and transmitted the scripts. Therefore, what such an exclusivistic defi- nition might imply in these cases is that the systems were potentially capable of conveying much thought, even though the phonetic features of the scripts were actually used for very specific purposes. For instance, some early colonial documents fromTepedaoztoc, near Texcoco in the basin of Mexico, illustrate the adaptive flexibility of the Aztec glyphic system when it was used to record Spanish words and proper names by the almost exclusive means of phonetic indicators (cf. Arreola 1920; Prem and Riese 1983: 177). Also, the differential preservation of material culture in the Mesoamerican archaeological record imposes limita- tions for seeing the full array of uses or all the possible societal applications of a script. Denying the status of writing to Mesoamerican graphic systems entails more than differences of opin- ion resting on a technicality. Because the lack of writ- ing is invariably perceived as the lack of history, the assertion that Mesoamerican indigenous groups had no writing promotes imperialistic attitudes and ulti- mately contributes to the continuous domination of contemporary Mesoamerican peoples (Brotherston 1992, 1995; Galarza 1992). My goal is not to derive a "precise" or a "true" defi- nition of writing. After all, definitions are simply ar- bitrary heuristic devices, tools that should enable us to examine, with little or much success, the phenom- enon under study. That Zapotec glyphs constitute el- ements of a writing system is beyond dispute. Despite diverse approaches, the script has been assumed to be a mixed system since the beginning of this century (Batres 1902; Caso 1928). The fact that its "ortho- graphic" component has an inextricable relationship to an elaborate semasiography necessitates an approach in which both aspects are not divorced. Knorozov (1958: 284) applies the term hieroglyphic to refer to the textual features of early mixed systems, and it is in this sense that the word is used here, as opposed to the actual etymology of the Greek words hieros (sacred) and glyphein (to carve) - that is, religious, sacred, ob- scure, esoteric writing. Quite probably the actual con- tent of some Zapotec inscriptions is religious or at least makes direct or indirect reference to mythology, but, again, the term hieroglyphic in this case refers to the nature and not the content of the script. Language of the Inscriptions Alfonso Caso (1928: 9-13) was the first scholar to recognize a correspondence between the geographic area of the inscriptions discussed here and the region where the Zapotec language is spoken today. But Caso made this observation in relation to later inscriptions dating between the fifth and ninth centuries a.d. (1965b: 931). Actually, the known extent of the Zapotec script falls partially within the present-day distribution of the language. Yet, Caso s assertion and its applicability to the entire developmental trajectory of the script can be substantiated by the following arguments: 1 . Ethnohistoric data confirm a late expan- sion of Mixtec groups from western Oaxaca into the central valleys (Paddock 1966, 1982; Whitecotton 1990). This likely resulted in a bilingual situation and in some cases the dis- placement of Zapotec speakers. A concomi- tant eastern expansion of Zapotec toward the isthmus, encroaching on the Huaves, is also supported by ethnohistoric and linguistic data (Whitecotton 1990;Rendon 1962). Thus, be- fore the eleventh century a.d., Zapotec lan- guage had a different distribution within southwestern Mesoamerica. The known ex- tent of inscriptions that can be attributed to the Zapotecs on the basis of stylistic similari- ties covers western and central Oaxaca. The composite distribution of the script shown in Figure 1.8, which lumps examples from the entire developmental sequence of the script, coincides fully with the presumed ex- tent of Zapotec language before the eleventh century a.d. I should note, however, that - with the exception of the western (Urcid and Joyce 1999) and northeastern limits (Oudijk 15</page><page sequence="34">Fig. 1.6 Examples of Mesoamerican scripts (not to relative scale): (A) Epi-Olmec, (B) Zapotec, (C)Teotihuacan, (D and E) Maya, and (F) Xochicalco. 1 6</page><page sequence="35">Fig. 1.7 Examples of Mesoamerican scripts (not to relative scale): (A) Nuine, (B) Mixteca-Puebla, and (C) Aztec. and Urcid 1997) - the maximum spread of the writing system was determined on the basis of inscriptions that were found on por- table media (Fig. 1.9). 2. Continuities in the archaeological record suggest that an archaic form(s) of the con- temporary variants of Zapotec was the lan- guage used and encoded in the earlier inscrip- tions from the central valleys of Oaxaca. 3. Other languages of Oaxaca, belonging to the same family as the Zapotec language or to different ones (e.g., Mixe-Zoque), have geographic distributions that do not coincide with the main locus of the script (i.e., Monte Alban and the central valleys of Oaxaca) .Their elimination as linguistic candidates for the in- scriptions is based on scientific parsimony. Given that the underlying premise of this study is that ancient Zapotec writing reflects linguistic prop- 17</page><page sequence="36">Fig. 1.8 The known extent of Zapotec inscriptions and present-day distribution of the Zapotec linguistic branch. erties, it is necessary to briefly outline some general characteristics of the Zapotec language.4 Zapotec is a subbranch belonging to the Otomanguean family. On the basis of its current geographic distribution and presumed antiquity, this family constitutes a group of languages that must have been spoken by peoples who played a key role in the origins of agriculture and ur- ban life in Mesoamerica (Swadesh 1949: 420; Hopkins 1984: 30). Currently, we have only a general under- standing of the linguistic kinship of the Otomanguean family and its evolutionary development. In addition to Zapotecan (Zn),the family encompasses eight other branches: (1) Otopamean (OP), (2) Popolocan (Pn), (3) Mixtecan (Mn), (4) Tlapanec (Tl), (5) Amuzgo (A), (6) Chinantecan (Cn), (7) Huavean (H), and (8) Chiapanec-Manguean (C-M) (Figs. 1.10 and 1.11). According to glottochronological estimations, the diversification of Otomanguean languages occurred earlier than in other linguistic families in Mesoamerica. For instance, whereas the proto-Mayan family appears to have begun diversification circa 2000 B.C., proto- Otomanguean did so some 2000 years earlier (Hopkins 1984: 31). Aside from a general evolutionary outline of the Otomanguean family, practically nothing is known of the historical development of the individual groups that it comprises (ibid.:29).By 1300 B.C. the pre-proto- Zapotecan branch of the Otomanguean family was al- ready distinct, existing as a relatively independent vari- ety of speech, and was probably internally diversified. It also shared relatively few innovations with the other 4 Extensive bibliographies on the Zapotec language can be found in Jimenez Moreno (1942) and Hopkins and Josserand (1979: 130-141). The summary on the Zapotec language pre- sented here is based on the works of Swadesh (1947, 1949), Reeck (1982), Justeson et al. (1985), and Fernandez de Miranda (1995). Joseph Whitecotton (1982) and Whitecotton and Whitecotton (1993: 410-423) provide a discussion of early colonial sources on the Zapotec language. l8</page><page sequence="37">a* 'u u t/l o &lt;D 4-&gt; o a, N o 4-&gt; g fi &lt;L&gt; U 3 S" &amp; 8 to &lt;L&gt; Â£ &lt;L&gt; S3 &lt;u *T3 o T3 &lt;u on 3 &lt;L) â M Â§ "d &lt;L) Â£ "C u a ON 5b Â£ 19</page><page sequence="38">eight branches. The proto-Zapotecan languages con- tinued diversifying until 450 B.C., when the Chatino group split and pre-Zapotec appeared. By a.d. 550, at the time of proto-Zapotec, Chatino and Zapotec where sufficiently differentiated to constitute separate groups (Hopkins 1984; Justeson et al. 1985: 21). Today, Zapotec languages are a highly diversified group encompassing several mutually unintelligible variants. Each of the variants has a number of lan- guages. The degree of differentiation in present-day Chatino might be represented by as many as three vari- ants (Terrence Kaufman, personal communication 1995). Using an apt analogy, Swadesh noted, The Zapotec linguistic family seems to be, on a smaller scale, what the Romance family is on a greater scale. That is, the Zapotec lan- guages spoken by a population of some 200,000 people inhabiting half of the present day state of Oaxaca, have the linguistic diver- sification that the Romance languages ex- hibit among its 200 million speakers distrib- uted in parts of Europe and large portions of the New World. (Swadesh 1949: 419) The Zapotec group is classified into four subdivi- sions that include (1) Miahuateco (southern moun- tains), (2) valley Zapotec (central valleys), (3) Serrano (northern mountains), and (4) western Zapotec (in- cluding a variant formerly distinguished as Papabuco) (Fig. 1.1 2). Valley Zapotec and Serrano Zapotec are in turn so diversified that they warrant further subdivi- sions. The former includes a main valley variant (2a), a smaller valley variant (2b), and a Tehuantepec variant (2c). Nexitzo (3a) and Villalteco (3b) are variants of the Serrano Zapotec. Among the four main variants there are important phonetic differences but few structural ones (Swadesh 1949: 427). In general, the phonetic elements include 5 vowels and between 19 and 24 consonants (occlu- sive, resonant, and fricative). Among these, one of the most characteristic phonemes is the glottal stop, which conveys meaning. Thus, la (yes) la' (leaf) zeda (cigarette) zeda' (scraper) bela (become loose) bela' (to frighten) The glottal stop occurs only at the end of a syl- lable. It is found between vowels but is pronounced at the end of the first one (ibid.: 433). Zapotec is also a tonal language (three or four tones) and, as in the case of the glottal stop, tone also conveys mean- ing. Thus, da (bean) !da_animal grease) zeda (corn cob) !zeda_(cigarette) lo (eye) !lo_carbon) !lo (agave stem) Many homophones are used in Zapotec (Reeck 1982: 374). The word order in the language is gener- ally verb-subject-object (VSO) (Swadesh 1949: 446; Rosenbaum 1974: 10; Monzon and Lara 1979: 58; Reeck 1982: 374). Zapotec is slightly synthetic in its structure, consisting mainly of bisyllabic roots with few prefixes and suffixes (Swadesh 1949: 421). Mono- syllabic roots of some modern variants appear to be reductions of bisyllabic roots (ibid.; Marcus and Flannery 1978: 57). This trend suggests the possibility that archaic Zapotec was less synthetic than today's Zapotec (Swadesh 1949: 421). Zapotec relies on juxtaposition in the formation of sentences, but, in the process of combining the elements, these are not phonetically modified. Char- acteristically, Zapotec syntax places the descriptive element after a main element (e.g., hair-mouth = mustache) (ibid.: 424). Because there are no particles to mark the relationship between elements, juxtapo- sition indicates those relationships. This certainly puzzled Friar Juan de Cordova, who, after becoming a proficient Zapotec speaker (central valleys variant), maintained, The way the natives speak is with truncated and loose sentences that are not linked by con- junctions or any other particles; rather they speak a dozen sentences without conjunctions, which for us would seem like barbarism. (Cordova [1578] 1886: 89)5 Swadesh (1947) and Fernandez de Miranda (1995) reconstructed the phonological structure of 5 Unless otherwise noted, all translations are mine. 20</page><page sequence="39">proto-Zapotec, the language from about a.d. 550 on. According to these reconstructions, the phonemic sys- tem included 5 vowels and between 13 and 16 conso- nants (strong, resonant, and weak as well as the glottal stop). These generate a syllabic grid with some 60 to 70 CV combinations. Neither Swadesh (1947: 228- 229) nor Fernandez de Miranda (1995: 18) delves into the question of tone because of the lack of reliable data. Nothing is published of the phonological, mor- phological, and syntactical features of pre-Zapotec from 450 B.C. to a.d. 550 - that is, of the language that must be encoded in the earlier hieroglyphic inscriptions. The most ancient form of the Zapotec language available for epigraphic studies is found in the writ- ings of early missionaries, natives knowledgeable of the European tradition, or colonial administrators. Among the several postcontact sources there is the in- valuable vocabulary of Friar Juan de Cordova, per- haps the most comprehensive of any native Mesoamerican language (Reeck 1982: 369; Whitecotton 1983: 59). However, this vocabulary as well as several grammars were recorded by using the model of Latin syntax. Swadesh (1949: 439), for ex- ample, described how this procedure distorted certain aspects related to the combination of elements (pho- netic and syntactic). In addition, Cordovas compila- tion is not strictly a vocabulary because it contains idiomatic expressions. In these expressions, words are not identified or separated. Reeck (1982: 372) gives two excellent examples of long, undivided phrases, one of which is the entry for "inquisitor" ( Inquisidor de la sancta inquisition): huetogotichateniquelatielijlachixiticha Dios (Cordova [1578] 1886:235) [Person who puts down word concerning the straight-heart word of God - that is, person who enforces the mandate of God] hue person who t habitual-tense marker ogo puts down ticha word teni concerning quela nominalizer of a verb tie habitual-tense marker lij straight laachi heart xi possessive marker ticha word Dios God To identify a word root in the vocabulary, it is neces- sary to compare several related entries. This procedure does not always provide the desired results. Besides the Latin syntactical model, Spanish orthography was not suited to reflect accurately the phonetic elements of the language, especially the glottal stop and the tone. Therefore, sixteenth-century Zapotec also represents a "challenge" to linguists (Reeck 1982). A linguistic approach to the study of Zapotec in- scriptions currently faces a series of difficulties. Aside from the need to understand sixteenth-century Zapotec, the most ancient form available in a known recording system, it is necessary to determine the pho- nological, morphological, and syntactical features of pre-Zapotec and then to determine the degree of simi- larity or difference to the later variants of proto- Zapotec and those recorded in the sixteenth century. Until this is accomplished, the use of Cordova's Vocabulario for epigraphic purposes can have but lim- ited application. Therefore, the few "phonetic read- ings" presented in this study - which are based on Cordova s data - are hypothetical. Because of their ten- tative nature and the premises upon which they are based, these phonetic readings are simply a transcrip- tion of Cordova s orthography. Although its underly- ing phonological elements have been worked out (Reeck 1982: 371), a transliteration into an actual pho- netic system was purposefully avoided. Methods Used in This Study To decipher a hieroglyphic script, a combination of factors or a set of necessary requirements must be met. Knowledge of the archaic language (s) is one. Another is the availability of large or self-contained bodies of inscriptions. A third factor is the existence of direct translations of a glyphic text into a known script or language (biscript texts). The major breakthroughs in the study of other 21</page><page sequence="40">Fig. 1.10 Current distribution of the Otomanguean family of languages. Fig. 1.11 Glottochronology of the Otomanguean family (after Hopkins 1984: 43). 22</page><page sequence="41">Mesoamerican writing systems - particularly the Maya, Aztec, and Mixtec - have been accomplished because of the convergence of these factors. For instance, the corpus of Maya inscriptions - in carved stones, mural paintings, portable objects, and codices - is consider- able. Also, the Aztec and Mixtec materials, although comparatively less abundant than the Maya, are usu- ally self-contained - that is, they consist of books or inscriptions in diverse media that deal with discrete, frequently complete, and emically organized themes. The scholars working with these scripts have also ben- efited from biscript texts from the colonial period. Such documents have helped unravel either the nature of the script or at least the specific content of inscrip- tions. For example Diego de Landa's "alphabet," in the case of Maya script, opened the road for reconstruct- ing the syllabic grid of the script (Knorozov 1956). The Matricula de Huexotzinco, which contains lists of individuals with their names in glyphic form and the Nahuatl equivalents in the roman script (Prem 1974), added to the rudimentary understanding of the nature of the Aztec writing system that was provided as early as the 1790s by studies of the Codex Mendoza. The Mapa de Teozacualco, with its list of married couples and its geographic referents, led to determi- nation of the genealogical content of the Mixtec cod- ices and their provenience from specific towns in the Mixteca Alta (Caso 1949a). None of the three conditions is met for the study of Zapotec writing. Consequently, we are faced with the problem of how to proceed in the study of a script for which the language involved is presumed but whose ancestral form(s) has been partially reconstructed, for which few complete inscriptions are available, and for which there is, as yet, no documentary source acting as a key. Given the current drawbacks of a linguistic approach, the emphasis here is preeminently archaeo- logical. Thus, this study cannot aim at phonetic deci- pherment. Two types of analyses have been followed in trying to build the necessary foundation for a bet- ter understanding of the script: the comparative and the contextual methods. The Comparative Method Epigraphic comparisons can be internal or external. In seeking to understand the Zapotec script in its own terms, my emphasis has been first on an internal com- parison of the inscribed materials found in a localized region and attributable to a single system. Although I do not dispute the usefulness of extending compari- sons to look for resemblances or differences with bet- ter known scripts, particularly given the logographic component in the different Mesoamerican scripts, I have considered the application of external compari- son to be secondary. Only when certain problems re- main unsolved after the use of internal data have I felt justified to turn to external comparisons. If the se- quence in which these two strategies of the compara- tive method are used is reversed, one runs the risk of homogenizing cultural phenomena and obliterating variability. More dangerous is falling in the trap of fitting data into a preconceived scheme and distorting evidence in the process of doing so (Barber 1974: 15). My use of internal comparison in this case has been extended to include not only epigraphic data but also sixteenth-century sources written in Zapotec, specifi- cally Juan de Cordova s Vocabulario and Arte en lengua gapoteca, both works originally published in 1578.There are other colonial Zapotec vocabularies and grammars (Judith Whitecotton 1982; Whitecotton and Whitecotton 1993), but my exclusive reliance on the works of Cordova stems from the fact that his is the earliest European documentation of Zapotec day names. Also, although the limitations in using sixteenth- century linguistic data to cope with inscriptions that span from the fifth century B.C. to the ninth century a.d. are obvious, it seems more appropriate to rely on documents written in a language that is historically derived from the presumed language of the inscrip- tions than to build arguments based on unrelated tongues. Fundamental to conducting internal comparisons is the availability of a large corpus of accurately repro- duced inscriptions. Although the currently available glyphic material attributable to the Zapotecs is not as abundant as that of the Maya, it was possible to as- semble a sizeable corpus by compiling inscribed ex- amples widely dispersed in publications, by searching others through field surveys - both in archaeological sites as well as in present-day villages and towns - and by documenting inscribed objects housed in muse- ums and private collections. The first step was to gather all the published ex- 23</page><page sequence="42">Fig. 1.12 Current distribution of the Zapotecan branch and its subdivisions. amples of inscriptions into a single catalogue. It soon became obvious that the major difficulty in working with this material is its differential presentation. Some inscribed examples are available only in photographs, others only in drawings. In many instances it was not possible to generate reliable renderings from photo- graphs. Even in the case of high-quality photographic reproductions, shadows or oblique angles did not al- low an accurate determination of the shape and con- figuration of glyphs. Also, in most cases, the photo- graphs lack a scale, giving little idea of the size of the glyphs and the inscribed objects. The use of published drawings had its problems too. The renderings differ in technique and in accuracy of glyphic details as well as in proportion and scale of inscribed examples. In Figure 1.13, for example, vari- ous versions of a carved monolith now designated MA- SP-3 are compared.6 The drawing on the right side of the lower row is the one made for this study. This rendering does not attempt to enhance the inscribed stone, to reflect the width of the carved lines, or to accentuate the different carved levels. The simpler the drawings, the clearer the reproductions for epigraphic analysis. Because of the difficulties outlined above, one of my aims during the field surveys was to locate the already published examples and check the inscriptions to document them consistently and reproduce them by means of reliable illustrations. I also hoped that in the process of searching for known inscriptions I would be able to locate and record additional examples. The search began in archaeological sites that had already 6 See Appendix 2 for a key to the designation of inscribed examples and their geographic provenience. 24</page><page sequence="43">been explored and contained nonremovable features with writing. Surprisingly, I recorded many unpub- lished examples in these settings. Surveys in unexplored localities were less productive. I was able to locate only a few previously unknown inscribed stones, and some of them were only partially exposed. Invariably, their state of erosion was advanced because of their unpro- tected condition. A more successful survey strategy was the documen- tation of carved stones embedded in churches, public buildings, and houses in many villages and towns throughout Oaxaca. These monoliths have been found, dragged, and reused - in some cases probably since colonial times. In a few instances, even though the existence of inscribed stones in specific villages was already known or determined through the survey, it was not possible to record them. Understandably, local people sometimes do not trust strangers, and diplo- macy was not enough to convince them of the pur- pose of the study. Because not all the present-day setde- ments in Oaxaca could be surveyed, there are still many more exposed, as yet undocumented, carved stones. Although the archaeological context is lost, in most cases preventing one from knowing their place of ori- gin, chronology, and function, the monoliths with re- liefs in villages and towns should be an important fo- cus for future expansion of the corpus. To complement the search, I visited several muse- ums and some private collections. In the case of mu- seums, many of the inscribed examples have already been published. Yet, I documented significant unpub- lished examples in storage rooms. Regrettably, for most of the inscribed objects in public or private reposito- ries, geographic and contextual proveniences are sel- dom documented. The Contextual Approach The contextual method that I use here has two lev- els of application. The first entails examination of the archaeological context as well as of the physical con- dition and state of preservation of inscribed stones. The aim is to determine the sequence of events that each carved monolith underwent, from quarrying and uses within the sociocultural system to final deposi- tion as part of the archaeological record. It is becoming increasingly apparent that most of the known Zapotec inscriptions on stone were part of large narrative compositions intended as architectural decoration, whether public, domestic, or mortuary. Many of these composite narratives were dismantled in antiquity, and the constituent blocks were used again to carve reliefs on the remaining plain surfaces or were simply integrated as construction material in subse- quent architectural projects. Therefore, the configura- tion of the original narrative programs was obliter- ated. Previous studies of Zapotec writing invariably have failed to recognize reuse. Even though the mes- sage carved on individual monuments might be self-contained, the inscriptions are meaningless unless they are treated at least in the same physical sense as they were viewed by their creators. It is as if the pages of a book written in an unknown script were detached, torn into pieces, and then dispersed. Only by putting the pages together and determining their sequence will the first step toward a comprehensive understanding of the inscriptions be gained. Examination of the archaeological contexts and state of preservation of carved monoliths can provide clues to reconstruct the original configuration of narrative compositions. Yet, successful reconstruction depends on the quality of archaeological data and requires that most or all the constituent stones are available. Even if total reconstruction is not feasible, the method s first level of application would prove useful in imposing interpretive limits. When the two necessary conditions are fulfilled, and the inscriptions can be viewed as nar- rative programs, the second level of the contextual ap- proach can be applied. This level refers to the epi- graphic context. It focuses on specific patterns of glyphic arrangements, including associations of par- ticular signs, substitutions of some glyphs for others, recurrent sequences of signs, and variations in the com- bination of signs. It is through the study of epigraphic contexts that the signary of the script can be derived. It also can lead to elucidation of formats of texts and reading orders. Recording Techniques Although it can hardly be claimed that the render- ings used in this study are faithful replicas of the origi- nal inscriptions, the systematic documentation by a single individual brings in a certain degree of consis- 25</page><page sequence="44">Fig. 1.13 Comparison of available drawings of MA-SP-3, Monte Alban. 2 6</page><page sequence="45">The compiled corpus from central Oaxaca consists of some 1200 examples of artistic manifestations in different media, with carved stone as the predominant category. Only 570 of these examples have epigraphy; the rest include only narrative pictography or frag- ments of it. Of the examples with epigraphy, 441 (77%) have already been published. Through fieldwork I was able to document 129 examples that have not been published (23%), and to check 236 (54%) of the pub- lished materials. Some examples of entries in the cor- pus compiled so far as well as recent epigraphic find- ings not included in this study are published elsewhere (Urcid 1994b, 1995b, 1997;n.d.c.:2,figs. 1.26 to 1.29; Urcid and Winter 1989; Urcid, Winter, and Matadamas 1994). Now that the preliminary aspects of this study are outlined, what follows is a journey through more than a thousand years in development of the Zapotec script. The exposition not only summarizes the present ac- complishments in its understanding but also highlights the many challenges for the future. tency.To produce renderings as accurately as possible, I photographed the face of each entire relief as well as details of the inscriptions. I also sketched the monu- ment in situ, using magnifying glasses and touching the carvings to follow the lines of the reliefs. Based on the details of these field sketches, I then traced the draw- ings to scale from photographs. To enhance the usefulness of photography, I used artificial light whenever possible, casting the light at different angles to obtain contrasting shadows. When the use of artificial light was not feasible, I photo- graphed the inscribed examples under natural light but at different times of day. One of the shortcomings of documenting carved stones in villages was the com- plete reliance on natural light, and on several occa- sions I was unable to take frontal photographs and touch the reliefs because of their inaccessible loca- tion - such as carved stones that are embedded high in bell towers of churches. When museum pieces were being documented, the situation was the reverse, as I was able to consistendy use artificial light and to touch the carvings. 27</page><page sequence="46">CHAPTER 2 The Study of Zapotec Hieroglyphic Writing: A Historical and Critical Overview Introduction Scholarly interest in the Zapotec script has a long and intricate history. The beginnings can be traced to Guillermo Dupaix, a Spanish explorer who, in the company of his draftsman Luciano Castaneda, trav- eled through Oaxaca in the early nineteenth century. While describing and documenting several stones carved with hieroglyphs, Dupaix commented, The way of representing thought [in Oaxaca] varies, and displays another arrangement of figures; the symbolic characters are different from the Mexican ones, which demonstrates that this writing is not the same . . . , just as the language was different, so was what is carved. (Alcina Franch 1969: 107-108; Villasenor 1978: 137-138) Since then, several authors have studied the script to determine its nature and to elucidate the specific content of inscriptions. These endeavors can be distinguished in terms of two different types of contributions. On the one hand are authors who have advanced interpretive frame- works; these are a minority. On the other hand are scholars who have recorded only inscriptions, have described or interpreted them by using the available paradigms, or have simply engaged in speculation. Most of the explorers of the nineteenth and early twentieth century fall into this last category. This is understand- able given that the field of Mesoamerican archaeol- ogy was then in its infancy. Today, however, some au- thors still venture to propose grand schemes based on inadequate or precarious evidence. The cumulative result of these efforts is a bewildering confusion in conceptual categories and in the concomitant termi- nology. The purpose of this chapter is to present, in chronological order, a sample of different kinds of contributions, emphasizing those of the few authors who belong to the first group. Some of the works that appear outdated today are discussed because of their role as antecedents. In this way, historical conti- nuity can be appreciated, and the importance of some advances becomes more obvious. Critical evaluations are kept general, because in-depth discussions of spe- cific interpretations are done in other parts of this study. The Early Scholars (Nineteenth to Early Twentieth Century) Although by the late nineteenth century some ar- chaeological materials carved with hieroglyphs had already been published (Dupaix, in Kingsborough 1831, 4; Batres 1889; Seler 1890; Leon 1896; Holmes 1897), almost nothing was known of their proveniences or specific contexts. In 1898 Marshall Saville found the first inscriptions by controlled excavations. His ex- plorations at Xoxocotlan and at Quicopecua, both sites in the vicinity of Monte Alban in the central valleys of Oaxaca, yielded a number of tombs with associ- ated inscriptions (Figs. 2.1 and 2.2). The findings im- mediately lead to the recognition - already anticipated by Dupaix - of the existence of "an entirely new form of writing from that heretofore known in Mexico" (Saville 1899:358-360). In 1901 Nicolas Leon, then professor of ethnology 29</page><page sequence="47">Fig. 2.1 Southern Mesoamerica. in the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, published a photograph of one of the carved stones found by Saville with a commentary to the inscrip- tion (Fig. 2.3). The occurrence of glyphs accompa- nied by coefficients led Leon to believe that the carv- ing contained calendrical dates.1 The graphic con- ventions of the signs were seen as Maya and Nahua, and the format construed as a continuous horizontal arrangement of katuns (periods of 7200 days) with an "initial series" glyph. In addition to the presumed chronological value of the signs, each column in the linear sequence had - according to him - day glyphs 1 Nicolas Leon and subsequent commentators of stone XOX-2 (Caso 1928: 106-107; Marcus 1983g: 150-152, 1992: 284) were not aware of the row of calendrical glyphs in the lower re- cessed surface, because the source for their comments was a photograph by Saville, which had identification numbers for the upper relief covering the lower band. According to Leon (1905a: 178), the lintel of tomb 3 was destroyed after Saville 's excavations. This statement could not be corroborated in a visit to the site in 1987. Although the excavation trench in mound 9 was still visible a few years ago, much debris and vegetation covered the area. Saville made a cast of the lintel and took it to the Museum of Natural History in New York, but it deteriorated to such a degree that it had to be discarded (Barbara Conklin, personal communication, 1990). The draw- ing in Figure 2.3 was derived from an amplification of an- other photograph by Saville found in his archive at the mu- seum. From this other photograph, it was possible to deter- mine only the configuration of a lower glyph and the coeffi- cient to another. 30</page><page sequence="48">Fig. 2.2 The central valleys of Oaxaca. (1901: 371-372). Part of this interpretation entailed the occurrence of positional numeration, but the work- ings of such a device were not made explicit. Leons comments can be considered the first attempt to de- termine the glyphic representation of day names in the Zapotec calendar (Fig. 2.4). A substantial contribution to the available corpus of inscriptions came at the turn of the century, when Leopoldo Batres conducted excavations at Monte Alban, a site now known to be among the largest setde- ments in southwestern Mesoamerica. After almost two and a half months of work, he found 46 carved stones. To Batres the themes of the inscriptions were "leg- ends in historical passages" or "historically religious reliefs" (1902: 15). He argued that the Zapotec and other Mesoamerican scripts were characterized by the combination of symbolic, ideographic, and phonetic signs (ibid.: 36). He deduced, based on a unilineal evo- lutionary premise, that the script could not be alpha- betical, yet he was the first to consider the possibility that the glyphs nevertheless reflected some aspects of the ancient language. Other than these general remarks, 3i</page><page sequence="49">Fig. 2.3 Lintel from tomb 3 in mound 9 at Xoxocotlan (XOX-2) with comments by Leon (1901). Fig. 2.4 Zapotec glyphic day list as deduced from Leon (1901). there was no attempt to interpret the epigraphy be- cause "the true meaning of the symbols was lost" (ibid.). His analysis was limited to the isolation of most of the glyphs, which were then briefly compared with those from other parts of Mesoamerica, including glyphs from Xochicalco,Teotenango, and the Maya region as well as from Mexican codices. Such comparisons en- abled him to ascertain that Zapotec writing was dis- tinct from the Mixtec and Aztec scripts (ibid.: 37). Also in 1902, Nicolas Leon compiled a corpus of 19 inscribed stones - rendered in his own drawings - to argue for the existence of a unique kind of hiero- glyphic writing attributable to the ancient inhabitants of Oaxaca (Leon 1905b). Among these materials were not only a number of already known inscriptions pub- lished or excavated by Dupaix, Saville, and Batres but also newly discovered examples of inscriptions in pri- vate collections and in the museum in Oaxaca City. Leons conclusion was that the writing system had originated somewhere in the Mixtec region and that the system was, following his own previous arguments (Leon 1896, 1901), characteristically mixed, combin- ing Maya and Nahua conventions. In 1904 Seler published 17 inscribed objects, some of which were new additions to the corpus.The draw- ings were accompanied by brief interpretations that relied on Nahua mythology and language. Such a method was understandable not only because of the paucity of epigraphic data but also because of the rich body of ethnohistoric information on the later peoples of the central highlands. Among the few comments, one became of great significance for subsequent stud- 32</page><page sequence="50">Fig. 2.5 Zapotec glyphic day list as deduced from Seler (1904a, 1904c). ies.What in the minds of the nineteenth-century schol- ars, including at first Seler himself, had been inter- preted as a glyph denoting the "binding of the years" (end of a 52-year cycle) was now identified as a bar with the numerical value of five units (Seler 1904a: 337). The conventions of the ancient numeration sys- tem so pervasive in the Zapotec inscriptions were therefore clarified, one in which dots stand for a unit and bars stand for five units. Seler s interpretation of some of the glyphs accompanied by coefficients rep- resents a second attempt, albeit limited, of determin- ing the glyphic list of the days in the Zapotec calen- dar (Fig. 2.5). Seler (1904b) also published an essay on the an- cient Mesoamerican calendar. Although this paper did not deal with Oaxacan hieroglyphic inscriptions, it played an important role in subsequent studies. Seler discussed some issues concerning the structural prop- erties of the Aztec and Maya calendars. The work con- tains a linguistic interpretation and translation of the day names in the Zapotec calendar recorded by the friar Juan de Cordova in the sixteenth-century gram- mar called Arte del idioma gapoteco (Cordova [1578] 1886). The results of the linguistic analysis were used to reconcile a number of apparent discrepancies be- tween the Maya and Aztec calendars regarding the sig- nification and glyphic representation of day names.The linking role that the meaning of the Zapotec names played in solving, according to Seler, major differences between the Maya and Mexican day lists, and the pe- culiar inflections in the Zapotec words, led him to conclude that the Zapotec calendar represents per- haps "one of the most primitive forms of [the Mesoamerican] chronological system," and that it was in the Zapotec region where the Mesoamerican cal- endar had its origin (Seler 1904b: 25, 55). By the turn of the century, the Oaxacan historian Manuel Martinez Gracida completed a five-volume work that contains, mainly in the second book, the largest corpus of inscribed examples that had been compiled until then (Martinez Gracida n.d.).The cata- logue, however, was not comprehensive because it did not include all the epigraphic material known at the time. Yet, geographically it covers not only the central valleys but other regions of Oaxaca as well. In addi- tion to documenting the examples by means of draw- ings (using the services of several professional illustra- tors) Martinez Gracida also wrote commentaries, in some instances quite detailed. As was the inevitable approach of his time, he interpreted the inscriptions 33</page><page sequence="51">en" i n H. &lt;N Â¥ o 2 O 8 2 Â£ a | o o â¢fl 'I s N (N CD a o -*-&gt; c/s -3 3 N j s c/o VO CN Uu 34 5 .â Â§ Â¥) S*!c S Â«Â« -s â¢ S ^ Â° J2 - Â« c uS5 - S&amp; S Â« SIS *2Â±: C Â»H Â« -h ST Â« Q-tJ C Â»H ,-| -H -nÂ« S 3 2 2 0*0 i^f CO -nÂ« S V *e* 3 2 O 2 is &lt;0 0*0 u CO V O &lt;0 u Â§â¢82 CO V S5- O "* &lt;0 u â¢si ?Â«5 5. **9S kw,Ss. â¦'J ocS Si"-?

His major emphasis, although inconsistent, was to identify the discreetness of the glyphs and assign them some specific meaning, as if the script were based entirely on semantic signs. Because Martinez Gracida knew about the mortuary proveniences of several carved stones, he interpreted some of the inscriptions in pseudohistorical terms (Fig. 2.6). Regrettably, his catalogue remained unpublished and in private hands, so it was unavailable to all subsequent scholars. The corpus that was known by then grew in the course of three publications by Constantine Rickards, British consul, dilettante archaeologist, and collector of Oaxaca antiquities. His works of 1910, 1918, and 1922 were also important because inscriptions were consistently presented for the first time by means of photographs. According to Rickards, the carved stones had representational and symbolic elements that were intended to express the thoughts, ideas, history, and cults of the ancient inhabitants of Oaxaca. He recog- nized that interpretation of the hieroglyphs was not possible at the time and proposed that only descriptive accounts would avoid "falling in errors or fruitless con- jectures without solid bases which, rather than being scientific, could only end up being works of imagina- tion" (Rickards 1918: 18). Nevertheless, the comments accompanying his photographic catalogues hint at the notions that Rickards had about the content of the inscriptions. On a number of occasions he refers to "calendrical dates," "astronomical hieroglyphs," "dei- ties," "priests," and "temples" (ibid.: 19; 1922: 50). In his works, Rickards proposed repeatedly the similarity of the hieroglyphs in the Oaxaca stones to those from the Maya area. Because he also was aware of the mor- tuary provenience of several inscriptions, he argued that the general content of Zapotec writing dealt with events of local history (Rickards 1922: 49). In summary, by the early part of this century opin- ions about the nature of the Zapotec script were di- vided. Whereas its distinctiveness from other systems was recognized by some scholars (Dupaix, Saville,Batres, and Seler), others, on the basis of apparent similari- ties - particularly with Aztec and Maya writings - viewed it as nothing but a mixture of those scripts (Leon and, to a lesser degree, Rickards). With regard to the content of the inscriptions, Batres, Seler, Martinez Gracida, and Rickards concurred that they dealt with religion and mythology, although the latter two granted them a historical dimension as well. An Interpretive Milestone: Alfonso Caso (1928 and 1947) The first systematic study of Zapotec hieroglyphs came in 1928 with the pioneering work of Alfonso Caso. The specific ethnic attribution of the script was based on the recognized affinity between hieroglyphs in stone and those in ceramic effigy vessels. The latter have a geographic distribution within the regions cur- rently occupied by Zapotec speakers. It was also sup- ported by the conspicuous differences between this hieroglyphic system and the one in the codices attrib- uted to the Mixtec region of eastern Oaxaca. Using a corpus of 42 carved stones and a dozen ceramic ob- jects with incised or molded glyphs, which did not constitute all the epigraphic material known at the time, Caso established a classification of two groups: glyphs accompanied by numerals and those without them. The coefficients in the first group were invari- ably represented with bars and dots. Because similar numerical notations form an integral part of known Mesoamerican calendrical systems (Maya and Aztec), Caso deduced that the glyphs in the first group had to do with computation of time. This deduction led him to look for elements and patterns of those known calendars. Because none of the coefficients in Caso s corpus exceeded a value of 13, he assumed that the glyphs accompanied by numbers represented day names. The first step was to reconstruct the 20-day list of the cal- endar. Nevertheless, he encountered two difficulties. First, instead of 20 groups, his pictographic identifi- cations resulted in 26 categories. The type glyphs were designated with the letters A to Z (without using the Spanish letters CH, LL, and N).To account for the 6 additional groups, he suggested that some days could have been represented by variant glyphs. The second difficulty was that only 6 of the 26 type glyphs could be linked to their position in the day list (Figs. 2.7 and 2.8). The correlation problem was approached from two directions. Because the vocabulary of Friar Juan de Cordova was in the hands of Seler, Caso had to use 35</page><page sequence="53">the published linguistic interpretation of the Zapotec day names instead of relying on the primary source. The few resulting correspondences between Seler's translations and the pictography of the calendrical glyphs led him to a second strategy. According to Cordova, individuals were named, although not ex- clusively, by the name of the day on which they were born.2 Caso tried to determine the meaning of the day names from the lists of Zapotec deities and rulers recorded by missionaries (Cordova [1578] 1886; Balsalobre [1656] 1892) and from the sixteenth-cen- tury Relaciones geogrdficas (censuses ordered by King Phillip II of Spain). However, none of the names of deities and only a few of the names of rulers appeared to be calendrical, and those that were matched Cordova's day names. Consequently, the correlation problem was not solved. Caso also noted 20 instances of a sign that appeared consistently associated with glyphs E, G, M, and N (Fig. 2.9). He considered that such a sign represented Cociyo, the Zapotec god of lightning and rain.3 Its association with calendrical glyphs led him to believe that it functioned as a specific period marker. The observations that it occurred accompanied by only four glyphs with coefficients and that the value of those coefficients ranged exclusively from 1 to 13 were the main arguments to propose that the sign could stand only for the vague solar year, that is, the cycle of 365 days. Given the properties of the Mesoamerican cal- endar, he elegantly eliminated other possibilities (Caso 1928: 48-49): 1. The sign in question cannot stand for a complete sacred calendar (260 days). Other- wise the accompanying glyph, as well as the associated coefficient, would have to be al- ways the same. 2. The sign cannot stand for any of the sub- divisions of the sacred calendar (65, 52, 13 days). Otherwise the accompanying glyph, but not the associated coefficient, would always differ. 3. From these, it follows that the sign can- not represent multiples of the sacred calen- dar, like the Calendar Round of 52 solar years (which is equal to 73 sacred calendars). 4. The sign cannot stand for the month of 29 days. Otherwise it would appear accom- panied by all the day glyphs. 5. The sign cannot stand for the month of 30 days. Otherwise it would appear accom- panied by only 2 day glyphs that are 10 posi- tions apart in the list - for example, numbers 1 and 11 or 2 and 12. 6. The sign cannot stand for the Venus year (584 days). Otherwise it would appear accom- panied by five and not four different day glyphs. Then Caso proposed an iconographic developmental scheme in which the Zapotec year glyph represents the ancestral form of the year glyphs in the Xochicalco, Mixtec, and Mexican calendars (Fig. 2.10). Concomitant with the interpretation of the year glyph, the accompanying signs E, G, M, and N were seen as the year bearers, that is, those signs that name the years. However, because of the correlation prob- lem, three of them could not be related to their posi- tion in the day list. The only one that could be placed was glyph G. Because this glyph is equivalent in mean- ing and pictographic representation to the 7th day in 2 In connection to the naming practices, Cordova states about the sacred calendar, "These days and their name were used for many matters concerning the life of the people. First, they were employed in births because, since the day had a name, such appellative was used to designate the newly born child" ([1578a] 1886: 202). 3 The name of the Rain God was recorded by Cordova as Cocijo ([1578b] 1987: 141). Throughout this study, however (and unless they are direct quotations), the Zapotec words with "j" are spelled with "y" because it has been established that in Cordova's orthography the letters y, j, i, and ii were used to represent the phoneme /y/ (Reeck 1982:370-371). The change, therefore, avoids incorporation of the "j" sound in Spanish and reflects more closely the way certain words were pronounced in the 16th century. 36</page><page sequence="54">Fig. 2.7 Zapotec glyphic day list as deduced from Caso (1928). 37 Zapotec na*e Nahuatl according to Iconographic Day no. naÂ«e Seler Glyph* interpretation (1904b) I Cipactli Chill a, Chijlla Â© Ehecatl Qui j , Laa 3 Calli Guela J Monstrous head 4 Cuetzpallin Gueche 5 Coatl Zee.

In these other systems, the year bearers corresponded to the 3rd, 8th, 13th, and 18th positions in the day list. To support his case, Caso brought forward evidence from two codices, Tututepetongo (formerly Porfirio Diaz) andTepeucila (formerly Fernandez Leal), whose provenience at the time was presumed to be the 38 Alphabetical Iconographic Glyph designation* interpretation ^5^ A (6) Knot C (6) Snout of a tiger 0 (19) Vessel with Mater or flower (1Â§) E (24) Turquoise (the sun conceived as a precious stone) F (0) Bird (Owl?.

Cuicatec region in the northwestern portion of the present-day state of Oaxaca.4 These documents, al- though painted in a Mixtec-Mexican style, have sets of year bearers that correspond to the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions. Caso further commented that two more codices of unknown provenience, Dehesa and Humboldt, as well as the epigraphy in a monolith from Teotenango (inToluca),and an inscription from Copan (in Honduras), appear to be framed in a calendrical system whose year bearers also corresponded to the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions.5 In addition, using data from several Mesoamerican calendars, Caso ar- gued for changes through time in the position of the year bearers (Table 2.1). Then three hypotheses were advanced. One was that at the time the sacred calendar was invented, its beginning probably coincided with that of the solar year, the latter having then a set of year bearers corre- sponding to the 1st, 6th, 11th, and 16th positions.6 Given the proposed set of Zapotec year bearers and the available archaeological evidence, the second hy- pothesis stated that the sacred or divinatory count origi- nated in the Oaxaca region, a proposition already ad- vanced by Seler (1904b) but on the basis of another argument. The third hypothesis was an attempt to ex- plain the shifts in the positions of the year bearers. Caso proposed that these changes could be related to corrections to the vague year (365 days) to compen- sate for the cumulative error in relation to the tropical year (365.242264 days). The epigraphic implication of Caso's arguments was that, even though the spe- cific placement of glyphs E, M, and N in the Zapotec day list could not be determined, these signs had to occupy the 2nd, 12th, and 17th positions. Caso proposed that the glyphs without numerals were either ideograms or phonograms. The proposi- tion of phoneticism appears to have been based ex- clusively on the morphology of some of the glyphs. Caso noticed that sometimes the glyphs form com- plex compounds. By stating explicitly that perhaps rebus writing was involved, Caso apparently viewed the script as being language specific (1928: 68). The most conspicuous noncalendrical signs were briefly commented upon and arbitrarily designated by their obvious or presumed representation. One of these was the "Jaws of the Sky"glyph (Fig. 2.1 la). This sign pre- viously had been designated "Sacred Nose" by Batres, "Gate to Eternity" by Martinez Gracida, and "Ser- pent" by Rickards. Caso, however, interpreted it as the representation of a feline. He noted that this imagery could be depicted in elaborate or simplified forms, the latter being the nose of a jaguar. The representa- 4 Since Caso's study, the Cuicatec origin of Codices Tututepetongo and Tepeucila has been conclusively demon- strated (Hunt 1978; Van Doesburg n.d.). 5 In a later work, Caso grouped Codex Dehesa as Cuicatec and Codex Humboldt as Tlapanec (Caso 1979: 9). The rela- tionship of Codex Humboldt to the Azoyu codices and their Tlapanec affiliation has been amply confirmed (Vega Sosa 1991, 1992), and Codex Dehesa appears to have strong connections with Coixdahuaca (Urcid n.d.f ). 6 So far there are a few known archaeological examples of types I and V year bearers, all from Maya inscriptions in the cave of Naj Tunich (Stone 1995: 158-162). 39</page><page sequence="57">Fig 2.10 Developmental scheme of the year glyph in highland Mesoamerica as deduced from Caso (1928: 50-51).

This idea was also contingent on interpreting occasionally asso- ciated scrolls as representations of clouds. Casos discussion of noncalendrical signs contin- ued with the "Bag" glyph (Fig. 2.11b). He considered that, specifically, the sign could represent an incense 41 a 111 Â® 6" H b c Â® ^ ^ d a. The "Jaws of the Sky" glyph b. The "Bag" glyph c. The "Hill" glyph d.

The available examples appeared in columnar texts, always following what he had inter- preted as day glyphs and occupying the last position in the inscriptions. The epigraphic context of the sign and its pictographic transparency led to the conclu- sion that the glyph meant "end" of the text or of the message. With regard to the "Hill" glyph (Fig. 2.1 lc), a sign already interpreted by Batres as a toponymic in- dicator, Caso concurred with such a view because of the glyph's general resemblance to the conventional representation of hills, which figure prominently in the place names of Mexican and Mixtec codices. An- other conspicuous noncalendrical sign that was dis- cussed is the "Fish" or "Turde" glyph (Fig. 2. 1 Id). Caso pointed out the resemblance of this sign to represen- tations of turtles in the Codex Borgia and theTizatlan murals in Tlaxcala. The glyph was noted to occur be- tween year and day glyphs and, consequently, was in- terpreted as the name of a "month." This interpreta- tion had two important implications: (1) that even glyphs that are not accompanied by numerals could have chronological significance, and (2) the existence of a glyphic standard sequence that begins with the year, follows with the month, then the day, and closes with an ending statement. Given such a sequence, Caso proposed the tentative identification of 15 "month" glyphs (Fig. 2.12). The presence of signs that represent hands and feet was also noted by Caso and, except for an instance in which an open hand was thought to represent a coef- ficient with a value of 5 units, no further comments were made on these glyphs. Elaborately dressed indi- viduals were interpreted as deities or their imperson- ators, and those with simple'garments as mortals. Based on Cordova's information about people's appellatives, and on Aztec sources where gods are named accord- ing to the day on which they were born or the day over which they presided, several instances of glyphs with numerals were interpreted by Caso as calendrical names of deities and humans. These interpretations had important implications because they recognized that not all the glyphs accompanied by numerals nec- essarily have chronological significance. In synthesis, Caso's work proposed that the Zapotec script was to some degree phonetic and that the con- tent of inscriptions was preeminently of historical character. Specific events, in which deities or humans were the protagonists, were recorded within the gen- eral frame of the Mesoamerican calendar. However, because of the correlation problem, particularly that 42</page><page sequence="60">of the year bearers, it was not possible to elucidate the dates on the inscriptions in terms of the actual native computation of time. In one sense, the con- tent was earthly, narrating dates, lives of individu- als, and places of conquests; in another it was mytho- logical, describing supernaturals and the dates when rituals were performed. At the end of his work, Caso presented a compara- tive summary of several Mesoamerican calendrical and writing systems. General linguistic similarities were also noted among the Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec languages, including, for example, the existence of cognates for month (homonym for moon) and for day (homonym for sun). Regarding the calendrics, however, the Maya and Zapotec calendars counted in terms of elapsed time, whereas the Aztec system counted in terms of elapsing time. Relationships were also noted between the writing conventions in the Zapotec inscriptions and those from Teotenango and Xochicalco, although the latter were seen as closer to the Aztec system. Such comparisons of the Maya, Zapotec, Xochicalco- Teotenango, Teotihuacan-Chalco, Mixtec, Borgia group of manuscripts and related materials, and the Mexican system could be done only in very general terms because, by that time, chronological scales in all the key regions were nonexistent. Alfonso Caso s second major contribution to the study of Zapotec writing came in 1947. In contrast to his work of 1928, the several seasons of archaeologi- cal investigations at Monte Alban- begun since 1932- allowed him to establish a relative chronology and to correlate epigraphic data to specific epochs. Caso fo- cused exclusively on the inscriptions of the earliest two periods and was able to distinguish them and treat them separately. Of the period I corpus that was known from the site (145 stones), Caso published only 25 examples, mainly the drawings made by the Monte Alban project artist Agustin Villagra. The catalogue included all the examples that had recognizable epig- raphy. It consisted of 20 stones carved with Danzantes and five stelae, three of them broken and incomplete. Both types of carvings were treated as a single group because they shared similar glyphs. Although no abso- lute dates were available, the analysis of pottery asso- ciated with the inscribed stones and comparison with several early Mesoamerican ceramic assemblages were used to support a period I dating. Such a chronologi- cal placement led again to a brief discussion of the antiquity of the sacred calendar in Oaxaca. Caso also distinguished two systems of numeration in these early inscriptions: (1) bars and dots, whose use continued in later periods, and (2) fingers used to denote single units. This other system appeared to be confined to Monte Alban I and II and the available recorded val- ues were not greater than two (Fig. 2.13a). Caso identified three new instances of the year glyph, being accompanied twice by the year bearer E and once by M (Fig. 2. 13b). Using the criteria of glyphs accompanied by numbers 1 to 13, he determined the presence of day glyphs B, E, M, O, and P. With regard to glyph M, what in 1928 was considered a variant (a representation of one or more undulating lines), in 1947 became a different and distinct glyph. However, because of the limitations of the alphabetical classifi- cation, the new glyph had to be designated M'(Fig. 2.13c). On the other hand, the new examples of glyph P led Caso to propose that the pictograph was not simply a human head, as he had suggested in 1928, but the specific representation of Xipe Totec (deity im- personator wearing as mask the skin from a sacrificial victim). Caso noted three more instances of glyph W, which in 1928 had been classified as a day glyph (Fig. 2.13d). However, two of the new examples unmistak- ably appear accompanied by coefficients greater than 13 (14 and 18). Because the available values did not exceed 20, Caso reinterpreted the glyph as a "month" sign, with the implication that in Monte Alban I, the Zapotec inscriptions anchored days not only in the year but also in the month, as in the Maya Calendar Round system. The reinterpretation of glyph W does not appear to have affected the previous view about possible "month" glyphs. Those tentatively identified in 1928 would have omitted the coefficient that speci- fied the position of the day in them. Caso proposed that some glyphs unaccompanied by numerals never- theless did function as day signs. This apparently was based on their pictographic similarity to glyphs from the period II corpus that do occur with coefficients 1 to 13 (Fig. 2.13e). Caso considered again that noncalendrical glyphs either were ideographs or had a phonetic value. Their presumed relationship to an ancient language led him to consider them only in a descriptive manner. He identified nine categories and designated them in terms 43</page><page sequence="61">Fig. 2.13 Calendrical glyphs from Monte Alban I (Caso 1947). of the shape of the glyphs (Fig. 2.14). The categories included: (a) human heads, among which was a pos- sible representation of Quetzalcoad; (b) hands in dif- ferent postures, which were considered possible verbs; (c) animal heads of jaguars, toads, birds, and serpents; (d) early versions of the "Bag" glyph; (e) the "Tied Bundle"; (f ) the "Boot"; (g) the "Spear-thrower," which, according to Caso, was one of the most reli- able pictographic identifications because of its simi- larity to the representation of the atlatl in the Maya glyphic system; (h) the "Hill" glyph; and (i) a group of miscellaneous glyphs whose scarcity did not allow comparative considerations. Some of them appeared pictographic, resembling an axe, a house, or a vessel. For analysis of the inscriptions from period Monte Alban II, Caso used a corpus of 56 stones, although only 17 were fully published, including six Danzantes attributed to this period. Because the latter had few glyphs, the emphasis of the study was on the epigra- phy of the slabs from Building J. Although the ar- rangement of the inscriptions in these monoliths pre- sents several variations, Caso noted a generalized for- mat (Fig. 2.15). After a detailed analysis of the com- ponent elements in all the carvings, Caso hypothesized that the core content of the texts was the naming of towns that had been conquered by Monte Alban. Such an idea rests on the following observations: 1. The way the eye is carved in some in- verted heads suggests representation of dead personages. The types of elaborate head- gear - which can be used to form groups of heads - seem to have special significance, per- haps attributes of tutelar deities. These heads might represent dead rulers.

Because the "Hill" glyph is the least vari- able sign, it must have the generic meaning of "place" or "town." 3. The single or compounded signs on top of the "Hill" glyph would specify the name of the place. Their morphology and combi- nations, specifically in the case of the com- pounded glyphs, suggests the representation of toponyms by means of a phonetic system similar to that used by the Aztecs, who made use of phonetic indicators and, to a lesser de- gree, of the homophonic principle. (At least 39 presumed place names could be docu- mented.) 4. The accompanying texts cite, among other things, the date of the conquering event. Such dates are given in terms of year, month, and day of occurrence. (Caso appeared to imply here that, although the position of the day within the month is given by the accom- panying coefficient, the position of the month within the solar cycle is not specified.) 45 &gt; tÂ»&gt; % $ ^ â¢ ~&lt;2ZD ^23 S _ * $ -Â§ T? f a rll _ T? 9 &lt;Â£Â£=&gt; DÂ® U i Â» Â®i a.

Analysis of the individual glyphs in the associated texts led to identification of seven more instances of the year glyph, three of them accompanied by the bearer E and two by the bearer M. The year bearers associated to the other two annual signs were not dis- cernible because of the eroded condition of the carv- ings (Fig. 2.16a). Caso also identified nine more in- stances of glyph W. In only one case was the coeffi- cient greater than 13 (coefficient 15). Three other examples appeared inverted and without numerals. Caso maintained that there was a calendrical glyph of the O category (the representation of a monkey) that was accompanied by the coefficient 18, and he inter- preted it as another month sign. On the basis of a Maya analogy, he hypothesized that the inverted ex- amples of glyph W could be puns for completion, that is, possibly giving the first position of a day within the given month (e.g., day 0-the first-in the month W) (Fig. 2.16b). Other results included conclusive identification of day glyphs A, B, D, E, F, J, O, P, and Z and the possible occurrence of glyphs K and N.The use of glyph M as a day sign during epoch II could be deduced only from its function as year bearer. On the other hand, Caso identified five more glyphs that could not be grouped in the already existing categories. He therefore intro- duced another classificatory scheme based on roman numerals. The new signs were designated as glyphs IV, VI, VII, VIII, and IX (Fig. 2. 1 6c) . Several noncalendrical glyphs were recognized by Caso, and these were de- scribed on the basis of their forms (Fig. 2.17). In summary then, Caso reiterated the most likely 4 6 Glyph on top of the "hill" sign ' a.t. - , ^ f- ,,ar Human head "Hill" glyph upside down Day date o o ^ MA- J- 10 I I 0 30 cm</page><page sequence="64">Fig. 2.16 Calendrical glyphs from Monte Alban II (Caso 1947). occurrence of phoneticism in the script, a judgment based on the way glyphs are combined to form com- pounds. With regard to the calendrics, the new epi- graphic data did not contradict his previous identifi- cation of the year glyph. Yet, although more examples of the calendrical categories defined since 1928 be- came available, and new type glyphs accompanied by coefficients were added, the problem of correlating the bearers E-M-N as well as other glyphs to the day list remained unsolved. Because Caso was able to distinguish the inscrip- tions of Monte Alban I from those of Monte Alban II, one of the most important conclusions was the obvi- ous continuity in the script, perhaps not so much in the format of the texts but in terms of the types of glyphs and the iconographic conventions used to rep- resent them. Caso argued that an assessment of plau- sible discontinuities was impossible. Given the paucity of epigraphic materials, the lack of certain glyphs did not necessarily imply changes in the writing system. It could be simply the result of unattested evidence. Subsequent Epigraphic Studies Between the two major contributions of Caso an- other linguistic study of the sixteenth-century sacred calendar recorded by Cordova appeared. The author, Wilfrido Cruz, was a native Zapotec speaker from Tehuantepec (Cruz 1935). His goals were (1) to dem- onstrate that the Spanish-Zapotec vocabulary published by the Junta Colombina (1893) was of the same dia- lect as Cordova s Vocabulario ; (2) to assess the accuracy of Seler s translations; and (3) to propose, given his insights as a native speaker, a wider range of possible meanings for the day names. He found that the two vocabularies were of the same dialect from the central valleys of Oaxaca. The resemblances were not only lexical but also in terms of format, meaning that the Junta Colombina vocabu- lary was a later copy, with slight linguistic modifica- tions, of Cordova s (Cruz 1935: 44). Cruz argued, how- ever, that the dialects from the central valleys spoken in the 1930s bore no close phonetic resemblance to 47 lh') (H) Â£3 1 11 - ^ ooo B IV &lt;3&gt; Arrowhead &lt;S==S ' - 00 B (Gj) vi en ? jp (Â©) cpil FS cCh Â® m &lt;l&gt; 7 " H aÂ® Si vm &lt;u ? ^ IX ( 1 ) Resembles an object W ^Â§1 Â® with flames o o o EE3 C a b a.

New categories of day glyphs</page><page sequence="65">Fig. 2.17 Noncalendrical glyphs from Monte Alban II (Caso 1947). the one contained in both vocabularies (ibid.: 42). However, Cruz failed to realize that the orthography of the vocabularies is not a faithful reflection of the phonology of the language. Also, because he was not a trained linguist, his assertion is impressionistic. Accord- ing to recent glottochronological estimations, there is minimum divergence (lexical and phonological) be- tween Cordova's Vocabulario and several contemporary variants of the language, particularly those spoken in Teotitlan del Valle, Santa Cruz Papalutla,Tlacochahuaya, andTlalixtac de Cabrera (Rendon 1969). With regard to the second objective, Cruz concurred with most of Seler's translations, having only a few points of contention. Of the 20 day names translated by Seler, Cruz disagreed on six but was able to pro- pose alternative translations for only three. Despite the advantage of being a native speaker, Cruz lacked an understanding of the structural properties of the Mesoamerican calendar. At one point he tried to es- tablish a correspondence between the four divisions of the Zapotec sacred calendar (65 x4 = 260) and the four bearers of the Nahuatl solar calendar (4 x 13 = 52) (Cruz 1935: 31-37). In addition, Cruz had no ac- cess to crucial ethnohistoric sources. In his conclu- sions, he repeatedly claimed as absurd Cordova's state- ment that the painted book from which he took the information of the sacred calendar had the day signs distributed in and around the figure of a deer, a scene that occurs in several surviving codices (see Fig. 3.3). The major pitfall of the linguistic analysis by Cruz was his misunderstanding of the role played by pre- fixes attached to the day names recorded by Cordova. Seler was baffled by these, and noting that they were related to the cardinal numbers (1 to 13) and that they repeat themselves in series of 13, he set them aside. Cruz, on the other hand, incorporated them in his detailed translations. The result was a myriad of pos- sible meanings - some of them seemingly absurd - which in turn rendered unmanageable the problem of understanding the meaning of Zapotec day names. Cruz also held some opinions about the nature of the hieroglyphic script. He believed that it was "allegoric, ideographic, and phonetic, quite clearly on the way of becoming mature [i.e., alphabetic]" (ibid.: 68). Given the characteristics of the Zapotec language, he realized the homophonic principle could have played a key role in the script. Cruz also recognized that a number of problems regarding the Zapotec cal- endar could be solved only through archaeological studies. In the 1950s Mario Macias Villada, an engineer in- terested in calendrical systems, wrote at least three pa- pers dealing with the Zapotec calendar (1957, n.d.a, n.d.b). On the basis of several published sources, he sought to elucidate the configuration of the solar count. The first task was reconstruction of the glyphic day list. He used Seler's translations (copied from Caso 1928), probably Cordova's Arte, and the linguistic study of Cordova's calendar by Cruz (1935) as well as his own versions of the glyphic reproductions that were available in several of Caso's publications. In Macias s works, the glyphic day list was consecutively modi- fied (Fig. 2.18). Although there is no explanation for the changes, they appear to reflect the procedure fol- lowed by the author, that is, trying to match the pre- sumed representation of the glyphs with the multiple meanings of the day names proposed by Cruz. The fact that his drawings are not accurate reproductions of the published materials also appears to have played a role in the uncertainties. Following Reko (1945: 143), Macias took 18 signs in the cartographic portion from copy A of the Lienzo de Guevea - a document from a town in Tehuantepec 48</page><page sequence="66">whose earliest known version was painted in 1540 - as the glyphic representation of the Zapotec months.7 Then the author adopted Caso s identification of the year glyph and the year bearers. Curiously, however and without empirical basis, Macias eliminated glyph N as annual marker and replaced it with glyph J. There- fore, according to him, the Zapotec bearers were J (Flower), M (Serpent), G (Rabbit), and E (Turquoise). From the correspondences that he established between the bearers and certain Zapotec day names, it is clear that, like Cruz, Macias confused the quadripartite di- vision of the sacred calendar with the four bearers of the solar count. Nevertheless, with these sets of inter- pretations Macias generated two complete solar cal- endars and established their equivalence to the Gregorian system. Macias s correlation between the native and Chris- tian calendars was based on several assumptions. The first was that the sequence of the year bearers in the native computation of time went from J to E to M to G. (This, however, contradicts the positions that he assigned them in the day list, where the sequence goes from J to M to G to E.) A second assumption was that the year 4 Flower (4J) was equivalent to the year 1522. Therefore, given the sequence of bearers above, the year 1 Turquoise (IE) was equivalent to 1519. How- ever, the evidence for these equivalences was not given. Macias also considered two versions for the beginning of the Zapotec year: March 26 and January 18 (the former datum is erroneously attributed to Cordova; the origin of the second was not specified). A third assumption was that the native solar count began with the first day of the list and the coefficient 1 . To make the calendars understandable to himself and to the readers, Macias presented them in a western format. Figure 2.19 includes only an excerpt of the two solar cycles that he reconstructed. The upper charts refer to the year 1 Turquoise, illustrating on the left side the 20 days of the 5th month. To the right appear the 5 "un- lucky days" that followed the 18th month. The lower charts refer to the year 4 Flower, showing on the left side the 20 days of the 5th month and to the right the corresponding 5 "unlucky days." As can be inferred from a few comments in his works, Macias also con- sidered that the content of Zapotec inscriptions was historical (Fig. 2.20). In 1958, Howard Leigh, artist and collector of Oaxacan antiquities, published two articles on Zapotec epigraphy and iconography. Leigh (1958a) adopted the framework being used at the time by Eric Thompson for the study of Maya hieroglyphic writing. He ig- nored Caso s identification of the year glyph and the year bearers, explicitly rejecting the idea that Zapotec inscriptions recorded historical matters. In his view, the inscriptions dealt with astronomical notations and with time reckoning. Thus, the epigraphic texts con- tained calculations like those of the Maya Long Count, which in turn provided the means for the precise calendrical dating of stone monuments. Given this reasoning, Leigh had to adopt the Goodman-Martinez- Thompson correlation and the resulting Maya start- ing point for their Long Count: 3113 B.C.8 Then, by a series of "guesses," he assigned fixed numerical values to several glyphs (Fig. 2.21). With this interpretive model, Leigh proposed the calendrical dating of several inscriptions, including in some instances the presumed correlation with the Gregorian calendar. However, the procedures to de- rive the dates and the correlations were never made explicit. His results cannot be replicated with the pre- mises that he himself established (Table 2. 2). 9 Leigh believed that those inscriptions that dealt with astro- 7 Reko, in turn, had apparently misinterpreted Seler, who sug- gested that the glyphs in the upper portion of the Lienzo de Guevea could represent the places where sacrifices were held during monthly festivities (Seler 1906). The map in the Lienzo actually depicts 20 geographic locations: 6 rivers and bodies of water, and 14 hills. Of these, 18 correspond to the landmarks setting the boundaries of Santiago Guevea. 8 It is now generally considered that the starting base date for the Maya Long Count is 3114 B.C., a retroactive date that was probably devised around the time of Christ (Houston 1989: 49). 9 Some additions in Figure 2.21 and in Table 2.2 come from a photograph by Paddock of the blackboard notes used by Leigh for a lecture presented at the Centro de Estudios Regionales, Oaxaca, Mexico, in 1958. Leigh adopted the glyphs for num- bers 1, 500, and 8,000 from a predictive analysis of Cruz (1935: 106-107) on how the Zapotecs would have represented some coefficients given certain homophonies in the language. 49</page><page sequence="67">Fig. 2.18 Two glyphic day lists according to Macias (n.d.a [1951], n.d.b [1956]) indicating changes in sign correlations. 50 List of 1951 List of 1956 Caso's Zapotec Meaning in Glyphs designations Zapotec Meaning In Caso's Day no, nana Spanish na-w Spanish Glyph designation ' KiSsr ' * - ' flor del pochote. r - r s' *C 2 Laa Guaje. luz, , - .

Figure 2.22 illustrates a specific example of Leighs astronomical interpretations. Leigh 1958b focused on determining the glyphic day list, a problem loosely dealt with by Leon (1901) and Seler (1904a) and that, although systematically treated by Caso (1928), could not be entirely solved. Apparendy unaware of the attempts by Macias, Leigh did not acknowledge his reconstructions. To identify linguistically and pictographically Zapotec day names, Leigh used the Mexican calendar as a guideline. De- spite his competence in the Zapotec language (Mitla dialect), he did not use direcdy Cordovas list of day names. Rather, he resorted to the convoluted approach of using the Spanish/English meaning of the names in the Nahuatl language to find corresponding mean- ings in the series of 260 days recorded by the friar. As a result, the equivalents to the 4th and 11th days (Cuetzpallin [Lizard], and Ozomatli [Monkey]) ended up without Zapotec names! The linking of the glyphs in the day list was also based on the pictographic similarities between Oaxaca and Nahuad signs (Fig. 2.23). To reconstruct the list, Leigh not only used glyphic materials from several in- scriptions at Monte Alban but complemented these with examples from San Juan Sola and from carved stones and ceramic objects held in the national, the Oaxaca, and the Mitla museums. He disregarded chro- nological differences in the data, but it can be deduced that of the 35 glyphs that were assembled, 2 belong to the corpus of period I, 8 to inscriptions from period II, and 25 to the corpus of period III. Caso's contributions to the Handbook of Middle American Indians were his last publications on the topic (1965a, 1965b). The two articles dealing with Zapotec sculpture and writing included a partial summary of his 1928 and 1947 studies, a few new observations that reflected certain changes in his thinking, and some additions to the corpus of inscriptions. A number of important observations and interpretations made in the various reports from the Monte Alban excavations and in the study of Zapotec "urns" were, however, not incorporated. Yet, the knowledge gained from the excavations in Oaxaca allowed him to discuss the epi- graphic material in chronological order, Monte Alban I to Monte Alban IV. Reflecting changes in his views, particularly those of 1928, Caso considered that, because the earliest known calendar in Oaxaca appears fully developed, the origins of the writing system and calendrics re- mained unknown (1965b: 932). Later in the essay, how- ever, he commented that "Seler righdy said that there is reason to believe that the Mesoamerican [sacred] calendar was invented in Oaxaca" (ibid.: 945). On the basis of a radiocarbon date from the Mixteca Alta as- sociated with a ceramic assemblage similar to that of Monte Alban I, Caso was able to place in absolute terms the earliest evidence of writing and calendrics in Oaxaca. The date was 600 B.C. By then, the calendrical system already bore evidence for the sa- cred count, the solar calendar, four year bearers, and probably "months" (veintenas). However, despite an at- testable long continuity in some of the bearers, from Monte Alban I to III, Caso refrained from attributing the earliest manifestation of the script and calendar to the Zapotecs. With regard to other calendrical mat- ters, he reiterated the existence of signs for days that do not appear accompanied by coefficients (Caso 1965b: 934, fig. 5), a strange opinion considering that, by definition, day glyphs should be accompanied by numerals. In this case, Caso did not recognize that some signs have two versions: a calendrical (when accom- panied by coefficients) and a noncalendrical (when devoid of them). An important new statement that bore on the problem of placing signs in the day list was that perhaps glyph M (one of the bearers) occu- pied the second position (1965b: 933). Caso also be- gan to view the earliest inscriptions from a historical perspective. His description of the stylistic character- istics of the Danzantes, which was fundamentally the same as the one presented in 1947, included a general interpretation of the accompanying epigraphy. Accord- ing to Caso, the glyphs were the calendrical and per- sonal names of the depicted individuals. Caso's discussion of the epigraphic materials from Monte Alban II, which includes complex combina- tions of glyphs to form compounds and where signs occur in different combinations, led him to stress again the use of a phonetic system based on the rebus prin- ciple and similar to that used by Mexicans and Mixtecs. Partly as a result of an ambitious macro-regional pro- 51</page><page sequence="69">Fig. 2.19 Excerpts of the Zapotec solar calendar according to Macias (n.d.a [1951], n.d.b [1956]). 52 ffl M Alio TlWUt^A O JAOt MlZA VdtGO OAA 1 CUIA-uUiA-CUIllO A6UA OtL 9iO DC.

Yet, nothing new could be said about pending calendrical problems. However, based on lack of evidence, Caso explicidy rejected the existence of a Long Count and position enumeration throughout the evolutionary trajectory of the Zapotec calendrical notations. As to the calendrical inscriptions from Monte Alban Ilia, Caso maintained the idea of possible month glyphs that were not accompanied by numerals. The two texts from the so-called Lapida de Bazan were thought to include some of these. The lack of coefficients implied that their sequence within a given year was not speci- fied, nor did they anchor a day as in the case of the Monte Alban II month glyphs. Two important omis- sions in his discussion of day name glyphs for this pe- riod include the former identification of a new sign, glyph N (Caso 1938: 77; Caso and Bernal 1952: 107), and the pictographic reevaluation, based on the study of ceramic effigy vessels, of glyph J as a conventional- ized representation of maize (Caso and Bernal 1952: 20, fig. 7). Here, glyph J was not interpreted as in 1928 (a monstrous head) but was viewed, as in 1938, as the representation of "flower." On the other hand, the glyph he had classified with the letter Q in 1928 was now considered to be Mixtec. Apparendy Caso took the "Cuilapan scribe" (where the glyph occurs) as a ceramic effigy belonging to Monte Alban V. Caso also asserted, despite accumulating evidence of "Mixtec" style inscriptions in the central valleys of Oaxaca dur- ing later periods, that from period Ilia until the six- teenth-century "Zapotec writing and calendar exhibit few important changes" (Caso 1965b: 941). Yet, dur- ing period Illb - the last in the apogee of Monte Alban as an urban center - Zapotec writing exhibited, ac- cording to Caso, a new trend characterized by the lack of large stelae and the use of small slabs whose in- scriptions and narrative scenes were historical. Zaachila, a settlement close to Monte Alban, was considered the center of this innovation. It follows from the previous comments that Caso's papers of 1965 dealt with substantive aspects and not with method. Consequently, he did not clarify which were the problems that remained to be solved, and this led to unfounded criticism. For instance, regard- ing the article on writing, Kubler (1972: 3) came to doubt Caso's interpretive framework instead of sim- ply noting inconsistencies and omissions. Because there are solid arguments in the works of Caso, it is impor- tant to briefly summarize his contributions. Figure 2.24 provides the list of calendrical glyphs as defined by 1967. By then, a total of 32 different categories had been created, excluding glyph W, which had been re- moved in 1947 as a special calendrical glyph (i.e., a "month" glyph). Between 1947 and 1967 practically no advance was made on the correlation problem (Fig. 2.25). Evidendy, Caso was aware of the attempts of Macias (n.d.a and n.d.b) and Leigh (1958b), but he did not mention them because, as will become more obvious in Chapter 3, they ignore structural proper- ties of the calendar. Because two of the bearers re- mained uncorrelated, it still was not possible to ac- count for some calendrical inscriptions in terms of the indigenous time reckoning. Nevertheless, Caso maintained that the vertical in- scriptions from Monte Alban followed a standard se- quence that contained much chronological informa- tion, anchoring an event by the year, month, and day of occurrence. From this sequence, it is deduced that he considered the reading order to proceed from top to bottom. Casos interpretation of glyph W implied that days were anchored to their position in a given month only during Monte Alban I and II. Because the sign apparendy fell in disuse by the end of period II, the succeeding trend was to specify the month with- out giving its position in the solar cycle, nor anchor- ing within it a specific day date. Figure 2.26 presents the revised lists of "month" glyphs as deduced from Caso's publications. It does not include the glyphs from the Lapida de Bazan because Caso never pointed out any specific sign. It also should be stressed that, in all his writings, he repeatedly emphasized the tentative- ness of the "months" interpretation. In the early 1970s, using the data published by Caso, Hans Prem (1971, 1973) presented two papers dealing with the writing system from Monte Alban. Prem's fundamental premise was that, except for Maya writ- ing, all the other scripts from Mesoamerica can be classified as being in a transitional stage between "par- 56</page><page sequence="74">Fig. 2.24 Comparison of Caso s lists of Zapotec calendrical glyphs from 1928 through 1952.

Prem (1971: 117) emphasized that the earliest evidence of writing is not necessarily equivalent to its origin. Therefore, it could not be con- cluded that the beginning of writing in Mesoamerica took place in Oaxaca. Although this criticism was ap- parendy aimed at Seler s and Caso's proposals, those authors had been referring to the origin of the sacred calendar and not of writing per se. While evaluating the evidence for the earliest peri- ods at Monte Alban, Prem kept contradicting his own views about the nature of the script, sometimes char- acterizing it as ideographic, at other times conceding that homophonic writing could be present. He re- marked that Casos assumption of phoneticism was based on an analogy with Aztec writing, one that "is by no means sufficiently substantiated" (1973: 47). Yet, he agreed that "to a limited extent, the writing was suited for the recording of verbal texts" (ibid.). Thus, the early Zapotec script was almost but still not a "true" writing system. Prem reiterated that the direction of reading for the columnar inscriptions is probably from top to bottom and that the known inventory of noncalendrical glyphs consisted of 30 signs, of which 26 were different. Because very few glyphs were re- peated in the available signary, Prem speculated that the total graphic inventory of the script could prob- ably reach at least a thousand signs. In his summary of Caso s calendrical conclusions, Prem considered uncertain whether the representa- tion of fingers should be interpreted as numbers, al- though the existence of numerals up to 18 suggested to him the presence of a vigesimal system. Like Caso, Prem also disagreed on the existence of higher num- bers like those found in the place value system of the Maya Long Count. Prem (1973: 47) judged that Caso's opinion about the early presence in Oaxaca of the sacred and solar counts was unfounded, noting that, because most of the attested coefficients range from 1 to 13, it is only a "modest internal probability that the associated signs represent days" of a calendrical system similar to the known sacred count. Although he ac- knowledged that for later periods the existence of the sacred calendar is secured, the interpretation of the year glyph and the year bearers "cannot yet be ac- cepted as unequivocally proved" (ibid.: 52). Regard- ing glyph W, Prem disagreed that it stood for a month glyph and considered that the sign more likely repre- sented count of elapsed time periods. Given the patterns of the numerals, with several that do not exceed the value of 13 and few that do not exceed the value of 18, Prem saw two possible inter- pretations for calendrical glyphs. One is that signs com- bined with coefficients express time periods. In this case, he predicted that the calendrical signary would be rather small, including 18 or 19 glyphs. The other possible interpretation is that the glyphs and their ac- companying coefficients are permutable with each other, naming together a time period. If so, the signary would comprise 38 to 39 glyphs, that is, 19 month names and 20 day names. To him the two interpreta- tions were not mutually exclusive but could exist si- multaneously. One cannot fail to see, however, that Caso's conclusions fit and supersede Prem's predic- tions. For instance, in the case of signs with coeffi- cients representing time periods, the presence of the year glyph, the year bearers, and glyph W would actu- ally make the potential total signary slightly larger - that is, 22 to 23 glyphs. In the case of permutable signs and numbers that name a period, Caso's interpreta- tion of the day glyphs includes the possibility of day signs having variants and therefore a potential list of at least 40 calendrical signs. That both of Prem's alterna- tive interpretations can occur simultaneously is, of course, what Caso's results imply. According to Prem (1971: 121-122), the relative frequency of calendrical signs in the inscriptions shows in later times a strong decrease, although this state- ment does not find support if one separates early and late calendrical glyphs from Caso's lists published in 1928. Because of changes in the inventory of signs, Prem argued for a distinct shift between the writing of early and later periods - this despite Caso's caution- ary note that apparent discontinuities could be simply the result of lack of data. To account for the presumed discontinuities, Prem (1971: 122) considered a change of population and perhaps even language. Regarding the script during later periods, Prem characterized it as hieroglyphs associated with narra- tive pictography. The signs were placed in vertical col- umns "which are frequently inexact and not specifi- cally marked" (Prem 1973: 51). Eventually, and gradu- ally, columnar inscriptions vanished, and the glyphs appeared dotted over the areas left uncovered by the scenic representations. Furthermore, "because of the 59</page><page sequence="77">Fig. 2.26 Comparison of Caso's lists of Zapotec "month" glyphs (Caso 1928, 1947). 6o Â© m Month list of Caso 1928 MA.

From these commentaries, it appears that Prem perceived a gradual disintegrating trend in the Zapotec "partial" script. Although he conceded that the script of early periods was close to "true" writing, its later development was rather a degeneration. By the "Clas- sic" period, the columnar inscriptions were inexplicit, to be replaced later by obscure epigraphic arrange- ments containing calendrical notations characterized by a "thematic depletion," all of this epitomized by the eventual "suppression of various possibilities of manifestation" (ibid.). In summary, Prem was extremely skeptical about the phonetic nature of the script. Regarding the cal- endar, he presented the same set of premises already underlying Caso's interpretations. He disagreed with Caso on certain minor points, as in the specific mean- ing of glyph W. On other points, he embraced much circumspection, as in the interpretation of the year glyph and the year bearers. Because Prem s extreme cautiousness ends up postulating the existence of an unknown calendar that could have been similar to the known sacred count, his position is not scientifi- cally parsimonious. Whereas Prem based his studies exclusively on pub- lished materials, Ignacio Bernal followed another strat- egy, one that he hoped would eventually help to clarify some of the problems with which Caso, as he himself had recognized, was able "to make but litde headway." Assisted by two artists, Bernal continued with the com- pilation of a corpus of inscriptions. In the 1970s, the author published three important catalogues of stone carvings. One of these documented several examples that were embedded in churches, public buildings, and houses in the present-day villages of Macuilxochitl and Tlacochahuaya in the central valleys of Oaxaca (Bernal and Seuffert 1973). The aim was to comple- ment the corpus that had been excavated at the ar- chaeological site of Dainzu, an ancient settlement be- tween the two villages. The stones apparendy had been dragged from the site, probably since colonial times. Although Bernal had been publishing in bits and pieces the carved stones excavated at Dainzu (1967, 1968a, 1973, 1976), the most complete catalogues were not available until much later (Bernal and Seuffert 1979; Bernal and Oliveros 1988). Another addition to the corpus came in 1974, when Bernal published sev- eral of the carved stones housed at the Museo Frissell in Mitla (Bernal and Mendez 1974). Except for the examples excavated from Dainzu, whose ar- chaeological context and approximate dating could be assessed, the specific proveniences of the carvings from Macuilxochid and Tlacochahuaya were unknown, and the attributed proveniences of a few stones from the Museo Frissell included widely dispersed localities from the central valleys. On the basis of stylistic criteria, and recognizing the limitations, Bernal strove to assign temporal placements to the carvings. He also described them using Caso's epigraphic classification, without finding any evidence that would have contradicted the main conclusions delineated by Caso. Despite his ef- forts, Bernal emphasized that more epigraphic data were needed and that the study of Zapotec writing was "still in its infancy" (Bernal and Mendez 1974: 7, 21). Joyce Marcus, another scholar interested in Zapotec writing, has published several studies on the topic (1976a, 1976b, 1980, 1983a to 1983i, 1984, 1992; Marcus and Flannery 1996). Marcus considers that the Zapotec script was a "true" and "heterogeneous" writ- ing system, one that was pardy pictographic, partly ideo- graphic, and partly phonetic (1976b: 38, 1992: 17-19). Three traits useful in distinguishing "true writing" in Mesoamerica from other forms of permanent visual communication are, according to her, (1) the exist- ence of linear formats, which imply a reading order, (2) some degree of relationship to the spoken language, and (3) the occurrence of a finite inventory of signs combined according to specific rules. Except for her suggestion, based on an analogy with the Maya script, that some early Zapotec columnar inscriptions might have read in pairs (following a zigzag sequence), her concerns have not been in determining underlying syntactical principles, elucidating the specific relation- ship of the script to the spoken language, or identify- ing the signary and the rules for its use. Rather, her contributions have focused on the societal uses of writing. In doing so, her approach has been preeminently comparative, placing the inscriptional evidence in broader geographic and cultural contexts. For example, in her first overview of Mesoamerican writing sys- tems, Marcus (1976b) discussed the Zapotec case within a macro-regional frame that included the southwest- 6i</page><page sequence="79">ern highlands (Oaxaca and Chiapas), the gulf coast, the Maya highlands, and portions of the Maya south- ern lowlands. She traced the temporal occurrence of a number of traits in the scripts and in the calendrical systems, like the arrangement of single and double columns of inscriptions, notations that refer to the sa- cred count, year bearers, bar and dot numeration, and notations in the Long Count. Viewed in such a broad context, Marcus reiterated again, as Caso had done before (1947, 1965b), that the earliest evidence for a number of traits comes from Oaxaca and that these pristine manifestations can be specifically placed some- time between 600 and 500 B.C. Marcus emphasized, however, that "it would be unwise to attribute the ori- gins of this writing to any single ethnic group, for it might have emerged over a wide area" (1976b: 64). In a subsequent publication (1983a to 1983i), Marcus framed several of Caso's semantic readings within the paradigm of cultural evolution. Particular emphasis was paid to the role of warfare, as deduced from the repre- sentation of captives or sacrificial victims, in the origin and maintenance of the state. Her most substantive glyphic interpretations, however, were done with the implicit assumption that the writing system is funda- mentally "ideographic." Consequendy, knowledge of the Zapotec language is not necessary to decode the specific messages in the inscriptions, and the principle of homophonic writing, suggested by Caso, is ignored. This underlying position is particularly evident in her attempts to identify place names presumably inscribed in the monoliths from Building J at Monte Alban and in her efforts to unravel the purpose, content, and mean- ing of the inscriptions in the corner stones from the South Platform at the same site. For instance, in the case of the slabs from Building J, Marcus adopted Casos interpretation of towns con- quered by Monte Alban. To her, these towns represent landmarks defining the tributary territory of a Zapotec expansionistic state during period II. Such a proposi- tion is based on comparison of glyphs carved circa A.D. 200 with the toponyms from several of the tributary regions listed in Codex Mendoza, an Aztec document from the early sixteenth century that inventories the commodities extracted by the Triple Alliance on their conquered provinces (Fig. 2.27). In doing so, visual glyphic similarities are equated with semantic equiva- lences, in turn disregarding linguistic differences. As she herself recognized, and despite the attested shifts of setdement patterns in Oaxaca throughout the Pre-His- panic sequence (Kowalewski et al. 1989), her approach also "presupposes more than 1500 years of continuity in place names" (Marcus 1 976a: 129) . Yet, for her method to be sound, it is equally necessary for a Nahuad top- onym in Codex Mendoza to be semantically equiva- lent to a place name in a different language. Although in several instances that is the case, there are many ex- amples where the Nahuad name has no semantic rela- tionship to a local toponym because it is an imposition that stems, in part, from ritualizing tribute geography (cf. Brotherston 1992: 18, and chap. 3; 1995: 55-61). In an attempt to model the empire as an extension of the capital's quadripartite layout, the Mexica named more than one geographic landmark with the same name. For instance, the name Tototepec (Hill of Birds [Totod- bird and teped-hill]) designates three different places, including a town in southern Veracruz (the one listed glyphically in the tribute section of Codex Mendoza [fol. 46r]) , in coastal Oaxaca (the one selected by Marcus) , and in eastern Guerrero, near Tlapa (listed glyphically in the section of Codex Mendoza detailing the con- quests of the Mexica ruler Ahuitzod [fol. 13r]). A fourth tributary province, that of Quautochco in central Veracruz, includes a town named Totodan (Place of Birds). The proliferation of setdements with the same name is also prevalent at more local levels. Paddock (1989b) provides the more striking example of Mixtepec, a name that identifies nine widely distributed towns in the present-day state of Oaxaca alone. The imposition of Nahuad names sometimes involved misinterpreta- tions of local place names.The Zapotec town of Xaquia (At the Foot of the Rock [Hill]) would have been ren- dered in Nahuad - with the same meaning - asTetidan. Yet, it is now officially known as Teotidan (Near the Place of the Deity [Idol]) (Paddock 1990b). The most ambitious comparative study of Marcus (1992) is also presented within the theoretical frame- work of sociopolitical evolution. From this perspective, the preoccupation on the part of those who patronized or did the actual writing centered on defining their territory and political domain, naming for posterity the members of their families, arranging marriages to es- tablish alliances, deifying dead heroes and ancestors, re- 62</page><page sequence="80">cording accession to political office, and leaving records of their military deeds. Thus, writing in Mesoamerica was used as a propagandist^ tool by the elite to legiti- mize and maintain their privileged position (vertical pro- paganda). Given the precocity of Zapotec writing, a corollary of this view is that writing in Mesoamerica originated in the context of evolving chiefdoms whose elites needed to assert, maintain, and perpetuate their power vis-a-vis other competing elites (horizontal pro- paganda). Such a conclusion assumes that early writing in Oaxaca was done only in stone, a view that is weak- ened by the known production of books and lienzos in Mesoamerica during later times. Because these other media include economic and administrative genres, co- operation between elites also could have promoted the invention of writing in Mesoamerica (Postgate,Wang, and Wilkinson 1995). 10 Because the intent on the part of the elite was not to present an "objective history," Marcus cautions that interpretations should not take for granted the veracity of written records, stressing the relative or positional interests of those who sponsored or controlled access to writing. Yet, that cautionary note has seldom been applied to her own interpretations. For instance, no consideration has been given to the possibility that the Building J inscriptions at Monte Alban are a propagandistic fabrication that would not reflect the actual extent of an early Zapotec political domain; nor has she entertained an "emulation" model (Flannery 1968) when discussing theTeotihuacan style carvings from the South Platform at Monte Alban, as- serting that Teotihuacan ambassadors were actually there. The exclusive emphasis in political uses of writing limits a consideration of its other social functions: proper conduct of ritual, divination, or perpetuation of worldviews. For Marcus, Mesoamerica cannot be characterized as a literate society because writing (and reading) was in the hands of only a few. Yet, there is no objection to portraying Mesoamerican societies as agricultural, even though parts of the population en- gaged in commerce, crafts, services, and government; and no one has any difficulty in typifying Mesoamerican civilizations as urban, even though most of the people did not live in cities. Ultimately, the social role of a script can be evaluated in more detail only if its structure and content are well understood. Central to any discussion of historiography and its ma- nipulation is the elucidation of native time reckoning, but calendrical matters in Zapotec inscriptions have never been formally addressed in her studies. Never- theless, in addition to her theoretical and substantive contributions, Marcus has added 12 new examples to the Zapotec corpus (1976a: figs. 15-17,21-22,24-27; 1976b: fig. 2; 1992: 239, 240), including the earliest purported inscription in Mesoamerica found at San Jose Mogote. Another author who has dealt with the Zapotec script is Gordon Whittaker (1981, 1983, 1992, n.d.), who characterized the writing system as logographic, that is, a loosely phonetic system in which signs have a dual component (n.d.: 12). One element is the se- mantic, and the other is the phonetic. He argued that, "logographs with phonetic elements pertaining to a particular language could be read in another language by simply disregarding the incorporated or affixed phonetic elements. The advantage of a logographic script, then, lies in its ability to transcend linguistic boundaries" (n.d.: 13). Such characteristics are diffi- cult to frame within his own definition of writing: the codification and representation of linguis- tic information by means of graphic elements (signs) of uniform size, arranged in sequence, and bearing a rigid relationship to language, (ibid.: 18, emphasis added) From these expositions, one has the impression that a logographic system is a mixture or a stage between what he calls an iconographic system and a writing system, something reminiscent of Prem s "partial" ver- sus "true" writing. On the other hand, such a charac- terization of a logographic system became a theoreti- cal justification for the reliance on Nahuatl language to deal with certain aspects of the inscriptions, par- 10 Implications of differences in archaeological preservation are best illustrated by Linear B, a Minoan syllabic script known from several thousand clay tablets that record economic trans- actions.

Whittaker used two methods, which he calls the comparative and the combinatory (n.d.: 22-24). The former "works on analogy with other scripts of re- lated cultures," the latter "consists of examining the [epigraphic] context of each inscription in order to discover its meaning." With these tools, and using the corpus that was known until 1947, his emphasis was primarily on the inscriptions of Monte Alban that pertain to the earliest stages in the history of the city (600 B.C. to A.D. 200). Whittaker considered that dur- ing Monte Alban II the writing system was in its "fin- est flowering," adding, From the beginning of period III, however, columns of hieroglyphs become rarer, and texts or isolated glyphs are forced into cramped spaces left by the now dominant iconography. Inscriptions, which no longer occur alone, are increasingly reduced in length and scope until litde more than names and dates are left. By the beginning of the Late Classic, period Illb, the writing system is for all intents and pur- poses dead. (Whittaker n.d.: 21) This characterization of the evolutionary trajectory of the script, further elaborated in a subsequent work (Whittaker 1992: 6), is reminiscent of Prems devel- opmental sequence. Yet, contrary to the latter s posi- tion regarding the calendrics, Whittaker began by ac- cepting as valid Caso's identification of the year glyph. The point of contention, however, had to do with other features of the Zapotec calendar. Whittaker proposed that the calendrical decipherment required the solu- tion of two important problems: (1) proper identifica- tion of the year bearers and their correlation in the day list (by means of the comparative method), and (2) identification of another glyph, besides the year glyph, that also would have had the function of a time marker (by means of the combinatory method). If a day was anchored in the texts by two such markers, it would be possible not only to derive in some instances the amount of time involved in the inscriptions but to have a device by which to identify the position that other glyphs have in the day list. After clarifying some ambiguities in Caso's icono- graphic interpretation of the year glyph, Whittaker identified nine glyphs that, according to him, func- tion as annual markers. Because only four bearers are expected, given the structural properties of the Mesoamerican calendar, such glyphic variability was explained as morphological (not semantic) change in the way of representing the bearers throughout the evolutionary development of the script. Whittaker interpreted the four basic bearers as iconic or conven- tional representations of "House," "Rabbit," "Reed," and "Flint," that is, the signs of the days that in later calendrical systems (Mexican, Mixtec, Maya) occupied the 3rd, 8th, 13th, and 18th positions in the list. Con- sequently, according to Whittaker, the Zapotec year bearers are of type III and not of type II as argued by Caso. The most likely candidate for another time marker, besides the year glyph, was glyph W, because the sign appeared accompanied by coefficients larger than 13. As mentioned before, Caso tentatively interpreted the sign as the glyph of a month. Whittaker, on the other hand, proposed that the 13-day periods ( trecenas ) could also fulfill the expectations, because there are 20 of them in the sacred calendar. Because he assumed that the " trecena " glyph anchors a day date, glyph W pro- vided the means to determine conclusively the posi- tion of other calendrical glyphs in the day list. How- ever, because of the paucity of data, it was possible to anchor only five glyphs by this procedure. As a result, Whittaker s reconstruction of the day list for Monte Alban I and II is only partial (Fig. 2.28). When viewed in their epigraphic context, the in- terpretation of glyph W as the trecena glyph allowed Whittaker to derive other properties of the Zapotec calendar, including what he considered to be a verifi- cation of the position of the day that named the year (day 360) and apparent intervals of 9 days ( novenas ) between the trecena dates (1983: 112, 116). Having solved the key calendrical problems to his satisfaction, Whittaker turned to analysis of the monoliths from Building J at Monte Alban (n.d.). Caso's general in- terpretation was not disputed, but several modifica- tions were proposed. Whittaker considered that much of the syntax of the ancient language is reflected in 65</page><page sequence="83">the inscriptions. He therefore viewed them in terms of object, verb, subject, plus much calendrical infor- mation (Fig. 2.29).Whittaker assumed the "Hill" glyph, seen by Caso as the toponymic indicator for the com- pounded glyph on top of it, to be the glyphic name of Monte Alban itself. By viewing the small rounded elements inserted in the "Hill" glyph as representation of jades or precious stones - an identification initially made by Caso (1947: 24) - he proposed that the origi- nal name of Monte Alban was Taniquiecache (Hill of the Precious Stone). He then concentrated on the rest of the compounds, which, following Caso, are taken as the names of the places subjugated by Monte Alban. Whittaker disagreed with Marcus's method and with most of her toponymic interpretations, and despite an entire chapter devoted to cautionary tales about the etymological difficulties in the study of place names, his identifications of the toponymic glyphs in the in- scriptions of Building J rest on a series of assump- tions: 1 . The inverted heads represent emblems for "districts" where the vanquished towns were situated. Based on the classification of heads hinted at by Caso, Whittaker defined 10 dis- tricts (A to J). 2. The slabs were chronologically placed in Building J from left to right. Because he was "inclined to regard the series as com- posed of a sequence of originally free- standing stones set at some point into the walls of Building J, but not created for that purpose" (Whittaker 1983: 139), he acknowl- edged their nonprimary context. 3. The stones with the emblems of district A, being mostly on the left side of the struc- ture (if viewed from southwest to northeast), were the first to have been set. (This in turn assumes that the resetting of the stones did not involve many changes to their original arrangement.) 4. Because of the temporal primacy of the stones with the district A emblem, the latter should be geographically the closest to Monte Alban, and the valley itself is the area most likely to contain the district. With these premises, Whittaker proposed the iden- tification of 18 of the place names in the monoliths (that is 50 percent of the presumed but fully legible toponymic glyphs). Figure 2.30 locates only those glyphs forWhittaker's district A. In his identifications, some signs are taken as ideographs, and the assump- tion of semantic equivalences between Nahuatl and Zapotec place names is invoked. For example, the pur- ported glyph forTlacolula is interpreted as a painting brush and a codex and is correlated to that town by establishing that its name derives from the Nahuatl term Tlamilo'lan, which means "By the codices." Other glyphs are taken as logograms, as in the case of the purported glyph for Mitla, whose Zapotec name is given as Yoopaa, or "House of Tombs."11 Still other explanations are unrelated to etymological or linguis- tic considerations. For example, the case of Caballito Blanco involves interpretation of the glyph as the pic- tograph of an astronomical sighting device and the assumption that one of the structures at the site func- tioned as an astronomical observatory. In sum, none ofWhittaker's interpretations resorts to the homopho- nic principle, which - as mentioned previously - was at the core of Caso's ideas. Ultimately, Whittaker s ap- proach, like that of Marcus, begins with a preconceived idea of where the places they are trying to identify are located. The ensuing procedure, particularly in the case of Whittaker, is indeed to identify the places by mak- ing the data fit into the a priori scheme. Based on the comparative and combinatory meth- ods, Whittaker claimed to have identified several other glyphs (Fig. 2.31). The interpretation of geographic referents is evidently based, although not acknowl- edged, on glyphic similarities to Mixtec place signs 11 Whitecotton (1983: 68-69) states that the name Yoopaa (House or Place of Tomb) for Mitla was probably an attempt to render the Nahuatl name into Zapotec. In his study of the genealogy of Macuilxochid, he identified an old name for Mitla: Yoopechelichepezelao (House of the Tiger [highest lineage], Face of the Serpent). 66</page><page sequence="84">(cf. Smith 1973a: 36-54). In the case of the other glyphs, it is unclear exactly how he arrived at those identifi- cations, making his "combinatory method" something similar to Leigh's "guesses." In summary, Whittaker considered that the script was ideographic (the semantic element) and phonetic (in which glyphs act only as determinants). He did not, however, place much emphasis on the homopho- nic principle. Nevertheless, he conceded that, at the peak of the development of the script, the inscrip- tions reflect the syntax of the language. The reading format of the texts in the slabs from Building J pro- ceeds from top to bottom and right to left. In addi- tion, the inscriptions have much chronological infor- mation (year, trecena, and day dates as well as novena intervals). With regard to other properties of the Zapotec calendar, Whittaker considered that the year bearers conform to those known from the late Mexi- can, Mixtec, and Maya calendrical systems (3-8-13- 18) and that the day naming the year fell on day 360. His reconstruction of the early day list results in mul- tiple, in some cases as many as four, alternative glyphic variants for a single day name. On the other hand, the list is only partial because of the lack of data. Guido Munch (1983) presented a paper dealing with Zapotec theogony among contemporary peoples from Tehuantepec. Using the "insights gained from ethnog- raphy," Munch proposed a number of glyphic inter- pretations. Figure 2.32 presents those extracted from his commentaries on Zapotec gods. Although the ap- proach of "ethno-iconology" has proved essential in the study of Mesoamerican scripts (Galarza 1992; Anders and Jansen 1994; Anders, Jansen, and Van der Loo 1994; Anders, Jansen, and Perez Jimenez 1994; Van der Loo 1987; Van Doesburg n.d.),Miinch's work on glyphs and ancient symbols is not different from that of Martinez Gracida, who was writing at a time when little knowledge of ancient and living indig- enous cultures was available. Without delving into the topic of writing, Munro Edmonson has discussed the nature of the ancient Zapotec calendar within a much larger framework: that of some 60 Mesoamerican calendrical systems. After demonstrating the fundamental unity of all these calendars (Edmonson 1988: 6, fig. 3), and following a number of epigraphic assumptions, the author con- cluded that the Zapotecs had a calendar with the fol- lowing characteristics: 1.Type III New Years, which occupy posi- tions 3-8-13-18 in the day list. Based on the assumption that the Zapotecs named the year for the last day of the 18th period (day 360), the year bearers fall in set II (those occupying positions 2-7-12-17 in the day list) (ibid.: 10). Edmonson agreed with Caso on this point, but in terms of the glyphic categories the bearers are glyphs E, G, M, and M' and not E, G, M, and N as proposed by Caso. 2. The initial month of the year was the third. Month reckoning was recorded mostly by position in the solar cycle, but at least one nominal designation is identified by Edmonson (month P) (Fig. 2.33). Glyph W was interpreted as the sign for the month, con- trasting with Caso s (the glyph of a month), and Whittaker's (the glyph for trecena). Edmonson also contended, following Caso, that the count of months went from 0 to 19 (ibid.: 11). 3. The Calendar Round began with the year 1 Piy. Piya is the name of the twelfth day in Cordova's calendar. This name is translated by Edmonson, following Caso (1965b), as "Sun." 4. Contrary to Whittaker's propositions, Edmonson was of the opinion that there is no evidence for trecena and novena calcula- tions in the ancient Zapotec calendar (Edmonson 1988:273). Edmonson agreed with Caso about the main prop- erties of the Zapotec calendar. The only difference lies in identification of one of the bearers and in in- terpretation of glyph W, which in his opinion is the glyph of the month and not the glyph of a month. Using his own versions of epigraphic materials pub- lished by Caso, Edmonson proposed a complete re- construction of the glyphic day list (Fig. 2.34). He also gave the position of the day that named the years 67</page><page sequence="85">(day 360), the coefficient with which the Zapotec Calendar Round began (coefficient 1), and the month with which the Zapotec solar count started (third). With the publication of a book on Zapotec writ- ing, Roman Pina Chan (1992) has joined the group of scholars interested in the topic. In it, he presents several radical views that disagree with those of pre- vious studies. Taking the writing system as exclu- sively ideographic, the author argues that the script did not constitute an autochthonous development; rather, it derived from an Olmec substratum. In his opinion, Zapotec writing originated out of eco- nomic needs, mainly administration and tribute. Such a conclusion stems from his interpretation of the Danzantes at Monte Alban. Although several scholars consider these carvings as representations of dead captives (Coe 1962; Marcus 1974, 1983a, 1992), Pina Chan believes they depict an age-grade priestly organization whose members in the upper echelon governed the affairs of the early Zapotec state (1992: 40-45) (Fig. 2.35). The sign that Caso interpreted as the "Spear-thrower," which appears in some of the inscriptions associated to the Danzantes and in some of the slabs from Building J, means "tribute" according to Pina Chan (1992: 50 and 62), hence the preeminently economic charac- ter of the early inscriptions. The bulk of Pina Chan's book is devoted to commenting on and interpret- ing some of the best known Zapotec inscriptions, but nowhere in the study is there a hint of a method. Rather, as in the case of Martinez Gracida, Leigh, and Miinch, the approach is to assign a semantic value suggested by the pictography of the signs and then select the one that renders an inscription in- telligible to himself. Figure 2.36 illustrates the re- sult of such an artifice.

Mostly, however, the authors do not make their methods and assumptions explicit. The point on which most scholars agree is on the general nature of the script. A phonetic component has been suspected since 1902, when Batres charac- terized the writing system as being mixed. Since then, the script has been variously described as "ideographic and phonetic" (Caso), "heterogeneous" (Marcus), "par- tial" (Prem), and "logographic" (Whittaker). Caso's suggestion that homophonic writing is involved meant that the script conveys a specific language; yet, by 1965, he was not willing to attribute the earliest archaeo- logical periods at Monte Alban to the Zapotecs. Whittaker favors a logographic system that, by virtue of its ideographic substratum, could have been the medium for a number of languages. He considers Zapotec speech as the most likely candidate for the phonetic determinants in the script and, although calendrical matters are dealt with using Nahuatl, some of Whittaker s interpretations are actually accompa- nied by readings in contemporary Zapotec. In sum, despite the long-held recognition that the script in- volves phoneticism, the possible range of speech units being represented, as well as the underlying rules for arranging them, have not been elucidated. There is less agreement about other aspects of the script. The recognition of some patterns in the texts began with Caso, who proposed the existence of a standard sequence. The content was considered pre- eminently calendrical, specifying the year, the month, and the day of the occurrence of an event (verb), with all these followed by a "closing" statement ("Bag" glyph). Marcus s proposal of a zigzag reading sequence for double columnar arrangements stands alone, but in terms of content it also results in the recording of several simultaneous events (verbs and nouns) with much chronological information (year, two months, and a day date). Whittakers views of textual inscrip- tions from period II concede that the organization of the inscriptions reflects the syntax of the language, and he defines their parts in terms of object, verb, and subject. Like Caso, Whittaker assumes that much ad- ditional information in these texts is exclusively calendrical (year, trecena , day, and novena cycles, which, although not explicit, can be derived from the trecena counts). Because glyphs with coefficients are a conspicuous trait of the script, the emphasis of most of the authors has been on elucidation of the numerical notations. Their pictographic transparency and properties (par- ticularly the value of the coefficients) are in some cases similar to those of better known Mesoamerican calendrical systems, and therefore the aim has been to 73</page><page sequence="91">Fig. 2.34 Zapotec glyphic day list according to Edmonson (rearranged fiom 1988: 269). 74 Zapotec Meaning Caso's Day no. name in English 61yph designations I Chi Day a i+ Â® Pee Wind M r " ' 3 Queela Night IY ^ -J f ' "N 4 Yace Black jdS- S ' Q -N 5 Pella Serpent ; D Y ff^T 6 Quiqueni Head H Â© China Oeer q 8 Peela Rabbit ^CE3 j vil 9 Nica Matar Â«â¢ 10 Telia Oog x /w-o I I Pilloo Monkey 0 v J m @ Ply Sun ?=f= Â£ V '' J 13 Quij Can* ^ A H Peche Jaguar B+ 15 Naa Eagle NC*+ 16 Quilloo Crow p nK ^ Tixoo Quake 2 csi^ ' 18 6opa Cold q k J ' 19 Gappe Cloud 0+ 'Z^Z) *â¢ ' 20 Lao Flower j â¦ problematic identifications * NC * noncalendrical glyph O y*ar bearers</page><page sequence="92">Fig. 2.35 Interpretation of the Danzantes at Monte Alban according to Pina Chan (1992). 75 6th age grade Senior adults with beards and sometimes j shown with a hunchback 1 1 5th age grade Young adults, shown obese and in near-seated or upright positions.

Despite important contributions by Caso between 1928 and 1965, several problems remain un- solved. Subsequent scholars who dealt with the calendrics incorporated few if any of Caso's conclu- sions in their studies. In other words, they all start prac- tically from scratch and they all disagree with each other. The disagreements range from recalcitrant skep- ticism (Prem) to "full" but not shared solution of a number of problems (Macias,Whittaker, Edmonson). Although the great majority of authors - even before the works of Caso - concede that the general content of the inscriptions is primarily historical, the calendrical disagreements have precluded the understanding of those historical events in terms of native time reckon- ing. The aim of the next chapter thus is to lay down the necessary foundations to embark on an analysis of calendrical notations. 78</page><page sequence="96">CHAPTER 3 Problems in Reconstructing the Ancient Zapotec Calendar Introduction Glyphs accompanied by coefficients in Zapotec writ- ing can have two functions. In some cases their value is chronological, meaning that the signs bear a direct re- lationship to the system of time reckoning. In other instances the glyphs have a nominative character - that is, they make reference to mortals. This other usage can be deduced from the ancient practice, documented by Cordova during the early colonial period, of nam- ing people according to the day they were born (see Chapter 2, note 2). The nominative value of glyphs with numerals constitutes an indirect reflection of the calendar. Yet, irrespective of their particular function, I refer to both chronological and nominative signs as "calendrical." Their comprehensive analysis should dis- close some of the structural characteristics of the an- cient calendar. Although the study of noncalendrical inscriptions, like verbs or toponyms, could proceed without clari- fication of the calendrical glyphs, the history of deci- pherment in the Maya script provides a relevant ex- ample. Significant breakthroughs in the unraveling of Maya noncalendrical inscriptions were achieved once the chronological notations had been understood. In Oaxaca too, the workings of the calendrical in- scriptions can be derived independently of the re- maining glyphs. Also, at a given level of analysis, the noncalendrical inscriptions cannot be under- stood without reference to the associated chrono- logical notations. To guide the analysis of calendrical signs I first outline a general calendrical model. The model can be based on the fair amount of available ethnohistoric and ethnographic descriptions, not only from Oaxaca but from other regions of Mesoamerica as well. I will then be able to address the problem of the specific nature of the Zapotec calendar. Because there have been several attempts to deal with this problem, it is worth conducting a critical review of the interpretive schemes presented by Caso (1928, 1947, 1965b), Macias (1957), Leigh (1958b), Whittaker (1983, n.d.), Edmonson (1988), and Marcus (1992). I turn first, however, to a discussion of the known structural prop- erties of the Mesoamerican calendar. The Mesoamerican Calendar A numeration system is necessary to keep track of units of time, and in Mesoamerica such a system was vigesimal. Although there were several graphic conven- tions to represent values 1 to 20, the oldest and most extensively used was the convention that combined bars and dots. The Mesoamerican calendar can be described as a nested hierarchy of cycles (Fig. 3.1). These cycles were derived from natural phenomena, mosdy from human biology and astronomy, and then integrated into an overall system by means of mathematical manipula- tions. For instance, the shortest and next to last cycles in Figure 3.1 resulted from observing the trajectory of the sun during a single day and in a year. The cycle of 260 days, on the other hand, was generated from observing cycles of the moon and their correspondence to the period of human gestation (Brotherston 1982, 1992; Earle and Snow 1983; Furst 1986).1 Still other cycles were derived from observing the path of Venus. 1 A contending hypothesis about the origin of the 260-day calendar stipulates that it was invented at Izapa, in coastal Gua- temala, to mark the interval between two successive passages of the vertical sun (Malmstrom 1997). 79</page><page sequence="97">Fig. 3.1 The Mesoamerican calendar as a nested hierarchy of cycles. In Mesoamerica, the day cycle was not counted from midnight to midnight but from midday to mid- day. The known names for such a cycle in several lan- guages are synonymous to the word "sun," like copiycha in Zapotec and k'in in Maya. The series of 260 days, commonly referred to in the literature as the "sacred count," also had its own name in different re- gions. Although it has been commonly stated by con- temporary scholars, including myself, that the Zapotec name of this count was piye, several sources, such as Cordova's Arte ([1578] 1886: 202) and Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 440v), as well as a seventeenth-century Zapotec calendar from the Sierra Norte (Alcina Franch 1993: figs. 28-31), indicate that such a word translates as "cycle," "interval," or "duration of time." It was therefore applied not only to the sacred count and its subdivisions but to other cycles like the solar count. The word for the sacred count in Maya is also un- known,2 leaving the Nahuatl term ( tonalpohualli ) as the only known native name for this cycle. Such a name translates literally as "the count of days." The sacred calendar was the result of the per- mutation of two series: one of cardinal numbers 1 to 13 and the other of 20 entities (I to XX) naming animals, plants, and meteorological phenomena like rain, wind, and lightning. This permutation of 13 numbers and 20 entities generated 260 days distinctly named (Table 3.1). The sequence of all these days within the sacred count was always the same. Also, once a complete cycle elapsed, it recurred, running 2 Mayanists commonly refer to the sacred count as tzolkin , an arbitrarily imposed term based on the words tzol (count of days) and k'in (sun, day) (Thompson 1971: 97). 80</page><page sequence="98">% 0 vO | 3 u a 8 y pi 1 i H T-t CO a 3 H âs5&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;^XX^XXXXXX O rH CS O â &lt;- â¢ CN rO ^ 00 ON T-H T- I T- I T-H T- iMC^i-invOhOO^H T- I T- I T- I i-hS I- âE3aS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;^!&lt;XXXXXXXXX I- co o â¢&lt;- t (n m HrH(Ncn'tin'Oh000NHHHrH^M(n'tin'O hH O "T-H CM m o T-I CM vOI^OOONT-HT-HT-H'rHr-lCNICO^LnvOr^OOONT-H'r-lT-H ~ ~ K&gt; cm co o rn ('j m rHHH(N]Cr),tir)'OhOO^HHHTHH(NC^i'l/l O rH CM fO O r-( lo 'o r- oo o' t-h t-h r- i t-h t- i cm co "^i" to 'o oo on t-h t- i t-H CM CO O rH (M CO t- IT- I t-H T- IfMtO^'invOh'OO^TH I T-H IT- IT-IT- I Ol fO Â»-H i-h EU âaaÂ£;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CXX^XXXXXXX O T-H CM CO o t IT 'D h 00 ^ T- IT- IT- IT- IH^fOtlfi^hX^T- 1 O T-H CM CO O T-H CM cO t- IT- IT-HT- iT-HCNCO^LnvOt^OOONT- IT- IT-HT- Ir-HCMCO i- I K . âa3^&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Â£XXXXXXXXXXX O T-h CM cO CO LO vO r- 00 ON T-h T-H T-H T-H T-H CM CO t3" LO '0 r- 00 ON O t-h CM CO Ot-hCNcO ONt- It- IT- iT-HTHCNCO^J-lOVOr^OOONT- IT-HT- IT-Ht- ICM HH ^ HH G HH ^ âB5^&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;^XXXXX^^X&gt;I ^ ^ O T-h CM CO (Nc01-m'OhMO'HHHHH(NcOTMnvDhOO H-H ~ s -a&gt;&gt;&gt;55^x mbSS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;CXXXXXXXXXXX O t-h CM cO O t-h CM cO OOONt-Ht- IT-HT- IT- iCNCO^lOVOt^OOONT- IT- IT- IT- IT-H i- I K â¢- i hBSS&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;QXXXXXXXXXXX O t-h CM cO T- icNco^unvor^oooNT- it-HT- IT-HT- icNco^Lnvor^ 8l</page><page sequence="99">its name in the native languages, and among the best known series are the Nahuatl and Maya (cf. Caso 1967a: tables X, XI). The only known Zapotec list of months has a number of peculiarities that are commented on below. In the present context, suffice it to say that from it the short period at the end of the veintenas was known as quicholla.The meaning of this name is unknown. The Nahuad and Yucatec Maya names to designate the 5-day period were, respectively, nemontemi and uayeb, which come to mean approximately "the unfortunate, superfluous, or remaining days." Although the sacred count and the solar calendar had a different origin and function - thus comprising separate computations (Brotherston 1982:9-15) - both systems were inextricably meshed. Whereas the sacred count provided the names of the 20 days, the solar count generated the series of 18 veintenas. Thus, the 20 days and their names were an integral part of both the sacred and the solar counts. In the solar reckoning, each year took its name from the day it began; depending on whether the counts were done in terms of elapsed or elapsing time, such a day could be the first (no. 1), as in the case of the Maya calendar, or the one at the end of the 18th veintena (no. 360), as in Nahua calendars. Because of the nega- tive associations of the last five days of the solar count, no calendar began the reckoning of years on the last day (no. 365). Just as the days from which they took their name, the years were also designated by the car- dinal series 1 to 13. Because 365 equals 18 x 20 + 5, if the year began with a day that had the coefficient 1 and the day sign I, then the following year was named by the numeral 2 and the sign VI.The third year would be named by the numeral 3 and the sign XI and the fourth year by the numeral 4 and the sign XVI. The name of the fifth year would continue the numeral series with coefficient 5, but it would revert to the first of the 20 signs. In other words, in the list of 20 days, the days that named the years would always be four and, regardless of which ones they were, these four names were spaced five positions from each other in the list. The four days naming the years are com- monly referred to as "year bearers," and depending on their position in the list, they can be grouped into sets: I (1st, 6th, 11th, 16th positions), II (2nd, 7th, 12th, 17th indefinitely, continuously, and invariably in the same order. The sacred calendar had a number of important subdivisions - 2, 4, 5, 13, and 20 - but the most sig- nificant one was the last, because it generated the trecenas (i.e., 20 periods of 13 days). This subdivision was used for augural purposes, permeating all aspects of every- day life like birth, marriage, death, subsistence, disease, crisis, and conflict. Each trecena was in turn presided over by a patron deity. Running concomitandy with the trecenas, there were three other series: the 13 Lords of the Day, the 13 Volatiles (flying creatures), and the 9 Lords of the Night. The explicit identity or names of the entities in each of these series is known only from Nahuad documentary sources. Whereas the series of the Lords of the Night was continuous in the Maya calendrical system and was used to anchor days (Thompson 1978: 17), it func- tioned differendy in the Mexican calendar. In the lat- ter, each day of the sacred count invariably had the same Lord of the Night that corresponded to it by the unfolding of the series throughout the 260 days. Given that 260 is not divisible by 9, such fixed correspon- dence was obtained by having two Lords of the Night accompanying either the last or the first day of the sacred count (Caso 1967a: 127). The 13 Lords of the Day and the 9 Lords of the Night accompanied the days alternatingly. One of the latter would reign from midday to midnight, and one of the former would reign from midnight to midday, and so on. The next cycle in the progressive order was the solar count of 365 days, which was divided into 18 periods of 20 days (18 x 20 = 360). At the end of this series ran a short period of 5 days (Table 3.2). The order of the 20-day periods or veintenas was invariably the same, and - except for the recurrent intercalation of the 5-day period between the 18th veintena of a solar cycle and the 1st veintena of the following one - the 20-day periods also ran uninterrupted. The count of the solar year also had its name in the native lan- guages. In Nahuatl, for example, it was called xiuhpohualli. Although the term for year in Zapotec is known (yza), the word used for the count of the year is unknown. There was also a native term for veintenas : peo in Zapotec (meaning moon or month), uinal in Maya, meztli in Nahuad. Each of the veintenas also had 82</page><page sequence="100">Table 3.2 The Mesoamerican Solar Calendar (365 days) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 00 I 18293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 718293 10 II 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 III 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 IV 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 V 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 VI 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 VII 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 VIII 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 IX 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 X 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 XI 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 XII 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 XIII 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 XIV 1 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8293 XV 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 XVI 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 XVII 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 XVIII 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 XEX 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 XX 718293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 71829 positions), III (3rd, 8th, 13th, 18th positions), IV (4th, 9th, 14th, 19th positions), and V (5th, 10th, 15th, 20th positions).3 The interlocking of two cycles of different length (260 x 365) meant that their point of common origin (0 in Fig. 3.1) did not recur until 52 solar years had elapsed (52 x 365 = 18,980 -r- 260 = 73). This is actu- ally the lengthiest cycle illustrated in Figure 3.1. The years in this larger cycle were all distinctly named by the permutation of the cardinal series 1 to 13 and the 3 When referring to the days that named the years, some au- thors use the word "eponymous" (meaning "giving name"), reserving the term "year bearers" to designate the resulting set of four names that recurrently fell on day 1 . However, as men- tioned previously, not all calendars in Mesoamerica had the eponymous signs falling on the first day of the year. Stone and MacLeod (Stone 1995: 159) make a useful distinction between "alignment sets" (i.e., the five sets of four year names that are possible given the mathematical properties of the Mesoamerican calendar, irrespective of the day on which the eponymous sign fell) and "year bearers" (i.e., the particular set of eponymous days whose position was at either the end or the beginning of the year) . Here, the term "year bearer" is used in the first sense - that is, as a synonym of "eponymous," without making a priori judgment of when in the Zapotec year the naming day fell. 83</page><page sequence="101">four names taken from the day list. This cycle is com- monly referred in the literature as "Calendar Round," although it too had its name in different native lan- guages. Only the Nahuatl term, however, survived in the ethnohistoric records (xiuhmolpillt) (Table 3.3). A significant division of the Calendar Round was into four groups (the four columns in Table 3.3). The first set began and ended with the name 1-1 and 13-1, the second with 1-VI and 13- VI, the third with 1-XI and 13-XI, and the fourth with 1-XVI and 13-XVI. Only the Nahuatl name of this division is known (tlalpilli). A cycle of higher order, not shown in Figure 3.1, consisted of 104 years. It was then equivalent to two Calendar Rounds. The duration of this cycle was related to the count of the Venus year (584 days), be- cause 104 vague years equal 65 synodic revolutions of Venus, giving a total of 37,960 days. Again, only the Nahuad name for this cycle of higher order is known (huehuetliztli) . Available Accounts of Calendars in Oaxaca Since the times of the sixteenth-century chroni- clers, there has been a recognition of the existence of a generalized Mesoamerican calendar, that is, of a sys- tem sharing the same core properties. Based on ethnohistoric and ethnographic data, later scholars ar- gued this too. Seler's analysis of the sixteenth-century Zapotec day names, for example, aimed precisely at solving apparent differences between the meanings of day names in the Maya and Nahua calendars. He con- cluded that, despite superficial variations, mostly ex- plicable in terms of metaphorical associations, the day names in the three calendrical systems had the same meaning (Seler 1904b). Caso proceeded along the same lines, presenting a comparative table with 32 day lists from several re- gions of Mesoamerica (1967a: table IX). The mean- ings of the day names in that table present greater variability across day lists, but in most instances the variation is the result of inadequate translations, postcontact changes, and incomplete data. A few cases, however, cannot be explained in this way and repre- sent evident regional differences. Yet, Caso postulated that such differences should be viewed as equivalences, stressing that the order of the days in all the lists is invariably the same. Because the 20 days form the nucleus of the nested hierarchy of cycles in the calendrical system, the dem- onstration of its unity in diverse regions of Mesoamerica means that the other properties were also present among different native groups.4 It is because of an historical accident that the best and most comprehen- sive documentation of the cycles and their interplay comes from Nahuad sources. That all the properties described in the preceding section were present in the calendrical systems of Oaxaca can be demonstrated by putting together the fragmentary ethnohistoric and ethnographic information (Fig. 3.2). For example, in terms of the shortest cycle, the day, Cordova recorded that the Zapotecs counted it from midday to midday ([1578] 1886: 212). The use of the cycle of the 9 Lords of the Night is evident in a modern manuscript from San Antonio Huitepec (Van Meer n.d.) and in the native calendar used today by the Zapotec Loxichas in southern Oaxaca (Carrasco 1951;Weidaner 1958; Caso 1965b; Van der Loo 1987; Van Meer n.d.a).The cycle of the 13 Lords of the Day can be deduced from Balsalobre's mid-seven- teenth-century description of idolatries among the Zapotecs from the region of Sola de Vega in western Oaxaca. This description provides the Zapotec names of 13 gods (Balsalobre [1656] 1892; Berlin 1957). As argued below, an almost complete list of 13 gods can also be derived from Cordova's Vocabulario , which is known to have information gathered in the Tlacolula valley of central Oaxaca (Jimenez Moreno 1942). The series of volatiles seem to be added in the Zapotec day names recorded by Cordova, as I argue in more detail later in this chapter. Also, among the series of seventeenth-century calendars from the Zapotec re- gion of Villa Alta in northeastern Oaxaca, housed to- day in the Archivo de Indias in Seville (Alcina Franch 1966, 1993), is a solar count that lists the Zapotec months. 4 A study dealing with the survival of the Mesoamerican cal- endar in Middle America also attests to the fundamental unity of the ancient calendrical system (Miles 1952; cf. also Broda de Casas 1969; Edmonson 1988; Stross 1983). 84</page><page sequence="102">Table 3.3 The sequence of Year Bearers in the Mesoamerican Calendar Round (52 years, or 18,980 days) II 1 VI 1 XI 1 XVI 2 VI 2 XI 2 XVI 2 I 3 XI 3 XVI 3 1 3 VI 4 XVI 4 1 4 VI 4 XI 5 1 5 VI 5 XI 5 XVI 6 VI 6 XI 6 XVI 6 I 7 XI 7 XVI 7 1 7 VI 8 XVI 8 1 8 VI 8 XI 9 1 9 VI 9 XI 9 XVI 10 VI 10 XI 10 XVI 10 I 11 XI 11 XVI 11 I 11 VI 12 XVI 12 I 12 VI 12 XI 13 I 13 VI 13 XI 13 XVI Although pertaining to different branches of the Otomanguean family, other lists of months are known from the Chinantecs and Mazatecs of northwestern Oaxaca (Weidaner 1936;Weidaner andWeidaner 1946; Schultz 1955). From the Mixes of eastern Oaxaca, whose language belongs to an entirely different family but who are geographically adjacent to the Zapotecs, excellent and unique ethnographic documentation of both the sacred and solar counts and their interplay exists (Mann and Chadwick 1960; Carrasco, Miller, and Weitlaner 1961; Weitlaner and Weitlaner 1963; Caso 1963; Lipp 1991). The Mixe solar count documented ethnographi- cally in the twentieth century, and the Zapotec solar calendar found in the ethnohistoric documents of the seventeenth century provide good examples to further demonstrate the unity of the Mesoamerican calendar as well as to assess the nature of the differences they present in relationship to the general model. It was emphasized previously that the order of the names in the Mesoamerican day list is invariable and that re- gional differences should be considered equivalences. Yet, all the known versions of the Mixe calendar present two couples of transposed day names (Table 3.4). Caso cogendy demonstrated that these transpositions and other peculiarities of the Mixe solar count are the re- sult of its adjustment to the Christian calendar, par- ticularly to the device of leap years and the irregulari- ties that it generated in A.D. 1700, 1800, and 1900 (Caso 1963: 71). As to the solar calendar from the region of Villa Alta that includes a list of months (Manuscript 85), it also presents a number of peculiarities that have to do with the number of months and their duration (Table 3. 5). 5 For instance, the solar year has 20 instead of the anticipated 19 subdivisions. In addition, the period named quicholla consists of 6 and not 5 days. As a result, there are three other periods that do not have 20 days each: one has 18 days (1st month), one has 19 days (14th month), and one has 1 day (20th month). Because the calendar in Manuscript 85 is accompa- nied by its Christian equivalences (dominical letters, 5 Initially, Manuscript 85 was thought to come from the town of Santa Maria Sogocho (Alcina Franch 1966: 121, table 1). In the subsequent study of the calendars from the Sierra Norte (Alcina Franch 1993), no specific provenience is given for this manuscript. 85</page><page sequence="103">o *n 0 (/&gt; V s 6 4- &gt; 1 3 O 00 &lt;N cn tb iE 86 / J 7 *1 Â§ / / S- AS I s / | J f I . - . ^ ' I | Â£ m c ^ y | I Â§ ' l f , . .

The names of the months in this manuscript present some interesting problems. Cline, for example, noted the similarity of the name quicholla to the Aztec month name quecholli. Because the latter does not show variations in the Nahuatl sources - as do other month names - Cline suggested that Nahuad quecholli might be a loan word from Zapotec quicholla. He then as- sumed that the Zapotec month toohua, the first of the year, was equivalent to panquetzaliztli, which is the month that follows quecholli in the Nahuatl calendar (Cline 1975: 275).6 Nahuad quecholli means "flamingo" (Caso 1967a: 37) or "roseate spoonbill," but a corre- sponding Spanish term cannot be found in Cordova's Vocabulario. On the other hand, the position of the period quicholla in the list of Manuscript 85 sug- gests an equivalence of meaning to the Nahuatl nemontemi ("the unlucky or remaining days"). Yet, the only relevant entry in Cordova's Vocabulario, one that refers to a fateful or unlucky day, states "Aziago dia- chij nazijnachibaa"([1578] 1987:50).The Zapotec ex- pression in this entry does not come close to the name quicholla, probably because it refers to a single day and not to the 5-day period. Although elucidating the meaning of quicholla does not seem possible with Cordova s Vocabulario , this source does help in translat- ing at least one of the other month names in the list from Manuscript 85: the 9th term, gogaa. Seler (1904b: 37) translated the expression cocij cogaa in Cordova s Vocabulario as "special time in which no work can be done." Cordova s entry states, Tiempo encogido en que _cocij cogaa no se puede trabajar. (400v) vt de aguas o vientos. f. vedado [Resting time when one cannot work because of rain and wind, forbidden] One of the meanings of cociy cogaa is indeed the one given by Seler, but the second part of the Spanish expression clearly refers to the "season of rain and wind," that is, when no agricultural work is done. Because of the correlation of the calendar in Manu- script 85 to the Christian year of 1696, it is known that the month gogaa fell in August, which is pre- cisely the final part of the rainy season. The translation of the name for the 9th month in the list of Manuscript 85 as "season of rain and wind" suggests that the meaning of the other names may be related to the agricultural cycle. Yet, two month names, 6 The calendar in Manuscript 85 is only solar and does not include its interplay with the sacred count. Yet, the fact that it is accompanied by detailed Christian equivalences made it pos- sible for Cline to confirm that its synchrony to a.d. 1696 is with the Julian system (the Gregorian reform apparendy was not followed in remote areas). Furthermore, through a series of correlations, Cline determined that the native name (actually the Nahuad equivalent to the Zapotec term) of that particular year was 7 Motion and established synchronologies between the Mixtec, Zapotec, and Christian calendars. 87</page><page sequence="105">Table 3.5 Zapotec Names of the Months in Manuscript 85, Sierra Norte of Oaxaca (Alcina Franch 1966: 131) No. Month Duration 1 toohua 18 days 2 huistao 20 days 3 begag 20 days 4 lohuec 20 days 5 yagqueo 20 days 6 gabena 20 days 7 golagoo 20 days 8 cheag 20 days 9 gogaa 20 days 10 gonaa 20 days 1 1 gaha 20 days 12 tina 20 days 13 zaha 20 days 14 zadii 19 days 15 zohuao 20 days 16 yetilla 20 days 17 yeche 20 days 18 gohui 20 days 19 quicholla 6 days 20 queainij 1 day huistao (2nd) and gohui (18th), appear to include suffixes for "great" and "small." This also suggests that, among the names, there might be terms used to refer to the festivities and their associated deities, as in the Nahuatl list. Eventually, it might be possible to fully translate the list from Manuscript 85 by means of lin- guistic and ethnographic fieldwork or by relying on Cordova's Vocabulario. Because not all the discrepancies in the documen- tary sources and in the ethnographic accounts can be explained as the result of postcontact changes and ad- justments, it is evident that the Mesoamerican calen- dar exhibited regional variations.The case of the mean- ing of certain day names has already been alluded to, as well as the fact that not all the calendrical systems had the same set of year bearers (see Table 2.1). But perhaps the best illustration of regional variants is the difference in synchronization among them. Even in the case of solar counts that named the years after the 360th day, not all of them began with the same name (Jimenez Moreno 1961;Brotherston 1982: 17-20).This also means that the sacred calendars had different be- ginnings within the solar counts. In turn, this might have led to the well-documented differences in the augural classifications of days into bad and good ones. Despite such expected variability, it is equally evi- dent that all the calendrical systems used in ancient Mesoamerica had a sacred count, a solar count, and a Calendar Round. With this underlying premise in mind, Table 3.6 presents a selection of day lists from those compiled by Caso, including those for which most of the days have translations. This table will be instrumental in the analysis conducted in the next chapter. 88</page><page sequence="106">Zapotec Day Names Having outlined the general structure of the Mesoamerican calendar and argued for a fundamental unity, I now turn to a review of the different models that have been proposed to account for the Zapotec calendrical inscriptions. The first part of the review deals with the linguistic interpretations of the day names documented by Cordova as well as their translations. Table 3.7 presents the lists of the various authors. The differences in this table, particularly those re- lated to translations, are difficult to understand given the fact that Seler's list is the only one based on the study of both the Arte and the Vocabulario of Cordova. Cruz took the Zapotec terms from Seler. He also made use of the vocabulary published by the Junta Colombina (1893) and of his own knowledge of the language to verify and amplify the translations. Caso (1965b: 944) states explicitly that his list of Zapotec names and their translation is based on Cordova's Arte and on a compilation of Seler's and Cruz's data. Macias too derived the Zapotec names from Cordova's Arte but copied the translations from Cruz. As noted in Chapter 2, Leigh used the Spanish/English meaning of Nahuatl day names and then selected correspond- ing names from Cordova's Arte (which is why the trans- lations are of the Nahuatl day names). Whittaker ap- parendy took the Zapotec names and most of the trans- lations from Seler. However, the origin of his ortho- graphic modifications (changing letter "g" for "q" or adding "c") is unclear, for these are not based on Cordova's Arte. The source of one of his translations ("conflict") is also unknown. Edmonson states that the Zapotec terms and the translations in his list were taken from Caso (1965b), which is partially true. Four- teen of the Zapotec day names in his list are different from those of Caso. On the other hand, all but four of the translations are the same. Rather than copying Caso, Edmonson may have translated into Zapotec the con- cepts that were derived from existing iconographic interpretations of the glyphs. This procedure can be illustrated with the first entry in his list ("chi," day). Based onWhittaker's interpretation of glyph I as "day," and after correlating the glyph to the first position, Edmonson translated the English "day" into Zapotec "chi." In summary, the Zapotec names in all the calendrical models that have been advanced are ultimately based on Seler's study. In the course of reuse, the primary data have been distorted (e.g., the first Zapotec day name is now "chi" instead of chijlla).Thus, it is nec- essary only to evaluate Seler's study, which paradoxi- cally did not deal with hieroglyphic inscriptions. To do so, the original sources have to be used. The goal is to determine how accurately Seler derived the list of Zapotec names from Cordova's Arte, which in turn will allow an assessment of the accuracy of the trans- lations. In addition to the calendar recorded by Cordova, another Zapotec sacred count will be used for comparative purposes. Of the 99 calendars from the Villa Alta region mentioned previously, Alcina Franch (1966: table 4) published initially one sacred count (originally designated Manuscript 7), which came from the village of Temascalapa. This seven- teenth-century calendar, now renamed Manuscript 10 (Alcina Franch 1993), will be used as a control sample. Its use in this context is also relevant because the in- formation on this sacred count has quite a different origin than Cordova's. The fact that the calendar from Temascalapa appears in a booklet that was confiscated by the church from a local diviner (colaniy in Zapotec), means that it was written by a native who had knowledge of the European alphabetical script. As mentioned before, Cordova gathered his data between 1570 and 1575 in several communities from the Tlacolula arm of the Oaxaca valley, most probably in Tlalixtac, Tlacochahuaya, Teotitlan, Teitipac, and Papaluda.The circumstances under which he collected the information on the calendar are not known, but some can be deduced from his comments: The said 260 days were divided by the na- tives into 20 parts or periods, or months, each one of 13 days. And for each one of these 13- day periods they applied the figure of an ani- mal, like Eagle, Monkey, Snake, Alligator, Deer, Rabbit, etc. The heads of these figures were painted inside the parts and extremities of a deer in such a way that the said figure con- tained all 20 signs. (Cordova [1578] 1886: 203) As noted by Seler (1904d: 271), it is obvious that Cordova's assistants showed him a codex. The manu- script must have had a scene similar to the ones in 89</page><page sequence="107">Table 3.6 Day Lists from Several Regions of Mesoamerica (Caso 1967a: table ix) MEXICANO MEZTITLAN GUATEMALA OTOMI 1.

From Cordova's passing description of the calendrical signs (i.e., "Eagle"), and as will become more evident after analyzing the glyphs with numerals in Chapter 4, it can be assumed that the codex was painted in Mixtec style. The friar refers without distinction to the patrons of the trecenas ("Y para cada treze dias tenian aplicada vna figura de animal"), zs well as to the 20 day names (which is the actual case in the scenes of the unfolded deer skins from the codices already cited). As noted previ- ously by Whitecotton, Cordova described signs of only six animals, most certainly because of their pictographic transparency. Cordova continues, And those twenty animals had each one thir- teen names, and although all these thirteen names were very similar, they were differen- tiated by adding or eliminating letters, and by changing the numerals, as shown below.

(Cordova [1578] 1886: 203) From this passage it is also evident that Cordova failed to understand the nature of the words that make up the day names. He somehow recognized that each one had two parts: a common root (like Richard in the example) and a particle that altered the root (chang- ing Richard into Richie, Rich, Rick, Ricky) . Cordova gave also, in Zapotec, the cardinal number (from 1 to 13) that followed each day name. The terms for some of these numbers also have variant forms (Table 3.8). His observation about the variability in the roots results from grouping the sacred count in veintenas, al- though this probably was not the format in which it appeared in the codex that he saw.

Yet, he could not explain the meaning of the prefixes. Once he iden- tified them, he set them aside: I have already mentioned that the Zapotec calendar is of an extremely ancient type. This is shown ... by the fact that the relation of the signs to the thirteen figures has become to some extent encrusted upon the form of the words used to denote the days. We can therefore detach a prefix from all the names of the word, which is very nearly the same for all the signs connected with the same num- ber. There are a few exceptions, which were perhaps due to an oversight or an erroneous conception on the part of the deserving monk who preserved this calendar for us or possi- bly are merely to be ascribed to the careless reprint. . . . Yet only a few of these various prefixes seem to contain any distinct mean- ing. (Seler 1904b: 36-37) Fig. 3.3 Deer skin with the 20-day signs in Codex Borgia (after Seler 1904d: 271). 7 Caso s argument that the sacred count probably originated somewhere in the region of Oaxaca is based partly on this quadripartite division (65 x 4 = 260) (Caso 1965b: 945). The trait, however, is known not only from 16th- and 17th- century Zapotec sources (Cordova [1578] 1886: 201-204; Balsalobre [1656] 1892: 238) but also occurs in the Maya codices (Thompson 1971: 90- 100), in the Borgia Group manu- scripts, and in Codex Tudela, a Mexican manuscript dated to 1553 (Tudela 1980). Pages 65 to 70 of Codex Borgia, which provide the patrons of the 20 "13-day cycles" (trecenas), follow the same order of the sacred count given by Cordova. Although in these pages of the codex the day names are not accompanied by numbers, the quadripartite division of the sacred count is evident by having trecenas 1 to 10 in the lower portion of the pages and trecenas 11 to 20 in the upper part. In addition, a double line separates trecenas 5 and 6 and 15 and 16. 93</page><page sequence="111">To verify Selers division of the Zapotec words into roots and prefixes, the day names of both the Cordova and theTemascalapa calendars are arranged as veintenas and trecenas (Tables 3.9 and 3.10).8 In Table 3.9 the 20 day names of both sacred counts are placed in col- umns, and in Table 3.10 the trecenas of both calendars are arranged horizontally. This way a given root and a given prefix can be compared simultaneously. It should be emphasized that these matrices are arbitrary arrange- ments and in no way reflect the indigenous organiza- tion of the sacred calendar. After the roots are sepa- rated from the prefixes so that maximum simultaneous similarity is attained for both, all the root variants are placed at the right end of each calendar in Table 3.9, and all the prefix variants are listed in the lower sec- tion of each calendar in Table 3. 10. Then, by using the most common occurrence, the modal 20 roots and 13 prefixes in each calendar can be derived and com- pared with Selers results (Table 3. II).9 Three important observations can be made. First, the two lists of roots (Cordova and Temascalapa) are very much alike. The only slight difference involves the 15th day base (na and lina).The case of and que^a is only apparent, because both forms occur in Cordova's calendar. Second, the two lists of prefixes show a wider degree of divergence. Nevertheless, the substitutions display a pattern making them relatively different but equivalent. For example, the particle yo in the calendar from Temascalapa consistendy substi- tutes for the particle pe in Cordova's calendar. In gen- eral, the letter "p" in Cordova's orthography is substi- tuted by the letter "b" in the orthography of the Temascalapa calendar. Third, when the results obtained here are compared with Seler's list, general agreement in prefixes and roots can be observed. The few differ- ences in roots pertain to days 3, 4, 14, 18, and 19. The roots derived by Seler in these cases are, respectively, guela, gueche, gueche, opa, and ape. The ones I obtained are laala, lachi, lache, lopa, and lape. As is evident by the relative occurrence of these words (see Table 3.9), such disparities are simply due to the fact that Seler selected infrequent roots to char- acterize those day names. Despite the slight differences between Seler's results and those of this analysis, it can be seen from the comparison in Table 3.11 that three roots and three prefixes are repeated twice or even three times in each calendar (Table 3.12). Moreover, with the exception of prefixes ne (in the Cordova calendar) and la (in theTemascalapa calendar), the rep- etitions have the same position in the sequence. These patterns (the repetitions and their correspondences) mean that, contrary to the "model" sacred count in Table 3.1, the two Zapotec calendars do not contain 260 different day names. Another implication is that the repetitions cannot be the result of mistakes attrib- utable to those who recorded the calendars (Cordova and his native collaborators from the central valleys and the native scribe from the northern mountains). Rather, it seems that Spanish orthography failed to register glottal stops and differentiate tones. Because, as mentioned in Chapter 1, these phonemes convey meaning in the Zapotec language, the apparent or- thographic repetitions in day bases and prefixes actu- ally must refer to different phonetic readings that con- veyed different meanings. How can the variations in the roots and the pre- fixes be explained? As noted before, Seler exclusively adduced these to mistakes on the part of Cordova and also on the part of the printer who published the first facsimile edition of Arte (Nicolas Leon). Joseph Whitecotton, however, has summarized succincdy the reasons: 1. Variations due to orthographic error, printer's error, and sequential error (the first and third could have had their origin in Cordova's assistants and the native scribe as well) . 2. Variations having to do with the ortho- graphic, and hence phonological, environ- s Alcina Franch (1993: 176-183) independently conducted a similar analysis with a sample of 29 calendars from the north- ern Sierra. The results of that study are practically identical to those presented here (see also Urcid 1992a: 92-101). 9 Although Joseph Whitecotton (1982: 293) has amply dem- onstrated why for certain problems it is not advisable to recon- struct a typical calendar from Cordova's data, it is necessary to do so for epigraphic purposes. The structure of the sacred cal- endar, as shown in Table 3.1, predicts the occurrence of 20 distincdy defined glyphs that permutate with 13 numbers, which in turn produces 260 different combinations. 94</page><page sequence="112">Table 3.8 Zapotec Terms Designating Cardinal Numbers 1 to 13 (Cordova [1578] 1886: 204- 212) No. Common Variant form form 1 tobi chaga 2 topa cato 3 chona cayo 4 tapa 5 caayo 6 xopa 7 caache 8 xoono 9 caa gaa 10 chij 1 1 chijbitobi 12 chijbitopa chijbicato 13 chijno chijbichona ment. For example, in several cases the roots and the prefixes modify each other. 3. Limitations of Spanish orthography to account for the sounds in the Zapotec lan- guage (particularly tones) (Whitecotton 1982: 291-294). When the number of internal differences in the Cordova andTemascalapa calendars are quantified, the latter shows greater variability. Table 3.13 summarizes the results from Tables 3.9 and 3.10 by summing up the number of variations in the roots and prefixes for each day. It cannot be argued that dialectical differences be- tween the Zapotec languages spoken in the central valleys and in the mountains to the north account for the differences. Although several of the prefixes in both sets of day names are not the same, that is not the case with the roots. Perhaps the fact that the Temascalapa calendar was written approximately 100 years after Cordova s can explain the discrepancies. By then, the divinatory practices and the learning of the skills had to be conducted in utmost secrecy. The lack of an open tradition for learning the esoteric matters of the sacred count might have led to cumulative changes, especially in the sequences of the roots and that of the prefixes. No doubt, however, simple in- consistencies dictated by orthographic limitations do account for the greater variation in the Temascalapa calendar. As noted by Joseph Whitecotton, "Zapotec [written in the Roman script] probably displays greater orthographic variability than does Spanish" (1982: 294). Seler s thinking about the significance of the pre- fixes was ambiguous. In the previous quote, he first implied that they are somehow related to numbers but then stated that they are basically meaningless. Never- theless, he proposed translations for them, a task that was also done by Cruz (Table 3.14). Caso commented, For example, particles are used with the day sign and number, and these particles, of which 95</page><page sequence="113">Table 3.9 Cordova (top) and Temascalapa (bottom) Sacred Counts Arranged as Veintenas.

(Caso 1965b: 945) Because some of the 99 calendars from the Villa Alta region include the cardinal numbers, which are given in arabic graphs either before or after the day names, Alcina Franch considered the prefixes to have fundamentally a numerical character. The arabic nu- merals simply reinforce information already encoded in the sequence of the day names (Alcina Franch 1966: 124). Whittaker (1983: 128) considered the possibility that the prefixes refer to an archaic numeration system, arguing that there are 9 prefixes in the day names on Cordova's calendar and not 13, linking the inflections to the 9 Lords of the Night. In other words he elimi- nates the repetitions, failing to recognize that, despite the variations and the multiple occurrences of a given form, the prefixes recur consistently each 13 days. Ap- parently based on the known occurrence of special and esoteric terms for the cardinal numbers in the Mixtec calendar (Smith 1973a: 26),Whitecotton considers that the prefixes must correspond to a number, stating, 96</page><page sequence="114">veintena 9 veintena 10 veintena 11 veintena 12 veintena 13 Variants Pechijlla Pinochijlla Quachijlla Pecechijlla Nichilla chijlla [8] chilla [5] Piliaa Quiciguij Pillaa Quiaguij (18) Laa laa [8] guij [3] lao [1] nij [1] Pillaala Quiaguela (15) Nelala Pelaala Peolaala laala [9] la [2] lala [1] guela [1] Nalache Pelachi Qualachi Pillache Pillachi lachi [6] lache [4] chi [1] quichi [1] gueche [1] Pecee Peozij Pillazee Calacij Calazije zee-cee-ze [6] cij-ci-zij-zi [5] zije [1] guij [1] Pillalana Calalana Nalaana Pelana Pinolana lana [9] laana [3] lannaafl] Pillachina Pechina Pino chijna Qualachina Pecehijna china [11] chijna [2] Calalaba Qualapa Pecelaba Pillalapa Quielapa (20) lapa [10] laba [3] Pinipueca Pinique^a Quiani^a (17) Caleque^a Pelaque^a que^a [9] nifa [4] Quiatel la (14) Netel la Petel la Coatela Calatel la tela [13] Peolaa Pel loo Peoloo Pillalo Pel loo loo [11] lo [1] laa [1] Peolapija Pillapija Calapija Calapija Pelapija pija [12] cuija [1] Calaa Nel laa Pel laa Pinij Pillaa laa [10] guij [2] nij [1] Pelaache Peceeche Qualache Pinieche Pillaache lache [6] laache [4] eche [2] gueche [1] Qualannaa Pecennaa Pillana Quia quinaa (19) Pinonaa nnaa [7] na [4] naa [1] quinaa [1] Pillaloo Quiaguilloo (16) Neloo Peoloo Peloo loo [12] lao [1] Nixoo Pexoo Pelaxoo Peolaxoo Pillaxoo xoo [13] Peloppa Pelopa Pillopa Calopa Loppa lopa-loppa [10] opa-goppa [3] Lappe Lappe Lappe Pelappe Pinappe lape-lappe [10] ape-gappe-appe [3] Pinoloo Pel loo Pinoloo Pillalao Quiciloo loo [10] lao [3] veintena 9 veintena 10 veintena 11 veintena 12 veintena 13 Variants Yogchila Benechijla Cuachila Queuchila Bilachij chijla [6] chila [5] chilaa [1] chij [1] Cualaa Quicee Bilaa Yaguee (18) Yalana laa [7] la [1] labaa [1] lana [1] cee [1] guee [1] Bilala Yagquilao (15) Lala Yeolala Yoolala lala [9] lao [2] la [2] chij [1] Lachij Yolachij Yoolachuj Yeolachij Bilachij lachij [8] lachi [1] lachuj [1] laoo [1] chij [1] guechi [1] Yolocce Yolocee Quecce Lacce Lacce ce [5] cce [4] cee [3] guee [1] Bijlana Yalana Yalana Yalana Benelana lana [13] Lachina Yoochina Benechina Cuachina Quecchina china [8] chijna [3] cchina [1] nina [1] Benelaba Cualaba Queuela Bilalaba Yaglaba (20) laba [11] labaa [1] la [1] Yezagniza Bilagniza Yagniza (17) Lagniza Yologniza niza [13] Yagtela (14) Yatela Yotela Yatela Yotela tela [13] Yoolao Yoolao Yeolao Bilalao Nalao lao [10] laho [1] laa [1] lana [1] Yolobia Bilobia Lobia Lobia Yolobia bia [11] biaiz [1] chijyaa [1] Cuala Laa Yolaa Binechij Cualaa laa [7] la [2] lana [1] ce [1] gue [1] chij [1] Yolachij Binechij Cualachij Quiuchi Bilachi lachij [8] lachi [2] quechi [1] chij [1] chi [1] Cualina Quiuna Bilinna Gagnina (19) Iinna lina [8] nina [2] na [2] iinna [1] Bilala Quagnila (16) Laoo Yoolao Yoolao lao [8] laho [2] laoo [1] la [1] nila [1] Xoo Yoxoo Yoloxo Laxoo Bilaxoo xoo [10] xo [3] Yolopa Yolopa Bilopa Lopa Lopa lopa [10] nopa [1] zopa [1] copa [1] Pilagpag Lapag Lapag Yoolapag Binepag lapag [9] lagpag [1] cepag [1] hepag [1] nepag [1] Nalao Yolao Binela Cualao Quecelao lao [10] laa [1] lahaho [1] la [1] I do not assume that calendrical name pre- fixes are the same in meaning as are normal numbers.They undoubtedly have many com- plex referents . . and at best can only be correlated with normal numbers. (Joseph Whitecotton 1982: 293)10 By comparing the list of prefixes in the Zapotec day names with certain known subdivisions in other calendars, we might see something of the complex referents alluded to by Whitecotton. In Table 3.15 the 10 Whitecotton is of the opinion that Whittaker s argument about the existence of 9 instead of 13 inflections is a "simpli- fication of the Cordova prefixes that is a considerable improve- ment over one attempted by Caso (1965b)" (Whitecotton 1990: 152). Yet, he then continues saying, "While I believe that this scheme [Whittaker s] correcdy shows the relationship between the prefixes and the numbers, the problem is that the orthogra- phies in the manuscripts are such that we cannot predict the numbers from this model alone. The best we can do then is suggest a less specific accounting of them based on their distri- butions" (ibid.). 97</page><page sequence="115">Table 3.10 C6rdova (top) and Temascalapa (bottom) Sacred Counts Arranged Horizontally as Trecenas. 1 Qviachilla Pillaa Pelaala Nelachi Peciguij Quelana Pillachina Nelaba Pelaque^a 2 Quiagueche Palannaa Peoloo Calaxo Pellopa Qualappe Pillalao Nichijlla Peolaa 3 Quiachina Pelapa Peolaque^a Calatella Pelloo Qualapija Pillaa Lache Pelannaa 4 Quialao Pichijlla Peolao Laala Pcolache Qualaze Pillalaana Nichina Peolapa 5 Quiaguij Pelache Pelaana Calaloo Pexoo Qualopa Pillape Neloo Pichijlla 6 Quelana Pechina Pelapa CalequeÂ£a Petella Qualoo Pillapija Nelaa Pillache 7 Quegappe Peoloo Peochijlla Calaa Pelaala Qualaache Pillazi Nelaana Pichina 8 Quicuija Pelaa Pellache Calannaa Pelloo Qualaxoo Pilopa Lape Pelloo 9 Quiacee Palalannaa Peochina Calalopa Pelaque^a Coatella Pillaloo Calapija Qualaa 10 Quiegopaa Peolape Caloo Calachilla Pellaa Qualaala Pillachi Calacij Pillalana 1 1 Quiagoloo Peolapija Peolaa Lache Qualanna Pillalao Nixoo Neloppa Pelape 12 Quiagueche Pazee Peolana Calachina Pelapa Qualanifa Pillatela Neloo Pelapija 13 Quiaxoo Pelopa Peolape Caloo Pechijlla Piliaa Pillaala Nalache Pecee 14 Quiatella Peolaa Peolapija Calaa Pelaache Qualannaa Pillaloo Nixoo Peloppa 15 Quiaguela Pelachi Peozij Calalana Pechina Qualapa Pinique^a Netella Pelloo 16 Quiaguilloo Pexoo Pelopa Lappe Pelloo Quachijlla Pillaa Nelala Qualachi 17 Quianifa Petella Peoloo Calapija Pellaa Qualache Pillana Neloo Pelaxoo 18 Quiaguij Pelaala Pillache Calacij Pelana Qualachina Pillalapa Caleque^a Coatela 19 Quiaquinaa Peoloo Peolaxoo Calopa Pelappe Pillalao Nichilla Laa Peolaala 20 Quielapa Pelaquefa Calatella Pelloo Pelapija Pillaa Pillaache Pinonaa Peloo Quia [15] Pe [9] Peo [11] Cala [9] Pe [15] Qua [10] Pilla [9] Ne [9] Pe [7] Quie [2] Peo [5] Pe [5] Ca [5] Pela [2] Quala [4] Pi [8] Ni [3] Pi [3] Qui [1] Pi [2] Peola [1] Cale [1] Peo [1] Pilla [2] Ni [2] Cala [2] Peo [3] Que [2] Pa [2] Pi [1] Pe [1] Peci [1] Pi [2] Pini [1] Na [1] Pela [3] Pela [1] Cab [1] Ne [1] Qua [1] Coa [1] Cale [1] Qua [2] Pala [1] Ca [1] - [3] Que [1] Pino [1] Pilla [1] - [3] Coa [1] 1 Yagchijla Yolaa Yolala Lachij Yooce Cualana Bilachijna Labaa Yologniza 2 Yagquechi Yoolina Yoolaho Laxoo Yolopa Cualapag Bilahaho Chilaa Yolaa 3 Yagnina Laba Yologniza Calatela Yoolaho Cualabia Bilaa Lachij Bilana 4 Yaglao Yoochila Layola Lala Yolachij Cualace Bilalana Lachina Yolaba 5 Yague Yolachij Yoolina Calao Yooxoo Cualopa Bilapag Bilalao Yochijla 6 Yaglana Yeoochina Yolaba Lagniza Yatela Cualaa Belobia Lala Yolachij 7 Yaghepag Yeolao Quochijla Laa Yolala Cualachi Bilace Yalana Yoochijna 8 Yagchijyaa Yeolana Yeolachi Lina Yaolao Cuaxoo Bilopa Lapag Yoolao 9 Yeagcee Yololana Yoochina Calaba Yologniza Calatela Bilalao Nalobia Yoolaa 10 Yagcopa Yolapag Yeolao Lachijla Yoolaa Cualala Bilachij Guee Yalana 1 1 Quiglao Yolobia Yeolaa Lachij Yoolina Cualao Bilaxoo Lopa Yoolapag 12 Yaguechi Yolacee Yololana Lachina Yolaba Cualagniza Bilatela Nalao Yolabia 13 Yagxoo Yolopa Lapag Calao Yogchila Cualaa Bilala Lachij Yolocce 14 Yagtela Yoolao Yolobia Cuala Yolachij Cualina Bilala Xoo Yolopa 15 Yagquilao Yolachij Yolocee Yalana Yoochina Cualaba Bilagniza Yatela Yoolao 16 Quagnila Yoxoo Yolopa Lapag Yolao Cuachila Bilaa Lala Yoolachij 17 Yagniza Yotela Yeolao Lobia Yolaa Cualachij Bilinna Laoo Yoloxo 18 Yaguee Yeolala Yeolachij Lacee Yalana Cuachina Bilalaba Lagniza Yatela 19 Gagnina Yoolao Laxoo Lopa Yoolapag Cualao Bilachij Yalana Yoolala 20 Yaglaba Yologniza Yotela Nalao Yolobia Cualaa Bilachi Iinna Yoolao Yag [13] Yo [7] Yeo [5] -[6] Yoo [7] Cua [16] Bila [9] -[11] Yoo [8] Ya [3] Yoo [4] Yo [4] La [5] Yo [7] Cuala [2] Bi [9] Ya [3] Yo [5] Yeag [1] Yeo [3] Yoo [3] Ca [3] Ya [2] Cualag [1] Bilag [9] La [2] Yolo [2] Quig [1] Yolo [2] Yolo [3] Cala [1] Yao [1] Cala [1] Belo [1] Lag [1] Ya [2] Quag [1] Yolog [1] Yolog [1] Cua [1] Yolog [1] Na [1] Yola [1] Gag [1] Yola [1] Quo [1] Ya [1] Yog [1] Nalo [1] Yolog [1] Yeoo [1] La [1] Lag [1] Yolo [1] Bila [1] Bila [1] - [1] Layo [1] Lo [1] " [1] Na [1] Numbers in brackets indicate frequency of variation in prefixes;

The list of gods from Sola de Vega was obtained at an ecclesiastical trial that Gonzalo de Balsalobre, priest of San Miguel Sola, conducted against the main local diviner, Diego Luis. Being accused of idolatry, the di- viner (colaniy) made two confessions: one in 1635 and the other in 1654 (Berlin 1957: 12- 15). The list of 13 gods was given on both occasions, but it was only in the latter one that the Zapotec names were stated. The earlier version included only the deities' attribu- tions in Spanish. The lists are similar but not identical. For example, the order of the deities, as well as some of the attributions, varies. Berlin favored the second list because it does not have Catholic referents as does the other (i.e., "Dios Padre" or "Dios del Infierno- Lucifer"). Yet, the second list is not altogether unam- biguous, since, for example, the name of one deity and its attribution is repeated twice (gods 12th and 13th). In only one instance did Diego Luis himself provide a translation for one of the names: Licuicha Niyoa, mean- ing the "Sun God." By studying other prosecution cases the church con- ducted against the inhabitants of Sola for idolatrous practices, Berlin was able to generally confirm the lists provided by Diego Luis. From this confirmation it also became evident that the Sola names of the deities present a number of variants. There may be two rea- sons for this. One must be orthographic inconsistency; the other, cited by Berlin, was the lack of understand- ing on the part of the common people about the spe- cialized and esoteric knowledge of the colaniy. The gap between them was aggravated by the covert na- ture of indigenous religious practices. At the time of Berlin's study, the meaning of most of the Sola Zapotec names was unknown. Most of the terms still remain untranslated, since Cordova's Vocabulario provides only limited hints about their sig- nification. Table 3.16 compares the lists of gods docu- mented by Balsalobre and by Cordova. The series from Cordova is taken from his Vocabulario, where the names do not follow alphabetical subheadings. Several rear- rangements are necessary to make the series compa- rable to the list given by Diego Luis to Balsalobre.

The first observation is that only 12 different deities can be extracted from Cordova's Vocabulario. Of these, seven matches can be made on the basis of the gods' attributions (nos. 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9). Only four matches based on the actual Zapotec names can be established: Coquilao-Coqueelaa, Huichana-Nohuichana, Cocijo-Locio, and Cozaana- Cosana. Of these, one presents an apparent discrep- ancy in meaning. Cozaana in Cordoba's list is described as the "God of Animals, invoked by hunters and fish- ers"; Cosana in Balsalobre's list is described as the "God of the Ancestors, invoked by hunters and fishermen." In the list from Sola de Vega at the second position appears Licuicha Niyoa,"God of Hunters."

Another recognizable term in the list from Sola de Vega is the suffix for 13 (tzino) in the name of the first god.Two names, the 3rd (Coqueelaa) and the 10th (Xonatzi Huilia) have honorific titles that were used to address rulers (Coque,"Lord"; and Xonatzi, "Lady"), but only in the case of the former does the name ap- pear to be calendrical (Lord-Lightning). Several names have the word Liraa or Leraa, but its meaning remains unknown. The rearrangement of Cordova's data was used as a device to clarify the meaning of some of the Zapotec names in the list of gods given by Diego Luis; it does not presume that the list in the central valleys neces- sarily had that sequence. By comparing the two Zapotec series and the Aztec list of 13 gods it is evi- dent that, despite the diverse orders in all of them, there are similarities. For instance, all have a God of Maize or a God of the Underworld (nos. 4 and 5 in Balsalobre's list; nos. 9 and 2 in Cordova's list; nos. 7 and 6 in the Nahuad list). There are also traits unique to each one. For example, an equivalent to the Aztec God of the Sun is not apparent in Cordova's list, and an equivalent to the Zapotec God of the Ancestors from Sola de Vega is not apparent in the Cordova and Nahuatl lists. These differences further exemplify the regional variations that permeated all aspects of the calendar. The preceding analysis also indicates that nothing in the names of deities, or in their attribu- tions, resembles the prefixes of the Zapotec day names. Yet, another comparison can be made, this time with the 13 Volatiles (Table 3.17). The series of volatiles in central Mexico contained sets of similar but clearly differentiated birds, like the hummingbird, the eagle, and the owl. There are, how- ever, no correspondences between the position of such sets and the location of repetitions in the Zapotec list of prefixes (see connecting lines in Table 3.17). The third column in the figure includes some Zapotec terms for the flying creatures of the central Mexican series. Some of these terms contain particles that coincide with the prefixes, suggesting that the inflections in Zapotec day names deal with augural matters dictated by a series Table 3.14 Seler's and Cruz's Translations of Zapotec Day Name Prefixes Seler's translations Cruz's translation (1904b: 37-38) (1935: 66-67) 1 quia Equivalent to Tlaloc as ruler of the four divisions 1 quia stone of the cycle. 2 pe 2 pe denotes verb or action 3 peo 3 peo denotes verb or action 4 cala 4 cala adverb 5 pe 5 pe denotes verb or action 6 qua Prefixes by which people in action and living beings 6 qua denotes idea of order 7 pilla are designated.

However, if this were the case, the se- quence and character of flying creatures in the central Mexican list would be different from that in the list of Zapotec prefixes. But not all the prefixes in the list can be accounted for. In some instances the Zapotec terms suggested by the central Mexican pictographs were found in Cordova s Vocabulario , but the words do not resemble or contain particles similar to the prefixes (for example "hawk," halcon, piguinicoce [213]). Despite the partial results, and taking into account expected regional variations, the comparison in Table 3.17 suggests the possibility that the Zapotec prefixes are analogous and served fundamentally the same pur- poses as the 13 Volatiles in the calendars from the cen- tral highlands.11 Why they were retained in the calendrical names of individuals and how far back the practice prevailed is unknown. In conclusion, Seler's linguistic interpretation of the Zapotec day names is essentially correct. What- ever the meaning of the prefixes, it is clear that Seler was right in setting them apart. They represent a dif- ferent problem to some extent independent of the meaning of the day names.12 Glyphic Discrepancies in the Proposed Zapotec Day Lists In the review of calendrical models, it remains nec- essary to evaluate the different glyphic day lists that have been advanced (Fig. 3.4). To do so, several crite- ria are used: (1) accuracy of glyphic reproductions, (2) incorporation of inadequate data, (3) omission of avail- able data, (4) disregard of chronological control, and (5) consideration of the properties of the calendar. The partial lists of Leon (1901) and Seler (1904a, 1904c) are not included in the discussion. Casos at- tempt, although partial too, is considered because he is the only author who has proposed a comprehensive classification of calendrical glyphs. So even though most of the signs are not correlated in his list, the glyphic categories are already defined. Accuracy of Glyphic Reproductions The lists by Caso and Leigh are the only ones based on original epigraphic materials, and the drawings - particularly those in Leigh - are reasonably accurate. The glyphic reproductions in the other lists are either photocopies of Caso's published materials (Whittaker), renderings redrawn from Caso (Marcus), inaccurate drawings based also on Casos publications (Macias), or renderings of "ideal types" (Edmonson). Incorporation of Inadequate Data Except for Caso s and Marcuss, a common mistake of the lists is the inclusion of glyphic examples that are noncalendrical.13 Table 3.18 presents the number of such inclusions in each list. In Leighs and Whittaker s lists, only two day positions are defined exclusively by noncalendrical glyphs. The incorporation of other noncalendrical glyphs in their lists does not aggravate the matter because they were taken as alternative vari- ants of calendrical signs. Omission of Available Evidence Except for Whittaker, the other authors do not dis- pute the validity of Caso s glyphic categories. Caso was the only scholar who actually conducted archaeo- logical excavations to recover epigraphic data pertain- ing to several periods. His glyphic classification, there- fore, is more comprehensive than Whittaker s - which includes only early materials - and will serve as a yard- 11 Two parallel passages in the Dresden (16c- 17c, 17b) and Madrid (94c- 95c) codices show the picture of a woman ac- companied by pictographs of different birds, including a vul- ture, turkey, quetzal, macaw, eagle, owl, and a flying creature identified by Mayanists as the muan bird (Villacorta and Villacorta 1930; Kelley 1976: 1 12-1 13, fig. 39). These birds are the same as those forming the Nahuad series, suggesting that the passages in the Maya codices deal with augural matters apparendy re- lated to the treatment of certain illnesses. 12 Joseph Whitecotton (1982:292) has stressed that, in the case of the study of colonial documents, the prefixes cannot be ignored. In many instances, names of individuals - which in- clude the prefixes - are not accompanied by the terms desig- nating the numbers, so prefixes are crucial for determining to which of several possible day names the appellatives correspond. 13 See Figures 2.18, 2.23, 2.28, and 2.34 to derive the particu- lar examples of noncalendrical signs included in the glyphic day lists of Macias, Leigh, Whittaker, and Edmonson. 103</page><page sequence="121">1 o &lt; &lt; O fTl Q fTl &gt; gj Â§ w p w uu 5 0 0 g 2 o 1 2 c/) 9 3 o 5 Â§ 2 g eJ a h eJ h 3h K H H LO ^ CO a 3 "55 Â§ 1 H&gt; *a ^ ^ 2 ^ .9 "S ^ S /^?'S "2 d ^ ^ Q w h)D,g w 0) NOVwD^Drt'^.HOyDu â 5 fi-S o-S Â°-S2c^^^-S-S 0 OOOOOOOOOOOOO m '"d'"0*^*T3rT3'"0T3'"0'"0'"d'"0*^*^ OOOOOOOOOOOOO h OOOOOOOOOOOOO O V / V - / â¢&gt; - / V - / V / N / V / V / V / X / V / V / V / m *3 Z al w to Â« 3 3 ,2 â¢Â§ Â§ S w to 3 ,2 ^ u S *8 3 3 3 -o 3 o Â§ Â£ â¢Â§* s w "5 'S '3 ^ m w "3 p o_, u u .Sj &lt;o r&gt; 3 ^ &amp; m w cs "3 o &lt;o s Â« r&gt; ^^'S'o'3^ 3 ^ &amp; cs o Â© 3 1Â« J' s ^ "S s .2 Â« 33Â§J^S3sn|^3 ^^'S'o'3^ Â© 3 J' s ^ Z $HOHH!&lt;(JHO'hohu r-Hcgco^mvor^oooNO^cvico T- I T- I ^~H T~H IT &lt;D â¢fl O 2 ~ -S f -5~S~ I ?lg 2| ft 8 &lt;* Ml l-il&lt;3 3 Â«&gt; "C" i -a^S^.cf^gl^ co a&gt;Sp^D&lt;-Mfe.53W)&lt;^-'a&gt;^^ N â¢SEÂ£S-SÂ°3Q;JÂ°-522 1 â W) rTd'i3'T3T3T3'T3'T3T3'T3'T3T3'T3T3 fl Â£ OOOOOOOOOOOOO Â§ y ^ V OOOOOOOOOOOOO v ' &gt;&gt; ' &gt; ' -w' V-' v ' N ' v / v / V / V y V v ' &gt;&gt; ' &gt; ' -w' V-' v ' N ' v / v / V / V / &lt;a T3 M CO ^ "S s Â« *2 "S -i z s SB E * Â« I so '3 z J SB Hi _ E ^ jj | fl 1| 8 I S I -Â§ _ 'B 2 &amp; 3 i-l 1-3 Â§&lt;Â§ O 1 1 Â§ i-e i i Â§ a u S .ta .y O o Â« )Zi- 5 Â« 5 O 5 n u i- Â« )Zi- Â« )Z]h- iXCJi- n u li- I T-HCNm^-Lnvor^oooNOT-HCNcn T-t T- I T- t T- I 4&gt; lis 0.

As mentioned in Chapter 2, by 1967 Caso had defined 32 glyphic categories. Table 3.19 quantifies only the most con- spicuous omissions in the other lists. Such omissions refer to categories that are made up of several well- identified signs and do not include groupings that were defined on the basis of single or dubious glyphs. Al- though using a different classificatory scheme, Whittaker is the only author who included in his list all the early calendrical glyphs defined by Caso.14 Disregard of Chronological Differences By 1947 detailed chronological control was not possible for all the existing epigraphic material, but, subsequendy, a general outline could be extracted from field reports of the Monte Alban excavations. Except for Whittaker's list, which as mentioned before deals exclusively with early materials, the other lists disre- gard the time dimension entirely. Consideration of Properties of the Mesoamerican Calendar This is, ultimately, the best criterion to evaluate the proposed glyphic day lists. The efforts of Macias, Leigh, and Marcus can be disregarded because they ignore the patterned position of the year bearers in the list. Irrespective of what the annual markers are, they have to be spaced five positions apart from each other. If the positions of the bearers that Macias him- self proposed are plotted in his list, the glyphs that named the years end up occupying the 1st position (glyph J), the 6th position (glyph M), the 7th position (glyph G), and the 16th position (glyph E). Although Leigh never discussed the year bearers, their position can be reconstructed by using Caso s and Whittaker's sets as a comparing device (Table 3.20). The differ- ences appear greater when Caso's set of year bearers is used, but in neither instance does the placement of the annual markers follow the required pattern. It can now be seen why Caso justifiably ignored the glyphic 14 Whittaker's classification (n.d.: 198-227), however, is an awkward device that pulled together in a single group early calendrical and noncalendrical glyphs. He then designated them with a continuous numerical sequence (numbers 1 to 957) but spaced the glyphs three, five, or six positions each so that gaps in the sequence eventually could be filled in by new discoveries. 108</page><page sequence="126">Table 3.19 Omission of Epigraphic Data in the Various Zapotec Glyphic Day Lists Macias Leigh Edmonson Marcus (n.d.b) (1958b) (1988) (1992) D A C C F C D M N P L N N N Q Q N S Y P Table 3.20 Caso's and Whittaker's Year Bearers Plotted in Leigh's Zapotec Glyphic Day List Leigh's Leigh's Caso correlation Whittaker correlation (1928) (1958b) (n.d.)

As in the case of Leigh, Marcus did not conduct a formal analysis of the year bearers; instead, she fol- lowed Caso, albeit partially, by recognizing that at least at one time the annual markers occupied the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions. Marcus, however, has also argued that the Zapotec year bearers changed through time (1992: 131, caption to fig. 4.25). In the glyphic list that can be reconstituted from her most extensive treatment of Zapotec calendrical signs (1992: 127-132), three of Caso s year bearers are placed in the 2nd and 8th positions (glyph E), in the 7th position (glyph G), and in the 20th position (glyph N). Not only do the positions 2-8-7-20 breach the required pattern, but a sign that was never considered a year bearer by Caso (glyph L), occupies, in Marcus's list, the position of an annual marker (the 17th place). The other two day lists, those of Whittaker and Edmonson, do recognize the patterned position of the bearers, although they disagree on the set of annual markers. Edmonson's set (II) is the one proposed by Caso. The only difference between the two authors deals with one of the bearers. Edmonson substitutes glyph M' for glyph N. He does not, however, present empirical evidence in support of this change. There- fore, the two contending models are basically those of Caso and Whittaker. 109</page><page sequence="127">Unity and Variability of the Mesoamerican Calendar Mesoamerica presents us with the paradox of vari- ability within unity. The reviewed ethnohistoric and ethnographic accounts concerning native time keep- ing clearly show that the diversity of the calendrical systems cannot be overlooked, yet it is also necessary to recognize their similarities. At a given level of analy- sis, the emphasis on "not one but many calendars" (Marcus 1992: 95-142) has led to much confusion in reconstruction of the calendrical system used by Zapotecs in Pre-Hispanic times.The opposite extreme position of trying to find a single "acceptable Mesoamerican pattern" (Whittaker 1983: 108) oblit- erates variability and forces data into preconceived schemes. What I intend to do in the next chapter is to focus on the commonalities of the Mesoamerican cal- endar to clarify the discrepancies between Caso's and Whittaker's models and to detect some of the features that made Zapotec time reckoning unique. IIO</page><page sequence="128">CHAPTER 4 Analysis of Calendrical Glyphs Introduction Now that the calendrical interpretations of various authors have been reviewed, the problem to be dealt with in this chapter resolves into two parts: (1) recon- ciling Caso s model, which posits type II year bearers (2-7-12-17), andWhittaker's model, which posits type III year bearers (3-8-13-18), and (2) once this discrep- ancy is resolved, establishing the four important posi- tions of the year bearers in the day list and recon- structing the rest of the glyphic day list. In doing so, Cordova s Zapotec day names discussed in the previ- ous chapter will be used. Because the study of colo- nial documents written in Zapotec - but using the Eu- ropean script - has not yielded clues that would en- able corroboration of Seler s proposed meanings (Whitecotton 1982, 1990), a concomitant goal here is to translate Cordova's day names by using epigraphic guidelines. Reconstruction of the glyphic day list will take into account all the currently available evidence and will rely on glyphic reproductions derived from the original inscriptions. Because the time dimension is also considered, the result should be a "type" list as well as a series of day lists pertaining to different peri- ods. Since the pioneering work of Alfonso Caso in 1928, the epigraphic evidence has quadrupled. The present sample allows a better understanding of the variabil- ity in representation of calendrical glyphs and a more accurate definition of their constituent attributes. These advantages have made necessary some modifi- cations to Caso s classification, which made use of let- ters in the roman alphabet to designate the day glyphs. This classificatory scheme made sense initially because 26 letters were available to designate 20 main signs. The documentation of more than 26 different glyphs by 1947 forced Caso to introduce a complementary system, based on roman numerals. To avoid confusion with the upper-case letters I and V, the numbers I and V were skipped, but for some unclear reason Caso began the series with number IV. Because most subsequent scholars have followed the alphabetical designations, the first system of classifi- cation is retained here. The complementary system, however, can lead to confusion because roman nu- merals are also used to designate the phases in the rela- tive chronology of Monte Alban. Therefore, in this study, I designate the new glyphs that go beyond letter Z with letters of the Greek alphabet. Given that carved stones cannot be dated direcdy, the chronological charts presented in this chapter should be taken as rough ap- proximations. The bottom to top arrangement of the glyphs is intended to reflect their relative sequence in time. This seriation and its anchorage to a time scale are based first on archaeological associations (glyphs placed to the left in each chart), and then, in the case of unprovenienced examples, by resemblances in icono- graphic conventions (glyphs to the right of the former). The inscriptional sources of glyphic data in the chro- nological charts appear in Appendix 1 . The Year Glyph and Year Bearers in Zapotec Writing The Year Glyph To clarify the discrepancies between Caso and Whittaker, it is necessary first to discuss the iconogra- phy of the year glyph. The sign was always interpreted by Caso (1928: 45-47; 1947: 11; 1969: 85) as the rep- resentation of Cociyo, the Zapotec god of lightning and rain (Fig. 4.1). The attributes of the glyph include hi</page><page sequence="129">Fig. 4.1 The Zapotec year glyph and its attributes according to Caso (1928). an eye with a suborbital plaque (a) and a mandible of a serpent with teeth (b), which sometimes shows a bifid tongue (c). Above the nose is a rounded cartou- che inset with a cruciform element (d).The cartou- che is in turn topped by a trapezoid (e). Caso argued that the last two elements (d, e) re- semble the turquoise nose plugs in Mexican picto- graphic conventions (Fig. 4.2). Although the compari- son involves two different linguistic families, the homonymity in the Nahuatl language between "tur- quoise" and "sun" (two of three alternative meanings for the word xiuh) was the reason for considering ele- ments d and e as the main attributes of the Zapotec solar year glyph. In his opinion, these two elements acquired prominence only through time, that is, as the sign underwent stylistic changes. Caso (1928: 45) also stated that the year glyph sometimes did not appear accompanied by a year bearer, although it always oc- curred with coefficients. From the list of year glyphs compiled in 1928, it is evident that he recognized two main versions: profile and frontal views (Fig. 4.3). Later, as more examples of the year glyph became available, Caso (1947: 1 1, 28-29) came to view the glyph as representing the headdress of Cociyo and noted three other consistent attributes of the sign (Fig. 4.4): a scroll adjacent to either side of the trapezoidal element (f), a horizontal band (g), and a vertical stripe at the extreme right (h).The stylistic evolution of the year glyph, as de- duced from Caso's works, is shown in Figure 4.5. Whittaker (n.d.: 29) correctly pointed out that what Caso identified as the representation of Cociyo in the Monte Alban Ilia versions of the year glyph is actually one of the bearers. This correction immedi- ately solves the awkward problem of having a year glyph that has coefficients but is not accompanied by a sign specifying the year's name. To Whittaker (n.d.: 26, 29), however, the main diagnostic of the year glyph is the headband, that is, elements "g" and "h," stating that the cruciform element "d" did not become es- sential until a later stage in the evolution of the script. Yet it is evident from his own illustrations of Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II year glyphs that trait "d" is a constituent element from the earliest known rep- resentations (Fig. 4.6). 112 w- - Â® trapezoid I ^ (0) â  d cruciform element ( V--^ 'l-JJ * a eye with suborbital plaque ^ - â¢*--* ^r'D j * b mandible of serpent with teeth Profile a eye with suborbital plaque 4^ J â¢ b mandible of serpent with teeth - c bifid tongue Frontal</page><page sequence="130">Despite the ambiguous definition of its parts, Caso (1947: 58-59; 1962: 69) eventually considered two of them (traits g and h) as the pictograph of a headdress. Jansen and Winter (1980: 7, fig. 5) have also advocated this interpretation, and Whittaker (n.d.: 26) followed as well. Based on Maya and Mexican usages in the representation of headbands, Stuart (n.d.) has argued that the Zapotec year glyph was a logogram intended to mean "ruler [referring to the bearer] of the year." In Caso s list of year signs (see Fig. 4.3), six include a stripe that projects from the trapezoidal element.The stripe usually ends in a circular ornament and two small tips. In summary then, a composite year glyph would consist of six elements (d, e, f, g, h, and i). Conse- quently, a type annual sign can be rendered as in Fig- ure 4.7. Considering this configuration, Caso s list of year glyphs requires only slight corrections, because the examples designated with numbers V and VI do not include the sign. The Year Bearers Having clarified the component attributes of the year glyph and that it is the pictographic representa- tion of a particular kind of headdress, I can proceed now with a review of Caso s and Whittaker s identifi- cations of the year bearers. In 1928 Caso identified four bearers he designated with letters E, G, M, and N (Fig. 4.8). According to him, the annual markers cor- respond to set II, that is, they occupy the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions in the day list. However, even in his last published contribution on the subject, he could correlate only glyph G to the 7th position and glyph M to the 2nd one (Caso 1965b: 933). Whittaker, on the other hand, identified nine dif- ferent glyphs as year markers (Fig. 4.9). He thought they resulted from changes through time in the repre- sentation of the four bearers that are expected, given the structural properties of the Mesoamerican calen- dar. He also proposed that the Zapotec bearers corre- spond to type III, that is, they occupy the 3rd, 8th, 13th, and 18th positions in the day list. Aside from being differently grouped, Whittaker s table includes only Caso s bearers M (named Quij) and E and G (both named Lapa). Concomitantly, the iconographic inter- pretations of Whittaker are different. Fig. 4.2 Nose plugs in Nahua iconography. Despite Whittaker s having clarified Caso s ambigu- ities about some of the constituent elements of the year sign, and having stated that "the bearers are placed below the year glyph" (Whittaker n.d.: 29; 1981: 5), his identification of annual markers is inconsistent. To begin with, Caso's bearer N is not illustrated in Whittaker s chart, a curious omission considering that three clear examples were available as early as 1965 (Rickards 1918: fig. 24; Caso 1928: 182; 1965a: 858, fig. 19; Gamio 1963: 11-13). The fact that Whittaker was not unaware of glyph N as a regular day glyph is demonstrated by his reconstruction of the glyphic day 113</page><page sequence="131">Fig. 4.3 Zapotec year glyphs (profile and frontal versions) identified by Caso (1928: 46, fig. 21). list, where the sign is correlated to the 10th position (Fig. 4.10). 1 To clarify the role of glyph N, it is useful first to isolate its constituent elements, which include a U- shaped base, a trifinial element, and twisted append- ages decorated with inner marks (Fig. 4.11). Consid- ering this constellation of attributes, 12 glyphs can be grouped as examples of bearer N. These document a sequence of some 1000 years, beginning as early as Monte Alban II (Fig. 4.12). Although there are unat- tested gaps in the sequence, the available examples show a certain degree of iconographic conservatism. Whittaker's glyph Quela for epoch II is being classed here as an early version of glyph N (no. 2). 2 1 Whittaker's chart is an attempt to reconstruct the day list of Monte Alban I and II. However, as noted by him, the glyphs in the 5th, 7th, and 10th positions were taken from the Monte Alban Ilia corpus. The example of glyph N in Whittaker's chart comes specifically from stone MA-SP-7a. 2 In Figure 4.12, glyph no. 2 has been reconstructed on the basis of Villagra's rendering (Caso 1947: 84, fig. 50B). Unfortu- nately, the glyph has already broken off from stone MA-J-105, and the piece containing it is lost. Therefore, it was not pos- sible to check the original source or to assess the reliability of Villagra's drawing. Although not included in his chart of year bearers, Whittaker classified glyph no. 1 in Figure 4.12 as a variant of his bearer Quij (n.d.: 202, no. 237). 114 Profile view Frontal view HL 221 oÂ® ftf? 157 "Sâ¢ Iff XX Fig. 21. - Jeroglifico zapoteco del ano: I y Hf Estela 1; III, Es-i tela '3; IV, Estela 15; V, Dintel 1 de Xoxo; VI, Estela 8; VII,' La- pida del Cerro de la Buena Vista; VIII, Estela 3; IX, Estela 2- X Dintel de Cuilapan; XI y XIII, Estela 6; XII, Estela 5; XIV, Este- la 9; XV, Estela 10; XVI, LApida 7 del Mus. de Oax.; XVII, Estela 15; XVIII, Estela 12: XIX, Lfipida 1 del Mus.

Although glyph M was included by both authors, Whittaker disagreed with Caso's iconographic inter- pretation. Instead of representing Cociyo, Whittaker argued (n.d.: 33) - based on Nahuatl mythology - that the iconography of the bearer Quij could be related to cipactonal "Sign of the Dragon," in turn a variant of Itztlacoliuhqui, the Aztec patron of the 13th day (Acatl). Again, by isolating its constituent elements, the con- figuration of glyph M can be clarified (Fig. 4.13). Sev- enteen examples of glyph M as a bearer have been documented to date. These range in time throughout more than 1000 years, from Monte Alban I to Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.14). Four of the examples corre- sponding to period Illb occur under frontal (or un- folded) versions of the year glyph (nos. 12, 13, 16 and 1?). Of the remaining seven bearers in Whittaker s chart, three never appear below or directly associated to a year glyph in the present corpus ( Copa for epochs II and III, Quela for epoch III). The glyph for Copa in epoch I occurs below a year glyph in MA-M-21, but it is an eroded glyph E. This sign was interpreted as such by Caso (1947: 11) and independently corrobo- rated by Justeson as a cruciform glyph (1986: 444, fig. 4a-2) (Fig. 4.15). The present evidence of glyph E as a standard bearer includes 20 examples, which also docu- 115</page><page sequence="133">Fig. 4.5 Stylistic evolution of the Zapotec year glyph as deduced from Caso (1928, 1947, 1967a, 1969). Fig. 4.6 Examples of the early Zapotec year glyph according to Whittaker (n.d.: 205). ment a continuous sequence of more than 1000 years (Fig. 4. 16). Two of the examples pertaining to period IHb appear under unfolded versions of the year glyph (nos. 10 and 15). Because of its specific function as a bearer, the preceding figure makes it clear that the glyph, although quite uniform in its overall form, has several variants (Fig. 4.17). As in the case of his Quij bearer (see Fig. 4.9), Whittaker considered the possibility that the image of the patron god of a day could substitute for the com- monly expected sign. Hence, with regard to the bearer Quela , the pictograph of a jaguar would have been homologous to the glyph "House" because, in Nahua mythology, that day "was under the patronage of Tepeyollotl, the Jaguar God of the Underworld" (Whittaker n.d.: 34). Yet, of all the year glyphs cur- rently known, none includes a jaguar glyph as bearer. By analyzing the example presented by Whittaker, it becomes evident that the band over the animal head lacks three of the diagnostic attributes of the year glyph, namely, the cruciform circle (Fig. 4.18, element d), the trapezoid (element e), and the scroll (element f). Con- sequently, the pictograph of a jaguar cannot be taken as a bearer.3 Whittaker resorted to further analogies with Nahuatl mythology to accommodate his glyph Quela from ep- och II (see Fig. 4.9). The sign was accounted for in terms of" Tepeyollotl being a variant of Tezcatlipoca (The Smoking Mirror)" (n.d.: 34). Yet, as mentioned previ- ously, the glyph Quela from epoch II is actually an example of bearer N. The Quela sign from epoch III in Whittaker's chart is a compound that contains, in addition to other signs, a house or temple in cross sec- tion. Although the pictograph of a house or temple has been documented - infrequently and in late in- scriptions - as a sign accompanied by coefficients, it has not been attested so far below a Zapotec year glyph. As a bearer in Oaxaca, the pictograph of a house or a temple occurs exclusively in association with the in- terlaced year glyph characteristic of the much later Mixtec script (Fig. 4.19). Further discrepancies between Caso and Whittaker 3 John Justeson and Terrence Kaufman (personal communi- cation, 1995) suggest that the animal shown in Whittaker's Quela glyph is actually a bat.

Caso interpreted it as the pictograph of a deer (glyph G). Whittaker argues that it represents a rabbit. According to him, "the distinguishing feature of the rabbit in Mesoamerican iconography is fre- quently its broad-edged teeth where the deer has pointed teeth" (Whittaker n.d.: 33). Because both ani- mals are shown with hanging tongues, Whittaker (1983: 105) further states that the best diagnostic to distin- guish them is the antlers of the deer. Since Seler s study of the representation of animals in the Mexican (and Mixtec) day signs, it was deter- mined that rabbits are generally characterized by long ears, round eyes, and two upper incisors (1923: 521) (Fig. 4.20A). Deer are represented with or without ant- lers, with long heads, and long narrow slit eyes. A few examples include upper teeth as well (ibid.: 541) (Fig. 4.20B). Seler did not comment on the tongues in these representations, but 10 of the 20 deer illustrated in the figure have a tongue hanging frontally or laterally (Fig. 4.20, nos. 269-271, 275, 277, 283-285, 287, and 288). Only 3 of the 16 rabbits have a small tongue sticking frontally (Fig. 4.20, nos. 202b, 203a, and 216). Equally evident from Seler s charts is that sometimes the upper teeth of rabbits are pointed and that deer are repre- sented with lower (squared or pointed) teeth as well. In the Mixtec codices (Bodley, Selden, Nuttall, Vindobonensis), representations of rabbits and deer do not always display mutually exclusive attributes, but the distinctions are easier to make because of colors. Rabbits are frequently painted white with black stripes, and deer are usually yellow or brown. In none of these 117</page><page sequence="135">codices is the rabbit shown with a hanging tongue. In epigraphic materials from Oaxaca, representations of deer have several variants (Fig. 4.21 A): (1) without antlers and without hanging tongue [no. 1]; (2) with- out anders and with a hanging tongue [nos. 2-5, 7- 17]; (3) with antlers and with a hanging tongue [nos. 18-27]; (4) with antlers and without a hanging tongue [nos. 28-32]; and (5) full-bodied [no. 33]. Although Seler considered that variance in the representation of antlers was due to the depiction of two different spe- cies, it might as well reflect sex or different stages in the ontogeny of the animal. Of the 32 examples pre- sented in Figure 4.21A, 25 (78%) show a hanging tongue, a trait that according to Caso denotes that the deer is dead, that is, it has been hunted (1928: 34) .4 On the other hand, rabbits in Zapotec epigraphy are sometimes shown with upper squared teeth and, of the known examples, none has a hanging tongue (Fig. 4.21B). In contrast to the representations of deer, rabbits usually appear full-bodied. In most instances, the posture is as if the animals were seated or walking on their hind legs. Furthermore, none of the calendrical glyphs that are pictographs of rabbits in the Zapotec corpus has appeared as a year bearer, that is, associated with the year glyph. Given these differences, Whittaker's glyph Lapa for epoch III cannot be a rabbit. The Lapa year bearer for epoch II in Whittaker's scheme (which corresponds to Casos glyph E; see Figs. 4.8 and 4.9) is supposed to be a substitute for the pre- sumed rabbit glyph. The justification for this proposi- tion rested on two arguments: one iconographic and the other linguistic (Whittaker n.d.: 30). The first was Fig. 4.9 The Zapotec year bearers and their iconographic interpretation by Whittaker (n.d.: 27; 1992: 19). 4 The hunting of deer today in remote areas of Oaxaca is still imbued with much esoteric lore (Ron Van Meer, personal com- munication, 1988). quIj copa quela lapa PERIOD (ACATL) (TEC PAT L) (CALLI) (TOCHTLI) 1 (jiÂ§ij) ((Jj) UNATTESTED Â© n @ iy ^ t 1.

Whittaker argued that there is a resemblance between the Zapotec glyph "of a cartouche with crossed bands" (glyph E) and the sign that in Maya script designates the 8th day Lamat (Fig. 4.22). Lamat corresponds to the 8th day in the Nahuatl calendar, and the day is named Tochtli (Rabbit), thus the pro- posed correspondence between the "cartouche with crossed bands" and Rabbit. The second argument is the phonetic resemblance, originally proposed by Seler (1904b: 44), between the Maya word lamat and the Zapotec lapa.5 Having already clarified that glyph G is the pictograph of a deer and not a rabbit, these ar- guments become invalid too. To further demonstrate the point, Figure 4.23 presents the 12 known examples of glyph G as a bearer. Its occurrence has been at- tested so far from period Ilia to late Illb, a sequence spanning only about 500 years. Early examples of glyph G as bearer have not yet been attested. A careful examination of Whittaker's analytical pro- cedures will clarify the origin of his scheme. His iden- tification of the year glyphs rests solely on a single inscription from one of the reliefs (surface a) on the slab that sealed tomb 104 at Monte Alban (MA-TR/ 20-t/104-l) (Fig. 4.24). The pictographic representa- tions of a house (A3) and a flint knife (B2) appear there. Because similar signs were used as bearers in later calendrical systems, Whittaker assumed that those in the relief were annual dates. He further deduced that the glyphs in B3 and C3 should correspond to the glyphs "Rabbit" and "Reed." Yet, none of these four signs appears under a year glyph, and those in A3 and B2 are not accompanied by numerals. Neverthe- less, Whittaker attributed to them the function of year bearers and assigned the nonexistent coefficients of 7 and 8 to two of the signs, claiming that the inscription records four consecutive solar years. In the process, he ignored the glyph in B4, which is a compound that has, above, a year sign, and below, a human head in profile accompanied by the coefficient 1 1 (two bars and a dot). Another important sign that was excluded from the analysis is the G (Deer) bearer that appears on the other large carved surface of this same mono- lith (surface c).That there is no disagreement about what this particular glyph represents is demonstrated by Whittaker s day list, where the sign is interpreted as a deer and correlated to the 7th position (Fig. 4.25). It should be noted that the slab from tomb 104 was excavated by Caso, who, in his commentary to the inscription, also ignored the representation of the old toothless face as the bearer, despite recognizing the 5 A detailed discussion of the possible borrowing of Zapotec lapa into Mayan languages appears in Justeson et al.

Caso proposed that the sign 9E above the year glyph was the annual date (Caso 1938: 78). This identification seemed necessary because the calendrical structure predicts only four different signs associated with the year glyph. A fifth one would have invalidated the interpretation of the year glyph itself, something that in turn would have been at odds with the overwhelming evidence in its favor. Yet, it is un- deniable that, by its context, the human head is acting in this case as a bearer. To clarify the significance of this peculiar example, it is necessary to present further pertinent materials. Two Relatively Unknown Inscriptions from Monte Alban Between 1937 and 1939, during the seventh and eighth field seasons of archaeological explorations at Monte Alban, Alfonso Caso and Daniel Rubin de la Borbolla conducted excavations in an architectural complex located on the southern sector of the site (terrace 1458) (Fig. 4.26). The explored buildings most probably functioned as the administrative locus for one of the 15 subdivisions into which the ancient urban center appears to have been organized during its later history (Blanton 1978: 66-93). The subdivision in ques- tion is the only one within the site that has a physical demarcation, being surrounded by double walls ap- parently built during Monte Alban Illb (ibid.: 75-76). Compared with the other subdivisions, it was also one of the most important sectors when the city reached its apogee between A.D. 600 and 800, being the fourth in surface extension, the third in construction volume, and the fourth in estimated population. The excavated complex consists of four pyramidal bodies arranged around an open plaza. The largest and tallest mound is the one on the south side. In the cen- ter of the plaza is a small quadrangular platform (Fig. 4. 27). This type of overall architectural configuration has been variously designated as "quadrangle" (Holmes 1897), "system" (Caso 1938), and "templo-patio- adoratorio " (Winter 1986). Although the report of the excavations was never published, and many details about the exploration program are still unknown (Caso 1939: 185), it is clear from what can still be seen today at the locality that the tallest mound was the main objective. Several exposed probings indicate that there were at least two main construction phases. Also, the clearing of the upper structure disclosed a room with three divisions. The one in the center originally had two interior columns, as can be deduced by circular areas in the floor that were not surfaced with stucco. Two deep stratigraphic pits were excavated at the sum- mit of the mound, one in the middle of the central 123</page><page sequence="141">Fig. 4.16 Known examples of bearer E (standard version) in chronological order. 124</page><page sequence="142">Fig. 4.17 Variants of bearer E.

It was in these ex- plorations at the summit where a carved stone was found. The Carved Monolith (7V-6) A large carved stone was embedded as the core of the step that gives access to the three-room enclosure. Evidently, the block had been reused as construction material during the last major modification of the pyramid and its precinct. The monolith, fractured in the middle, is still in situ today. The stone has carvings on two sides (Fig. 4.28). One relief is on one of the largest surfaces, and the other runs parallel but along one of the narrowest sides. Only the latter has been published in photograph (Garcia Moll, Patterson, and Winter 1986: pl. 333) and in sketches (Acosta 1959: 30, fig. 35; Garcia Moll, Patterson, and Winter 1986: pl. 196, no. 509). In its secondary use, the stone was placed in such a way that the narrow relief faced as the riser of the step, although probably the carving was covered by a layer of stucco. The relief on the underside must have rested directly on construction fill. To expose the carving, the exca- 126 269 270 871 272 'j I ^ 276 877 ^ "9 212 213 214 885 286 287 2** Fig. 908-21Â®.

Caso read the inscription in the narrow relief as a date: day 7G (7 Deer). From this, the entire architectural complex derived its present name of 7 Venado (Caso 1939: 185). The interpre- tation of the other relief either was not done or was never published. Although the disposition between the two reliefs is inverted, certain iconographic details suggest that both form part of a single inscription. For instance, the circles and scrolls that frame the central glyph on the narrow surface are treated in much the same way as those in the lower element carved on the larger side. By the form and treatment of the scrolls, the relief can be related to the Nuine style of the Mixteca Baja, which began to develop between A.D. 500 and 600 in north- western Oaxaca (Paddock 1990a). This chronological placement for the carved stone is reinforced by the assumption that the last phase of construction at the 127 7 Â® * 'Â° " 12 ^ ^ "^3$ 13 14 15 16 17 18 ^ ^ .53, /S) 18 SB e?e 19 20 21 22 23 24 i . 0AN_65 2 .

Inverted dispositions of reliefs carved on two differ- ent surfaces of the same stone occur in some lintels found at Monte Alban (Fig. 4.29). On the basis of these comparative materials, it therefore can be assumed that the stone 7V-6 was originally a lintel. For analytical purposes, however, Figure 4.30 shows both reliefs in the same disposition. Such an arrangement does not necessarily imply that the reading sequence began on the underside and continued on the narrow surface. Being a short inscription, the reading sequence could have been either way, as one entered or exited the room that originally contained the lintel. The length of the stone, spanning 5 m, suggests that it covered a wide entrance. Because a public rather than a mortu- ary function is deduced from the comparison of met- ric data for lintels with known primary contexts (Urcid n.d.c, 1: 359, n. 8), the monolith might have been re- moved from the previous structure that was partly covered by the subsequent construction event and whose remains lay directly underneath. The most prominent glyph on 7V-6 has certain el- ements suggesting the presence of a year glyph (Fig. 4.31). It can be described as a horizontal band (diag- nostic g) with two loops and hanging strips at either end (diagnostic h). Although other defining attributes of the year glyph are missing, one of the two glyphs below the horizontal band is a human head in profile, devoid of hair and mostly toothless. Its eye is framed by a glyph E.The two numeral bars below undoubt- 129</page><page sequence="147">Fig. 4.25 Glyph G in Whittaker's day list (1981: 2). edly accompany the human head. They cannot be as- sociated with the "Bag" glyph, to the right, because this sign never occurs accompanied by coefficients. Actually, this example of the "Bag" glyph is unique because of the element that overhangs from the top. This hanging element already has been mentioned as an attribute of the year glyph (diagnostic i). All these associations indicate that the lintel con- tains an annual date 10E. Furthermore, it establishes a relationship between the head of an old, toothless per- 130</page><page sequence="148">Fig. 4.26 Central and southern sectors of Monte Alban (assembled from Blanton 1978: maps N1-N4 and E9-E11). sonage and the bearer E. Such a link solves the prob- lem presented by the year bearer in the slab from tomb 104. Further evidence in support of this relationship are three annual dates in three jambs from tomb 5 at Cerro de la Campana, Suchilquitongo (Fig. 4.32). These examples include diagnostics e, f, g, and i of the year 131 Defensive walls ^ ^ ^ South Platform ^ ^ ^ Terrace 1458 ' NV' - -p Defensive walls I I 0 150 m</page><page sequence="149">Fig. 4.27 Plan and profile of the main architectural complex in terrace 1458, Monte Alban. glyph and show the face of an old toothless personage, as deduced from the pronounced prognathism, carry- ing the glyph E. Considering then all the known ex- amples, the bearer that consists in the representation of an old man's face (now designated glyph Alpha) documents a sequence from Monte Alban Ilia to 132</page><page sequence="150">Monte Alban Illb, that is, a span of about 500 years (Fig. 4.33). At this point it can be concluded that glyph Alpha is an alternative variant of the bearer E.The association of the latter with the notion of elderliness, conveyed by the representation of an old man, also indicates that glyph E is the senior year bearer in the Zapotec calendar. The Effigy Vessel While exploring the open plaza of the 7 Venado complex, Rubin de la Borbolla placed a pit in front of the adoratory at the base of the staircase for the tallest structure and found a cache designated as Offering 6 (see Fig. 4.27). Its specific contextual and stratigraphic provenience is still unknown, but it contained two ef- figy vessels. One of them (Fig. 4.34), probably a bra- zier, measures 74 cm in height by 74 cm in maximum width. The other vessel is only 29 cm tall and represents a seated individual without a headdress but with a buc- cal mask that has a broken bifid tongue (Fig. 4.35). Both objects were attributed to the Monte Alban II period by Caso and Bernal (1952: 151), although the arguments for such relative dating were not made clear, especially in the case of the smaller effigy vessel. The temporal placement of the brazier was based on the presence of the lateral elements, which occur in similar form on "urns" that, on stylistic grounds, cor- respond to the second epoch in the Monte Alban chro- nology (ibid.: 202). The small effigy vessel is remark- ably similar to one of the Oaxacan "urn" found at Teotihuacan, which Bernal and Caso dated to period Ilia (R. Millon 1967: 43) (Fig. 4.35). Based on this later judgment, and on the differences between the small "urn" and other effigy vessels with buccal masks pertaining to period II (Caso and Bernal 1952: 150- 151, figs. 251 to 257), one can date the two ceramic objects from Offering 6 to the transition between Monte Alban II and Ilia. The front of the Offering 6 brazier (Figs. 4.36, 4.37) consists of an anthropozoomorphic representation (a) with a horizontal band in the forehead (b).

A cartouche appears at the center of the band with an engraved cross inside (d). Above the cartouche are numerical signs (two bars and three dots) that sum up 13 (e).The posterior border of the vessel ends in a stepped rim (f). Apparently the brazier was found broken and in- complete because certain parts of the central cartou- che and the coefficients are now reconstructed. Nev- ertheless, enough of the original parts remain to en- dorse its adequate restoration. Caso and Bernal interpreted the imagery as the "God of the Bird with the Broad Beak." The meaning of the coefficient or its relationship with the rest of the effigy remained unclear because the "glyph [that ac- companied the numerals] is undiscernible." Never- theless, the authors concluded (ibid.: 202) that the co- efficient 13 must have been the calendrical name of the deity. Even as early as the studies of Batres (1889), Saville (1904), and especially Caso (1928), it was rec- ognized that some of the elements in ceramic effigy vessels tend to appear in the stone inscriptions. This is applicable not only to glyphs but to the representa- tions of masks and headdresses as well. And the ex- ample on the brazier is no exception. Following the analytical techniques of Caso (1949b: 79), Figure 4.37 shows a profile drawing of the effigy, placing the nu- merals at the bottom (but leaving their silhouette), and representing the central cartouche as a complete ele- ment. If the cartouche, the horizontal band, and the hanging stripe are isolated, something remarkably simi- lar to the sectioned year glyph results.The resemblance also holds if the entire configuration is compared with 136 Year SE Ytar 6E jaab 3 S 7 curved strip with ^ scroll circular ornament i â¢ U and two tips y r"|/* Â® trapezoid element horizontal band g glyph E â¢ face of old personage N|&lt;u&gt;j &gt; coefficient 6</page><page sequence="154">Fig. 4.33 Known examples of bearer Alpha in chronological order. the unfolded version of a year glyph. It is clear then that the motif is not only a royal headdress (which is what the year glyph represents), but it includes diag- nostic attributes (d), (e), (g), and (h). Concomitantly, the profile of the effigy itself results in a glyph that, by its context, must be a day name if not a year bearer. The function of the coefficient becomes clear, mak- ing of the brazier the three-dimensional representa- tion of an annual date or the embodiment of a ruler identified by its calendrical name. The glyph associated with the brazier has now been designated with the letter U (Fig. 4.38). Its constitu- ent elements include an eye with a supraorbital plaque (a), a curved beak (b) with an appendage above (d), and an earplug (c). Although few, three more examples of this sign as a bearer have been documented. These apparently span from early Ilia to late Illb, that is, some 500 years (Fig. 4.39). This demonstrates that there is another bearer that has an alternative form. Two of the five known instances of glyph U as a regular day glyph include some or all the elements that are diagnostic of glyph N (Fig. 4.40). So far, this is the only link sug- gesting that glyph U is the variant of the N year bearer. Position of the Year Bearers in the Day List Returning to the review of the discrepancies between Caso and Whittaker, we now have all the elements to clarify which correlation is correct. Caso s anchorage of the set to the 2nd-7th- 12th- 17th positions was based on the pictograph of the deer (glyph G), which in all other known Mesoamerican day lists is the name of the seventh day (see Table 3.6). In terms of internal evi- dence, there is ample linguistic support for Caso s cor- relation of glyph G with the seventh position. The root of the 7th day given by Cordova is china, and entries for "deer" in his Vocabulario state the following: 1.Venado generalmente Pichinaquijxi [Deer in general] pichinatani (421) 2. Ciervo animal Pichinaquixi [Stag] pichinatani yoce bichina (108v) 3. Bramar el ciervo Tipeechi pichinaquixi [to roar, the stag] (60v) 137</page><page sequence="155">Caso's correlation of glyph M was based on the ico- nography of the sign and on external comparisons. He argued that the sign resembled the Ehecatl ("Wind") glyph, which names the second day in the Nahuatd calendar, because both signs have buccal masks (Fig. 4.41). Glyph M, on the other hand, occurs also as a face in Zapotec ceramic effigy vessels (Fig. 4.42). Based on a number of attributes related to water, maize, and fertility, these urns were interpreted as representations of Cociyo (Caso andBernal 1952: 17-53).The homo- logue of Cociyo in the central highlands is Tlaloc, and the attributions of the latter are described as follows: Water, earth, fertility. Produces the rain by pouring water from jars and produces light- ning by hitting the jars with sticks. (Von Win- ning 1987, 1: 77) The link between glyph M and Cociyo is supported by other evidence as well. The two plaster busts deco- rating the facade of a room in a residential compound at Lambityeco show the anthropozoomorphic image holding a vessel with pouring water in one hand, and bolts of lightning in the other (Fig. 4.43). The entries for "lightning" in Cordova's Vocabulario state the fol- lowing: 3. Relampago Laha quiepaa [Lightning] que^a quiepaa laa tiapini^a tiapi laa (349v) The expressions above, which include the particles laha and laa, can be translated literally as "heat of the sky, ""heat that makes water come down, ""falling down hot," [calentura del cielo , caliente hace caer agua , cae caliente] (Roger Reeck, personal communication, 1989; also cf. Cordova [1578] 1987: 67v: Calentar muy caliente al fuego [heat very hot in the fire]). The main root of the second day is precisely laa. Seler (1904b: 40) proposed that the two roots given by Cordova (quij and laa) meant "glow" or "fire." These other meanings do not contradict but reinforce the metaphoric translation of the roots for the second day name as "lightning." Con- sequently, although based on different arguments, there is substantial internal evidence to support Caso s cor- relation of glyph M with the second position. These two links help us find the positions of glyphs E and N. For instance, the root for the 17th day name is xoo, a term originally translated by Seler as "power- ful, ""strong, ""forcible, ""earthquake" (1904b: 49). These translations came from the following entries in Cordova's Vocabulario: 1 . Fuer^a, vide for^ar y fiierte Quelacoxoo (201 v) [Force, to force, strong] 2. Temblor de tierra Xoo [Earthquake] xixooni (395v) 3. Dios de los temblores de tierra Pitao xoo (141) [God of Earthquakes] Fig. 4.34 Large effigy vessel from Offering 6, mound 7 Venado, Monte Alban. 138</page><page sequence="156">Also, Cordova states in his Arte ([1578] 1886: 114) that the word xoo means vigor, fury, impetus, courage. Although Caso always interpreted glyph E in the Zapotec corpus as the symbol of turquoise, he de- scribed it in the iconography of the central highlands - particularly Teotihuacan - as representing the surface of the earth and its quadripartite division (1967b: 258). The representational character of glyph E as the earth and its directions coincides with one of the meanings of the term xoo, because, after all, it is earth that trembles. Glyph E, or the Quinterno sign, as Caso called it in the iconography of the central highlands, is a con- sistent attribute in the imagery of the Mexican Tlaltecuhtli (Lord of the Earth), whose representations occur in the carved underside of several Mexica sculp- tures, that is, the surface of the monoliths resting di- rectly on the earth (Fig. 4.44). One of these sculptures (no. 5) even substitutes the Quinterno by the Nahuatl sign 0//m, a polysemous word that means "motion," "movement," and "earthquake." "Earth" and "Earth- quake" are also names of the 17th day in several Maya calendars (Seler 1904b: 50;Thompson 1971: 86). Con- sequently, not only through internal evidence, includ- ing iconographic and linguistic data, but based on ex- ternal comparisons as well, the correlation of glyph E to the 17th position is secure. By process of elimination then, glyph N should correspond to the 12th position. The main root of the day name given by Cordova is pija (pronounced /piya/). Seler s translation "to be turned" (1904b: 47) appears to originate from the following entry in Cordova s Vocabulario: Fig. 4.35 The smaller effigy vessel from Offering 6 (right), mound 7 Venado, Monte Alban, and one of the Zapotec urns found at Teotihuacan (left) (drawing of the Offering 6 vessel after Bernal 1949: pl. 3). 139</page><page sequence="157">Fig. 4.36 Analytical view of the brazier from Offering 6, 7 Venado, Monte Alban. 1 . Hilar muy torcido Tochijapijtoo [To spin with much twist] tochijpijatoo (220) Cruz, on the other hand, translated the term piya as "sun," "dry," "prickly pear," or "cactus organ" (1935: 58, 90). In Cordovas Vocabutario , the entries for these words state the following: 2. Sol planeta Copijcha, pitoo (383) [The sun] 3. Sol el calor del Xilla [Heat of the sun] xipechaa copijcha (383) 4.

Pitahaya el arbol Yaga pichij (315v) [prickly pear, the tree] The second expression in entry number 1 includes the particle pija,but,in the case of the other entries, the phonetic resemblance is less close (pijcha, /piyca/; chij, /ciy/). Furthermore, none of the proposed trans- lations helps clarify the pictography of glyph N. Based on another line of evidence, however, the sign appears to represent some kind of plant or flower (Fig. 4.45), and not a bat, as Caso thought, or a smoking mirror, as Whittaker proposed. If glyph N is the pictograph of a flower or plant, the translations proposed by Seler and Cruz suggest that the sign might represent either cot- ton (used for spinning thread) or a dried plant (the result of the sun's heat). Yet, entries in Cordovas Vocabulario for cotton (21v), dried (373), tree or plant that withers (373), or dryness (377v) do not support such pictographic interpretations. There are, however, two entries that state the following: lO.Yerba xabonera que sirve de xabon Piaa (228v) [Soapy plant used as soap] 1 1 .Xabon desta tierra rayzes Piaa , piaatochani [Soap of these lands, roots] (429) The term piaa in these expressions, which refers to a particular kind of plant, is the closest resemblance to the root piya. As stated by Cordova, such a plant and its roots were used for soap, which in turn yields an interesting link with external evidence. Seler states, The name [of the 12th day in Maya] is ee or eb , that is "a row of teeth, ""a row of peaks." It is translated in the Guatemalan chronicle, as in the Mexican Malinalli, by escobilla ("brush"). This translation is undoubtedly correct. The escobilla is a broomlike or brushlike instru- ment, made of plant fibers bound together, which is still very generally used by the In- dian women to clean their clothes and comb their hair. (Seler 1904b: 47) This statement supports the interpretation that glyph N represents a plant and confirms its anchorage to the 12th position. Also, the word piya can be specifically translated as "soap plant" or "brush." It has already been determined that glyph E is the senior or prime year bearer and that the annual mark- ers occupy the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions in the day list; thus, ignoring for the moment the value of the accompanying coefficients, the sequence of the year bearers in the native computation of time would have been E -* M G -* N (Fig. 4.46). So far only the bearers at either end of the series (E and N) have al- 141</page><page sequence="159">Fig. 4.38 Constituent elements of glyph U. ternative forms (Alpha and U, respectively). Variants for glyphs M and G might eventually appear in the archaeological record. Variations in the Year Glyph and the Year Bearers In his study of early inscriptions from Monte Alban, Caso interpreted the two signs at the top of the cen- tral inscription on MA-D-55 as a year glyph accom- panied by the bearer 2 or 4E (1947: 11) (Fig. 4.47 A). This sequence of glyphs has not been taken here as an example of an annual date for two reasons. One is that, although the upper glyph consists of a headband with a central element - a configuration reminiscent of the year glyph - attributes d, e, and f are not present. That the sign is also the pictograph of a headband can be demonstrated by its occurrence in other contexts (Fig. 4.48). All the illustrated examples pertain to Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II and involve representa- tions of Cociyo.The central element in this headdress, however, is the early version of glyph C. Therefore, this kind of headdress is different from the one that served as reference for the year glyph. The second rea- son is that, even though the sign in MA-D-55 placed immediately below the headband-sign C resembles glyph E (a squarish form with four points in the cor- ners and one in the center), it would be a unique and odd case of a bearer that has the coefficient inserted in the glyph itself (three dots and not two or four as Caso thought). Another known instance of this same glyphic sequence actually demonstrates that the dots do not have numerical value (Fig. 4.47B). One of the most striking patterns of the charts show- ing the bearers in chronological arrangement is that no examples of the Zapotec year glyph presumably dating to the tenth century or after have been attested so far. Yet, there are four carved stones that enable tracing some of the scribal and calendrical changes that took place in ancient Oaxaca after the collapse of Monte Alban (Fig. 4.49). Although the anchorage of these stones to an absolute chronology is only tenta- tive, Figure 4.50 illustrates the relative sequence of modifications in the year glyph, in the bearers, and in the conventions for representing the coefficients. The sequence goes from circa 500 B.C. at the bottom to circa A.D. 1500 at the top. The first significant change after a long and perva- sive continuity in the Zapotec bearers, which attests for uninterrupted sacred and solar calendrical counts, is the replacement of the year glyph. Sometime in the tenth or eleventh century, the Zapotec form was sub- stituted by the early version of the Mixtec imbricated 142</page><page sequence="160">year glyph, retaining, however, the Zapotec bearers. The year glyph in CRO-2 (see Fig. 4.49, no. 1) indi- cates that early examples of the interlaced sign may appear in the archaeological record accompanied by the bearers M, G, and N (and possibly by the Alpha and U variants as well). A subsequent change involved a calendrical modi- fication, one in which the year bearers were shifted one position ahead. The equivalence between the old and new systems, as given in pectoral 26 from tomb 7 at Monte Alban is Year 10M (10 Laa or 10 Lightning) in the Zapotec calendar (represented by the Chi-Ehecatl glyph) = Year 11R (11 Caua or 11 House) in the Mixtec calendar (Caso 1932: 26; 1956: 495; 1969: 92). Although Caso attributed such calendrical reform to C f 5 Alligator (father of cf 8 Deer and founder of the second dynasty of Tilantongo), Jansen and Winter (1980: 9) have shown that the argument rests on an incorrect assumption (see also discussion of glyph F). Therefore, it remains unknown who introduced the correction, when exacdy it occurred, and why.The shift in year bearers was not general because certain regions of Oaxaca and Guerrero retained type II annual mark- ers even after Pre-Columbian times. This is demon- strated by the Tlapantc codices, Azoyu I, II, and Humboldt; the Cuicatec codices, Tepeucila and Tututepetongo; and the solar calendar in Manuscript 85 from the region of Villa Alta in the Zapotec north- ern Sierra. The system of bars and dots for represent- ing numerals continued despite the shift in the year bearers. The exclusive use of dots to represent the co- efficients of calendrical glyphs was eventually the last change. From the chronological arrangement of the year bearers one can trace the stylistic development of the Zapotec year glyph in more detail (Fig. 4.51). First, it can be noted that some of the examples from Monte Alban II and Monte Alban Ilia (profile view) include additional elements that have not been considered as constituent traits of the year glyph. In the earlier forms, an added element appears above the headband, yet its pictographic source is not readily apparent. The other addition in later year glyphs appears suspended from attribute "d." It has an oval elongated shape with trifinial ornaments at both ends. From Figure 4.51 it can be concluded that by Monte Alban Illb there was a loosening in the canons followed to represent the Fig. 4.39 Known examples of bearer U in chronological order. 143 + 1000-] MA.

By then, at least three variant forms were used: (1) profile view of the headdress; (2) frontal view of the headdress; and (3) a partial version that com- prises only attributes "d-e." Concomitant with these changes is the arrangement of the bearer in rela- tion to the year glyph. Whereas in periods I, II, and Ilia, the bearer invariably appears below the year glyph, in period Illb the annual marker was placed below, above, or in front of the sign or was even inserted in element d. By recognizing such a degree of variation, the in- terpretation of the main glyph in 7V-6 as a year sign is reinforced. It also makes plausible the existence of a fourth variation in the year glyph. There are two ex- Fig. 4.48 Assorted images, in ceramic and stone, of Cociyo (not to relative scale). 149 1. MNA, ceramic vase without provenance 2. MA-TR/1456-BP, ceramic vase 3.

Both look like pictographs of headbands and appear associated with glyph M. Al- though the example on MA-TR/l-t/155-lb is much eroded, there was certainly no coefficient. However, the lack of a numeral does not necessarily invalidate the interpretation of this particular sign as a variant year glyph. In the current corpus there is, for instance, an example of an unfolded year glyph with a bearer E that is not accompanied by a numeral (Fig. 4.53). The omitted coefficient in TLA-1 could have been 1 or 13. Therefore, it appears that in a few cases the coeffi- cient of a year bearer must have been implied. Re- turning to the possible annual date on MA-TR/l-t/ 155-lb (see Fig. 4.52), it should be noted that other scholars have interpreted it as the representation of a temple with jambs, roof, balustrades, and staircase, all these with a glyph placed at the door (Acosta 1974: 75; 1982; Gendrop 1984). Yet, the proponents did not realize that the relief has an inverted disposition.There- fore, the apparent resemblance to a temple results from viewing the relief upside down. The Zapotec Calendar Round The preceding analysis has confirmed Caso's iden- tification of annual markers and the occurrence of type II year bearers in the Zapotec solar calendar (2nd- 7th- 12th- 17th positions). Epigraphic evidence has so far yielded at least 70 year glyphs with recognizable annual names and six different bearers. Nine more year glyphs have been documented, but the accompanying glyphs naming those year dates broke off or are eroded beyond recognition (Fig. 4.54). The relative frequen- cies of the available year bearers and certain icono- graphic associations indicate that these various signs resolve into four main bearers, two of which had al- ternative forms: E/Alpha, G, M, and N/U (Fig. 4.55). Furthermore, the link between glyphs E and Alpha - the latter being the pictograph of an old man's face - establishes the former as the senior year bearer.6 6 That glyph E is the senior bearer in the Zapotec calendar had already been proposed by Edmonson (1988: 268), but his determination of the seniority rests on unclear iconographic arguments. Furthermore, he correlated glyph E to the 12th position. 150</page><page sequence="168">Fig. 4.50 Chronological development of year bearers in Oaxaca. 151</page><page sequence="169">Â£ &amp; u &lt;L&gt; 4-&gt; o 8" N (U .g Vw o a 0 *13 1 o *Z3 V) 00 T- I LO Ph 152</page><page sequence="170">Fig. 4.52 A possible fourth variant of the year glyph 153</page><page sequence="171">Fig. 4.53 Stone TLA-1 with unfolded year glyph and bearer E on surface a. (The coefficient of the annual date is omitted.) The equivalence between glyphs E and Alpha, and the correlations of the bearers to the day list, imply that the sequence of annual markers in the Calendar Round was from E to M to G to N. This order sug- gests that, in the context of solar computations, glyph E could have represented the last day before the five "unlucky days" and thus would have been the name of the year with which the 52-year cycle or Calendar Round began. If these deductions are correct, then glyph E is a bearer in the sense understood by Maya epigraphers (i.e., the glyph that carries the date from a completion of a cycle to the opening of the follow- ing one). It also would mean that the Zapotec calen- dar had a structural property that continued operating in much later calendrical systems from the central high- lands, that is, the name of a year is given by the last day name of the 18th "month" in the previous solar cycle (Caso 1967a: 59). What remains to be determined is the coefficient of the year E with which the Zapotec Calendar Round began. The Day Name Glyphs With four positions in the day list securely assigned to the year bearers, the next step is to proceed with the analysis of other calendrical glyphs. The goal is to re- construct the entire glyphic day list. 154</page><page sequence="172">Fig. 4.54 Zapotec year glyphs without recognizable bearers. 155</page><page sequence="173">Glyph A Glyph A was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of six examples. He interpreted it as the pic- tograph of a knot, but its position in the day list was not ascertained. Twenty examples are now known, and three variants can be distinguished (Fig. 4.56). Arranged chronologically, the examples document a sequence of more than 1000 years, starting in Monte Alban II and ending in late Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.57). Two entries from Cordova's Vocabulario that relate to knots state the following: 1 . nudo escurredizo Pigueete/d [Slipknot] lana tela (285v) 2. Lazos de carga Toonafe/dyoa [Lassos to tie burden] tooni tela toopife/dyoa toonabixiyoamani (240v) These entries include the particle tela, which is the root of the 10th day. The correspondence between the iconography of the glyph and the translation of the root tela as "slipknot" provide sufficient evidence to correlate glyph A to the 10th position in the day list.7 The glyph occurs in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d), in the Mixteca de la Costa (Brockington, Jorrin, and Long 1974: 65, fig. 19a), in Eastern Guerrero (Piiia Chan 1960: photo 4), and in the corpus from Xochicalco and Chalco (Caso 1967a: 172-173). Its presence in Chichen Itza suggests that glyph A was also used in the calendrical system of Tula (Caso 1928: 27, fig. 3 no. IX).8 Infrequendy, the sign also appears as a noncalendrical variant in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph B Glyph B was originally defined by Caso (1928) on 7 Cruz (1935: 87) proposed that tela translates as "to tangle up" [enrredar], "to twist" [retorcer] . These terms can be related semantically to "knot" and, therefore, reinforce the proposed link between tela and glyph A. 8 The stone sculpture with a glyph A from the Arensberg col- lection attributed to the Zapotec culture (cf. Kubler 1954: pl. 99) actually might be from Tula or another locality in the cen- tral highlands. the basis of 10 examples.9 The sign was interpreted as the pictograph of a jaguar. The current corpus includes 48 examples that, when arranged chronologically, document a long sequence of some 1000 years, from Monte Alban II to Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.58). As shown in Figure 4.59, the glyph displays four variants. Two involve representation of the animal's head (pro- file and frontal views), one represents most or all of the body, and the last variant, which follows the prin- ciple of pars pro to to, depicts only an extremity with claws. The distinctive traits of the first two forms in- clude (1) a threatening gesture exposing canines and incisors, (2) rounded or pointed small ears, and (3) a tongue that sticks out frontally. An attempt to repli- cate the spotted skin of the animal is apparent in only two painted examples (Fig. 4.58, nos. 9 and 49). The infrequent frontal representations of the jaguar's head as a calendrical sign come mostly from the joint or separate double vases that have the carved glyphic cou- plets of IB and 2J (Fig. 4.60). Although frontally de- picted, the two known examples of frill-bodied jag- uars are treated differently. One appears seated and the other is prone (see Fig. 4.58, nos. 5 and 35). Only one example of the fourth variant has been documented so far. Because the jaguar occupies the 14th position in the day list in several Mesoamerican calendars, Caso correlated glyph B accordingly. On the other hand, the Zapotec word for jaguar given by Cordova is Pechetao [tiger, ferocious animal] ([1578] 1987:402). But the word peche does not match the root of the 14th day (lache). The latter term might translate as "heart": 1. Cora$on de animal Lachitzoni (92) [Heart of an animal] 2. Cora$on de cualquier cosa Lachi(92) [Heart of anything] In Nahua mythology, one of the aspects of Tezcatlipoca was known as Tepeyollod ("hill heart"). 9 The count of number of glyphs originally classified by Caso under this and subsequent glyphic categories includes picto- graphic misidentifications. A detailed account of those misidentifications appears elsewhere (Urcid n.d.c, 1 : 361-364). 156</page><page sequence="174">Fig. 4.55 Relative frequencies of the known Zapotec year bearers. In Codex Borbonicus,Tepeyollotl is represented with a jaguar disguise (Caso 1958; Nicholson 1971). How- ever, because the link between heart and jaguar and the correlation of glyph B to the 14th position so far are based on external evidence, such a place- ment should remain tentative until all the glyphic evidence is reviewed. Glyph B has been attested in the Mixteca Alta dur- ing the Late Ramos phase (A.D. 1 to 200) (Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43b-44b), in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 168), and on the Oaxaca coast (Jorrin 1974: 39, fig.5). It has not been documented at Xochicalco, but it was used as a day name in the calendars from Tula (De la Fuente, Trejo, and Solana 1988: Figs. 158-159) and Castillo deTeayo, Veracruz (Seler 1908: 444). Glyph B is used as a noncalendrical sign in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph C glyph C was viewed as the stylized representation of a jaguar s nose and mouth, and its correlation to the day list could not be determined (ibid.: 29). Later, based on examples of glyph C that appear in ceramic effigy vessels - where the glyph does not occur accompa- nied by coefficients - Caso and Bernal proposed a se- quence tracing the temporal changes in the represen- tation of the glyph (Fig. 4. 61). Whereas the early ver- 157</page><page sequence="175">Fig. 4.56 Variants of glyph A. sions of Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II were seen as representing a vase in cross section with flow- ing water, Caso's original interpretation of a jaguar's face for the subsequent forms was retained (Fig. 4.62). 10 The problem of correlating glyph C to the day list remained unsolved. Leigh (1966) proposed that Caso and BernaTs sty- listic sequence was incomplete. In his opinion, the glyph was modified during its later stages into the sign that Caso had previously called the "Jaws of the Sky" (Fig. 4.63). Although Leigh agreed that the early versions of the glyph represented a bowl of water, he considered that the jaguar was not represented at all in the later versions of Monte Alban Illb and Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.64A). Rather, the imagery was that of the Alligator. Thus, Leigh correlated the versions from Monte Alban I to Monte Alban Ilia to the 9th position (Water) and the later ones to the 1st position (Alligator). The alternative of placing presumed noncoeval variants of the same sign in two different positions of the day list, however, is preposterous. Apparently without being aware of its identification in the Zapotec corpus, and of the discrepancies be- tween Caso and Bernal and Leigh, Joralemon - in his study of Olmec iconography - proposed that the ver- sion of glyph C in early Oaxacan objects represented bladelike maize vegetation (1971: 13, 63, motif 96). In 1975, Philippa Shaplin suggested a different breakdown for the constituent elements in the late forms of the sign (Fig. 4.64B) and concluded, The glyph embraces the fundamental prin- ciple of pars pro to to, synthetic image, and prob- ably the split profile as well and, as such, is a complex composition whose stylistic devel- opment should be determined only with the greatest caution. (Shaplin n.d.: 191) Although Shaplin avoided specific iconographic in- terpretations, the terms used to describe the elements that compose the glyph suggest that she also viewed it related to water (e.g., "stream," "bowl"). Although she implicidy rejected the stylistic sequences of Caso and Bernal and that of Leigh, she did not propose an alter- native. To date 23 examples of glyph C as a calendrical glyph have been attested, and these document a continuous sequence that spans from late Monte Alban I to Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.65). 11 Despite its use for some 1000 years, the glyph shows a remarkable degree of conserva- tism. Taking into account the calendrical sample but us- ing an example that is not accompanied by coefficients, the constituent elements of the glyph are isolated in Figure 4.66. Shaplin's characterization of the glyph is 10 Actually, the example from Transition II-IIIa shown in Fig- ure 4.61 is not a glyph C but a glyph V. u Example 3 in Figure 4.65 is taken from a published render- ing (Leigh 1966: 258, fig. 1 1) and not from the original inscrip- tion, which is reported to be in a horizontal crevice on the escarpment of Caballito Blanco, Tlacolula (Anonymous 1960). The inscription is said to cover some 4m2, and its discoverers claim to have been able to obtain a latex cast of some portions. The glyph published by Leigh was supposedly copied from this cast. Renderings of the other glyphs are unknown, as is the whereabouts of the cast. The geological nature of the escarp- ment and the formation processes that led to the cracks in the rocks make the existence of the inscription doubtful. At any rate, verification of its presence requires specialized climbing equipment. i58 J / 1 L ] A Q Knot flanked by two curved elements r^K '/ (q) that usually have inner narks (p /rS )] Knot resting on a U-shaped base and with a trifinial adornment on the top Whirled knot</page><page sequence="176">Fig. 4.57 Known examples of glyph A in chronological order. 159</page><page sequence="177">Fig. 4.58 Known examples of glyph B in chronological order. 1 60</page><page sequence="178">Fig. 4.59 Variants of glyph B.

Within the configuration shown in Figure 4.66 there are two constellations of elements that are used in Zapotec iconography in the composition of other glyphs. Elements 1-2-3 also conform attribute "i" of the year glyph. In the year sign, the unfolded versions displaying attribute "i" in bilateral symmetry are less common than the profile versions where the attribute occurs singly.

The oc- currence of this constellation, whether in the year sign or in glyph C, is a good temporal marker for the signs of period Ilia onward (see Figs. 4.51 and 4.65). The constellation of elements 7-8-9 resemble what Caso designated the "Jaws of the Sky" glyph (Fig. 4. 67B). Although in glyph C the extremes of element 7 are usually short, and horizontal and appear deco- rated with tripartite finials (element 8) - traits that never occur in the "Jaws of the Sky" glyph - the pres- ence of teeth, sometimes displaying dental filing, re- lates the two symbols. This link apparently confused Leigh in his study. That his developmental sequence is incorrect can be demonstrated by the facts that (1) Caso's "Jaws of the Sky" glyph is not a calendrical sign, and (2) elements 7-8-9 are not exclusive to glyph C but are also used as lower frames for other signs (Fig. 4.68). Elements 4-5-6 remain to be analyzed. These can be considered the core traits of the glyph. Viewed in isolation, the resemblance of the later variants to the early versions becomes clearer (Fig. 4.69). This analy- sis of glyph C demonstrates that the stylistic sequence proposed by Caso and Bernal is correct. The remain- ing problem is determining what the glyph represents and what its position is in the day list. Except for the apparent link with water in the early versions (the un- dulating lines), the analysis of the constituent elements does not provide a hint about what the glyph stands for graphically. Its iconographic associations in the ceramic vessels, however, provide a clue for determin- ing its possible position in the day list. As a noncalendrical sign glyph C is very common in ce- ramic effigy vessels, particularly those representing Cociyo. In some instances, the glyph is adorned with representations of plants (Fig. 4.70), again suggesting a link with water. Therefore, glyph C could be related to the 9th position, whose Zapotec root name ni^a translates literally as "water." However, in several Mesoamerican calendars the 19th position in the day list means "rain," and the glyph that occupies this po- sition in the Mixtec and Nahuatl calendars is the rep- resentation of Dzahui or Tlaloc - that is, the homo- logies of Cociyo. Glyph M, the epigraphic counter- part to the image of Cociyo, has already been discussed. It has also been demonstrated that glyph M is a year bearer that occupies the second position. Therefore, based on the triangulation that Cociyo is the homo- logue to Dzahui or Tlaloc, and that glyph C is a fre- quent element in the representations of Cociyo, the calendrical version of glyph C can be correlated to the 19th position as well. 163 y stripes XSS-J iadebead ^ - * - * - ^ - tips of stripes 1 1 I tail of quetzal ^ ^ nose of jaguar (Â£gÂ§6^ canines and filed incisors</page><page sequence="181">Fig. 4.63 Stylistic evolution of glyph C according to Leigh (rearranged excerpts from Leigh 1966: 258, 260, 264-268). Cordova's root name for this day is lape. Seler re- solved the root as "appe" or "gappe" and translated it as "covered with clouds" or "cloud covering" (1904b: 52). However, it has not been possible to verify Seler 's assertion by using Cordova's Vocabulario or looking at the entries for "downpour" (14v), "rain" (251v), "shower with much wind and little rain" (317), "cloudy" (30v, 285), or "dew" (361v, 415v). Cruz, on the other hand, proposed that the root lape meant "drop" (1935: 61). Cordova's Vocabulario states, 1 . Gota cuando cae de agua Lapam^ [Drop of water, when it falls] Pinijni9a (207) 2.

However, because the glyph potentially could be correlated to one of two positions (9th or 19th), the problem of its link to the day list should be dealt with once all the glyphic evidence is reviewed. An example of glyph C with coefficients has also been documented in a portable object attributed to San Pedro Anane, a locality in the Mixteca Alta (Leon 1905b: pl. 1). It was also used in the Nuine script of the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d). Yet, it has not been attested in any other calendrical system from the cen- tral highlands. As noted before, noncalendrical ver- sions of glyph C are frequent in Zapotec art, particu- larly in ceramic effigy vessels. In the epigraphy, how- ever, they are rare.

However, Caso also contemplated the possibility that the glyph was the pictograph of a flower, an idea based on similarities to the sign for the 20th day also in the Nuttall codex (Fig. 4.7 1) .Therefore, nine "flower" signs were considered by Caso as variants of glyph D. In 1938, while discussing epigraphic evidence from Yucunudahui in the Mixteca Alta (Fig. 4.72, A1 and Bl), Caso suggested that the glyph was perhaps equiva- lent to "reed," not so much because of its iconography but because of the apparent function of two glyphs D as year bearers associated with a "Teotihuacan" year glyph. However, in subsequent studies Caso and other authors took glyph D as the pictograph of a flower (Bernal and Mendez 1974: 9; Paddock 1983: 76). Ap- parently, such interpretation is based not only on the noted resemblance between glyph D and the "Flower" glyph in the Nuttall codex but also on certain simi- larities of the sign to the "Flower" glyph in the Mexi- can script (Fig. 4.73). Winter (1989: 1), on the other hand, has proposed that the glyph represents the broad- leafed agave plant, with the dot representing the cav- ity from which sap is collected. Currently, 42 examples of glyph D have been at- tested, and these document a long sequence of some 800 years, from Transition II- Ilia to Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.74). Despite the prolonged use, glyph D is an- other sign characterized by extreme conservatism as well as minor variations. The constituents of the glyph are shown in Figure 4.75A. Given its attributes and general resemblance to glyph N (see Fig. 4.11), the sign appears to be a pictograph of some type of plant. Although in the Mixtec and Nahuatl calen- dars the 20th day name means literally "flower," Seler could not find a similar translation for the corresponding Zapotec name loo. Cruz (1935: 61) also indicated that the root is not even remotely related to the concept of flower. Entries for flower or agave plant in Cordova s Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 198, 253) lack the particle loo, confirming the as- sessments of Seler and Cruz. Therefore, despite the morphological similarities to a flower or an agave leaf, there is no linguistic basis to link the glyph to the 20th position in the day list. Caso s interpretation of the glyphic examples from Yucunudahui has an important connotation: the im- plicit correlation of the sign to the 13th position (1938: 50). In the Nahuatl calendar, the 13th position is oc- cupied by the day name "Reed" and functions as a bearer. Because the 13th position in the Zapotec day list is not occupied by a bearer, and glyph D never appears associated with the Zapotec year glyph, it in- deed could be linked to that position. Some morpho- logical resemblances with certain representations of the Nahuatl "Reed" glyph can also be established, as the latter also have a trifoliate element (Fig. 4.75B).

In sum- mary, glyph D appears to represent some type of plant or flower. On the basis of its calendrical context in the slab from Yucuiiudahui, on iconographic similarities to the Nahuatl "Reed" sign, and on linguistic criteria, the glyph can be tentatively linked to the 13th posi- tion of the day list. Despite its high relative frequency as a calendrical sign in the Zapotec corpus and its occurrence in the MixtecaAlta (Caso 1938:50bis,fig.68) and the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 168), glyph D has not been docu- mented outside of Oaxaca. Noncalendrical versions of the sign occur in Zapotec epigraphy and in differ- ent contexts (Urcid and Winter 1989: 66, pl. 9). Glyph E Caso (1928) defined glyph E on the basis of 24 ex- amples. It was interpreted as the symbol of turquoise, and, although its function as year bearer was deter- mined, its correlation to the day list could not be elu- cidated. An alternative iconographic interpretation as the quadripartite division of the earth and the func- tion of glyph E as the year bearer occupying the 17th position have already been discussed, and so has been the linguistic support for such correlation. As a day name, the present corpus includes 63 examples. De- spite its highest frequency relative to other glyphs, the attested glyphs cluster between Monte Alban Ilia and late Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.76). A span of only 600 years is no doubt the result of sample error. As dem- onstrated in the sequence for the glyph E as bearer, the sign had greater antiquity, going as far back as Monte Alban I. Glyph E has also been documented in the Mixteca Alta (Caso 1938: 46bis, fig. 65), Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d), Mixteca de la Costa (Brockington, Jorrin, and Long 1974: 65, fig. 19a), at Malpaso and Cerro Bernal in Chiapas (Navarrete 1966: 36, photo 50, 1976: figs. 13 and 14), at Teotihuacan (Caso 1967a: 163, fig. 21; 1967b: figs. 42a, 42c), Cacaxda (Foncerrada 1993: fig. 44b-A), and Xochicalco (Urcid n.d.g). So far it has not been attested in Tula. Noncalendrical versions of glyph E are common in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph F Glyph F was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of eight examples. It was tentatively inter- preted as the pictograph of an owl representing Quetzalcoad (ibid.: 33-34). Its position in the day list, however, was not determined. The present sample in- cludes 29 examples, which document a long sequence of almost 1 ,000 years, beginning in Monte Alban II and continuing until Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.77). This glyph, which is indeed the pictograph of an owl, is also characterized by pervasive conservatism. Yet, there are two variants: profile and frontal views (Fig. 4.78). In Cordova's Vocabulario, entries for "owl" state, 1 . Buho ave nocturna Tama, cotama (62) [Owl, nocturnal bird] 2. Aves nocturnas que tenian por agueros Xicochinapezeelao [Nocturnal birds held as omens, metaphor] (es metaphora) (48) Tama or cotama does not match any of the calendrical roots. There are some Nahua and Maya calendrical lists, such as the Cronica Franciscana de Guatemala, in which "Owl" is the name of the 16th day (Seler 1904b: 48). On the basis of external evidence, glyph F could be correlated accordingly. Jansen and Winter (1980: 9), while describing stone TIL-1 from the Mixteca Alta (see Fig. 4.49, no. 3), proposed a correlation of glyph F to the third position. They argued that, in the Mixtec calendrical system, the "Owl" glyph is an in- frequent variant of the bearer Cuau (House). This ar- gument also explains the occurrence of the "Owl" glyph as a bearer in Codex Vindobonensis, a Mixtec book where the year bearers unequivocally occupy positions 3 (House), 8 (Rabbit), 13 (Reed), 18 (Flint) (Fig. 4.79). In his commentary to the Mapa deTeozacualco, Caso interpreted the Owl bearer in the Vindobonensis dif- ferently. Instead of assuming that one of the Mixtec annual markers had a variant (the "Owl" glyph as an infrequent substitute of the "House" glyph), he thought that the passage in the codex gave an equivalence be- tween the Zapotec and the Mixtec calendars: 170</page><page sequence="188">Fig. 4.71 Glyph D compared with glyphs "Water" and "Flower" from Codex Nuttall.

It seems that the calendrical correction done by Lord 5 Alligator "Tlaloc-Sun," entailed a change from the old Zapotec system, in which the years were named Turquoise, Deer, Owl, and Serpent, to the new Mixtec and Aztec system, in which the years were designated Reed, Rabbit, House, and Flint. Thus, the year 13 Owl, day 7 Movement in the Vindobonensis [a date in the old Zapotec system] correspond to the year 13 House, day 7 Movement (973 A.D.), or to the year 12 House, day 7 Movement (985 A.D.) [alterna- tive dates in the new Mixtec system]. (Caso 1949a: 24) Implicitly then, the "Owl" glyph was taken as an- other form of the Zapotec glyph N, a sign whose pic- tography was not apparent and that had been previ- ously interpreted as the possible representation of a bat. In later works, Caso maintained that the year-day calendrical reform stated in Vindobonensis VI-1 (13 Owl-7 Movement) was also recorded in Codex Bodley 8-II (13 House-7 Movement) and in Codex Nuttall 25-C (12 House-7 Movement). Caso also noted that the three manuscripts were not in accord with the calendrical synchronology given in gold pectoral 26 from tomb 7 at Monte Alban, which gives the equiva- lence of 10 Wind-2 Movement in the old Zapotec system to 1 1 House-2 Movement in the new Mixtec system (Caso 1960: 35, and 1969: 92) (Table 4.1). By interpreting the Owl annual date in the Vindobonensis as an alternative form of the year 13 House in the Mixtec system, the discrepancies between these sources are eliminated, leaving the gold pectoral the only in- scription that actually gives the equivalences between two calendrical systems. The Zapotec main root for the third day is laala, which, as mentioned before, does not translate literally as "owl." Seler, who selected the infrequent root guela, correctly translated it as "night" (1904b: 40; also cf. Cordova [1578] 1987: 283). The meanings of the name for the third day in Maya calendars are not only "night" and "darkness" but "house" as well (Seler 1904b: 41). Aside from the fact that the owl is preeminendy a noc- turnal bird, there is an interesting comment in Cordova's Arte, where the friar states that the"Zapotecs took many 172 12 3 4 &lt;~@P Â£2?

There is no linguistic resemblance between pequia or piquia and laala, but the relationship between "house" and the "owl" is apparent. Although Seler pro- posed that in Nahuatl conventions the cozcaquauhtli and the owl are often used interchangeably (1904b: 48), entries in Cordova's Vocabulario for hawk (213 and 367v), falcon (268), or bird of prey (48) do not match the root laala. Therefore, the link of glyph F in the day list cannot be accomplished through linguistic data. Nevertheless, the augural and metaphorical connec- tion hinted at in Cordova's data strongly suggests that the sign corresponds to the 3rd position. The argu- ment presented by Jansen and Winter, which explains the occurrence of the Owl bearer in the Mixtec calendrical system, adds additional support for such a correlation. What remains to be determined is the meaning of the Zapotec main root for the third day (laala). Glyph F has been documented in the Mixteca Alta (Leon 1905b: pl. 3; Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43a-44a) and in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d), but it does not appear to occur in other calendrical systems outside Oaxaca. Noncalendrical versions of glyph F have been attested in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph G Defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of 12 examples, glyph G was interpreted as the pictograph of a deer, identified as one of the bearers, and correlated to the 7th position in the day list. The defining traits of the glyph and its function as a year bearer occupying this position have already been detailed, along with the linguistic support for such correlation. As a day name, 20 examples have been documented so far. Chrono- logically, these span from Monte Alban Ilia to late Monte Alban Illb, that is, a continuous sequence of some 500 years (Fig. 4.80). Glyph G has been documented in the Mixteca Alta (early Flores phase, A.D. 300-800) (Caso and Bernal 1952: 62, fig. 96bis a-b) and in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d). It has also been attested in Teotenango (Caso 1967a: 162, fig. 19) and Cacaxda (Lombardo de Ruiz et al., 1986: 520, no. 48), but so far no examples are known from Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, or Tula. Noncalendrical versions in Zapotec epigraphy are infrequent. Glyph H Glyph H was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of eight examples. As noted by him, the sign is the pictograph of a human skull. So far, 18 examples are known.They document a sequence that spans some 800 years, from Monte Alban Ilia to late Monte Alban IV (Fig. 4.81). Invariably, the glyph shows the skull in profile. Some examples have a small appendage in the nasal cavity reminiscent of flint knives stuck in the cranial masks found in Mexica offerings or in the deco- rated skull that formed part of the offering in tomb 7 at Monte Alban.Teotihuacan and Mixteca-Puebla pic- tographic conventions also depict this trait (Fig. 4.82). 174</page><page sequence="192">Fig. 4.76 Known examples of glyph E in chronological order. 175 +1000 - MA.

In other calendrical systems, this glyph corresponds to the 6th position in the day list. Its meaning is gen- erally "death." However, none of the expressions in Cordova's Vocabulario referring to "dead" or "to die" (274), "bone" (415), "skull" (67), or "cranium" (77), matches the root for the sixth day (lana). Seler (1904b: 42-43) translated the root as "hare," "flesh," "veiled," "concealed," "dark," and "secret."

Oler como pescado fresco o carne Tillaana/*wtf (289v) [Smell of fresh fish or animal flesh] By translating the root lana as "smell of flesh," one could link the notions of "death" and a "human skull" without a metaphor. For the time being, the correla- tion of glyph H to the 6th position in the day list depends mostly on external evidence and should be considered tentative until all the calendrical evidence is reviewed. The glyph has been attested in the Mixteca Alta (late Ramos phase) (Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43b-44b) and in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167), and it also may be present at Xochicalco (Caso 1967a: 167, fig. 2e). Noncalendrical usages of glyph H in Zapotec epig- raphy are known as well as the occurrence of picto- graphs of defleshed mandibles. Glyph I Glyph I was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of eight examples. Its graphic source could not be interpreted and it was simply described in mor- phological terms as a glyph in the shape of a Maltese cross. Now that more examples are known, its epi- graphic associations suggest that it is not a day glyph. The discussion of glyph I is, therefore, deferred to the section on special glyphs with coefficients later in this chapter. Glyph J On the basis of six examples, glyph J was viewed by Caso (1928) as a composite sign. The lower element was seen as representing the open jaws of a "mon- strous head." This element was further compared with the representation of caves in Nahua iconography; from this, the glyph was linked to the 3rd position in the day list (cave = dark house). Caso and Bernal (1952) related the glyph to conventionalized representations of the maize corncob (Fig. 4.83). In other works, Caso interpreted it as the representation of a flower (1938: 50, 1965b: 936). Sejourne (1955: 112) has argued that the glyph is specifically the representation of cotton. Despite all these propositions, the position of glyph J in the day list has not been clarified since Caso's initial linkage to the 3rd day. In 1965, on the basis of icono- graphic interpretation of the glyph as a flower and on the translation of the 20th Zapotec day name as "Flower," Caso implicitly correlated the glyph to the last position in the list. To date 41 examples have been attested, and these document a continuous sequence from Monte Alban II through late Monte Alban Illb, that is, some 900 years (Fig. 4.84). In its overall configuration, the glyph exhibits a remarkable conservatism through time. The constituent elements of the glyph are illustrated in Fig- ure 4.85. The trait that varies the most is the central appendage; it is characterized by (1) no markings at all, (2) vertical line with no band(s); (3) vertical line with band(s), (4) diagonal band(s) from left to right, (5) diagonal band(s) from right to left, (6) horizontal band(s), and (7) stepped or undulating band(s). If not for all the subsequent iconographic reinter- pretations - including Caso's - his original correlation of glyph J to the 3rd position would have been in conflict with the already secured linkage for glyph F. Also, when discussing glyph D, it was mentioned that the word for "flower" does not match any of the day names, which invalidates Caso's subsequent (and im- plicit) proposition that glyph J corresponds to the 20th day. Given the evidence from the effigy vessels illus- trated in Figure 4.83, Caso and Bernal's interpretation that the sign is the stylized representation of maize appears well founded. Further support for this con- tention is the occasional association of glyph J with representations of plants as well as its general similar- ity with glyphs D and N, two other signs whose graphic source were plants (Fig. 4.86). If glyph J is the representation of maize, what is its position in the day list? To begin with, none of the terms for maize given by Cordova ([1578] 1987: 252, 253v) matches any of the day name roots.

The fourth entry is also of interest because it makes a link be- tween hand and maize. Maize, and in a general sense "corn field," might be taken here as "sustenance," and in that sense as "mother" too.12 This argument resorts to metaphors and requires a number of assumptions, but it provides a tentative correlation of glyph J to the 15th position. Confirmation of such a correlation will have to wait until all the calendrical data are reviewed. Glyph J has been documented in the Mixteca Alta (late Ramos and early Flores phases) (Caso 1938: 50bis, fig. 68; Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43a-44a) and in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d). As a day sign, however, it appears 12 Among the Mazatecs of northwestern Oaxaca, a tradition related to the eighth month of their native solar calendar states that "at this time there can be heard in the east every now and then, two or three times a day, a low far-away rumble like the rumble preceding an earthquake, and people say that where the sound comes from there sits an old woman upon the sea. She has big breasts and with them she feeds the cornfields" (Weitlaner and Weitlaner 1946: 195). l8l</page><page sequence="199">Fig. 4.83 Derivation of glyph J from the maize corncob (after Caso and Bernal 1952: 20, fig. 7). to be exclusive to some of the Oaxacan calendrical systems. The glyph is used in Zapotec epigraphy in noncalendrical contexts. Glyph K Glyph K was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of a single example found in the upper right side of MA-NP-9b (Fig. 4.87). This glyph was inter- preted as a human leg and foot in profile, showing only the general shape without anatomical details. A reexamination of the original carved glyph not only disclosed an advanced state of erosion but also led to a different rendering and to the conclusion that the sign is not the representation of a human leg and foot. Be- cause the glyph occurs close to a broken portion of the stone, its relationship to the missing epigraphy can- not be determined. Consequently, the case presents two alternative interpretations: 1 . The sign is not a calendrical glyph. The coefficients to the left (a bar and four dots = 9) may have been associated to a missing glyph immediately above the numeral bar. 2. The coefficient does indeed accompany the glyph on the right side, but then the lat- ter cannot be classified as glyph K. Rather, it would be an example of glyph Theta. Caso subsequently suggested the possible presence of a K glyph in stone MA-J-14 (1947: 30) (Fig. 4.88). However, the sign is a noncalendrical glyph. The bar at the top cannot be a coefficient to the paired feet because another glyphic element separates them. De- spite Caso s misidentification in the case of the first example, two more signs of human legs and feet ap- parently associated with numerals have appeared since then. Both pertain to Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.89). These examples also present problems of interpreta- tion. The glyph found on the ceramic object (no. 1) can have several interpretations: 1.The carved coefficient is intended to refer to the vessel itself, which has the shape of a human lower leg and includes the foot. 2. The ceramic object had a counterpart where the calendrical sign for the coefficient could have been carved. The set would have consisted of a pair of legs with a calendrical name; one had the sign and the other had the coefficient. 3. The element carved above the coefficient in the ceramic leg is the main sign. This ele- ment has been classified alternatively as an- other example of glyph Theta. The second example, which depicts a staircase with ascending legs and feet accompanied by two dots, can also have alternative interpretations (Fig. 4.90). The dots may not function as coefficients in this context, or they could be part of the other calendrical glyph that appears below (5Z or 7Z). Because a calendrical glyph that con- sists in the pictograph of a human leg and foot is clearly present in the corpus of Xochicalco, and four examples have been documented there (Caso 1967a: 173, fig. 9), it 182</page><page sequence="200">Fig. 4.84 Known examples of glyph J in chronological order. seems advisable to retain Casos category despite the dif- ficulties of interpretation outlined above. Entries for leg and foot in Cordova s Vocabulario state the following: 1. Pierna de la rodilla abaxo Lacenijani (315) [Leg, from the knee down] 2. Pie o pies tener Ti^obanijaya (314) [To have a foot or feet] Because no link can be established between the ex- pressions for leg or foot and any of the day name roots, the correlation of glyph K will remain pending until 183</page><page sequence="201">Fig. 4.85 Constituent elements of glyph J. all the glyphic evidence is reviewed. The sign has not been attested in other parts of southwestern Mesoamerica. Except for its presence in Xochicalco, it is also unknown in other calendrical sys- tems from the central highlands.The noncalendrical pic- tograph of a leg and foot is used infrequendy in Zapotec epigraphy, although footprints are more common. Glyph L Glyph L was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of four examples. Regarding its iconographic interpretation, Caso stated, This glyph has a close resemblance with cer- tain variants of the Ollin glyph (Movement, Earthquake). In both instances, the central part is a stellar eye that, as can be demonstrated by the Aztec calendar stone, substitutes the face of Tonatiuh.The four volutes that accompany the eye (in glyph L) are similar to the four blades of the Ollin . (Caso 1928: 39) This comment has been invariably misinterpreted by other authors, because it has led to consideration of the glyph as homologous to the Nahuad sign Ollin. Consequendy, it has been "read" as "movement," which in turn denotes a correlation to the 17th position in the day list (Marcus 1976b: 45; Flannery and Marcus 1983a: 57; Marcus 1983a: 91; 1983h: 178, fig. 6.6 H; Flannery and Marcus 1990: 42; Marcus 1992: 36; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 130). To clarify Caso's comments, Figure 4.91 illustrates several variants of the Mexican glyph "Movement" and examples of glyph L. On the basis of certain simi- larities, Caso evidently established a purely morpho- logical resemblance between the two but not a se- mantic or a calendrical equivalence (cf. Caso 1965b: 939). He was aware that glyph L could not occupy the 17th position in the day list because that is the posi- tion of a year bearer, and glyph L never functions as such. Among effigy vessels is a group whose facial traits include scrolls in the eyes (cf. Caso and Bernal 1952: 94-100). From these naturalistic representations, it is evident that the central element of glyph L is the con- ventionalized depiction of a human eye. The current corpus includes 29 examples (Fig. 4.92). The earliest example (no. 1) occurs in stone 3 from San Jose Mogote (SJM-3), a monument that has been dated to the Rosario phase (Marcus 1976b; Flannery and Marcus 1990: 35-50; Marcus 1992: 36; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 129) (see Fig. 4.137, no. 7). Such a dating, how- ever, has been questioned on the basis of stylistic argu- ments (Whittaker 1983: 104; Justeson et al. 1985: 34; Pina Chan 1992: 66) and contextual arguments (Cahn and Winter 1993: 39-64). These critics consider that the carving could date as late as Monte Alban II or even to the period of Transition II-IIIa. If so, the avail- able sample of glyphs L would document a sequence of at least 1000 years. Throughout its developmental sequence, glyph L ex- hibits persistent conservatism. Except for a single oc- currence of a double, frontal, and three-dimensional rep- resentation (Fig. 4.92, no. 3) all the other instances of glyph L conform to a single variant. Having determined that the central element of the glyph is an eye, relevant entries in Cordova's Vocabulario state the following: 184</page><page sequence="202">Fig. 4.86 (A) Glyph J in urn headdresses with representations of plants, and (B) comparison of Glyph J with glyphs D and N. 1.

Ojos sumidos muy alia dentro como ymaginavan al diablo, como sin carne Laotega (289) [Deep sunken eyes, without flesh as they imagined the devil] 3. Ojos por la vista Laom (289) [Eyes to see] Common to all these words is the particle lao. There are three day name roots loo in Cordova's calendar: 11th, 16th, and 20th. Assuming that there is indeed a linguistic link between the term for "eye" and any of the loo roots, the specific correlation of glyph L to any of these three positions remains to be determined. Glyph L has been documented in the Mixteca de la Costa ( Jorrin 1974: 48, figs. 9c-d) and in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d) but not in the Mixteca Alta or in the central highlands (the only known example from Teotihuacan was found in the Oaxaca barrio) (Fig. 4.92, no. 2). The sign has not been attested as a noncalendrical version in Zapotec epigraphy. 185</page><page sequence="203">Fig. 4.87 MA-NP-9 and Caso's (1928) glyph K. Glyph M Originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of eight examples, glyph M was interpreted as the picto- graph of a serpent, with two main variants: (1) the head (sometimes with the body), and (2) the undulat- ing body (without the head). Later, Caso modified this category by removing the variants of headless bodies. These were then interpreted as representations of flow- ing water and designated with the letter M' (1 947 : 1 1 , 50, fig. 17; 1965b: 933, 934, fig. 4). The iconographic interpretation of glyph M as Cociyo (God of Lightning and Rain) , its function as a year bearer occupying the second position in the day list, and the linguistic support for such correlation have already been discussed. As a regular day name, this corpus includes 33 examples. These document a continuous sequence 18 6</page><page sequence="204">Fig. 4.88 Glyph K in MA-J-14 (after Caso 1947: 100, fig. 67). that spans from Monte Alban Ilia to Monte Alban Illb, that is, some 600 years (Fig. 4.93). However, as the ex- amples of bearer M demonstrate, the glyph dates back as early as Monte Alban I (see Fig. 4.14). Glyph M has been attested in the Mixteca Alta (Las Flores phase) (Caso 1938: 52, fig. 71), in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167; Urcid n.d.d), and probably in the Mixteca de la Costa (Urcid 1993). It also might be present in Xochicalco, where the glyph appears to have been incorrectly interpreted as the repre- sentation of the Alligator and linked to the first po- sition in the day list (Caso 1967a: 165, fig. la, 167, fig. 2a). Noncalendrical variants of glyph M occur in Zapotec epigraphy. 187</page><page sequence="205">Glyph N Defined on the basis of five examples, Caso (1928) interpreted glyph N as the stylized representation of a bat and recognized it as a bearer. Its position in the day list could not be determined. A purely morphological resemblance was noted between one of the examples and certain variants of the Maya glyph Ahaw, which occupies the 20th position. Later, in his commentary to the Mapa deTeozacualco, Caso proposed that glyph N perhaps represented an owl (1949a: 24). The ramifi- cations of this proposition have already been com- mented on in relation to bearer N and glyph F. The iconographic interpretation of glyph N as represent- ing the flower or fibers of a soap plant13 and its func- tion as a year bearer occupying the 12th position have already been discussed. As a regular day name this cor- pus includes 32 examples. These document a continu- ous sequence from Monte Alban II to Monte Alban IV, that is, some 1000 years (Fig. 4.94). Glyph N has been documented in a portable ob- ject attributed to a locality in the Mixteca Alta (Leon 1905b: pl. 1). It also was used as a calendrical sign in the Nuine script (Urcid n.d.d). It has not been at- tested in the calendrical systems of the central high- lands. Noncalendrical variants of glyph N occur in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph N Glyph N was first noted by Caso during the fourth field season at Monte Alban. At that time, the sign was considered a variant of glyph L (Caso 1935: 22). By 1938, when more examples had accumulated, its clas- sification as a variant of glyph L was questioned (Caso 1938: 77), but it was not until a later study that the glyph was given a new designation: By the way, the head with serpent mask and upturning nose was not included in the pre- vious study on Zapotec glyphs. We now des- ignate it as glyph N (letter not used in the 1928 classification). (Caso and Bernal 1952: 107) 13 The Nahuatl term for a plant that was used in the central highlands to make soap was amole , identified as Yuca elata (Schoenhals 1988). Glyph N could be the pictography of the white, fleshy flowers of this plant. Fig. 4.89 Two possible examples of glyph K in the Zapotec corpus. l88 +1200-1 MA. Va + 1000 = MA.

The attribute of the buccal mask actually involves two variants. One is straight and short and identical to the mask of glyph M. The other is upwardly retroflexed, as is the case in 190</page><page sequence="208">Fig. 4.93 Known examples of glyph M in chronological order. 191</page><page sequence="209">Fig. 4.94 Known examples of glyph N in chronological order. Figure 4.96. By using the attributes of (1) buccal mask, (2) volutes in the eyes, and (3) tied hairdo, it is possible to determine the range of variation that the glyph exhibits (Table 4.2). The most common attributes of glyph N are a ret- roflexed buccal mask, the absence of volutes in the eyes, and the occurrence of a tied hairdo. A tongue appears in only two cases. Although the volutes in the eyes are a variable trait, their presence in some ex- amples establishes a link of some kind between glyphs L and N. Glyph N also has its counterparts in the effigy vessels that were grouped by Caso and Bernal as "Dios del Mono en elTocado" (Fig. 4.97). In some narrative scenes, "personalized" non- calendrical versions of the glyph appear as if descend- ing from Caso's "Jaws of the Sky" glyph (Fig. 4.98). In one particular instance, the descending figure is calendrically identified in the headdress as 12L (no. 3). The configuration of the glyph, combining human and animal traits, and its personalized versions suggest that the glyph represents a human being capable of transforming, that is, a nahual.Thc nature of the rela- 192 â¦1000-^ 8 HA.

Calendrical examples of glyph N have been attested in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167; Urcid 1996, n.d.d). Although one example of the glyph (3N) has been reported from Castillo deTeayo, Veracruz (cf. Seler 1908: 448, fig. 51), the sign does not occur in the known calendrical systems of the central highlands. Noncalendrical usages of the glyph have not been at- tested in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph O Glyph O was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of three examples. The sign was interpreted as the pictograph of a monkey and was correlated to the 1 1th position in the day list. Currently, the corpus includes 42 examples. These document a long sequence from Monte Alban II to Monte Alb&amp;n Illb, spanning some 1000 years (Fig. 4. 99). The overall configuration of the glyph exhibits marked conservatism through- out the sequence. Two main variants can be distin- 193</page><page sequence="211">guished: profile and frontal representations. The latter, however, are infrequent. Both versions share the same attributes (Fig. 4.100A). Sometimes the animal appears with the teeth exposed (a), as if in a threatening ges- ture. Nine of the known cases include a small, fron- tally projecting tongue (although in one of these ex- amples the tongue is rather large and bifid) (see Fig. 4.99, no. 6). The threatening gesture and the project- ing tongue are also attributes of the Jaguar (glyph B) (Fig. 4.100B), but the treatment of the bulged fore- head (b), the rounded eye (c), and the anthropomor- phic ear (d) are distinctive attributes of glyph O that differentiate it from glyph B. Caso's correlation was based on the fact that in the great majority of Mesoamerican calendars the day name "Monkey" occupies the 1 1th position (see Table 3.6). In epigraphic terms, Caso's assignment is correct. In addition, there is linguistic support for this correla- tion. "Monkey" in Cordova's Vocabulario is as follows: 1 . Mono animal, vide mona Pixiyo [Monkey animal, see female monkey] pil/oo niguijo (273) 2. Mona animal, vide mico Pixiyo [Female monkey, see mico] Pillao Pilleo Pil/oo gonna (272v) Two of these expressions contain the particle loo, which is the main root for the 1 1th day. Although the 16th and 20th day names also have the root loo, the correspondence between the meaning of the 1 1th day name and the pictography of the sign tie glyph O se- curely to the latter position. This correlation simplifies the problem of anchoring glyph L (eye), which now can correspond to either the 16th or the 20th day name. Glyph O has been recorded in the Mixteca Alta (late Ramos phase) (Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43a-44a), in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167), and at Xochicalco (Caso 1967a: fig. 2h). In Zapotec epigraphy, glyph O is found infrequently in noncalendrical contexts. Glyph P Defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of two ex- amples, glyph P was described as a human head with lines in the face representing facial paint. Later, Caso (1947: 1 1) specifically interpreted the glyph as the rep- resentation of Xipe Totec. Eleven examples have been attested so far. These document a sequence from Monte Alban I to Monte Alban Illb, spanning more than 1000 years (Fig. 4. 101). Throughout this sequence, two vari- ants that appear to have chronological significance can be distinguished. The earliest versions are character- ized by a human head in left profile with or without lines across the eyes. These traits could place these ex- amples (nos. 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 4.101) as early vari- ants of glyph N and not P. The other variants also in- clude a human head in profile, but the lines in the face are angled. Sometimes these squarish lines occur in the back of the cheek, but in other instances the lines cross the eye. The head appears either in upright posi- tion (left and right profile) or facing downward. Seler's (1904b: 46) translation for the root of the 10th day tela was "with the head down." Cordova's Vocabulario states the following: 1 . Bocabaxo estar puesto asi Taaco teelaoz [To be faced down] cota tixobacofee/doa (57) 2. Boca abaxo cosa assi estar Naaco teelaoz [A thing facing down] noxobacotee/doa (57) 3. Cabe^a abaxo poner algo To^oquiquea (63 v) [To place something facing down] 4. Cabe^a abaxo ser puesto Ti^oquiquea (63v) [To place ones head with the face down] Only the two first entries contain expressions with the tela (teela) particle. Cruz (1935: 56) mentioned, however, that these expressions specifically refer to the face (lao).The state of being turned down is given by the particle tee and not tela. Considering this correc- tion and the translation already proposed for the root tela as "slipknot" (see discussion of glyph A), no link can be established between the 10th day and glyph P. Caso (1947: 11; 1967a: 173) argued for an icono- graphic relationship between the glyph and the Xipe Totec complex. In the Xochicalco corpus, there is a calendrical sign that bears a more direct resemblance to a skinned Xipe Totec mask (Fig. 4.102), and Caso considered the possibility that such a glyph could oc- cupy the 15th position in the day list because Xipe 194</page><page sequence="212">Fig. 4.95 Known examples of glyph N in chronological order. 195 +1200-1 HA.

Totec was regent of the Nahuatl day "Eagle." By tri- angulation - and implicitly - the Zapotec glyph P was correlated accordingly. The following are some rel- evant entries from Cordova s Vocabulario that provide linguistic data on the Xipe Totec complex in Oaxaca: 1 .

Dessollado assi Nipitoxi [To be so flayed] natoxitine quiti lati xahueni (134v) Nothing in these expressions can be related to the root of the 15th day naa, or, for that matter, to any of the other roots. Consequently, there is no apparent linguistic support for Casos implicit correlation, which, in addition, contradicts at this stage the tentative link between glyph J and the 15th day. Therefore, the cor- relation of glyph P remains pending. Aside from its possible occurrence as a calendrical sign in Xochicalco, glyph P has not been attested in other parts of the central highlands. Noncalendrical versions of the glyph appear infrequently in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph Q Caso (1928) defined glyph Q on the basis of one example. The sign was interpreted as the pictograph of a stone knife and correlated to the 18th position in the day list. Whittaker (n.d.: 34) proposed that the el- ement upon which the stone knife overlaps represents the sewed chest cut of a sacrificial victim. As men- Fig. 4.100 Attributes of (A) glyph O, and (B) glyph O compared with glyph B. 199</page><page sequence="217">Fig. 4.101 Known examples of glyph P in chronological order. tioned previously, Whittaker also correlated the glyph to the 18th position but, without basis, identified it as a bearer. So far only three examples have been attested. Two appear to pertain to Monte Alban II and the other one might be from Monte Alban Ilia (Fig. 4.103). However, such a chronological anchorage is uncer- tain. Caso (1965b: 941), for example, eventually con- 200 sidered that glyph Q was of Mixtec affiliation, an as- sessment apparently based on the judgment that the effigies containing two of the glyphic examples (nos. land 2) pertain to the Monte Alban V ceramic assem- blage. If correct, then the seriation presented in Figure 4.103 will have to be reversed. Both Caso s and Whittaker 's pictographic identifi- cations seem correct, although the third example in</page><page sequence="218">Fig. 4.102 Comparison of glyphs P from Xochicalco and Oaxaca. The Oaxaca example has been rotated 90 degrees. (Xochicalco sign after Caso 1967a: 174, fig. 10a). Figure 4.103 includes only the representation of the sewed chest cut. Thus, glyph Q can also be related to the XipeTotec complex. Casos correlation of the glyph is based on the fact that in several Mesoamerican cal- endars the name of the 18th day translates as "flint knife" or "sacrifice" (see Table 3.6). Entries in Cordovas Vocabulario for these words are as follows: 1 . Pedernal Quie que^a [Flint] (307) 2. Sacrificio lo que se ofrece o mata; Quij el primero y tercero son de promesa cona [Sacrifice, that which is offered or quee immolated; the first and third words (367 v) imply a covenant] 3. Piedra sobre que sacrificavan hombres Quie tiye [Stone upon which (314v) they sacrificed men] No link can be established between these expres- sions and the root of the 18th day name lopa or to any of the other roots. The root lopa actually can be translated as "humid," and by metonymic extension as "dew," as can be attested in the following entries from Cordova s Vocabulario (cf. also Fernandez de Miranda 1995:170, 201,209): 1. Vmedecerse o estarlo Zel/opdya [To get humid or to be humid] til/o/xiya tacanal/opoya (41 5v) 2. Vmidad por rocio del cielo Copa [humidity caused by dew xil lopa quie paa from the sky] (415v) 3. Rociada estar la tierra vmeda o pano vmido Til/opoyapi [Sprinkled, the earth to (36 lv) be humid, or wet cloth] 4. Rocio que cae o cuando cae del cielo Copa [Falling dew, or when it (36 lv) comes down from the sky] Seler (1904b: 52), on the other hand, translated the alternative roots opa and gopa as "cold" based on the corresponding entry in Cordovas Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 200v) and then argued for a link between coldness and stone (flint). Given the number of assumptions involved in the linguistic interpretations, the link between glyph Q and the 18th position rests basically on external data. Therefore, it is best to consider the correlation tentative until all the glyphic evidence is reviewed. In its calendrical version, glyph Q has also been docu- mented in the Mixteca Alta (late Ramos phase) (Caso 1956: pl. I). So far, the glyph is unknown in other calendrical systems from Hie central highlands. Repre- sentations of flint knives (but not of sewed chest cuts) occur as noncalendrical signs in Zapotec writing. Glyph R Glyph R was first defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of two examples, which occur on the same slab (Fig. 4.104, no. 1). Although the provenience of the 201</page><page sequence="219">stone is unknown, Caso considered the style of the relief as Mixtec. Only one other possible example of glyph R has been attested; it occurs on a carved stone whose stylistic affiliation is difficult to determine (Fig. 4. 104, no. 2). The identification of the calendrical glyph in the carving presents two alternatives. The numeral bar at the bottom either refers to the representation of the house or it relates to the sign carved in its en- trance. The latter alternative accordingly has been clas- sified as an example of glyph Theta. Whatever the case, even if three examples of glyph R are considered, its extremely low frequency in rela- tion to the other calendrical glyphs in the Zapotec corpus indicates that it is a rare variant. Furthermore, the style of the reliefs in the stones places the sign as a late form. This chronological placement is reinforced by resemblance to conventions in later calendrical sys- tems (Mixtec and Nahua), when the pictograph of a house was used to designate the third day. In Figure 4.105 the examples have been correlated to Monte Alban Va because of the persistence of the numeration system based on the use of bars and dots. Such usage might suggest that the two stones dis- cussed here are Zapotec products that partially reflect borrowing from Mixtec conventions and would be among the few available examples of the last stage in the development of the script before its replacement by the writing system exemplified in the carved bones from tomb 7 at Monte Alban, the Mida murals, and the Mixtec codices. On the basis of the external evi- dence alluded to previously, the glyph can be corre- lated to the 3rd position in the list, making it the later substitute of glyph F (the pictograph of an owl). As a calendrical sign, glyph R has been infrequently attested in the Mixteca Baja (Caso 1965a: 858, fig. 20, 860-861). It also has been documented in Xochicalco (Caso 1967a: 167, fig. 2b-c). Noncalendrical versions of glyph R appear in Zapotec inscriptions. Glyph S Glyph S was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of one example.The pictographic source from which the sign was derived remained unclear and, consequently, the glyph could not be linked to its po- sition in the day list. So far only one more example has been documented, although its coefficient may have 202 Fig. 4.103 Known examples of glyph Q in chronological order. eroded and is unattestable. The two known examples appear to pertain to the later part of Monte Alban Ilia or to early Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.106). Following the principle of pars pro toto , glyph S is one of the traits characteristic of the representations of human- turdes (Fig. 4. 107). This imagery, which has its coun-</page><page sequence="220">Fig. 4.104 Glyph R on stones MOX-6 and LGH-12534. terparts in Mixtec (Yahui) and Nahuatl (Xiuhcoatl) iconography, includes a stepped-tail, which glyph S represents.The sign also has been attested in Xochicalco but, because its resemblance to glyph S was not recog- nized, Caso designated the Xochicalco example as glyph Xi (1967a: 174-175). In the case of the latter, its association to the Xiuhcoatl imagery was noted. Fur- thermore, Caso suggested that glyph Xi occupied the 10th position in the day list because the calendrical name of Xiuhtecutli was 1 Dog (1 Itzcuintli) (ibid.: 175). The root of the 10th day in the Zapotec calendar is tela, yet the word for "dog" provided by Cordova is peco ([1578] 1987: 31 lv). Consequently, there is no linguistic support for correlating glyph S to the 10th position, a position that already has been secured for glyph A.14 Therefore, the link of glyph S to the day list remains pending. In its calendrical version, the glyph has been docu- mented in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d), in the Mixteca de la Costa, and in Guerrero (Caso 1967a: 175, fig. 1 lb-c). In Zapotec epigraphy, the sign has not been documented so far in contexts other than calendrical. To avoid the usage of Mixtec or Nahuatl ,4 Joseph Whitecotton (1982: 324) cites the entry in Cordova's Vocabulario for "domestic animal" [Casero animal domestico], mani zeela ([1578b] 1987: 75) and then hints at a similarity between tela and zeela. However, the assumption here is that the term necessarily refers to dog (a common and important domestic animal), and the phonetic differences between the two words would have to be justified. 203</page><page sequence="221">names to refer to a Zapotec image, the counterpart to the Yahui and the Xiuhcoatl is named arbitrarily "Xicani." This is the term given by Cordova for sor- cerer and necromancer (hechizero embay dor, nigromantico) ([1578b] 1987: 216v), which is the meaning of the Mixtec word Yahui (Smith 1973b: 63). The "Xicani" imagery in Oaxaca is pervasive and of great antiquity (Fig. 4.108). Glyph T This category involves the first modification to Caso's classification. In 1928 he created it to fit the glyph docu- mented in 1806 by Dupaix in a carved monolith from Monte Alban (SP-7b) (Fig. 4.109). Because the por- tion of the stone that contained the glyph was lost at the beginning of this century, the early drawing can- not be checked against the original. Recognizing that the reliability of the rendering could not be evaluated, Caso nevertheless viewed the glyph as the pictograph of a club with obsidian blades (pitanco in Zapotec and macuahuitl in Nahuatl).The contextual study of SP-7 indicates that the glyph in question appears below a year glyph. Consequently, Caso's glyph T is most likely a bearer E (see Fig. 5.39). With this correction, I now use the letter T to desig- nate the pictograph of the rabbit. Even though at least one example of the Rabbit glyph was already available in 1928, Caso did not detect its presence. To date, 10 examples are known, and these document a sequence from Monte Alban Ilia to Monte Alban Illb, that is, a span of some 600 years (Fig. 4.110). As mentioned in the discussion of the year bearers, the rabbit is represented with long ears, sometimes with two teeth sticking out from the upper lip, and usually is full-bodied. In some cases it appears as if seated or walking on its hind legs. Relevant entries in Cordova's Vocabulario are as follows: 1. Conejo peela (85) [Rabbit] 2. Liebre animal pelapillaana [Hare] (244v) Based apparently on the second entry, Seler trans- lated the root lana of the 6th day as "Rabbit." Whereas 204 Fig. 4.105 Known examples of glyph R in chronological order.</page><page sequence="222">Fig. 4.106 Known examples of glyph S in chronological order. the linkage of glyph T to the 6th position would be in conflict with the tentative placement of glyph H, "Rab- bit" is invariably the name of the 8th day in several Mesoamerican calendars (see Table 3.6). The Zapotec root for that day is lapa, which in turn was translated by Seler as "to divide, ""to cut up, ""to break in pieces" (1904b: 44). These translations apparently are based on an entry in Cordova s Vocabulario for the word "piece" [Peda^o: Laha, pellaha] ([1578] 1987: 307). In sum- mary, although there is no linguistic support to link glyph T to the eighth position, external evidence sug- gests such a correlation. A final assessment will remain pending until all the calendrical evidence is reviewed. In its calendrical version, glyph T appears in the Nuine script (Moser 1977), in the corpus from Xochicalco (Caso 1967a: 167, fig. 2f, 180, fig. 17b-c), Tula (De la Fuente Trejo, and Solana 1988: pl. 126), Teotenango (Alvarez 1983: 242, fig. 3, 245, fig. 4a), and Veracruz, particularly at ElTajin (Kampen 1972). The glyph is infrequently used as a noncalendrical sign in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph U This category involves the second modification to Caso s classification. In 1928 it included a single glyph, misidentified by him because of an inadequate ren- dering. Upon closer examination of the carved glyph, which occurs in a monolith at Monte Alban (NP-7b), I determined that it is actually a glyph 4M with a knot on top (Fig. 4.1 1 l).With this correction I now use the letter U to designate a glyph that was not available in the 1928 corpus. The function of glyph U as a year bearer occupying the 12th position, being therefore a variant of glyph N, has already been discussed. As a regular day name glyph, five examples have been re- corded. These document a continuous sequence from late Monte Alban II to Monte Alban Illb, that is, a span of about 700 years (Fig. 4.112). Glyph U is common in the iconography. It forms the face or appears in the headdresses of certain effigy vessels as well as in the headdresses of carved and painted personages. It is also pervasive in the epigra- phy, where it displays a number of forms and appears in multiple contexts (Fig. 4.1 13). The noncalendrical variants of glyph U resolve into two unfolded ver- 205</page><page sequence="223">Fig. 4.107 Human-turtles and derivations of glyph S. sions: one that occurs as pedestals in certain toponymic glyphs (no. 2) and another that presides over proces- sions and narrative scenes (no. 3). The latter in turn has two versions: the full and the abbreviated (nos. 3 and 4). The teeth in the full version sometimes appear filed, and the abbreviated form includes the eyes only. The derivation of forms 2 and 3 from form 1 illus- trated in Figure 4.1 13 was noted by Batres (1902: 21- 22) and formally demonstrated by Leigh (1958a: 3, figs. 35-38). The derivation of form 4 from 3 was pro- posed by Caso (1928: 79-A5). Figures 4.114 and 4.115 present, in chronological arrangement, the different manifestations of glyph U, embracing under a single complex disparate designa- tions like the "Jaws of the Sky" (Caso 1928), "Bird Deity of the Broad Beak" [Dios del Ave de PicoAncho] (Caso and Bernal 1952: 199-216), or "Cosmic Sky Dragon" (Shaplin n.d.). Although glyph U has been mistaken with representations of Cociyo (glyph M) (Caso 1928: 79) and variously interpreted as a serpent (Rickards 1918: 21) or an alligator (Leigh 1958b: 3; Edmonson 1988: 253a; Marcus 1992: 325), its pictog- raphy appears to derive from a bird. In the current corpus there is one unmistakable instance of glyph U as a winged creature (Urcid, Winter, and Matadamas 1994: 22, fig. 15). Caso and Bernal (1952: 215) and Taube (1988: 343) specifically suggest that the image derives from the buzzard.Taube (1987) has also pointed out its similarity to the "Principal Bird Deity" in Izapa and Maya iconography, an image that in several narra- tives assumes the role of Vucub Caquix, the mytho- logical bird that ruled the world at the time of cre- ation in the epic of the Popol Vuh. 206 During the Izapa horizon (300 B.C. to A.D. 300), the noncalendrical imagery of glyph U was certainly not exclusive to Oaxaca but had a wide geographic distri- bution throughout southern and southwestern Mesoamerica (Fig. 4.1 16) (see also note 5.25). Norman (1976: 319, fig. 6.35) actually sees the unfolded ver- sion of Zapotec glyph U as deriving from Olmec and Izapan elements. As a calendrical sign, however, glyph U has been attested only in the central valleys of Oaxaca, in the Mixteca Alta (Las Flores phase) (Caso 1939: 160, fig. 2), in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid 1996, n.d.d), and in Tula (cf. Caso 1941: 92, fig. 9; Caso and Bernal 1952: 213, fig. 350-III). Given the varied forms and contexts in which the imagery occurs, it appears to refer to a very important entity or concept. Because the unfolded version pre- siding over processions and narratives is usually found in mortuary contexts, glyph U seems to be associated with the dead as powerful ancestors, and has been taken as a symbol of royal descent (Marcus 1983i: 191). In Maya monuments, the "Principal Bird Deity" appears associated with ceremonies of succession and legiti- mation (Taube 1987: 8), a connection that seems to hold as well in the case of Zapotec narratives (Urcid 1995a: 19) (see Fig. 4.98). Glyph V This category involves the third revision to Caso's grouping. In 1928, the V category included a single glyph whose classification was based on a misidentification generated by an inappropriate ren-</page><page sequence="224">Fig. 4.108 "Xicani" imagery in Oaxaca (drawing no. 1 by Karl Taube). 207 1 .

The sign, which is actually a glyph N, occurs in a carved monolith from Monte Alban (NP-9c) (Fig. 4.1 17). The category V, as defined here, includes a vari- ant originally classed by Caso as an example of glyph M (1928: 41, fig. 18, no. VII). The glyph designated by Caso (1947) with the roman numeral VIII has also been incorporated in this group. The 26 currendy known examples document a con- tinuous sequence from Monte Alban II to Monte Alban Illb, that is, a span of about 1000 years (Fig. 4.118). Glyph V is one of the few signs that exhibits a wide range of variation. The variability, however, does not appear to have chronological significance. The imag- ery of the glyph is theriomorphic and includes the forms shown in Figure 4.1 19. The eye with the pecu- liar supraorbital plaque links variants 2 through 5. Vari- ants 4 and 5 depict the theriomorphic image with its snout open, showing fangs and a bifid tongue. This threatening gesture can be linked to the configura- tion of variant 2. Variant 1 can be related to variant 5 because both include the snout. The only example of the former, however, does not have fangs or a bifid tongue. The fifth variant can display simultaneously inward and outward bilateral symmetry (see examples 12 and 12' in Figure 4.1 18), conveying the idea of an image that encompasses the four directions of the world. This iconographic peculiarity suggests that the position of glyph V in the day list is number 1 . The Zapotec root for this day name is chilla, and this term, according to Cordova ([1578] 1987: 78), Fig. 4.109 MA-SP-7b (right) and Caso's glyph T (left) (Caso 1928: 43, fig. 20, and 143, fig. 42). 208</page><page sequence="226">Fig. 4.110 Known examples of glyph T in chronological order. 209</page><page sequence="227">translates as "alligator" [Cocodrillo, lagarto del agua; Pehopi chilla mani penne].That glyph V can be seen as the pictographic representation of an alligator as con- ceived by the native's mind is supported by its com- parison to the sign for the 1st day used in later calendrical systems (Fig. 4.120). Although in noncalendrical context the imagery of glyph V includes attributes of humans and snakes, these variations do not necessarily invalidate the correlation of the glyph to the 1st position in the day list (Fig. 4.121). As a glyph with coefficients, the sign has been at- tested in a portable object attributed to a locality from the Mixteca Alta (Leon 1905b: pl. 1). It also has been attested in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d).15 Glyph V is also a frequent element in Zapotec iconography (Fig. 4.122). In ceramics it appears in the headdresses of urns and whistles (cf. Caso and Bernal 1952: 164-169); it 15 The counterpart of glyph V in the calendrical system from Guerrero and those from the central highlands prior to the Nahuas appears to be the RE (Reptile's Eye) glyph. Except for a single instance in the Mixteca de la Costa (cf. Jorrin 1974: 38, fig. 4a; Urcid 1993: 156, fig. 18-3), the RE glyph has not been documented in Oaxaca. If the proposed equivalence (V = RE) is correct, the Zapotec evidence would favor Von Winning's correlation of the RE glyph to the first position and not Casos link to the second position (cf. Caso 1967a: 164-65). Fig. 4.111 MA-NP-7b and Caso's (1928) glyph U. 210</page><page sequence="228">appears as a mask in effigy vessels, in ornaments on garments, and in pedestals (C). In the case of box-urns, the image of glyph V is the invariable motif decorating the frontal side of the bases (no. 1 l).The noncalendrical version of the glyph appears also in the headdresses of carved and painted personages (D). There are also indi- cations that the imagery of glyph V was extensively used in the decoration of public architecture (B). In epigraphy, noncalendrical versions have also been docu- mented (A). Glyph W Glyph W was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of one example. By 1947, 10 more cases had been documented. The fact that glyph W sometimes appears accompanied by coefficients greater than 13, but so far not higher than 20, indicates that the sign is not a day name. Rather, it has a distinctive calendrical function. Consequently, the glyph is discussed in the section on special glyphs with coefficients later in this chapter. Glyph X Category X involves the fourth modification to Caso's classification. In 1928 it included a single glyph that was misidentified. The sign occurs on a carved monolith from Monte Alban (NP-5) and is an ex- ample of glyph G (the pictograph of a deer). There- fore, I now use the letter X to designate a glyph not attested in 1928 or in 1947 (Fig. 4. 123). The sign rep- resents a human face (a) that is usually topped by a headdress (b). It frequently wears a twisted broad band covering the lower part of the face (c), and has a nose ornament (d). Twenty-one examples have been re- corded so far. These document a sequence from Monte Alban I to Monte Alban Illb, a span of some 1200 years. However, there is a gap in the sequence, with no known examples pertaining to periods II and early Ilia (Fig. 4.124). Glyph P, one of the categories already discussed, also consists in the pictograph of a human face. That glyph X cannot be a variant of the former rests on two differ- ences. One is that the human head of glyph P is always represented in profile and is frequendy facing down- ward. The human head of glyph X can be represented Fig. 4.112 Known examples of glyph U in chronological order. 211</page><page sequence="229">Fig. 4.1 13 Derivation of unfolded pedestals and the "Jaws of the Sky" glyph from glyph U. in profile or in frontal view; so far, no example is known to appear facing downward. The other difference is that the human head of glyph P has squarish lines in the cheeks or sometimes crossing the eye, and it is devoid of a headdress. The human head of glyph X does not have similar lines but instead has a broad band covering the mandible. Also, it usually appears with a headdress, with ornaments in the ears and with a nose or lip plug. On the basis of this comparison, both glyphs appear to have mutually exclusive attributes. Four examples (Fig. 4.124, nos. 3, 10, 12, and 13) have a headdress in the shape of an owl. These cannot be confused with ver- sions of glyph F, because they invariably show the orna- ments characteristic of glyph X. The iconography of the glyph, therefore, suggests the representation of an important individual, one characterized by sumptuary goods. Relevant entries in Cordova's Vocabulario state the following: 212 1. Ombre de real condicion Peni/dc/zipaa [Man of royal lineage] /&lt;jc/iilana lachixe ni (290v) 2.

The expressions in entries 4 and 5 contain the particle lao, which resembles the root of the 16th and 20th day names (loo). On the basis of other entries in Cordovas Vocabulario (shown below), Seler translated the Zapotec root for the 20th day loo as "face" (1904b: 54), a linguistic alternative that also coincides with the iconography of the glyph and that can be linked by metonymy to the concept of "ruling lord" [Principal': 1. Cara hoyosa o cartihoyoso Peni lao (72) [Grave face] 2. Haz por el rostro o cara del hombre Lao [Semblance or face of men] loo piahui/doni (214v) 3. Haz o faz de qualquier cosa Laoni [The face of anything] loom (214v) Because the 16th day name also has the root loo, glyph X can be correlated to the 4th (lachi), the 16th (loo), or the 20th (loo) position. Consequently, the final link will remain pending until all the glyphic evi- dence is reviewed. As a sign with coefficients, glyph X has been at- tested in the Mixteca de la Costa (Brockington, Jorrin, and Long 1974: 65, fig. 19a) and in the Mixteca Baja (Urcid n.d.d). Examples outside southwestern Mesoamerica are known from Xochicalco (Caso 1967a: 174, fig. 10c) and Cacaxtla (Lombardo de Ruiz et al. 1986: 517, no. 44). In Zapotec epigraphy, the glyph is used as a noncalendrical sign. Glyph Y Glyph Y was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of one example, and the graphic source of the glyph was not apparent. So far 19 signs are known, and from these it becomes evident that the glyph is the pictograph of a snake. The attested examples docu- ment a continuous sequence from Monte Alban Ilia to Monte Alban Va, that is, a span of about 1000 years (Fig. 4. 125). The glyph exhibits two variants: (1) head in profile, and (2) complete and coiled body. So far the first variant clusters in Monte Alban Ilia and early Illb and might have fallen into disuse by late Illb, when the representation of the entire animal predominated. The entry for "snake" in Cordova s Vocabulario is as follows: 1 . Serpiente generalmente es generico, vide culebra Pellatoxo [Serpent, generic; see snake] pe//dtotija (378) 2. Biuora de las del caxcauel Pellacopijce [Rattlesnake, viper] toxo totija nichibaxono pixono (55v) 3. Culebra generalmente Pela [Snake in general] pella (102v) The term pela, however, does not match any of the day name roots. On the other hand, the name of the 5th day in several Mesoamerican calendars means "Snake," and the glyph occupying that position is also the pictograph of a serpent (see Table 3.6). Seler trans- lated the Zapotec root for the 5th day zee as "misfor- tune," "evil," "trouble," and "misery" (1904b: 42). Such translations apparendy are based on the following en- tries in Cordova s Vocabulario: 1 . Miseria o pobreza Quelanazij [Misery, indigence] gwe/dnachibaa (269v) 2.

Joseph Whitecotton (1982: 323) also argued along those lines, 21 6 noting that the snake was a major symbol of auguries and especially to bad omens (as can be observed in the last two entries above). However, because the correlation of glyph Y to the 5th position rests on external evidence and metaphorical associations, its link to the day list is tentative until all the calendrical evidence is reviewed. In its calendrical version, glyph Y has also been docu- mented in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167), in Teotenango,andinXochicalco (Caso 1967a: 162, fig. 19, 1.

Glyph Z Glyph Z was originally defined by Caso (1928) on the basis of four examples. The group, as defined here, also includes a category created by Caso (1947) and labeled M'. Caso, however, did not recognize the similarities between glyphs M' and Z. Thirty-six ex- amples are now known.

Throughout this sequence the glyph exhibits remarkable conservatism. 217</page><page sequence="235">Fig. 4.118 Known examples of glyph V in chronological order. 218</page><page sequence="236">Fig. 4.119 Variants of glyph V. The two recognizable variants are coeval through time and include (1) a vessel in cross section showing un- dulating lines inside, and (2) a cartouche with undu- lating parallel lines. One of the examples of the second variant (no. 8) includes scrolls over the undulating lines. Two other examples of the same variant (nos. 11 and 14) have noncalendrical versions of glyph J (maize) on top of the cartouches. There are two examples of the first variant (nos. 12 and 15) that include an eye reminis- cent of glyph V (Alligator). The configuration of both variants and the associations just noted indicate that glyph Z represents water. The term for "water" in Cordovas Vocabulario is rdga ([1578] 1987: 14), like one of the two roots for the 9th day. Furthermore, "water" is also the name of the 9th day in most of the calendrical systems from the central highlands and a few of the day lists from the Maya area (see Table 3.6). Therefore, through internal and external evidence, the link of glyph Z to the 9th position in the day list is well ascertained. This, at the same time, leaves position 19 as the most likely candidate for glyph C. Although one of the terms for the 9th day given by Cordova translates literally as "water," the main root is que^a. Seler translated it as "marble" or - based on the resolution of the root as "ezaa" - as "to come down" (1904b: 44). On the other hand, Joseph Whitecotton considers that the end particles on both roots (ca) derive from the entry in Cordova's Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 392) that refers to "substance that ema- nates from anything" [sustancia la que sale de qualquier cosa - zaa], and states, The association of niza, queza with water seems clear, literally, perhaps, "basic substance." The confusion with "stone" in Cordova prob- 219 Frontal view of an open snout (principle of pars pro toto) An eye surmounting a row of teeth (principle of pars pro toto) An isolated eye (principle of pars pro toto) Profile view of a zoomorphic head Frontal view of a zoomorphic head</page><page sequence="237">Fig. 4.120 The Mexican "Alligator" glyph and glyph V (drawing nos. 1-4 after Caso 1967a: 6, fig. 1A). ably stems from the fact that one word for stone in Zapotec is quia. This stone is literally quiezza and not quezaa (1st substance). (Whitecotton 1982: 324) To clarify the meaning of queÂ£a, it is necessary to present relevant entries in Cordova's Vocabulario: 1. Navajon de piedra con que sacrificavan Qwefaquietao [Stone blade with which (280v) they sacrificed] 2. Sacrificarse sacarse sangre de alguna parte del cuerpo con lanceta en orejas y en la lengua y en otras partes y en muslos To^ogwefdtiagaya [Self-sacrifice, to bleed lochia tozaaya oneself with a lancet from ticijchilochia the ears, tongue, from other coxi taotiagaya parts, and from the thighs] cototiagaya (367v) 3. Piedra negra de donde sacan navajas Piogo quega (314v) [Black stone from where they get blades] 220 4. Pedernal Qui tquega titij equij [Flint] (307) All these entries suggest that the term queÂ£a is associated with stones used for sacrifice and self- sacrifice. There are other relevant entries in Cordova's Vocabulario : 5. Piedra preciosa Quie queza [Precious stone] cache cachi quienachono (314v) 6. Relampago Laha quiepaa [Lightning] quega quiepaa laa tiapini^a tiapilaa (349v) No confusion on Cordova's part needs to be advo- cated because queÂ£a can be translated as "stone of lightning" (Terrence Kaufman, personal communica- tion, 1994), a metaphorical expression for obsidian and flint. Its "preciousness" derives from its use as a sacri- ficial instrument. The link between sacrifice and wa- ter would explain why the word que9a was used syn- onymously with the word ni^a.</page><page sequence="238">Fig. 4.121 Noncalendrical versions of (1) glyph V with human traits (arms and hands) and (2) with attributes of snakes (bifid tongue and body). Calendrical examples of glyph Z have been docu- mented in the Mixteca Alta (late Ramos phase) (Gaxiola 1984: figs. 43b-44b), in the Mixteca Baja (Moser 1977: 167), and in the Mixteca de la Costa (Brockington, Jorrin, and Long 1974: 65, fig. 19a). Outside Oaxaca, the glyph is known from eastern Guerrero (Pina Chan 1960: fig. 13),Xochicalco (Saenz 1966:26, photo 31),andTeotenango (Caso 1967a: 162, fig. 9). The glyph also appears as a noncalendrical sign in Zapotec inscriptions. Glyph a (Alpha) This and the following categories involve further modifications to Caso's classification. Most of these are actually additions to his original scheme. Glyph Alpha refers to the pictograph of an old man s head. The function of this glyph as a year bearer occupying the 17th position, being therefore a variant of glyph E, has already been discussed. Although examples of this sign as a regular day name might not be expected (be- 221</page><page sequence="239">Fig. 4.122 Multiple noncalendrical usages of glyph V (drawing no. 14 after Caso and Bernal 1952: 166, fig. 292a). cause it conveys only the notion of seniority in the context of annual dates), there is one possible example in this corpus (Fig. 4. 127). This glyph, which is part of a full-bodied representation, is repeated in three clay friezes that were part of a single mortuary program (Fig. 4.128). An alternative interpretation of the imag- ery can be made, however, because the numeral bar on top of the head (in CAM-2a and c) could be re- lated to the glyph and the dots placed in the posterior section of the old man's body. This other alternative has been classified as an example of glyph Kappa. 222 Glyph |3 (Beta) This category includes the glyph originally desig- nated by Caso (1947: 30) as IV. Its iconographic inter- pretation has been debated. Whereas Caso identified it as the pictograph of an arrowhead, others considered it the representation of a house (Macias n.d.b; Cook de Leonard 1961;Whittaker 1981; Edmonson 1988). Two lines of evidence support the former opinion. One of these, advanced by Caso himself, is compari- son of the glyph with representations of arrowheads</page><page sequence="240">in noncalendrical contexts (Fig. 4. 129). The other evi- dence is newly discovered epigraphic materials, which, although pertaining to later periods, demonstrate con- clusively that the Zapotecs used the pictograph of an arrowhead to name a day (Fig. 4.130, nos. 4 to 6). Two of these glyphs appear in a stela from Yaguila (YAG-1), in the Sierra de Ixtlan, north of the central valleys of Oaxaca (see Fig. 1.9, no. 3). One of these examples, however, is eroded and the presence of an accompa- nying coefficient cannot be confirmed. A third ex- ample is a glyph on a ceramic cylinder whose prove- nience might be Noriega or Zaachila (Urcid 1997, n.d.h).The six known instances of glyph Beta docu- ment a sequence from Monte Alban II to early Monte Alban IV, a span of some 1000 years. Nevertheless, there is a large temporal gap between the early and late examples. With regard to the term "arrowhead," Cordova s Vocabulario states, 1.

It also includes the infrequent root of the 13th day name (quij) recorded by Cordova. Further support to the linguistic evidence linking glyph Beta to the 13th position comes from Mixtec and central highland iconographic conventions, where the 13th day "Reed" is represented as the stem of an arrow or as the dart of a spear-thrower. Although the 13th position in the Zapotec list has been tenta- tively assigned to glyph D, glyph Beta could be a vari- ant form for this day name. As a sign with coefficients, the pictograph of an arrowhead has been attested in a portable object found in the Mixteca Alta (Cook de Leonard 1961). It also occurs in the Nuine script (Urcid n.d.d).The sign has been documented in the calendrical system from Xochicalco, although here it is represented as an ar- row-but. As noted before, the sign is used in Zapotec inscriptions as a noncalendrical glyph. This category includes a glyph that was not attested in 1928 or 1947. The sign consists in the representa- tion of the image of the Mixtec Dzahui and Nahuad Tlaloc, the god of lightning and rain. Previously, the occurrence of this imagery in Zapotec Oaxaca had been documented only in ceramic representations, where it did not appear accompanied by coefficients (Kowalewski and Truell 1970). Only four calendrical glyphs have been recorded so far, and these correspond to Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.131). The relationship between the ceramic and glyphic representations can be demonstrated by generating a two-dimensional rendering of the face in a remark- able effigy vessel housed in the Museo Frissell in Mida (Fig. 4.132). Based on this comparison, the attributes of the Dzahui and Tlaloc imagery in central Oaxaca include (a) a headdress of band or disk variety, (b) goggled eyes, (c) a human nose, (d) buccal mask with fangs, and (e) ears with ornaments. Given these traits, the four examples of glyph Gamma exhibit a peculiar range of variation. Example 3 in Figure 4.131 includes all the listed attributes. Example 4 differs by the quad- Fig. 4.123 Caso's (A) glyph X and (B) the new X category. 224</page><page sequence="242">Fig. 4.124 Known examples of glyph X in chronological order. 225</page><page sequence="243">Fig. 4.125 Known examples of glyph Y in chronological order. 226</page><page sequence="244">Fig. 4.126 Known examples of glyph Z in chronological order. 227</page><page sequence="245">Fig. 4.127 Possible example of glyph Alpha and its chronological placement. 228 ripartite goggled eye and the plain headband. Example 1 has all the defining traits except the human nose. In this case the nose appears to be covered by an exten- sion of the buccal mask. The headdress is of the over- lapping-disk variety. Example 2 does not have well defined goggled eyes, although this might be due to partial superposition by the headdress, which is a vari- ant of the overlapping-disk type. The buccal mask and the extension that covers the nose are identical to those in the first example. Because of these slight variations in the constellation of traits, the interpretation of the glyphic examples 1 and 2 as the "God with the Bow- knot in the Headdress" (" Dios del Mono en el Tocado") (Von Winning 1986: 120) is not warranted. Morphologically glyph Gamma closely resembles glyph M, particularly with regard to the mask (Fig. 4.133). As mentioned before, glyph M is the represen- tation of Cociyo. Because of the morphological and semantic correspondences between Cociyo, Dzahui, and Tlaloc, it could be postulated that glyphs M (the image of Cociyo) and Gamma (the image of Dzahui and Tlaloc) are equivalent. Yet, whereas the former is a well-attested year bearer, the latter has not been docu- mented as an annual marker. Furthermore, the images of Dzahui and Tlaloc are used in the Mixtec and Nahuatl calendars as the glyphic representation of the 19th day. Consequently, glyph Gamma could be cor- related to the 2nd or the 19th position in the day list. Its final linkage will be decided once all the calendrical evidence is reviewed. In its calendrical version glyph Gamma has not been attested in the Mixteca Baja. Curiously, it is also un- known from Teotihuacan, Xochicalco,Teotenango,Tula, or Cacaxtla. Noncalendrical versions of the glyph are used in Zapotec epigraphy. Glyph 8 (Delta) Glyph Delta had not been documented previously. Currently, five examples are known, and these cluster in Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.134). Its pictography is not readily apparent, but it appears to represent the tail end of a rattlesnake, showing one or two of the rattles.The entry in Cordova's Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 77) for "rattlesnake" [Caxcauel de bivora] has expres- sions that do not match any of the day name roots.

As a sign with coefficients, glyph Delta has not been documented in any other calendrical system from high- land Mesoamerica. Noncalendrical versions of the sign appear as sculptures in Rancho la Mora,Toluca, where they probably were used in architectural decorations (O'Neil 1990: 100, no. 36). It also has been documented as a noncalendrical glyph in Teotihuacan (Cabrera 1996) and in Zapotec inscriptions, and it frequently occurs in these graphic systems as ornaments in the garments of human figures (Fig. 4.135). Glyph Â£ (Epsilon) Glyph Epsilon had not been attested previously. Only two examples are known and both correspond to Monte Alban Illb (Fig. 4.136). Its pictography is not readily apparent. In some noncalendrical contexts the 230 glyph appears as an element associated with the mouths of jaguars, birds, and alligators (Fig. 4.137, nos. 1-3). The representation of bats in ceramic effigy vessels show, in the commissure of the creatures' mouth, a trait resembling glyph Epsilon (Fig. 4.137, nos. 4-5). The motif is also known from a large shell ornament (approximately 4.5 cm long) from the site of Fabrica San Jose (Drennan 1976: 229, fig. 78d) (Fig. 4. 137, no. 6). The fact that the ornament is perforated in the cir- cular portion indicates that it was suspended vertically, perhaps as a pendant or an earring. Similar motifs, al- though placed horizontally, were apparently carved in the stairway risers of Temple T at Monte Negro (Acosta and Romero 1992: 32; Flannery and Marcus 1983b: 101, fig. 4.10b). In stone SJM-3, the same sign punc- tuates the apparent stream of blood flowing from the chest of the sacrificial victim (Fig. 4.137, no. 7). Most of the iconographic associations noted above strongly suggest that glyph Epsilon represents a drop of</page><page sequence="248">Fig. 4.130 Known examples of glyph Beta in chronological order.

Con- sidering its proposed iconography, glyph Epsilon could be linked to the 9th position in lieu of the metaphori- cal reference to sacrifice linking the two names for that day (ni^a [water] and que9a [flint, obsidian]). How- ever, as proposed by Terrence Kaufman (personal com- munication, 1993), its correlation to the 18th position seems stronger because of the known meanings for the name of that day in other Mesoamerican day lists (see Table 3.6), which include "flint," "stone," "sharpened," "day of sacrifice," "to cut," and "to draw blood." Glyph Â£ (Zeta) One of the two known examples of glyph Zeta was classified by Caso (1928: 32, fig. 8 no. XIV) as glyph E (Fig. 4. 138, no. 1). Because both signs consist in a rounded cartouche divided in half by a vertical band, glyph Zeta actually might be a variant of glyph A (knot). If not, its pictographic source and position in the day list remain to be determined. Glyph T| (Eta) This category refers to Casos (1947: 101, fig. 68) group VII, although the only glyph in it was a noncalendrical sign. Currently, four examples are known (Fig. 4.139). The glyph consists in a plain cartouche that has a dot in the center. Although example no. 1 was originally in- terpreted by Caso (ibid.: 29, 100, fig. 67) as a variant of glyph D, glyph Eta shares only one of the attributes of glyph D, which is the dot.The pictography of glyph Eta is not apparent. Perhaps it represents a mirror, but the entry in Cordovas Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 185) for that word (Â« quiehuana [stone-image]) does not match any of the day names. Chronologically, the attested cases appear to span, discontinuously, from Monte Alban II to Monte Alban Illb, a sequence of some 1000 years. Given its infrequent representation, the sign easily could be the variant of any other glyph. Its pictographic source and position in the day list remain to be determined. Glyph 0 (Theta) This is a tentative category because three of the four examples are the result of alternative interpretations, and one was taken from a secondary rendering that could not be checked against the original relief (Fig. 4.140). As discussed in the context of glyph K, examples 1 and 2 may not be calendrical glyphs. Because of its context, 16 Caso and Bernal (1952: 71), however, interpreted this sign in the Bat effigy vessels as the tragus, that is, the fleshy promi- nence at the front of the external opening of the ear. 233</page><page sequence="251">Fig. 4.134 Glyphs Delta in chronological order. 234 example 4 has been classified alternatively as glyph R. All these tentative examples appear to represent some kind of a tied object. Chronologically, they document a sequence from Monte Alban Illb to Monte Alban Va, that is, a span of about 700 years. If these cases indeed conform a glyphic category, the pictographic source of the sign and its position in the day list remain to be determined. Glyph l (Iota) This is another tentative category because the two glyphs that conform it might not be accompanied by coefficients (Fig. 4.141). In the first sign, the cartouche of the glyph could stand simultaneously as the coeffi- cient 1 . Such conflation of signs has been clearly at- tested in two cases involving glyph E (see Fig. 4.76, nos. 4 and 12). With regard to the second example, the dot overlapping the U-shaped base just below the central foil might have a numerical value. If these two signs are indeed calendrical glyphs, their configuration would be similar to that of glyph D. Yet, they also differ because of the complete partition of the trifoliate element and the lack of the central dot. Per- haps these differences are part of a wider range of varia- tion for glyph D, so that glyph Iota could be simply a variant of it (Fig. 4.142). Glyph K (Kappa) This is another tentative category because the two glyphs that conform it might not be calendrical signs (Fig. 4.143). Glyph no. 2, for example, is the result of an alternative interpretation, and signs that bear a strong similarity to it are also known to occur as noncalendrical glyphs in the epigraphy. The context in which glyph no. 1 occurs suggests that the signs might have a func- tion other than a day name. The constituent attributes of the glyph include a trifoliate appendage surmount- ing a circular element with a U-shaped notch, a con- figuration reminiscent of glyph D. However, the differ- ences do not justify considering them as variants of the latter. If the two examples listed here are indeed calendrical versions, the pictographic source of glyph Kappa and its position in the day list will have to be determined when more data become available.</page><page sequence="252">Fig. 4.135 Noncalendrical examples of glyph Delta. Glyph X (Lambda) This is another tentative category because the single glyph that conforms it was derived not from the origi- nal carving but from the amplification of a slighdy over- exposed published photograph (Fig. 4. 144). Therefore, the reliability of the rendering cannot be assessed. The carved stone where this glyph occurs was documented at the end of the 1800s (Saville 1904: 54), and was ap- parendy vandalized and destroyed by the turn of the twentieth century (Leon 1905a: 178) (see also Fig. 2.3 and Note 2.1). The pictography of the sign is not ap- parent, but it resembles two opposing "speech" scrolls. Alternatively, it could be a variation of glyph Delta (tail of a rattlesnake). More data are needed to ascertain the validity of this category. 235</page><page sequence="253">Fig. 4.136 Glyphs Epsilon in chronological order. 236 Glyph [i (Mu) Glyph Mu was originally defined by Caso (1947) as glyph IX. I was unable to locate the stone where the glyph occurs and, therefore, Villagras rendering could not be checked against the original. Caso interpreted the glyph as an object with flames and noted its similar- ity to a noncalendrical glyph in MA-J-14, a monolith pertaining to the Monte Alban II corpus (Fig. 4. 145). 17 The glyph also can be seen as a glyph N. Until the original example is located and the available rendering is checked, or until more examples are found, glyph Mu will remain a tentative category. Glyph V (Nu) The sign Nu was defined by Caso (1947) as glyph VI (Fig. 4.146). He recognized that the only example in the category was very eroded, and its configuration cannot be determined. Thus, the Nu category will re- main tentative. Reconstructing the Glyphic Day List Now that the available calendrical data have been re- viewed, it is possible to proceed with an overall recon- struction of the day list. Table 4.3 summarizes the re- sults of the previous analysis. Six glyphs (E, G, M, N, U, and Alpha) have been securely linked, by virtue of their calendrical function, as main and variant year bearers. Four more glyphs (A, O, Z, and Beta) are also securely placed because of the correspondences between the graphic representation of the glyphs and the translation of Cordova's day names. The positions of four other glyphs (F, R, V, and Epsilon) have also been confirmed, not by linguistic data but mainly by iconographic or external evidence. The anchorage of seven glyphs (B, H, J, Q,T, Y, and Delta), although tentatively based on external evidence, does not conflict with any of the other proposed cor- relations. Glyphs Y and Delta appear to be actually part of a single category characterized by a wider range of variation that included fiill and pars pro toto versions. 17 In Caso s publication, glyph Mu was printed upside down (1947: 101, fig. 68 bottom). The error was corrected in a sub- sequent work (1965b: 935, fig. 10).</page><page sequence="254">Fig. 4.137 Noncalendrical examples of glyph Epsilon. 1 . MA-TR/20-t/104 pedestal of urn in facade 2.

The linkage of three glyphs (C, D, and Gamma) is also tentative because they apparently conflict with proposed or secured positions. Glyph D can be linked to the 13th position, which is already occupied by glyph Beta. Glyph Gamma can be linked to the 2nd or 19th position, with the latter being proposed for glyph C as well. There are two signs, L and X, whose position is unknown but the correlation options are limited, involving, respectively, positions 16 or 20 and 4, 16, or 20. Depending on the correlation of glyph X, the 4th position in the day list might remain vacant. Finally, there are 12 glyphs (K, N, P, S, Zeta, Eta,Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Nu) whose position in the list cannot be determined. To reconstruct the day list one point must be stressed: it is evident from the discussion of the year bearers, from a few of the day name glyphs, and from the total num- ber of different calendrical categories (32 if the tenta- tive groups are not counted and glyphs I and W are excluded), that some of the positions in the day list can have at least two different glyphic forms. To determine which are the main glyphs and which are variants, the histogram in Figure 4.147 compares the relative fre- quencies for all the day name signs (with the exclusion of those examples acting as year bearers). Because it can be assumed that the sample is random, the least represented glyphs must be the occasional vari- ants for those with higher relative frequencies. As ex- pected by the structural properties of the calendar, the histogram separates 20 signs.These are the ones for which at least 10 examples in each group have been docu- mented. Of these, the least represented signs are glyphs 240 P and T. The best represented main signs are glyphs E, B, O, and D. At the bottom of the histogram are 18 signs for which 6 or fewer examples in each category have been attested. In the course of the previous analysis, it was possible to determine the correspondences between few of these variant forms and certain main glyphs (glyphs Alpha to E, R to F, U to N, Beta to D, and Delta to Y) (Table 4.4). Because 20 main signs are well de- fined, the problem of finding their position in the day list is simplified to a certain degree. But to proceed it is necessary first to relate the remaining variants to the main signs for which they are infrequent substitutes. In doing so, the last six categories, including glyphs Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Nu, are excluded be- cause they are defined on the basis of dubious or single glyphic examples. The links between main and variant forms can be elucidated by resorting to the documented chronological differences, linguistic similarities in the names of the objects they represent, iconographic re- semblances, and external comparisons. Correlation of Variant Glyphs to Main Day Signs Glyph K ("Leg-Foot" sign). Assuming that the K cat- egory (see Fig. 4.89) is indeed part of the Zapotec calendrical conventions, there are indirect but conflict- ing leads to determine its position in the day list. Gor- don Whittaker (1986: 57), while discussing three Venus deities in the Dresden codex whose hieroglyphic names appear to be Nahuad words rendered phonetically in Maya script, proposed that the Xochicalco "Leg-Foot"</page><page sequence="258">Fig. 4.143 Glyphs Kappa. Fig. 4.144 Glyph Lambda. 241</page><page sequence="259">Fig. 4.145 Calendrical (right) and noncalendrical (left) versions of Glyph Mu. glyph could occupy the fourth position in the day list (equivalent to Nahuatl Lizard). I originally correlated the tentative Zapotec examples to the fifth position based on the translations of such a day in a list from Momostenango, Guatemala, which are rendered as "ser- pent" and "walker" or "traveler" (Urcid n.d.c, 1: 191) (see Table 3.6). An argument by Jansen (1996: 27-28) on the identification of a prominent figure in the Mixtec codices named 4 Jaguar as theToltec ruler known from other sources as Topiltzin or Nacxitl (a contraction of naui icxitl , meaning "4 Foot") suggests that the Xochicalco "Leg-Foot" glyph is equivalent to the 14th day name "Jaguar." A fourth possibility, which does not relate to calendrical glyphs and may be linguistically specific, comes from metaphoric speech in Mixtec, where the word "foot" is homophonous to "arrow" [nduvua] (Jansen 1985: 10). When depicted with a "flame" sign, the noncalendrical "foot" glyph has been taken as a metaphor for "war" (Anders, Jansen, and Jimenez 1992: 158, n. 13). If this metaphor was com- mon to several Mesoamerican peoples, then glyph K (Leg-Foot) could have been a variant of the 13th day name (Reed, Arrow). The four leads discussed above are based on clues from Maya,Toltec, and Mixtec sources. One might as- sume that an internal analysis of the Xochicalco epi- graphic material, where the presence of glyph K is irre- futable, could help resolve the contradictions generated by these leads. By conducting a rigorous classification of 91 calendrical glyphs from Xochicalco (Urcid n.d.g), signs for the 4th (Lizard), 5th (Serpent), and 13th (Reed) are readily apparent. Concomitandy, the pictograph of Jaguar has not been attested at Xochicalco. For now, the use of a "Foot" glyph in Zapotec writing remains pro- visional, and the correlation of the Zapotec and Xochicalco examples can be tentatively narrowed down to the 14th position (Jaguar). 242 Fig. 4.146 Glyph Nu.</page><page sequence="260">Table 4.3 Summary of Analysis of Zapotec Calendrical Glyphs Iconographic Correlation Position Link to deity Id. interpretation in day list complexes in urns A Knot Secure 10th B Jaguar Tentative 14th Dios Jaguar C Drop ?

On the basis of its iconography, glyph Q (see Fig. 4.103) is being linked with glyph P. The association rests on the assumption that glyph P, as Caso suggested, is indeed a representa- tion of Xipe Totec. Both are then related to each other by the theme of human sacrifice. Whereas the known examples of glyph Q date exclusively to Monte Alban II, the examples of glyph P pertain mainly to later peri- ods. By grouping them together, the temporal gap is filled and a more complete chronological sequence re- sults. Furthermore, by virtue of the presumed linkage of glyph Q to the day list, glyph P is, by default, corre- lated to the 18th position. Glyph Epsilon (drop of blood), which also has been correlated to that position, would have been the coeval variant of glyph P. Glyph S ("Xicani tail" sign). Following iconographic criteria, glyph S (see Fig. 4. 1 06) is being linked to glyph N. One of the most consistent attributes of glyph N is the upwardly retroflexed buccal mask, which is another defining trait of the "Xicani9 representations (Fig. 4.148). Glyph Gamma ("Tlaloc" glyph). As commented above, glyph Gamma (see Fig. 4.131) could correspond to ei- ther the 2nd or the 19th position in the day list. In the case of the first alternative, it would be a variant of glyph M; if not, it would be a variant of glyph C. Because, on the one hand, the glyph has not been attested as a year bearer (2nd place), and, on the other hand, the imagery of Dzahui and Tlaloc was used as the glyph for the 19th position in later calendrical systems, it seems more per- suasive to propose the second alternative (Fig. 4.149). The link of glyphs Gamma and C is reinforced by the fact that the latter is a frequent sign in ceramic effigy vessels related to water, rain, and maize deity complexes; it is particularly associated with representations of Cociyo, the Zapotec homologue of Dzahui and Tlaloc. Glyphs Zeta and Eta. Glyphs Zeta and Eta (see Figs. 4.138 and 4.139) cannot be linked with any of the other main signs. More epigraphic data is needed to verify the first category and to elucidate their graphic source. Correlation of Main and Variant Signs in the Day List Now that some variants have been linked to the main signs, the final correlation problems can be considered. Table 4.5, arranged as a day list, summarizes the results of the previous analyses. There are seven tentative cor- relations; none contradicts another. Thus, the linkage of glyphs Y, H,T, D, and B is ascertained on the basis of external evidence. These glyphs occupy the suggested positions in most of the Mesoamerican day lists. Now that 15 places are occupied, the anchorage of glyphs J and C - based, respectively, on metaphorical or icono- graphic arguments - appears secure. The problems that remain to be solved are (1) the specific correlation of glyph L to the 16th or 20th position; (2) the specific linkage of glyph X to the 4th, 16th, or 20th position; and (3) the placement of glyphs N/S. Glyphs L and X. The correspondences between the pictography of glyphs L and X (eye and face) (see Figs. 4.92 and 4.124) and the meanings of the 16th and 20th day name roots (loo, meaning eye or face) make both signs equal candidates for either position. The Maya day list, however, provides a clue because the name of the 20th day, Ahaw, means "leader" or "lord" (Seler 1904b: 54; Stuart and Houston 1989: 86). The fact that glyph X shows headgear, earspools, nose plugs, and lip plugs (all sumptuary goods reserved for the elite) and that the term for "ruling lord" [Principal] recorded by Cordova includes the particle lao, indicates that glyph X correlates with the 20th position. By anchoring glyph X accordingly, glyph L is - by process of elimination - correlated to the 16th place, and the 4th position re- mains vacant. Glyphs N and S. Although the correlation of glyphs N and S (see Figs. 4.95 and 4.106) with the 4th day name is by default, there are some clues that provide additional support for it. In Cordova s Vocabulario there are a number of interesting entries that also involve the term lachi: 1.Jugar ala pelota de los yndios con las nalgas Tiquija lachi [To play the ball the indians, cotija with their buttocks] quiquijaya tiquijaya (225) 2.

Several of these have been found in the rubble of ballcourts in the Sola de Vega region (Berlin 1951) as well as at Monte Alban and Yagul (Fig. 4. 150). This association has also been docu- mented in the Mixtec historical codices, where the imagery of Yahui (homologue of "Xicani") appears in close relationship to representations of ballcourts (see Fig. 4.108, no. 14). A well-documented attribute of the "Xicani" and Yahui imagery is as a sacrificer, an activity intimately related to the ballgame.18 A Final Calendrical List Now that the positions of glyphs L, X, and N/S have been determined, it is possible to summarize the results. Figure 4.151 presents a type glyphic day list indicating the position of the year bearers in the solar count as well as the position of the days that marked the quadripartite division of the sacred calendar. This latter datum is taken from Cordova ([1578] 1886). Fig- ure 4.152, which is a condensation of the previous chronological charts, shows the Zapotec day list through time until its eventual replacement by the Mixtec conventions epitomized by examples in the Nuttall codex. Table 4.6 summarizes in a matrix the coefficients of the day glyphs that have been attested so far. Special Glyphs with Coefficients While the day glyphs were being analyzed, two signs were separated because of their apparently special func- tion: glyphs I and W. Glyph I This glyph has the shape of a Maltese cross and, un- like most of the other glyphs, its pictography is not readily apparent. Twenty-five examples have been at- tested so far. Figures 4.153 and 4.154 present 23 of them in their epigraphic contexts. Of these, only one case pertains to Monte Alban II (no. 1); the others date to Monte Alban Ilia and Monte Alban Illb. Of the Monte Alban III inscriptions, those identified with numbers 2, 3, 13, 17, 19, and 20 contain versions of the sign accompanied by coefficients. Being 6 of 23, the calendrical versions represent 26 percent of the sample. Viewed in their epigraphic contexts, the calendrical versions of glyph I have their numerals distinguished from those associated with other calendrical glyphs within the same inscription. For example, the coeffi- cient of the glyph 71 on MA-TR/20-t/104-lc (no. 18 Smith (1973b: 63) cites the entry for Yahui in the Alvarado Spanish-Mixtec dictionary as "a witch or wizard, another im- personator who flew through the air," adding that such char- acterization matches representations of the Turtle-Xiuhcoatl in Mixtec manuscripts where the figure is shown as if "fly- ing." Jansen (1981: 94) describes the main uses and meanings of the Yahui imagery in the Mixtec corpus as names of indi- viduals, nahual of certain persons who are capable of trans- forming themselves into "balls of fire," a religious specialty of certain priests who performed sacrifices and were addressed as iya yahui (lord the necromancer), and image of the mythical entity itself. All these usages are present in the Zapotec corpus. There are also 17th-century documentary sources that cite an example of nahualismo from the Zapotec town of Yagavila, in the Sierra de Juarez. The story narrates that a neophyte was instructed by his teacher to go to the lake and ask to be a necromancer. While sacrificing a chicken, he implored, "You, lightning of this place, make me become fire and glow that could go anywhere." Indeed, he became fire and began to fly. To transform himself, the necromancer went to desolated places, where he could abandon his body. On one occasion, to take revenge of an enemy, he abducted the enemy's newborn son and, flying, took him to the lake, where he sacrificed the litde creature, beheading him and taking out his heart (Alcina Franch 1971:24-25). 247</page><page sequence="265">Fig. 4.148 Glyphs N and S and the imagery of "Xicani."

The bar lacks the diagonal bands and the dots are de- void of inner U-shaped marks, traits that occur in the coefficients of most of the other glyphs in the relief. The calendrical glyph immediately above (6Y) also has a plain bar and a plain dot, but the disposition of the numeral is in accord with the norm. The glyph 91 on MA-PH-la (no. 19) has a plain bar above the sign and four plain dots below it, but the numerals of sev- eral of the other glyphs on the same stela have inner marks in the dots and the diagonal lines in the bars. Example 31 on CCA-t/5-mural text I (no. 13) is dis- tinguished by having the dots of the coefficient delin- eated by a black line. The numerals of the other 249</page><page sequence="267">calendrical glyphs in the text are filled in with red paint. This purposeful differentiation applies also to the other three examples (nos. 3, 17, and 20). A further clue for a special function of glyph I is provided by the inscription on MNA-1 (Fig. 4.155). The text on this stone has a linear arrangement that begins with a year glyph placed at the bottom left. The inscription proceeds from left to right, along the lateral border of the slab, and ends, from right to left, on the upper side. In this linear sequence, glyph I appears in second po- sition and forms part of a conglomerate with the signs immediately above and below it. If the glyphs are ar- ranged in a single line with the year glyph on top, the resulting format on MNA-1 can be used as a model, and most of the other inscriptions that involve glyph I can be arranged to follow, with minor variations, the same sequence (Figs. 4.156 and 4.157). By doing so, however, the compounds with glyph I end up occu- pying a third position. Besides the I signs, the con- glomerates include hands, repeated cartouches, human heads, bird heads, and other signs. Some of these glyphs occur several times but in different combinations (Fig. 4.158B-F). The gestures of some hands and the re- peated cartouches suggest that at least some of the com- pounds are counts of some kind of units. So far, the values of the coefficients in the calendrical versions are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, that is, odd numbers (Fig. 4.158A). Glyph I resembles the "completion" sign in Maya epigraphy (Fig. 4.159, no. l).The sign also appears in the cosmogram of Codex Fejervary-Mayer. By includ- ing the four cardinal directions, the associated sacred trees, birds, colors, series of the 9 Lords of the Night, and the 20 day signs of the calendar, this chart conveys the notion of "wholeness," all framed by the symbol in the shape of the Maltese cross (Fig. 4.159, no. 3). The same sign appears in connection to the New Fire ceremony (and hence the completion of the 52-year cycle) among the Aztecs of central Mexico. In page 34 of Codex Borbonicus, the "Maltese cross" occurs in the lintel and the jambs of the temple where the New Fire is burning (Fig. 4.159, no. 2). As a pan-Mesoamerican symbol, the sign appears to be related to the concept of "completion" and hence it is plausible that, in the standard sequence shown in Figures 4.156 and 4.157, the conglomerates with glyph I in the third position may deal with counts of certain units and with period endings. Incidentally, at least eight of these inscriptions come from funerary contexts. Al- 250 though others were not found in tombs, their con- tent appears to be preeminently genealogical. Five of the noncalendrical versions of glyph I ap- pear on the carved stones identified with numbers 10, 11, 15, and 16 in Figures 4.153 and 4.154. The glyph in these contexts evidently has another function, be- cause the epigraphy does not consist of texts that can be arranged to conform with the sequence on MNA- 1. In these short inscriptions, glyph I appears in close association with calendrical signs, which undoubtedly refer to names of individuals and do not have chro- nological value. Glyph I then might have a nomina- tive function as the personal name that complements the calendrical appellative. This also might be the func- tion of glyph I on stone no. 1 in Figure 4.153, where the sign accompanies a noncalendrical glyph B. In this case it may be a composite personal name that identifies the depicted personage. Two more examples of glyph I deserve particular con- sideration (Fig. 4.160). One of these appears on a stone figure reportedly found in the southern portion of the state of Puebla. Although the object might not be a product from central Oaxaca, the three signs incised on it resemble the glyphic conventions of the Zapotec script. The remaining example of glyph I occurs in an unprovenanced, yet typical, Zapotec effigy vessel. Glyph I is present in these two objects as a discrete glyph with a numeral, suggesting a fourth epigraphic function: a day sign that refers to a calendrical name. Its infrequency relative to the other day signs makes it a rare variant. Whittaker (n.d.: 40) and Terrence Kaufman (personal communication, 1993) interpret glyph I as a representation of the sun, and Kaufman actually proposes a correlation of the sign to the 16th position based on etymological analysis of eastern and western Maya names for such a day (aj map and chaVin , meaning "sun god"). As already shown in Figure 4.151, glyph I would be a rare substitute of glyph L when used as a day name. Glyph W The graphic origin of this sign is not apparent, and Caso undoubtedly designated it so because of its gen- eral resemblance to the letter W (Caso 1928: 43, fig. 20, 1947: 99, pl. 66, 1965b: 939, fig. 14). Whittaker (1983: 109) argues that the sign "takes in fact the form of a conventionalized half-moon," and Pina Chan</page><page sequence="268">4 a &lt;D JCJ T3 t&gt; C O Â« &lt;U 4-&gt; ?a U O m w&gt; Â£ 251</page><page sequence="269">Fig. 4.151 Type Zapotec glyphic day list. 252 Name of day in 16th- Approximate meaning Letters Glyph century Zapotec in English * 1 Chilla Alligator V (?)

As men- tioned in Chapter 2, the occurrence of this sign with coefficients of value greater than 13 and less than 20 led initially to three hypotheses about its meaning: 1 . Caso proposed that the glyph represents a month whose coefficient gives the position of a day within it. The inscriptions contain- ing glyph W usually have several glyphs with coefficients, and Caso never pointed out spe- cifically the presumed day signs being an- chored by the given "months." 2. Whittaker suggested that the glyph rep- resents the period of 13 days (trecena). The co- efficient of glyph W in this case would indi- cate the position of the trecena within the sa- 254 cred calendar. Other glyphs with numerals in the same inscriptions were also interpreted by Whittaker as day dates, and it was assumed that the trecena sign had to be direcdy associated with one of these. Whittaker specified which day sign is associated with each of the examples of glyph W. Thus, because the day is anchored to a trecena and the position of the trecena in the sacred calendar is known, this anchorage provides a device by which the specific posi- tion of calendrical glyphs in the day list can be determined. And in Whittaker s reconstruction of the list (Fig. 4.161), the correlations of glyphs V (first position), Beta (3rd position), X (1 1th position), Lambda (19th position), and P (20thposition) were accomplished by plotting the particular examples on the inscriptions</page><page sequence="272">HH Jl % oh oh 43 1 s o .Oh u âº2 CO Â£ 255</page><page sequence="273">4-&gt; a o 15b â¢fl | Â§ o 'X3 a.

Edmonson proposed that glyph W is not the glyph of a month, but the glyph for "month." This interpretation implies that the coefficient of glyph W gives its position in the solar cycle. Edmonson also stated that, in some instances, the inscriptions contain com- plete dates (year, month, day) but that the month designation was omitted when a day name of the sacred calendar occurred only once in the solar cycle. To clarify ambiguity, it was only when a day name of the sacred calendar occurred twice in a year that glyph W was inscribed. The author also argued that at Monte Alban two different calendrical sys- tems that anchored day dates by their posi- tion in the year and the month were used simultaneously: one presumably attributed to the Olmecs and the other to the Zapotecs (Edmonson 1988: 22-25). 19 In some specific instances, he failed to point out exactly which day sign forms part of the triple or "com- plete" calendrical reckoning. These three hypotheses have a fundamental assump- tion in common: glyph W and some of the other signs with coefficients in the same inscriptions have a chro- nological function. There are, however, major differ- ences between the hypotheses. Caso's and Edmonson's propositions imply that glyph W is part of the solar calendar, thus providing a triple anchorage for a given date, whereas Whittaker's proposal implies that the sign is part of the sacred calendar, thus providing a double anchorage for a given date. Because of these anchor- ages, the three hypotheses can be tested by using the model of year bearers E-M-G-N and the reconstruc- tion of the glyphic day list proposed here. Yet, the data on glyph W need to be evaluated first. Available Evidence on Glyph W. Figure 4.162 includes instances in which glyph W appears accompanied by coefficients, with examples pertaining to Monte Alban I at the bottom and those of Monte Alban II at the top. In the earlier examples, glyph W always occurs immediately below a calendrical glyph, and the latter 258 has fingers as coefficients. Other calendrical signs within the same inscriptions have their numerals represented by means of bars and dots. The direct association of glyph W with signs whose coefficients are marked by fingers seems significant. The glyph W on MA-M-21 is peculiar because only half of the sign is represented, and this half appears rotated 90 degrees. Caso did not consider that this variation had any relevance. Whittaker, however, proposed that the half-sign refers to a "solar trecena."20 Edmonson (1988: 22, 273), on the other hand, suggested that it was the name of a specific month (which he designated "month P"). The calendrical signs accompanying glyph W in the early inscriptions have different interpretations. The one on MA-M-140 has been classed as glyph P (Caso and Urcid), or as the glyph occupying the 20th posi- tion in the Zapotec day list (Whittaker), and in the presumed Olmec day list (Edmonson). The signs above glyph W on MA-D-142 and on MA-M-21 were in- terpreted by Caso, Whittaker, and Edmonson as an ex- ample of glyph O. Here, they are being grouped as an early glyph X. Despite this last discrepancy, the gen- eral agreement is that both examples are of the same kind (either O or X).The texts that contain these ex- amples of glyph W appear to be incomplete. Yet, hy- pothetical reconstructions of the inscriptions suggest that the glyph might have had a specific position in the texts, with only minor variations (Fig. 4. 163). 21 19 The evidence that Edmonson (1988: 16, 227-231) presents for postulating an Olmec glyphic calendar is, in my opinion, not convincing. 20 The proposed "solar trecena " is a count for which there is no ethnohistoric evidence anywhere in Mesoamerica. Although Whittaker (n.d.: 39-40) states that the "fixed solar trecena " was anchored to the solar cycle, his hypothetical count rather would be an independent series, because by starting invariably on the first day of the year, the count of "solar trecenas" would not begin with coefficient 1 and the initial day of the sacred count. Whittaker states that "my hypothetical solar trecena begins on the first day of the year and counts . . . through the end of the 28th trecena and the completion of the solar year" (ibid.: 40). Yet, 28 x 13 = 364 and not 365. Therefore, his "hypothesis" also implies that the last day had to be skipped in order to begin the count again on the first day of the following year. 21 If the reconstruction of these texts is correct, then during Monte Alban I there were several reading formats: (1) from top to bottom and left to right, (2) from top to bottom and right to left, and (3) from bottom to top and left to right.</page><page sequence="276">The examples of glyph W that pertain to Monte Alban II show a wider range of glyphic associations. In at least three instances the sign clearly appears im- mediately below a calendrical glyph (once on MA-J- 13 and twice on MA-J-14, at D5/6 and E4/5).The example on MA-J-10 undoubtedly followed this pat- tern, but the calendrical glyph on top is now obliter- ated. The glyph W itself is highly eroded too. The third occurrence of W glyphs on MA-J-14 (at D3) appar- ently presents two alternative associations: 1. If the common pattern is followed (i.e., glyph W immediately below a calendrical glyph), then this example is associated to the glyph 10P (at D2). Except for the lack of lines crossing the human face, a missing trait that could be due to erosion, this P glyph is iden- tical to those on MA-D-140 and MA-J-13. Despite the different interpretations, all the authors agree on this similarity. However, un- dulating bars to represent the coefficient would be a unique case in this corpus. Alter- natively, the signs above glyph W can be taken as noncalendrical instances of glyphs Z (Wa- ter) and P (XipeTotec). 2. There is another calendrical glyph im- mediately below glyph W (at D4). Its coeffi- cient is indicated by two fingers. Given the association of such a numeration system and glyph W in the inscriptions from Monte Alban I, the lower calendrical glyph 2V can be taken as being associated with glyph W, but the inverted arrangement between the two signs would be unique. Whittaker followed this al- ternative. Edmonson's position in this case is unclear. Of the remaining examples of glyph W from Monte Alban II, the fourth occurrence of the sign on MA-J- 14 (at Bl) clearly is not accompanied by a glyph above. There are no traces of localized erosion that would have selectively obliterated a sign there. The glyph be- low has no coefficients, yet Edmonson "read" it as the Zapotec glyph 1 Water. Whittaker assumed that the calendrical sign related to glyph W is the one at the bottom of column B (glyph 7 Eta in the current clas- sification). If so, this would be another deviation from the norm, one in which glyph W and its associated calendrical sign are separated by other glyphs. The example on MA-J-105/106 follows the ex- pected pattern, yet the sign above glyph W lacks a coefficient. This sign has no counterpart among the known day glyphs. Its interpretation as a noncalendrical glyph was also made by Caso and by Whittaker. Edmonson did not comment on this particular ex- ample. Considering that only a portion of the slab re- mains, it is possible that there were other glyphs in the missing pieces. Even so, the placement of glyph W in relation to other signs with numbers would have been different from the known examples. Thus, there is a fourth contextual variation for the glyph, one in which 2) the sign is associated to a noncalendrical glyph. The glyph W on MA-J-132 also appears below a noncalendrical sign. However, given the fragmentary con- dition of the stone, it is impossible to determine whether the glyph had a coefficient and whether it was followed by a calendrical sign below. If it was, then the inverted relationship between glyph W and the associated calendrical glyph would have been more recurrent. Figure 4.164 presents the known inscriptions where glyph W appears without coefficients and inverted. Again, the eroded condition of the carvings precludes a conclusive assessment, but it appears that in all these instances the sign is appended to a noncalendrical glyph - single or compounded - located just above it. In Casos hypothesis, the inversion of the glyph and the lack of a coefficient suggested the notion of completion, as in the case of the Maya calendar, where the position of the days in the month ranged from 0 (completion) to 19 instead of from 1 to 20. In this case, the day being anchored was then omitted. In Whittakers hypothesis, the inverted examples of glyph W have a function analogous to the one proposed by Caso - that is, they signify the end of a trecena. Be- cause Edmonson argues that the count of "months" went from 0 to 19, it is evident that he too follows Caso with regard to the function of the inverted W glyphs. The epigraphy on MA-J-16 illustrates, however, a number of interpretive disagreements. A glyph with coefficients appears below the inverted glyph W.Villagra (Caso's draftsman) reproduced three numeral bars and three dots (18), which led Caso to propose that this 259</page><page sequence="277">Fig. 4.156 Linear arrangement of inscriptions with glyph I. 260</page><page sequence="278">c 0 *0. 1 5/5 c o o t/i o 4-&gt; C3 &lt;L&gt; a &lt;u bO a 2 c3 Â»-i &lt;L&gt; a Â£ r- m Tt- bb Â£ 261</page><page sequence="279">Fig. 4.158 (A) Glyphs I accompanied by coefficients, and (B through F) conglomerates with glyph I. 262</page><page sequence="280">Fig. 4.159 Glyph I as a pan-Mesoamerican symbol (drawings in no. 1 after Thompson 1971, fig. 25, nos. 55a and 56b). 263</page><page sequence="281">Fig. 4.160 Two possible examples of glyph I as a rare day name. 264</page><page sequence="282">Fig. 4.161 Whittaker's day list and glyphic correlations determined by means of the trecena hypothesis. 265</page><page sequence="283">lower glyph was another "month" sign. If so, the in- scription in this slab would contain a year date and two month dates. Unless there was a calendrical glyph in the now broken lower left portion, the coefficient of "month" O was not anchoring a day sign. Whittaker s comment on MA-J-16 postulates the existence of a fifth association pattern: an inverted glyph W accompanied by a coefficient but both separated by a sign (in this case the noncalendrical version of glyph O [Monkey]). The latter, according to him, is the name of the trecena itself. Because he followed Villagra's rendering, this specific inscription then refers to the completion of the 18th trecena. Given that such a trecena in the Nahuad sacred count begins with Ehecatl (2nd day), Whittaker was then forced to argue that "the expected flaming torch for Fire/Wind had been replaced by an animal associated with this day-name position - in Aztec times the mon- key is a primary aspect of the wind god, who is also god of the day Ehecatl" (Whittaker 1983: 116). Thus, he ad- vocates here a unique pattern in linear texts for the arrangement of a calendrical glyph and its accompany- ing coefficient. My own observation of the carving on this stone yielded only two bars and three dots (13) for the O glyph, making it a regular day name. Consider- ing the overall context, this calendrical glyph appears to be equivalent to those appearing in the central colum- nar text on the other slabs from Building J. If so, it can- not be a sign associated with the inverted glyph W Fig- ure 4.165 summarizes the five association patterns that have been proposed by Whittaker for glyph W Given that the hypotheses of Caso and Edmonson postulate a triple anchorage of a date within the solar cycle (with the exception of the inverted cases of glyph W),some of the available epigraphic examples cannot be used for testing the propositions because of the lack of two of the referential data. This is the case of the inscriptions on MA-D-142 (which lacks an annual date),MA-J-10 (which lacks the presumed day glyph), MA-J-13 (whose year bearer is obliterated), and MA- J-132 (for which no year and day glyphs are attested). Because of the fineness of some of the carvings and their state of erosion, there are, in addition, further discrepancies among authors about the value of some of the coefficients involved. The rendering of MA-J- 14 by Villagra included two bars (10) for glyph W in E5. Whittaker argues that the numeral consists of three bars (15). My own observation of the slab yielded only two bars. Villagra's drawing of MA-J-13 includes three 266 bars (15) as coefficient of glyph W. Whittaker claims that the numeral has three bars and a dot (16). My own observation yielded four bars (20), the lower one being mosdy eroded. The previous discussion has made two things evi- dent: (1) of the three hypotheses, Whittaker's is the most explicit and clearly stated; Caso s proposal, and even more Edmonson's, leaves some loose ends, or at least some of the corollaries were not made explicit; and (2) the incomplete nature of the data leads to ambiguities.To summarize the evidence, Figure 4.166 presents the 14 instances of glyph W discussed above and all the plausible epigraphic alternatives. Only the six combinations inset in boxes are discussed in detail here. Test of the Hypotheses on Glyph W. As noted by Whittaker, MA-J-14, where glyph W appears four times, presents the most appropriate case for initial scrutiny (although here the sign might exhibit three different association patterns). To test Caso's hypothesis, it is necessary to generate a solar cycle: in this case, the year 6 Xoo (6E), indicated at the top of the central inscription (at Al) (Table 4.7). The matrix in the table reads from left to right and from top to bottom. Each column, num- bered 1 to 18, represents a month of 20 days, and each row represents a day. The position of a given day in the month is given by the roman numerals I to XX. The number (1 to 20) that appears after the day name gives its position in the day list. Thus, the day 12 Laala in the upper left corner of the matrix (column 01 row I) represents the first day of the first "month" in the year 6 Xoo. The matrix was derived following the results of the analysis of the year bearers, so that the last day of the 18th veintena (column 18 row XX) is 7 Laa, which in turn becomes the name of the following solar cycle. The day that names the year 6 Xoo would have been at the end of the 18th month in the previous year. The calendrical structure reflected by the matrix in Table 4.7 is based on two data: (1) Cordova's statement that years were counted in terms of elapsed and not elaps- ing time,22 and (2) the seniority of glyph E indicated 22 With regard to the counts of the years, Cordova states, "And note that it is always understood that the first year is not counted, as made evident by the accompanying numbers When the year, the month or the day are elapsing, they say that these units of time are pending" ([1578a] 1886: 190).</page><page sequence="284">Â£ % &lt;-w o a .0 ' ' on U !&gt; U 'S g 13 u â s a o â¢Â£ Oh 'C 0 c/} g 1 iS CM vO t-h bh Â£ 267</page><page sequence="285">i &lt;L&gt; â M 1) â¢M c o s o s o *13 u S a o o 8 o *X3 l) â s 0 1 CO vO bb Â£ 268</page><page sequence="286">by the infrequent variant of an aged human face (glyph Alpha). Whittaker (1983: 109) and Edmonson (1988: 268) have also considered, using other arguments, that the structural properties displayed in Table 4.7 apply to the Zapotec calendar, so there is at least some con- sensus for the testing. Besides the solar cycle in Table 4.7, the test resorts to the glyphic day list in Figure 4.151. Caso s idea states that a day was anchored by its po- sition in the year and in the "month." Because the year and the day are known, it is possible to determine whether the specified day indeed falls in the position indicated by glyph W. In addition, because the sequence of the "months" was fixed in the solar cycle, all the resulting positions for glyph W should always be the same, as the sign refers to the same "month."23 The test begins with the glyphic combination 2W- 10 Beta (Arrow) on MA-J-14, where the coefficient of glyph W indicates that the day 10 Beta was the second day of month W. The columnar position of month W in Table 4.7 is unknown, but day Beta should fall in the second row. According to this study, glyph Beta corresponds to the 13th day (root laa or quij), yet such a day name occupies row XI and not the second one in Table 4.7. Inversely, to satisfy the posi- tion of the day indicated by the coefficient of glyph W (the second row), glyph Beta ends up corresponding to the fourth position in the day list (lachi, Ballgame) and not to the 13th (quij, Arrow). Also, glyph W would have been the 8th month within the solar cycle because the coefficient 10 (of glyph Beta) along the second row occurs in the 8th column in Table 4.7. Equally, the combination 4W-1P on MA-D-140 does not coincide on the matrix of the year 4 Laa (Table 4.8). In this case, glyph P (Xipe Totec), which corresponds to the 18th day (Lopa) according to this study, occupies row XI and not the expected row IV as dictated by the coefficient of glyph W. Inversely, to satisfy the position indicated by the coefficient of glyph W (fourth row), glyph P ends up being the glyph for the 11th day (Loo, Monkey) and glyph W would have 23 This actually undermines Caso's hypothesis of glyph ^be- cause it bestows an exclusive emphasis on the inscriptions in only 1 of 18 months. been either the 3rd or the 16th month within the solar cycle. In these two tests, the epigraphic combinations in- volving glyph W do not coincide in the respective annual matrices. By resorting to the inverse proce- dure, the day glyphs end up having positions that do not correspond to their meaning or pictography, and the position of glyph W in the solar cycle varies in each case. To test Whittaker s hypothesis, Table 4.9 presents a sacred calendar arranged as a matrix* The trecenas are clearly marked by the invariable coefficient 1 and by black triangles. They are also numbered in the upper left corner according to their position in the cycle. The matrix reads first from top to bottom and pro- ceeds from left to right. Nahuatl day signs are included on the extreme left. Because Whittaker used the Mexi- can names, those glyphic conventions must be retained to replicate his results. As he noted, all the glyphic cor- relations are "borne out by simple calculations" (Whittaker n.d.: 40). In the case of the combination 5W-7 Eta on MA-J-14, the day glyph corresponds to the Quiahuitl sign in the 19th row. It is in this position where the indicated trecena (the fifth) coincides with coefficient 7. If so, glyph Eta - whose position in the day list could not be determined in this study - would correspond to the Zapotec day name Lape (Drop) and, together with glyph Gamma, would have been a rare variant for glyph C. In the case of the combination 4W-1P on MA-D- 140, the day glyph corresponds to the Xochitl sign in the 20th row. It is in this position where the indicated trecena (the fourth) coincides with coefficient 1 . Fol- lowing the same procedure, the positions that Whittaker obtained for the other calendrical glyphs on MA-J- 14, MA-D-139, and MA-D-142 can be replicated. Most of the correlations, however, do not coincide with those derived in this study (Table 4.10). The fact that Whittaker s results do not match those of this study does not necessarily preclude their valid- ity. For that matter the reconstruction of the day list suggested here may be inaccurate in some details. Cur- rently, the inscriptions on MA-J-13 and MA-D-140 are the only ones by which the hypothesis of an an- chorage to a trecena can be tested independently. In these stones, glyph W is associated with the same 269</page><page sequence="287">Â£ % oh oh &lt;4-1 o a 0 "S 1 u 3 g o G 0 â¢fl 3 o *13 a '1-1 0 1 vO t-h bb Â£ 270</page><page sequence="288">calendrical glyph (P) that has different numerals (Fig. 4. 167 A). Unfortunately, there is no consensus about the value of the coefficient accompanying glyph W on MA-J-13. As mentioned before, Villagra rendered three bars (15), Whittaker saw three bars and a dot (16), and I observed four bars (20) (Fig. 4.167B). If Whittaker s numeral is assumed to be correct, the hypothesis of an anchorage to a trecena is of course validated. Curiously, in 1980, when the hypothesis was first enunciated, he omitted the discussion of this cru- cial example. It was not until later that he mentioned having personally examined the inscription, discover- ing that "although this section has undergone consid- erable erosion, in the space above the three bars of the numeral 15 traces of the missing dot may still be dis- cerned" (Whittaker 1983: 117). Yet, the drawing of the slab that accompanies the text (a photocopy of Villagra 's drawing) does not have the purported cor- rection (ibid.: 118, fig. 13). If the numeral of glyph W on MA-J-13 is 15 or 20, the hypothesis is invalidated. For instance, considering the combination 15W-5P, the meeting point between the 15th trecena and the coefficient 5 in Table 4.9 corresponds to the sign Mazad (7th row) and not the expected Xochitl. In the case of the combination 20W-5P, the resulting correspondence for glyph P is with the sign Malinalli (12th row).24 Assuming for the moment that Whittaker s inter- pretation is correct, the modifications to the glyphic day list in Figure 4.151 would be as follows: 1. Glyph P would have to be classed as a variant of glyph X and hence correlated with the 20th and not the 18th position. Despite the fact that categories P and X have mutu- 24 Without conducting a formal test of the trecena hypothesis, Edmonson commented," Whittaker 's readirig of the month sign as a trecena glyph requires changing the identification of the days and introducing new year bearers and a new calendar, none of which is necessary" (1988: 24).

Early glyphs X (human head) would have to be reinterpreted iconographically as early glyphs O (monkey head). 3. Glyph Beta (Arrow glyph) would have to be linked to the 3rd position, being then an alternative form to glyphs F (Zapotec) and R (Mixtec).The relationship between glyphs Beta and F and R would have to be based on an as yet unexplained metaphorical or met- onymic link. Also, the common practice of representing the 13th day name as a dart or an arrow in later graphic systems (for example, in the Codices Borgia and Nuttall, the Selden Roll, Lienzo Antonio de Leon, and Codex Tututepetongo) would have to be explained as an unprecedented change in pictographic conventions. 272 To proceed with Edmonson's hypothesis, it is nec- essary to consult again the matrices on Tables 4.7 and 4.8. Beginning with the epigraphic combination 2W- 10 Beta, anchored in a year 6 Xoo, the coefficient of glyph W falls in column II on Table 4.7. Here, how- ever, there are 2 days with coefficient 10 (the numeral of glyph Beta). One occurs in row V (China, Deer), and the other is in row XVIII (Loo, Face). Neither of these coincides, graphically or linguistically, with the Beta glyph (Laa/Quij, Arrow). Following the same pro- cedure in the case of the combination 4W-2V on MA- J-14, also anchored in the year 6 Xoo, the coefficient 2 (of glyph V) coincides with the 4th column and row IX (Table 4.7). This position corresponds to the 1 1th day name Loo (Monkey). Yet, glyph V represents the 1st day name Chilla (Alligator). The epigraphic combination 4W-1P on MA-D-140, anchored in a year 4 Laa, falls in the 4th column on Table 4.8. How- ever, in this column the coefficient 1 (of glyph P, Xipe Totec) occurs in row X, which corresponds to the day name Xoo. Glyph P cannot be the sign for that day name, which is occupied by glyph E, one of whose functions is as year bearer. Consequently, the results of this test are also negative.</page><page sequence="290">Whereas the test of Whittaker s hypothesis is in- conclusive, the other two tests yield negative results. It should be emphasized, however, that, although a po- tential for testing Whittaker s hypothesis independently exists (the repetitions of glyphs W-P), the other two tests do not have an independent parameter. In other words, the results are contingent on the validity of the annual matrices and the day list used in the tests. Thus, additional tests were done by changing the conditions on which the annual matrices are based. Specific modi- fications include (1) changing the initial day of the year (instead of placing it in day 360, it was placed in 1), and (2) following different reckoning alternatives: counts in terms of elapsing and counts in terms of elapsed time (Urcid n.d.c, 2: app. 4, tables 4.13-4.20). Despite these changes, the tests yielded negative re- sults. The day list proposed here remained unchanged in these further tests, however. Although the list may be incorrect in some of its details, the positions taken by the glyphs when following Caso s and Edmonson's hypotheses gave correlations in which the correspon- dences between the meaning of the day names and the pictography of the glyphs could not be satisfacto- rily solved. Summary Remarks The preceding analyses of glyphs with coefficients in Zapotec writing lead to the following conclusions. Special Signs: Glyph W Given the known range of numbers associated with glyph W (2 through 18 or 20), it has long been posited as a sign with a chronological function other than a day name. However, with certain inferred properties of the Zapotec calendar like counts in terms of elapsing time, the beginning of the year on day 360, and the glyphic day list reconstructed in the current study, tests of the hypotheses that glyph W is the sign of a month (Caso), of the trecena (Whittaker), and of the month (Edmonson) yielded negative results. The glyphs close association with annual dates strongly indicates a calendrical func- tion, perhaps as a count of elapsed time periods (other than the trecena) as suggested by Prem (1971: 121). Un- til such a proposition can be elucidated, glyph W re- mains undeciphered. 273</page><page sequence="291">Special Signs: Glyph I The contextual analysis of glyph I and its occur- rence with and without coefficients indicate that it has several functions. When it appears in isolated glyphic compounds and devoid of numerals, the sign may function as a personal name. When accompanied by numbers, the sign appears to be related to counts of units of some sort or with the completion of peri- ods. In such cases, the glyph occupies a fixed position within a standard sequence that invariably includes an annual date. This sequence, sometimes inscribed in lin- ear or agglutinated formats, is most common in in- scriptions that have a mortuary and genealogical char- acter. Although glyph I also could refer to the count of elapsed periods and does not overlap chronologi- cally with glyph W, it seems unlikely that both glyphs would reckon the same unit of time. Until the kind of temporal or material units being counted are eluci- dated, glyph I remains undeciphered. Still another func- tion of glyph I is as a day glyph. Consequendy, it was used as calendrical name of individuals. The only two available examples as a day name indicate that it is an infrequent variant, one that might occupy the 16th position in the day list. The Glyphic Day List The analysis of all available signs accompanied by numbers yielded 39 glyphic categories, which I desig- nated with two lettering systems (A through Z [in- cluding I and N, and excluding W], and Alpha through Nu). Their relative frequency separates 20 main glyphs and 19 variant signs. All of the former, but few of the latter, could be correlated to their positions in the day list. Twelve correlations are based on concordance be- tween the pictography of glyphs and the meaning of sixteenth-century Zapotec day names recorded by Table 4.8 Zapotec Solar Cycle 4 Laa (Year Begins on Day 360, Elapsed Time) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 00 Lapa 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 Ni$a 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 Tela 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 Loo 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 Pija 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 Laa 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 Lache 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 Naa 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 Loo 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 Xoo 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 Lopa 7 1 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 829 Lape 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 Loo 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 Chilla 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 laa 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 Laala 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 Lachi 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 Zee 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 Lana 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 China 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 274</page><page sequence="292">Â£ &amp; "5b c '&gt; ] c/5 c o C IS a o o o 15 8- "E. &lt;U &lt;u c r&gt; C/3 o Pu vO 'o bb Uu 275</page><page sequence="293">Cordova (glyphs A, E, G, J, L, M, N, O, V, X, Z, and Beta). In five instances, the pictography of the glyphs provided a clue for clarifying the general or specific meaning of the day names to which they correspond (glyphs A [tella,knot],J [naa, corn field], M [laa, light- ning], N [piya, soap plant], and X [loo, ruling lord]). The translation of these day names remained prob- lematic despite the studies of Seler (1904b), Cruz (1935), and Joseph Whitecotton (1982, 1990). In three instances, the pictography of the glyphs did not coin- cide with the known meanings of the day names (glyph B [lache, heart-jaguar], H [lana, smell of flesh-skull], Q [lopa, damp-flint]). Their links therefore must be based on metaphors. In at least two other cases, the clear pictography of the glyphs did not provide a clue for translating the day names for which they stand (glyphs F [Owl] andT [Rabbit]). This lack of corre- spondence also might be explained in terms of meta- phorical usages or metonymic connections between glyphs and their meaning. Until these are elucidated, the translation of the names laala (3rd) and lapa (8th) remains to be made. In one case, I anchored a glyph with unclear pictography to a day name of known meaning (glyph D to the day name quij [13th]). In another instance, the known meaning of the day name apparently provided a clue to discern the pictography of a glyph [glyph C (lapa, drop)]. Only two clear ex- amples of a metaphorical relationship could be ascer- tained with internal evidence (the name zee ["bad omen"] and its link to the serpent as an ominous ani- mal, and the name que^a ["stone of lightning"] as a link between sacrifice and water).

The correlations in the list that I propose here leave no major loose ends, nor do they present internal contradictions; they account for all the cur- rently available evidence, which includes 700 calendrical glyphs (70 year bearers and 630 day glyphs). Reconstruction of the glyphic day list yields other important implications about the nature of the script. The relationship between glyphs and words in Cordova's Vocabulario evinces a logographic compo- nent in the script. The continuity in the graphic rep- resentation of most of the day glyphs, from Monte Alban I to Monte Alban IV, supports the assumption that an archaic form(s) of the Zapotec language is en- coded in the inscriptions. 278 The Year Glyph and the Year Bearers The analysis of year signs corroborated that it is the pictograph of a royal headband. Despite its attested variability, the sign displays remarkable continuity through time. As to the signs with coefficients associ- ated with it, six annual markers that resolved into four main bearers (with two having an infrequent variant) were conclusively identified. The proposed correla- tions of these glyphs to the day list, all of which are substantiated by linguistic data, corroborate the set II year bearers for the Zapotec calendar (occupying the 2nd, 7th, 12th, and 17th positions in the day list) and yield an important datum: the sequence of these mark- ers in the native count of solar cycles proceeded from E (senior bearer) to M to G to N. A test of this model, using an actual set of inscriptions from the archaeo- logical site of Monte Alban, is the topic of the next chapter.</page><page sequence="296">CHAPTER 5 The Carved Monoliths from the South Platform at Monte Alban Introduction To evaluate the outcome of the calendrical analyses, particularly the model of year bearers, a set of inscrip- tions containing more than one annual date must be selected. By having several chronological references, the span of the dates and the intervals between them can be determined. It can then be established whether the temporal framework in the inscriptions is intelli- gible in terms of human life span. Currently, there are several examples of complete, self-contained inscrip- tions that have two annual dates. The archaeological context of most of these examples is known: they were found associated with tombs. This datum and the lim- ited (paired) alternatives regarding the sequence in which the dates can be read provide ideal situations for a test. Nevertheless, the following discussion uses a set of inscriptions from the ancient city of Monte Alban whose relatedness first has to be demonstrated by means of the contextual approach. The ensuing inter- pretive difficulties are accentuated, yet at the same time compensated for, by the presence of several year dates. Because of its multiple chronological references, the selected set of inscriptions constitutes a unique sample in this corpus. Monte Alban, situated in the present-day state of Oaxaca, Mexico, was a Pre-Columbian setdement with a long occupational history (Fig. 5.1). Shortly after its founding around 500 B.C., it reached urban propor- tions. At its maximum size, between a.d. 600 and 800, the core of the city extended across some 8km2 of rugged terrain, on the tops and slopes of a series of hills that rise some 400 m above the alluvial plains of surrounding valleys; its population was estimated con- servatively at as many as 30,000 people (Blanton 1978: 58). After a.d. 800, the urban center began to decrease in size until it became a small village. When the Span- iards reached the central valleys of Oaxaca by a.d. 1521, the settlement was completely abandoned. Aside from becoming one of the major cities in the highlands of southwestern Mesoamerica and having a continuous occupation spanning some 1500 years, Monte Alban is the locus for the largest known corpus of inscribed stones in the entire region. Most of these monuments are concentrated in the Main Plaza, the city's adminis- trative, political, and religious center (see Fig. 4.26). The inscriptions to be studied here were found asso- ciated to a building that delimits one side of the Main Plaza, referred to in modern times as the South Plat- form. The South Platform The South Platform is the second largest and most massive building at Monte Alban. Its monumental size can be noticed even from neighboring ancient and modern settlements on the valley floor, particularly those to the south and southeast that are located within a radius of about 10 km. As it stands today, the struc- ture consists of an enormous pyramidal platform sup- porting a relatively small architectural complex (Fig. 5.2). In antiquity, access to the summit of the platform was by two broad staircases, although such a double approach might have been the result of successive modifications. One was centrally located on the north- ern side - that is, the one facing the Main Plaza. This staircase, flanked by balustrades, is 45 m wide (Fig. 5.2, 279</page><page sequence="297">A). Forty-four steps had to be climbed to reach the summit of the platform, which rises some 14 m above the level of the Main Plaza. The other staircase (B) is located on the west side of the platform, but it is off- centered and placed close to the south end of the struc- ture (Marcus Winter, personal communication, 1994). Its architectural details remain unknown, but it also appears to have been intended as an access to reach the upper level of the platform. At its base the platform measures approximately Fig. 5.1 State of Oaxaca, Mexico, showing the central valleys and Monte Alban. 280</page><page sequence="298">Fig. 5.2 Plan and front elevation of the South Platform, Monte Alban (plan based on Peeler 1994). 281 ^ M A.

Its pyramidal configuration seems to have been accomplished by the superposition of probably six rectangular bodies that decrease in size from bottom to top. The lowest one has vertical walls and is 3 m high. The vertical dimension of the subsequent bod- ies was smaller, but because of their advanced state of erosion and the rubble that covers them, a precise as- sessment is precluded. Nevertheless, these appear to have had vertical facades as well. At one time, the al- leys between each pair of tiers functioned probably as corridors and perhaps as viewing stages. This is at least plausible for the junction between the first and sec- ond bodies, because a smaller ascending feature lead- ing from the Main Plaza to the top of the first tier exists adjacent to the east balustrade of the northern staircase (C).This other stairway is only 1.50 m wide and consists of seven steps. The alley at the top is ap- proximately 1 m wide. If the entire platform were exclusively an artificial feature, the resulting construc- tion volume would amount to approximately 168,000 m3. Such an estimate does not take into account the known irregularities in the topography upon which the platform stands, or the construction volume of the other buildings at its summit. The architectural complex at the top is formed by two mounds (Mound III and Mound SE) and by a plaza with a small and apparendy quadrangular struc- ture at its center (D). Mound III is the largest, measur- ing approximately 35 by 35 m at its base and 10 by 10 m at the top, with an elevation of approximately 10 m. It is located almost at the center of the north-south axis of the platform but is slighdy shifted toward the west in relation to the east-west line. Access to the upper level was by a staircase on the east side. The rectangular layout of a room can still be discerned at the top. Mound SE is much smaller. It measures approxi- mately 28 by 28 m at its base, 10 by 10 m at the top, and is about 6 m tall. It stands on the southeast quad- rant of the platform's summit. A few traces of the stair- case that gave access to the upper level are found on the western side of the mound, but nothing of a room remains at the summit. Because of the rubble cover- ing both structures, their external architectural fea- tures are quite indistinct. Some exposures, however, 282 indicate the occurrence of multitier bodies with a com- bination of vertical and slanted profiles. The upper plaza (D) measures approximately 40 by 40 m and occupies the area in front of the staircase of Mound III. It was bounded on the northern and eastern sides by walls, as is suggested today by lines of collapsed rubble about 2 m wide (E).To the south, the plaza is delimited by the northern side of Mound SE. Consequendy, it was not a common and shared open space for both buildings, being exclusively a functional component of Mound III. It is conceivable that the northern and eastern walls are a later addition to the original design, so that, at least during the late occu- pations of the platform, entrance to the plaza in front of Mound III was apparendy gained only through the southwestern corner. The given dimensions of the mounds on top of the platform are equivalent to about 8000 m3 of construction volume, giving a total of approximately 176,000 m3for the entire structure. Mounds III and SE are cut by a series of tunnels that go through at the level of their bases. Mound III is cut by one tunnel along the north-south axis but with a jog near the center of the mound's core. Mound SE is perforated by tunnels running in north-south and east-west directions. In addition, there is a large opening in the summit that meets the tunnels at their intersection. Substantial amounts of debris at the base of the opening have accumulated, internally forming a small mound. The rest of the upper level of the platform appears leveled and boundless, suggesting the existence of rela- tively large open spaces probably surfaced with a floor. Along its northern edge, however, are the remains of a wall (F) that was interrupted only by a small entrance - 1.5 m wide - in the center of the flow of access from the broad staircase on the northern side of the plat- form (G). This wall continued down, probably as a stepped boundary, across the tiers on the eastern and western sides of the platform. On the eastern side, the wall descends to end in another entry that restricts the access between the Main Plaza and the narrow area along the eastern side of the platform. Even though the section of the wall that descended through the tiers on the northwestern corner is completely washed away, its crumbled remains extend in a westerly direc- tion for about 100 m from the base of the platform.</page><page sequence="300">No access is present on this side, effectively isolating the broad and flat area adjacent to the South Platform on this other side. Also, it is now known that the west- ern wall crosses over a series of superimposed elite residences (Marcus Winter, personal communication, 1994; Peeler 1994: quadrant N16E26). A radiocarbon date of a.d.1 320 Â± 50 from underneath this extension (Winter 1994: 120) indicates that the wall was built later in the occupational history of the platform. This and other bounding features appear to have been part of a larger architectural enterprise that fortified the entire south sector of Monte Alban (see Fig. 4.26). The basal body of the South Platform, including the jogs of the central staircase, has 482 linear meters, of which only 156 have been exposed by archaeo- logical excavations. This number represents approxi- mately 32 percent of the basal perimeter. Carved stones of different geological origins, shapes, sizes, and states of preservation have been found embedded in some of the cleared portions and prominently in the four corners. So far, 26 of these have been discovered in the wall of the first tier, and 7 more as steps in the central staircase. Nine of the 33 stones have been re- moved to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia in Mexico City and to the Museo de Monte Alban for their protection and for exhibition. The rest are in situ. Of the removed stones, only five have been replaced by casts. Figures 5.3 to 5.6 present the facades of the platform showing the location and position of all the known carved monoliths as they were found by ar- chaeological explorations. Four more stones with carved reliefs have been located loose in the vicinity of the platform (Fig. 5.7).1 History of Explorations The earliest known description of the South Plat- form is that of Guillermo Dupaix, who visited Monte Alban during his second expedition to Mexico in 1806.2 The renderings accompanying the description were drawn by Jose Luciano Castaneda, Dupaix s drafts- man and companion. Although Dupaix referred la- conically but accurately to the supporting pyramidal structure, his account includes detailed observations and drawings of Mounds III and SE.3 In these ren- derings, the tunnels in the mounds are shown as hav- ing straight walls (Fig. 5. 8 A). The profile of those cut- ting Mound SE along the east-west axis depicts the walls as faced with nicely dressed blocks and the inter- section of the tunnels as a domed chamber (Fig. 5.8B). From these illustrations and the accompanying descrip- tions, it is clear that Dupaix interpreted the tunnels as 1 Today, S-12 lies loose near the southwestern corner, inside a trench excavated by several explorers. Its context and weight suggest that the stone might have been embedded in the basal wall, close to the angle and along the south side. None of the excavators ever mentioned the monolith. On the basis of the geological characteristics of the stone, the color, and the shape of the extant carved surfaces, it seems very likely that a frag- ment housed today in the INAH-Cuilapan storeroom (CRO-25) is part of this monolith. S-26 was found loose in front of the central staircase. The specific proveniences of frag- ments S-27 and S-28 are unknown. 2 There are several editions of Dupaix s account and they all contain different versions of the text and of the accompanying illustrations. Alcina Franch has argued that the edition based on the Seville manuscript includes the original drawings. Yet, the Mexican facsimile edition (based on that published in 1834 in Paris) claims that the French edition contains the original ren- derings (Villasenor 1978: 10, app. 9). The relevant illustrations in the Kingsborough (1831) and Alcina Franch (1969) editions - though slighdy different - are basically sketches, whereas those in the Mexican and French editions are enhanced renditions (cf. Villasenor 1978: 209, pl. xxvi [Mound III]; and 208, pl. xxvn [Mound SE]). From Dupaix s own account it is known that the exploration team was at Monte Alban sometime in July 1806, and from the account published in the Mexican edition it can be deduced that the group climbed to the site on two consecutive days only. Dupaix explicidy states that on the second occasion they returned to Oaxaca City around 3 p.m. because of an impending storm (Villasenor 1978: 137, 139- 140). Based on the itinerary, it is quite unlikely that the elabo- rate drawings in the Paris and Mexican editions are the first set of renderings. The illustrations in the French edition would have been originals (i.e., done by Castaneda) but already em- bellished and hence modified versions of the initial sketches. Therefore, key arguments presented in this chapter are based on the pertinent illustrations published by Alcina Franch. 3 For specific passages in Dupaix's account where he men- tions or describes the South Platform, see Alcina Franch (1969: 107, 111 [for the pyramidal base], 110-111 and n. 207 [for Mound III], 111, and 114-115 nn. 209 and 219 [for Mound SE]. The description of Mound III, however, refers incorrecdy to plate 44 (ibid.: fig. 69), which actually renders Mound SE. The latter is depicted in plate 43 (ibid.: fig. 68). 283</page><page sequence="301">s 0 s s V-i 1 Â£ -s 3 o 00 &lt;u -s $ Â§ 5 Cm s &lt;L&gt; -t-&gt; &lt;L&gt; &lt;D â¢fl .9 T3 6 3 H 1) 8 c 1 T3 u CO uS W&gt; [Â£ 284</page><page sequence="302">ri s O 2 I P-. â fi 3 O C/3 (U â a o (U Id s u a. a CL&gt; â fl Â»-l o a V â¢fl c T3 1) 3 1) n 1) c/3 1) c o â *-&gt; c/5 T3 U in bh Uu 285</page><page sequence="303">J 1 0 2 S l-i 1 Â£ 1 o C/5 V â¢fi o C S u 0 O.

This is deduced not only from Dupaix's own account and its accompanying illustration in the 1969 edition by Alcina Franch but also from the form and amount of debris currently deposited at the base of the mound's core.5 The report of the early explorer also contains the reproduction of a carved monolith, now designated SP-7, which was said to have been found at the foot of one of the platform's slopes (Alcina Franch 1969: 107, 269) (Fig. 5.9). In 1840, 39 years after Dupaix and Castaneda had been to the site, Juan Bautista Carriedo visited Monte Alban and again drew the carved monolith SP-7. Unfortunately, the drawing and the manuscript that resulted from his reconnaissance are apparendy lost today. With only a brief commentary on Carriedo 's work made by Caso (1928), it cannot be determined whether the precise location and disposition of the carved monolith were specified, but at least it can be deduced that the stone had not deteriorated much since Castaneda documented it. In 1855, Jose Maria Garcia ascended to the sum- mit of the ruined site and later published a sketch of the Main Plaza, rendering the South Platform as an elongated and narrow terrace (Fig. 5.10). He also made a vertical drawing of its northern side, showing traces of the central staircase. The tunnels in Mounds III and SE are also conspicuously marked in this early draw- ing. His brief description of the tunnels indicates that the center of Mound SE had collapsed by then (Garcia 1859:271). Another early explorer who visited Monte Alban during the second part of the nineteenth century was Desire Charnay. Apparendy he climbed to the site a number of times, and the earliest occasion was in 1858. His last trip possibly took place as late as 1882. De- spite the multiple visits, his account is very brief. He mentions the South platform indirecdy, stating that "the grandest ruins are to the south end of the pla- teau" (Charnay 1887: 499). Then he added that some years before his visit an Italian explorer had opened some of the mounds (ibid.). If the source of this in- formation came from local inhabitants, it is feasible that Charnay was misinformed about the nationality of Dupaix and about the type of activities that he conducted at Monte Alban. It also is possible that the Italian explorer was responsible for the tunnels in Mounds III and SE, which we know were made be- fore Dupaix's visit. If so, by the time Charnay went to Monte Alban, memories of these early explorations would have lingered among the local inhabitants for more than 50 years. Adolph Bandelier climbed to Monte Alban in 1881. Because of the brevity of his stay, he made a sketch only of the Main Plaza (Bandelier 1884: pl. xxvi, fig. 13). This and the brief accompanying description were mistaken in terms of the site's orientation, with the South Platform being placed toward the north. The rendering clearly shows Mounds III and SE but does not disclose further details. However, the explorer noted that the summit of the platform was "crowned by a wall of broken stones 1.70 meters thick, and broken down in many places" (ibid.: 319). Without doubt, he is referring to the collapsed wall on the northern edge of the platform's summit (see Fig. 5.2, F). Apparendy based on impressionistic methods, Bandelier incorrecdy determined the dimensions of the platform as being only 75 by 94 m at the base and 3 m high. His account gives a passing description of Mounds SE and III (the latter designated Mound B), which exhibited traces of rooms at their summits. Except for some uncon- 4 Zelia Nuttall (1932a, 1932b) followed Dupaix's view that the tunnels were original features. She went further by pro- posing that Mound SE was built for astronomical purposes and that the tunnels were devices to determine the length of the vague year. Because of the inherent difficulties in reading Dupaix's prose, other authors have incorrecdy attributed the perforation of the tunnels to him (Marquina 1969: 318; Zehnder n.d.: 214). 5 Dupaix explicidy states that the "tomb" was covered by a dome-like roof (Alcina Franch 1969: 111, n. 209; Villasenor 1978: 139). Yet the sketch published in the Kingsborough (1831) edition shows the vertical opening at the top of Mound SE. Because the English version appeared 11 years later than the drawing in the Seville manuscript, the noted discrepancy sug- gests that, although the description of Mound SE and its cor- responding figure were edited in the Spanish and French ver- sions, those modifications were not made in the English edi- tion (see Fig. 5.8B, no. 2). 288</page><page sequence="306">nected lines of stones on the edges of the central col- lapse, not much could be discerned at Mound SE, but, at the top of mound III,Bandelier saw the rectangular layout of the room (ibid.: 320). In 1895, William Holmes conducted a three-day reconnaissance at Monte Alban. Among his outstand- ing panoramic views of the site is one with the South Platform in the foreground (Holmes 1897: pl. xxvn). Although in this drawing much of "the mantle of the foliage enveloping many of the forms has been largely ignored, and the outlines are given somewhat more firmly than they appear in reality," it certainly conveys Fig. 5.7 Carved stones found loose in the vicinity of the South Platform, Monte Alban. 289</page><page sequence="307">Fig. 5.8 Monte Alban, Mounds III and SE as recorded by Dupaix and Castaneda. 290</page><page sequence="308">Fig. 5.9 Castaneda's rendering of Monte Alban's SP-7 as it appears in (A) Alcina Franch's edition and (B) in Villaseiior s edition. 291</page><page sequence="309">Fig. 5.10 Monte Alban, plan and front elevation of South Platform according to Garcia (1859: 270bis). 292</page><page sequence="310">an excellent idea of the state of the platform at the end of the nineteenth century. The explorer described and provided fairly accurate measurements for the structure and the mounds at the top. He also noted most of the other surface features that are visible to- day, including the small platform at the center of the upper plaza, the limiting crumbled walls, and the tun- nels in Mounds III and SE. These are clearly marked in the panoramic view. In contrast to Dupaix, Holmes was of the opinion that the tunnels could not have been original architectural features but instead were the result of previous explorations and treasure hunt- ing.6 Examination of the profiles in the interior expo- sures led him to propose the occurrence of artificial stratigraphy (ibid.: 219-221). Although Holmes was acquainted with Dupaix's account, he apparently did not carry out a search for the monolith SP-7, but he saw and sketched a bas-relief at the northeastern cor- ner of the platform. Unfortunately, the rendering was not published but, from his description, it appears to have included the reliefs on two adjacent monoliths: SP-3 and SP-2 (ibid.: 220). The first documented excavations of the South Platform were carried out by Leopoldo Batres in 1902. He opened trenches in the four corners of the basal body to expose completely the carved stones that had been seen by previous explorers. In doing so, he found monoliths SP-1 through SP-8. Because all but the first stone were removed and sent to Mexico City, Batres discovered that some of them have reliefs on several surfaces. SP-8, for example, is carved on the frontal, the upper, and lower surfaces. SP-2 has a relief on its frontal and back surfaces, but the latter was an initial attempt of carving what was later executed in final form on the opposite side. Although SP-1 was not moved, it was also noticed that its upper surface has reliefs. At the time of Batres s exploration, SP-7, the monolith that had been documented by Dupaix and by Carriedo, was found broken and incomplete. All the stones and their carved surfaces were drawn fairly accurately by a Oaxaca artist named Sabino Soriano, draftsman of the project (Batres 1902: pls. n-iv, xvm- xix). Batres recorded the location of each stone be- fore removing them, but his report unfortunately came out with some typographic errors that left the specific provenience of SP-7 and SP-8 uncertain. His account of the explorations at the platform includes the first published photograph of the struc- ture, showing a view of the northern side (ibid.: pl. xxiv). Batres also generated a map of the Main Plaza and, apparently based on Holmes's idea, presented a panoramic view of the site with the South Platform in the foreground (ibid.: pl. i, end map). Because the vegetation covering many of the mounds was cut down, Batres was able to observe architectural features, especially the location of staircases. This led to recon- structions on paper. In some instances, the reconstructions have pre- sumed architectural details. For instance, the platform and Mounds III and SE are rendered in the panoramic view (but not in the map) with three tiers each, and their profiles are shown with sloping facades. In the map, the walls at the summit of the platform and the quadrangular structure of the plaza in front of Mound III are not recorded. Yet, the walls at the base were detected, and the northern staircase of the platform and those of the two mounds are - together with the tunnels that cut them - correcdy placed. The one pass- ing through Mound III, however, is shown as a straight-line cut. Like Holmes, Batres did not consider the tunnels to be original features. His observations of the wall profiles led him to propose that the mounds were structures with superpositions. However, these were interpreted as a peculiar construction technique followed by the builders in the course of a single con- struction episode (ibid.: 11-12) (Fig. 5.11). 6 The procedure that appears to have been followed in the perforation of the tunnels and the magnitude of the endeavor suggests a scientific exploration of the times rather than a loot- ing episode. The jog in the tunnel that cuts Mound III is evi- dendy the result of two opposite operations, one from the north- ern side and the other from the southern end. Their slighdy divergent courses were then rectified at the point of juncture. In the case of the perforations in Mound SE, the tunnels pre- date the central hole, which, as argued before, must be the re- sult of a subsequent collapse due to structural weakening caused by the four internal probings. Whereas the north-south tunnel could have been a single straight-line operation, it is evident that the east-west ones must have been started at opposite sides because they meet the central opening at different points. 293</page><page sequence="311">Shortly after the explorations by Batres, Constantine Rickards visited Monte Alban. His contribution is the photographic documentation of several features at the site, including the earliest known picture of SP-1, the only carved monolith from the structure that had been left in situ (Rickards 1910: 11 Obis).7 Between 1926 and 1931, two topographic maps of the Main Plaza at Monte Alban were made by engi- neers Mariano Tirado Osorio [published by Caso (1928)] and Horacio Herrera [published by Caso (1932)]. These maps, although slighdy different, show important features associated with the South Platform, including the lower walls along the eastern side, the wall that abuts the northwestern corner, the traces of the central staircase, and the tunnels through Mounds III and SE.The map by Herrera also includes contour lines for a small intrusion located in the middle of the eastern edge of the summit (see Fig. 5.2 H). It was not until the fifth field season, in 1936, that large-scale clearing operations of the platform began. Caso and his assistants opened trenches in several places to relocate and follow the basal wall and in this way determine the perimeter of the platform. In the pro- cess, the rest of the carved stones known today were found. Shordy afterward, Caso published photographs of two of them (S-l and S-9).The vegetation on the entire northern side of the platform was cut down, disclosing the existence of the narrow alleys at the top of the first and sixth tiers. Although the clearing of the balustrades provided details about the construc- tion technique used, it was not possible to determine the architectural configuration of the upper and lower ends, which in other buildings at Monte Alban are decorated with tableros. While the juncture between the balustrades and the staircase was being cleared, it was discovered that the steps were in situ. Further prob- ing at this juncture indicated the existence of an ear- lier staircase immediately below the final one (Caso 1938: 5) (Fig. 5.12).8 During the fourteenth and sixteenth field seasons at Monte Alban, conducted by Jorge Acosta, work on the South Platform involved some clearing, reconstruc- tion, and consolidation.The vegetation that had grown on the northern side was cut down again, and rubble from the central staircase was removed (Acosta 1974: 70). Then the central staircase was reconstructed. To gain information about the original decoration of the balustrades, Acosta excavated more trenches and found evidence, at least on the eastern side, that the earlier staircase had tableros in its balustrades. However, "the elements were so confusing that they cannot help in the problem of architectural reconstruction" (Acosta 1978: 2, 4, fig. 4). While the clearing operations con- tinued, the small staircase adjacent to the east balus- trade leading to the alley on top of the first body was discovered. Its reconstruction provided evidence sug- gesting that it may have been a later addition. A cor- nice that evidendy projected along the top of the basal wall was found by clearing collapsed debris. The program of work by Acosta during the 18th field season at Monte Alban, in 1958, was to place back the carved monoliths that Batres had taken to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City at the beginning of the century. Of the stones from the South Platform, only SP-3, SP-5, SP-6, SP-7, and SP-8 were returned to Oaxaca. The other two monoliths, SP-2 and SP-4, were replaced by casts so that the originals could stay in the museum as genu- ine examples of Zapotec stone sculpture. Because the corners at the southern end of the platform were be- yond the area kept cleared for the public, Acosta s work concentrated exclusively on setting up the monuments from the northwestern and northeastern corners. While clearing and preparing the western side, he discovered 7 The photograph of SP-1 is of surface C only. Subsequent photographic documentation of the stones taken to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City was car- ried out by Rickards (1918) and by Jose Maria Lupercio (Caso 1928). Yet, SP-1 a, SP-8a, and SP-8b remained unphotographed. 8 Figure 5.12 presents a hypothetical reconstruction of the latest staircase. The details of the balustrades are deduced from what still can be seen at the locality and from Acostas architec- tural reconstructions in buildings M and IV. As noted by Caso (1938: 5), the technique of rectangular slabs forming the slanted surfaces of the balustrades in the South Platform is unique, because in other examples these had small and closely spaced steps that aided in the adherence of a final stucco layer. Al- though no direct evidence was found, these slabs in the balus- trades also must have been coated with plaster. 294</page><page sequence="312">Fig. 5.1 1 Monte Alban, Mound SE and its superpositions according to Batres (1902: 12). another stone with reliefs (SP-9) adjacent to the cor- ner. It had been missed by Batres and Caso because the stone was resting on its carved surface. According to Von Winning (1983: 60) and John Paddock (per- sonal communication, 1992), who happened to be at the site while Acosta s work was in progress, the bot- tom side was covered with red paint. Today, however, no traces of the paint remain. Underneath the corner, Acosta located a stone-lined basin covered with slabs. The boxlike receptacle, as well as the objects found inside it, also were sprinkled with red paint. As a result of these unexpected findings, Acosta explored the other three corners of the building. At the northeastern angle he encountered a similar stone box with an offering and discovered that the under- side of SP-1 had carved reliefs too. At the southwest- ern corner, a third stone box with an offering was found. The existence of a fourth votive cache under- neath the southeastern corner could not be attested because of the depth reached by the basal body at this point. The unevenness of the terrain here demanded a compensatory leveling height of 4.40 m. Apparently this drastic difference in the topography led Marquina (1969: 318) to suggest that perhaps the South Plat- form was built over a natural eminence. Although there is no mention of it, it appears likely that the north- eastern and southwestern "stone boxes," as well as the underside reliefs on SP-1, were also strewn with red paint. The contents of all the "stone boxes" - which in- cluded unmodified shells, worked jades, and ceramic jars - were remarkably similar in type and quantity of objects (Table 5.1). Acosta determined that the two spouted jars from the northwestern and southwestern corner offerings were characteristic of the ceramic assemblage of the Monte Alban Ilia period (Fig. 5.13). The carving of the monoliths, their placement in the corners, and the last modification to the South Plat- form were dated accordingly. Because of the evidence of an earlier staircase, the author considered that the construction of the platform was begun earlier, ap- parently during Monte Alban II (Acosta 1959: 12, and 28). To set up the monoliths, Acosta relied on Batres s report. The reconstruction of the northeastern corner did not present a problem, but, when trying to ac- commodate the stones in the northwestern angle, Acosta was unable to determine which stone went where because of the unfortunate mistakes in Batres s report about the location of SP-7 and SP-8.The prob- lem was solved by embedding SP-5 and SP-8, leaving SP-6 freestanding nearby. Likewise, SP-7 was left loose in the area near the northeastern corner. Because of the tilting of SP-1 and the resetting of SP-8, Acosta 295</page><page sequence="313">c o â X3 u Â£ 0 (J &amp; o 1 i .a u â fl 1 s Ui I g 1 o GO V â¢fl 0 V) 4t s 1 -Q u â¢fl .a V &amp; 1 8 a O *13 &lt;J s s 0 u 1 u a o 2 CM t-H in bb Â£ 296</page><page sequence="314">noted for the first time that these two monoliths have a peculiar and identical protuberance on their back surfaces. This trait occurs only in the upper parts, run- ning along the entire width of the monoliths (Fig. 5.14). In the 1960s, John F. Scott conducted fieldwork at Monte Alban to compile a catalogue of carved stones that, on stylistic criteria, could be attributed to the early stages in the history of the city (600 B.C. to a.d. 200). In 1978, he published the assembled corpus, which includes 16 of the stones found by Caso in 1938 embedded along the exposed perimeter of the South Platform. The catalogue contains the drawings of 13 stones made by Agustin Villagra (Casos drafts- Fig. 5.13 Spouted vessels found in the (a) northwestern and (b) southwestern corner offerings of the South Platform, Monte Alban.

The unphotographed monolith (S-l) had already been pub- lished by Caso and was not visible at the time of Scott's survey because of a rubble slide. He introduced the designation sequence S-l to S-16 to refer to the monu- ments, which do not include the monoliths exposed and removed by Batres or the stone found by Acosta (Scott 1978). In 1978, Richard Blanton did a large-scale survey of the entire site of Monte Alban, corroborating the presence of surface features in the South Platform that had previously been recognized by Bandelier, Holmes, Batres, Osorio, and Herrera. Viewed in a larger context, the system of walls associated with the platform was interpreted by Blanton as regulation points for the ac- cess to the Main Plaza. The apparent seclusion of the South Platform led him to suggest that perhaps the struc- ture functioned as a temple (Blanton 1978: 61, 63, 99). The most recent work at the South Platform took place between 1988 and 1994. Marcus Winter con- ducted explorations aimed at clearing and protecting the perimeter of Mound III. The excavations con- firmed that the northwestern corner of the mound's plaza was closed by the wall that delimits it on the northern side. At this juncture, the wall itself exhibits two building episodes (Marcus Winter, personal com- munication, 1989). The work also corroborated the existence of the mound's staircase on the eastern side, clarified the nature of the spatial layout for the room at its summit, and eventually will permit a better as- sessment of the structure's superpositions. The expo- sure of the northern facade, for example, disclosed the occurrence of two construction events. The latter one appears to be a major modification to the staircase, which in turn generated a substantial addition to the perimeter of the building. In the process of consoli- dating the northern half of the staircase, Winter found a carved stone embedded in the basal wall just north of the balustrade (Fig. 5.15). Architectural History of the Platform To understand the overall context of the carved stones mentioned above, it is necessary to briefly dis- cuss what is known about modifications to the South Platform through time. The explorations of the struc- ture have been restricted predominandy to surface sur- veys and partial clearings, so the scant evidence per- mits only a superficial glance at the architectural his- tory. Except for the existence of a previous main stair- case immediately below the last version, nothing is known about the interior of the supporting platform.9 At the summit, however, there is the hole detected by 9 The origin of a drainage tunnel has been discovered about 12 m to the west of the northeastern corner (Garcia Moll, Patterson, and Winter 1986: pl. 154) (see Fig. 5.2K). It is 30 cm wide x 40 cm high and apparendy follows a north-south course. The tunnel seems to vary in its dimensions at different points, and its ultimate outlet is unknown. It has not been fully explored because of potential danger of collapse (Marcus Win- ter, personal communication, 1989). 298</page><page sequence="316">Herrera as early as 1932 (see Fig. 5.2 H).The hole is still there, close to the northeastern corner of the plaza of Mound III. The intrusion is irregular, small, and slightly more than 2 m deep, but it has exposed parts of two adobe walls perpendicular to each other and at different depths. These in turn are superseded by three successive stucco floors (Fig. 5.16). Although it is not possible to determine whether the walls are part of an earlier room or simply retaining cells, the evidence indicates that, at least at this locality, the sum- mit of the platform was resurfaced three times, the last one by about 60 cm of construction fill. A great deal of building activity is evident in Mound SE. Each of the tunnels that traverse it cut through at least four major architectural phases, as pre- viously suggested by Batres (see Fig. 5.11). Yet the opening caused by the collapse at the center of the mound discloses seven superimposed stucco layers without counting the eroded top floor (Fig. 5.17). In the irregular profile on the western side of this vertical exposure, the step of an earlier staircase associated with the fourth building episode can be seen, and the discontinuities of the layers around the hole suggest the existence of contemporary but different floor lev- els, as if rooms in the same structure had been differ- entiated by steps. With only two tunnels probing horizontally and in one direction through the nucleus of Mound III, it is not possible to obtain as clear a picture as that of Mound SE.That there was at least one major addition to the structure has been demonstrated by the recent (but still unpublished) work of Winter. Also, three possible walls running perpendicular to the tunnels are detected in the core of the mound (Fig. 5.18). The stones of the two walls in the northern shaft appear to have dressed surfaces facing the interior of the structure, and the Fig. 5.15 Stone Mound III- 1, Monte Alban (based on a photograph courtesy of Marcus Winter). 299</page><page sequence="317">one close to the outer perimeter might even have a cornice. A fourth wall is visible at the juncture of both tunnels and runs perpendicular to the others. It has an approximate deviation of 8 degrees west of north. From what is currendy exposed of it, a minimum height of 2.16 m can be documented. The layout and characteristics of these walls are puzzling, as is the fact that the construction fill be- tween them is apparently the same. It consists of a clay mixture with slabs placed horizontally. The size of the stones varies, and some of them are quite large. Per- haps the core of the mound is the result of a single construction event, and the presumed walls are parts of retaining cells. If so, the rate of superpositions in Mounds III and SE was different, but the correlation Fig. 5.16 Composite cross section of intrusion at the summit of the South Platform, Monte Alban. 300 of their construction sequences and the elucidation of how they tie to the artificial accretions on top of the platform are impossible for now. Evidence of later additions, probably maintenance work, can be observed in some parts of the platform. For instance, the wall of the west balustrade in the main staircase appears to have been reinforced by add- ing another one against it. Also, a major retaining fea- ture appears to have been built between the first two tiers on the western side, narrowing the existing alley (see Fig. 5.2 I and J). In summary then, the size of the entire structure has prevented a fully comprehensive understanding of the construction events that led to its current con- figuration. The few available glimpses suggest, how- ever, a prolonged and complex architectural history. Arrangement of the Corner Monoliths The ambiguity about exacdy where some of the corner stones had been found by Batres, a problem that became aggravated when the monuments were later reset by Acosta, needs to be clarified. Caso made the first attempt in 1928. Using Batres's report as a guideline, and through a series of deductions, he came up with the arrangement shown in Figure 5. 19. When Acosta reset the stones he did not consult Caso s work, even though he was baffled by the uncertainties in Batres 's report. His solution, recognized by himself as unsatisfactory, resulted in the arrangement shown in Figure 5.20. Note that SP-6 and SP-7 were left free- standing near the corners. Regarding the former, Acosta (1959: 26) even considered the possibility that the monolith had been found in the upper section of the basal body, above the other stones. Since Acosta s work, some of the original stones have been removed to the site museum and others have been replaced by casts.The position of the monoliths as of 1988 is shown in Figure 5.21. There is enough information, both widely scat- tered in the literature and still visible at the locality, to re-create the way the carved stones were originally found by Batres (Figs. 5.22 and 5.23). Acosta s explo- rations provide a solution to some of the discrepan- cies in the placement of the monoliths. The precise location and position of the stones in the northeast-</page><page sequence="318">ern angle is well ascertained; the problem involves placement of the stones in the other three corners. The case of the northwestern junction can be solved by a correction to Acosta s arrangement: SP-8 is re- placed by SP-6, and the position of SP-5 and SP-6 is reversed so that the latter forms the angle of the cor- ner. This placement is supported by a description in Batres s report, where he states the following: The broken stone [SP-5], when found, had its front [carved] side looking towards the north, and the prisoner [the carved person- age] towards the west. . . . The [other] stone [SP-6] was found on the left side of [SP-5]. (Batres 1902: pl. iv emphasis added) If Batres meant "to the left hand of SP-5" (i.e., giving the position of the stones from the point of view of the observer), then SP-6 would have been along the northern wall leaving the inscription carved in its narrow surface embedded and hidden from view, something not mentioned by Batres. That he gave the location of the stones in relation to the monoliths themselves can be demonstrated by three details. First, the drawings of Soriano show SP-6 to the right of SP-5 (Batres 1902: pl. iv). Second, Batres published shortly after his 1902 monograph a photograph of SP-6 in situ. The accompanying caption describes it as "angle stone from the great platform of the temples at Monte Alban" (Batres 1905: pl. xiv). Because the pho- tograph was taken from west to east, it shows only the larger carved surface. Being perpendicular to SP-6, SP- 5 is - as expected - not visible. Only the rubble cov- ering the northern wall of the platform can be seen in the background. The third detail corroborating the lo- cation of SP-6 west of SP-5 is the distance between SP-9 and the northwestern corner of the platform recorded by Acosta. SP-6, placed with both carved sur- Fig. 5.17 Plan and composite cross section of core of Mound SE, Monte Alban. 301</page><page sequence="319">Fig. 5.18 Monte Alban, plan of Mound III showing tunnels and associated features. faces visible, does indeed fit there. Actually, a portion of SP-9 adjacent to SP-6 can be seen in Batres's 1905 photograph.10 By clarifying the relative location of SP-5 and SP-6 it becomes evident that SP-8 was not in the northwestern corner. If this monolith was not there, where did it come from? Caso correctly deduced that it must have been in the southeastern corner. During Acosta's explora- tions it was discovered that the angle of this corner was formed by a nicely dressed yet plain quadrangular monolith. Immediately north of this stone, along the eastern facade, was an empty space (Acosta 1959: figs. 28, 29). This space, still present today, measures 1 .73 m in length by 45 cm in depth, exactly the same dimen- sions as the base of SP-8. By a process of elimination, SP-7 must have been found in the southwestern corner. Nowadays this angle is missing, corroborating Batres's (1902: pl. xix) and Caso's (1928: 85, map) placement. The question of the exact disposition of the monolith remains. The known versions of Castaneda's drawing (Dupaix drafts- man) indicate that the two carved surfaces were ex- 10 It seems that after Batres removed the monoliths from the northwestern corner, a portion of the northern wall adjacent to the stones collapsed, leaving a sizeable space near the angle. Acosta must have assumed that all such space had to be filled in, and the best fit was the combination of SP-8 and SP-5. Therefore, he never considered the possibility of putting SP-5 and SP-6 next to each other. 302</page><page sequence="320">Fig. 5.19 Arrangement of the corner monoliths of the South Platform, Monte Alban, according to Caso (1928). posed and visible, but one illustration shows the block standing and the other shows it on its side (see Fig. 5. 9). The illustration in the Villasenor edition of 1978 is more faithful in its reproduction of the carving on the large surface, as well as on the perspective of the carvings on the narrow side, but adds cracks that do not exist in the actual stone. This detail suggests that the rendering was "retouched" and rotated 90 degrees by the illustrator or lithographer in charge of the origi- nal Paris edition to give the monolith a "touch of antiquity." On the basis of this argument, it is be- lieved that SP-7 was standing vertically when docu- mented by Dupaix. So would have been the surviving lower fragment recovered by Batres. In summary, assuming that the relationship between SP-5 and SP-6 given by Batres is the result of another error in his report, the most likely arrangement of the corner monoliths was as shown in Figures 5.22 and 5.23. Except for insignificant details, this is the way Caso had placed them. 303</page><page sequence="321">ON m Os rH B CA o s s u 8 4 1) 5 0 2 s 1-4 1 6 1 o C/3 â¢s 0 1 a I u V Â£ u O 0 â I a 1 I I in &amp;b â¢iH PL, 304</page><page sequence="322">Fig. 5.21 Arrangement of the corner monoliths of the South Platform, Monte Alban, as of 1988. Previous Interpretations of the Carved Monoliths Several authors have proposed opinions and inter- pretations about the content and meaning of the cor- ner stones. Early commentators, however, had only a partial glimpse of the evidence. It was Batres who, based exclusively on the imagery in the stones, first made an important comment about their theme. However, the monoliths were viewed and described as isolated enti- ties. Batres recognized animal and human figures, most of which appeared bounded and therefore appeared to be conquered personages. Casos (1928) commentaries about the monoliths were more prolific. Because of his interest in the in- scriptions, the remarks were framed using the epi- graphic classification he had just developed. He dis- covered calendrical and noncalendrical repetitions be- tween SP-7a and SP-8b, setting the precedent for con- sidering the stones somehow related (Fig. 5. 24 A). Al- though the relationships between frontal and lateral carved surfaces, or that between images and texts, were not pondered, Caso concluded that most of the cor- 305</page><page sequence="323">f vÂ» I 8 0 u 8 1 1 0 s s Â«-l 1 g o c/3 u â s o 8 fi 0 u a a a 1 0 c T3 Â§ E a 3 1) â fl 9 8 1) â fl .a 1 fl o 2 OJ CN in .Â£ Uh 306</page><page sequence="324">Fig. 5.23 Monoliths in the southwestern and northwestern corners of the South Platform, Monte Alban, according to this study. ner stones formed a set: When observing the eight stelae ... we note that six of them (2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8) represent prisoners with hands tied to their backs, as if this structure had been built to commemo- rate the victories that Monte Alban accom- plished over the different places named in- side the "hill" glyph at the bottom of each of these stelae. (Caso 1928: 89) An implicit assumption was that the monoliths were in primary context. The authors historical interpreta- tion was based on the results of the epigraphic analy- sis, particularly on the identification of the year glyph and the year bearers. The emphasis on the calendrics probably led Caso to consider that all the glyphs with coefficients had a chronological value and to assume that even those that were not accompanied by nu- merals were time markers. Hence, the year/month/ day of occurrence of the commemorated events was presumably recorded. These dates, however, were not translated in terms of the indigenous calendar. Al- though most of the protagonists were taken to be mortals, the elaborately dressed personages in SP-2 and SP-3 were interpreted as deities or their im- personators. Acosta also commented on the epigraphy and ico- nography of the inscriptions in SP-lb and SP-9. Caso supported and expanded on his comments. Hence, they were not only framed using the classification already established since 1928 but also reflect developments in Caso s thinking. Their discussion was very detailed, and further epigraphic repetitions linking the newly discovered inscriptions were noted (Fig. 5.24B). But the implications of such repetitions were not elabo- rated on, and consequently the corner stones were not treated as a set. One significant new assumption was that not all the glyphs accompanied by coefficients necessarily had 307</page><page sequence="325">Fig. 5.24 Epigraphic repetitions (A) noted by Caso (1928) between Monte Alban's SP-7a and SP-8b, and (B) those noted by Acosta (1959) between SP-lb and SP-9. 308</page><page sequence="326">chronological value. All such glyphs in these two nar- row reliefs were considered to have a nominative func- tion. The noncalendrical inscriptions were taken to be place names, that is, to have a toponymic value. The data used to support this assumption were two glyphs showing the pictograph of a building and an associ- ated path with two human footprints (Fig. 5.25, nos. 1 and 2). Because of the "clear geographical referent," the possibility that the noncalendrical glyphs could stand for personal names was explicitly discarded as improbable. Further support for such elimination was the additional assumption that personal names or rank of the individuals were specified in the symbols car- ried in the personages' headdresses. Yet, recognizing that these constructs were based on assumptions, Acosta (1959: 20-21) left open the question of the specific meaning of the inscriptions. Yet, the content of the stones was again interpreted as historical. For instance, the scene in SP-9 was seen as showing the paying of homage by five individuals to a ruler (cacique) of Monte Alban who had the attributes and insignia of a deity ("God 5F"). Acosta s identification of their calendrical names is given in Table 5.2. Because the personages carry copal pouches in their hands and there are no representations of weapons in their garments or paraphernalia, the figures paying homage were taken to be priests. Acosta noted that the pictographs of buildings in the two glyphic com- pounds mentioned before shared representational simi- larities with temples inTeotihuacan iconography (Fig. 5.25, nos. 3 to 5). In addition, he pointed out the fre- quent occurrence of two glyphs in the Monte Alban corpus (including the corner monoliths) whose sig- nificance could not be determined. These glyphs were designated the "Three-scrolled Swastika" and the "Triple Adornment" (Fig. 5.26). In his concluding remarks, Acosta dealt with the important question of the relationship between fron- tal and lateral carvings: Now, we are going to deal with a very inter- esting aspect, which is if the stones were used initially as lintels, that is, horizontally, and then vertically as stelae, which might account for the hidden reliefs on the narrow surfaces. (Acosta 1959: 29) Two arguments against such a possibility were pro- posed. One was that the protuberances on the upper back surfaces of SP-1 and SP-8 probably served as counterweights and for better adherence to an em- bedding core. Hence, the stones must have been de- signed to be placed in a vertical position. The second argument was based on comparison with large mono- lithic lintels still in situ at Monte Alban that indicated inverted length- width ratios (cf. Acosta 1959: 31). Whereas the known lintels are rectangular prisms, the largest corner monoliths from the South Platform tend to be quadrangular blocks. Thus, Acosta surmised that these stones could not have been lintels.

Al- though Acosta considered his two arguments as suffi- cient proof, he nevertheless admitted that the prob- lem was not conclusively settled: the stones could have been used before they became stelae (ibid.: 31). By the time Caso published his synthesis on Zapotec sculp- ture in the Handbook of Middle American Indians (Caso 1965a: 857), Acosta's dating of period Monte Alban Ilia for the carving and placement of the monoliths was reasserted. In a much later and seemingly unrelated study on Teotihuacan iconography, Clara Millon proposed a specific interpretation for the "Triple Adornment" symbol that Acosta had noticed in the reliefs of SP-7a, SP-8b, and SP-9. The sign was present not only at Teotihuacan but in other parts of Mesoamerica as well. She labeled it the "Tassel Headdress" motif: The headdress seems to be associated with Teotihuacan as a political entity outside its own boundaries, or is associated with a social group of high rank from the city which, in some way, was involved in foreign relations, 3io possibly on a diplomatic level. (C. Millon 1973: 305) Echoing this statement and the 1959 work of Acosta and Caso, Joyce Marcus proposed an interpretation of the corner monoliths in three successive publications (1980, 1983h, 1992: 325-329, 400-409). Her discus- sion of the stones is based on the following assump- tions: 1 . The South Platform was built in a single stage. Following Acosta, this event, as dated by the ceramic vessels found in the corner offerings, took place during period Ilia. 2. The monoliths were found in primary context. The stones at the corners were placed as orthostats, and the carvings on their nar- row surfaces were never meant to be seen. Caso's arrangement of the stones was adopted, but with a significant modification (Fig. 5. 27 A). For SP-7a to be hidden from view, the main surface of the monolith would have been sideways (as in Figure 5.9B), or facing</page><page sequence="328">the south and not the west side of the south- western angle.11 3. Following Acosta and Caso, the glyphs with coefficients in the side carvings are taken as calendrical names. Marcus also assumed that most of the non- calendrical glyphs in the narrow surfaces have a nominal function as well (a possibility that had beer explicitly discarded by Acosta without solid basis). Therefore, all the personages on the side carvings would be identified by their calendrical names and most oi them by their personal name too. Only twc noncalendrical glyphs that were crucial to her argu- ments were retained as toponymic signs. On the basis of the iconographic similarities noted by Acosta, the glyph "Temple-footprints" was specifically interpreted by Marcus as the place name of Teotihuacan-Tetida. The other was considered to be the place name ol Monte Alban itself and "read" as "Hill of 1 Jaguar'1 (1980: 58; 1983h: 176, 178; 1992: 325) (Fig. 5.27B). Because of the occurrence of the "Tassel Head- dress" and the purported toponymic reference tc Teotihuacan-Tetida, the author concluded that the re- liefs in the stones depict and commemorate the visit of eight individuals fromTeotihuacan to Monte Alban on an ambassadorial mission, a peaceful political event that coincided with the dedication of the South Plat- form (1980: 58; 1983h: 176, 180; 1992: 325; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 217, 219). The calendrical names of only seven of the visitors could be "read" and, ex- cept for the coefficient, the calendrical name of a Zapotec lord who greeted the travelers remained uni- dentified (Table 5.3). Such conclusions, however, did not incorporate two of the six side carvings in the corner monoliths (SP-la and SP-8a).The interpretive incongruity between the narrow "hidden" carvings, which supposedly docu- ment a peaceful political event, and the frontal reliefs, which represent captives and conquests, has been ad- Fig. 5.25 Glyphs "Temple-footprints" (1-2) compared with representations of temples in Teotihuacan ceramics and a mural (3-5) (reassembled from Acosta 1959: fig. 32). dressed by Marcus only recendy by proposing that the carved monoliths commemorate the inauguration into rulership and enthronement of a prominent Zapotec lord named on the main surface of SP-1 as 12 Jaguar. 11 The alternative that the main carved surface of the monolith would have been sideways has already been discarded (see note 2, in this chapter, and the section "Arrangement of the Corner Monoliths"). The possibility that SP-7 was in an erect position facing the southern and not the western side of the southwest- ern corner necessarily implies that the stone not only had been removed from its location before Dupaix and Castaneda saw it, but that it was taken out of its architectural context as a single piece and left standing vertically in the immediate vicinity. 311</page><page sequence="329">It was during such an inauguration that several pris- oners where immolated, Teotihuacan ambassadors went to Monte Alban to pay homage to the new ruler, and the South Platform was dedicated (Marcus 1992: 325- 329; 1994; Marcus and Flannery 1996: 217-221).12 In response to Marcus's scenario before her inau- guration hypothesis, Hasso Von Winning (1983, 1984) presented some commentaries on the monoliths. The aim was not to propose an alternative overall interpre- tation but to criticize some of her specific arguments. In Von Winning's opinion, what C. Millon and Marcus call the Teotihuacan "Tassel Headdress" should be called at Monte Alban the "Triple Adornment" because both symbols differ in form and function (Fig. 5.28). Ac- cording to Von Winning, there are still no known ex- amples of the "Tassel Headdress" in the iconography and epigraphy of Monte Alban. Von Winning argued that many of the other traits in the reliefs are exclusively Zapotec and consequendy do not occur in the iconographic and stylistic reper- toire of Teotihuacan. These include the garments, ties between imagery in the carved headdresses and ele- ments on the ceramic urns, and occurrence of nonconventional representations of human faces. The most conspicuous is the practice of identifying per- sonages by both their calendrical and personal names. On the basis of these traits, Von Winning concluded that the scenes on the narrow surfaces of SP-7 and SP-9 depict priests of Zapotec affiliation paying hom- age to a Zapotec ruler or god ("Dios del Mono en el Fig. 5.26 Examples of (A) "Three-scrolled Swastika" and (B) "Triple Adornment" glyphs (rearranged from Acosta 1959: 19, fig. 18). 12 Several authors have taken Marcus's interpretation of Teotihuacan ambassadors as fact (Sandey 1983: 81; C. Millon 1988a: 125, 127). Based on the occurrence of the "Treble Scroll" glyph at both Monte Alban and Teotihuacan, Clara Millon (1988b: 217) claims that the Zapotecs may have named Teotihuacan as "Place of Heart Sacrifice." Coggins (1983: 62) goes further astray by stating, "The priesdy Teotihuacanos car- rying 'incense bags' may have gone to Monte Alban to learn how to measure the height of the sun and the seasons scientifi- cally with an instrument, and how to transmit this privileged knowledge from one place to another." 312</page><page sequence="330">Fig. 5.27 Side reliefs (A) mentioned by Marcus (1983h: 177, fig. 6.5), and (B) toponymic glyphs for Teotihuacan-Tetida and Monte Alban according to Marcus (1983h). 313</page><page sequence="331">3 u .a â *-Â» 0 a 8 1 I CU cÂ» CO CO Tt" 00 ON rH cP Â£ a Â£ s * J 1 0 s rS 3 1) u 1 jj Â£ â 3 @ 1 s Â§ 0 5 rt "c/J Â«* (U IE T3 1 P s &lt;u s 00 CN in fab Â£ 314</page><page sequence="332">Tocado"). This interpretation contrasts with that of Acosta and Caso in the specific ethnic attribution, in the different identification of the presiding "deity" and in considering all the noncalendrical glyphs as per- sonal names. The author's "reading" of the calendrical names in SP-9 differs only slightly from that of Marcus (Table 5.4). Despite the iconographic disagreements and their implications, there is a similarity between the scenarios of both authors: the implicit, although in the case of Von Winning it is rather the inconsistent, assump- tion that the stones were found in a primary con- text. This also led the latter author to propose that the "hidden" carvings reflect "a political motive" (Von Winning 1983: 57, 61). The reason for a con- trast between the scenes on the narrow surfaces (in which "priests-rulers of a region under Zapotec control are paying homage to a Monte Alban ruler-god") and those on the frontal surfaces (in which "bound prisoners are personifying defeated chieftains and their towns") was not clarified. Gordon Whittaker (1983) attempted to decipher the calendrical inscriptions on the corner monoliths by using the set of year bearers extensively employed during late Pre-Hispanic times (set III) as a model. Notwithstanding the use of Nahuad calendrical names, Whittaker assumed implicitly two premises: (1) that the carved monoliths were found in a primary con- text - adopting Caso s arrangement of the stones, and (2) that all the glyphs accompanied by coefficients in the stone's inscriptions have a chronological value. Al- though no coherent picture emerged from his analy- sis, he concluded the following: 1 . There is a correlation between the place- ment of the stones around the South Plat- form and their sequence in the 52-year cycle, meaning perhaps that they were not only se- quentially placed but also that they are to be "read" from right to left, starting with SP-1 and ending with SP-2 - that is, following in a clockwise direction their location in the platform. 2. "Read" this way, the inscriptions in the program have a chronological frame that spans 26 years (from a year 13 Tecpad in SP-1 to a year 13 Tochtli in SP-2). 3. By plotting the annual dates carved in SP-6, SP-5, and SP-3 on this lapse, a pattern emerges "suggesting the possibility that the Zapotecs ordered events to fit the close or beginning of a recurring four-year subcycle, in a kind of ritual systematization of history. Alternatively, it may simply be that they pre- ferred to set down events at four-year inter- vals" (Whittaker 1983: 120). 4. Within this narrative program, stones SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9 form a subset whose inscriptions contain a series of Table 5.4 Calendrical Names of Personages in SP-9, Monte AlbAn, According to Von Winning Compared with Marcus's Identifications Marcus Von Winning (1992) (1984) 13 Knot no comment 9 Monkey 9 Monkey 1 Owl 1 Owl 8 ?

Tochtli, although in a previous state- ment the author "read" the annual date in SP-1 as 13Tecpatl. 5. There is a strong possibility for the oc- currence of glyphs that refer to a unit of time larger than the trecenas or veintenas. Specifi- cally, such units could be cycles of 52 days (a subdivision of the 260 ritual calendar: 5 x 52 = 260). Such glyphs do not have coefficients but occur adjacent to day names that coin- cide with or fall close to the end of such larger periods (ibid.: 124). There are two main disagreements between Whittaker and previous commentators. First, he as- sumes that all the glyphs with coefficients have a chro- nological value. Acosta, Caso, Marcus, and Von Win- ning concede that, in this context, those glyphs have a nominative function. Second, his approach is oriented exclusively toward the epigraphy, adopting the extreme position of ignoring completely the analysis of the accompanying images. In terms of artistic conventions, Whittaker saw the stones, particularly SP-1 , SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9, as "cast in a style resulting from intensifying foreign contact with theTeotihuacan-dominated north and southeast" (ibid.: 124). Carey Rote briefly revived the idea, initially posed by Acosta, of the monolith's nonprimary context by commenting that the "stelae created in connection with the dedication of the South Platform . . . may have also been re-utilized from a previous context, since part of their imagery is hidden within the walls of the plat- form" (Rote 1987: 124). Yet, her interpretation that the corner monoliths were erected and dedicated to commemorate an important battle in which notori- ous Zapotec leaders took important captives (ibid.: 134) takes for granted that the stones, as found, display a purposeful coherent program. A contradiction to the possibility that the monuments could have been re- used becomes apparent when she adds the following: The places and individuals named on [the narrow reliefs of] stela 1, 7, 8 and the Estela Lisa [SP-9] may relate to the imagery of 316 Zapotec military victory elsewhere on these monuments [SP-1, SP-2, SP-3, SP-5, SP-6]. In fact, these may be the noblemen/ warriors who aided in the conquest of these foreign sites. (Ibid.: 135-136) Rote followed Whittaker s calendrical terminology and discussed the carved narrow surfaces separately from the larger ones. Unable to "offer a more detailed explanation," Rote (ibid.: 143-144) ended up provid- ing brief and general descriptions of the imagery on each stone. The Reuse of Carved Stones in the South Platform From Figures 5.3 to 5.6, which show all the carved stones as they were found in the basal body of the platform and as steps in the central staircase, four im- portant observations can be made: 1. Despite an apparent pattern in the cor- ner monoliths, the relationships between them seem anomalous. For instance, the southeast- ern junction does not have a corner mono- lith carved on two surfaces, and the carvings on the narrow side of SP-7 do not display a vertical arrangement as in SP-2b and SP-6b. 2. The distribution and positions of the other carved stones do not exhibit a pattern. 3. Considering the stones as a group, their carvings present a wide range of thematic and stylistic variation. 4. The stones also exhibit differential states of preservation. Several are mere fragments. Furthermore, the reliefs, whether in whole or fragmentary stones, show different degrees of obliteration. If the carved stones were placed when the basal wall was built, the preceding set of observations in- evitably leads to the following conclusions: (1) that the carved stones are not in a primary context; (2) that</page><page sequence="334">there are parts of several distinct narrative composi- tions; and (3) that these different programs pertain to different periods. On the basis of themes and styles, it is possible to deduce the existence of at least eight narrative compositions, all of which must have been carved and dismantled at different points in time but whose constituent parts were eventually used, among other things, in erection of the South Platform's basal body. Without counting the corner monoliths, these compositions include the following (Fig. 5.29): (a) The M.A. I program from Building L (S-l) (b) Another M.A. I program (S-4, S-15, and S-19) (c) A M.A. II program (SP-4a) (d) A second M.A. II program (S-10 and S-27) (e) A third M.A. II program (S-l 1 and S-l 6) (f ) The M.A. II program from Building J (S-3 and S-l 8) (g) A M.A. Illa/b program (SP-4b) (reusal of c) There are also two stones that appear to be the waste from a carving workshop, because the reliefs look like abandoned sketches (see Fig. 5.5, S-l 3 and S-25). Also, the stone labeled S-20 in Figure 5.4 still has a coating of stucco with traces of red paint (cf. Garcia Moll, Patterson, and Winter 1986: pl. 318, no. 433). The Group of Monoliths from Monte Alban III Having reviewed previous interpretations of the corner monoliths and pointed out that all the carved stones embedded in the basal perimeter of the South Platform are apparently reused material pertaining to different epochs, I will attempt to elucidate how the group of monoliths dating to Monte Alban III might have been originally displayed. However, be- fore doing so, I will conduct an analysis of their state of preservation. Because the monoliths were moved around a number of times after their discovery, two evaluations need to be made: their condition at the time of the initial finding and their current state of completeness. The first assessment can be done on the basis of several early drawings and photographs. The second relies on direct inspection of the stones. Condition of SP- 1 SP-1 is the only corner monolith that has never been taken away from its location. In the large carved surface, a small portion of the relief on the bottom left side is missing (Fig. 5.30A, arrow 1), indicating a fracture along that side. More extensive breakage is evident in the upper and lower reliefs. The lower side has an incomplete register on the left end (arrow 2), and the upper surface lacks a complete register on the right end. Whatever was carved there is now com- pletely obliterated (arrow 3). If these incomplete reg- isters are reconstructed by using the dimensions of the complete ones, and if vertical projections are then extended, it becomes evident that the monolith origi- nally could have been an almost quadrangular block (Fig. 5.30B). A direct inspection of the sides supports the de- duction of fractures all along from top to bottom.These surfaces are not only irregular, they also have an un- even texture. To the right of the main surface, how- ever, the columnar inscription adjacent to the border is not damaged. Actually, the last two glyphs on it (ar- row 4) seem to follow the direction of the broken edge. The back surface, with a prominence that runs across the entire upper width of the stone, was worked in straight planes and was left with a coarse texture. Such a contrast between the condition of the lateral and the back surfaces suggests that, originally, the right and left sides were well faced. Because it is unlikely that such extensive damage to the stone resulted from Acosta s work, which simply involved tilting it to check the underside, the conclusion is that the monolith was already broken and incomplete when it was placed in the basal body of the platform. Condition of SP-2 Stone SP-2 was removed from Monte Alban at the beginning of the century and since then has been on display at the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City. Because of changes in the installations at the museum, the stone subsequently has been transferred on at least two occasions. Soriano s drawing of the monolith clearly indicates that its present condition is the same as when it was exposed by Batres. 317</page><page sequence="335">d 55 Â§ O s g u i Â£ i 0 t/i â 8 .s S Â§ D t/i 1 I Â£ Â§ (U C/5 B cx, a a o ;c "35 0 1 o U ON CN in fab Â£ 318</page><page sequence="336">fl o â 13 u 5 a o u K o â C â¢a 0 1 a 6 9 i &lt;u s o s T- I PU oo U-t o a 0 â 13 1 o u 4-Â» G &lt;L&gt; t/i Â£ Pi Pi g o cn in bb Â£ 319</page><page sequence="337">Fig. 5.31 Present condition of SP-2, Monte Alban: (a) front surface; (b) side surface; (c) back surface. The stone is incomplete along the left upper side, al- though the reliefs close to that edge are barely dam- aged (Fig. 5.31, arrow 1). Extensive chipping is more evident along the upper and right edges (arrows 2 and 3) and is more conspicuous along the upper border of surface b, where a part of the top glyph is missing (arrow 4). As already noted, on the posterior side of the stone is a first attempt at carving the scene contained in the frontal surface. The early version is inverted in relation to the later one. When the reliefs are compared in the same position, the breakage along the stone's left: bor- der becomes evident, because part of the earlier relief is missing at the bottom (Fig. 5.32, arrow 5). The treat- ment of the upper surface and that of the underside - 320 whose edge is visible in Casoss photograph (1928: 128) - suggests that the stone was nicely dressed on at least five of its six faces. A number of explanations for this condition are conceivable. Perhaps originally the block was not a rectangular prism and had an irregular shape along the left side even at the time when the first carving was being outlined. Or the block was a rectangular prism when quarried but broke slightly during its transportation from the source to the place where it was carved. Whatever the case, the missing portions of carved elements mean that the monolith was already slightly battered when it was placed in the northeastern angle of the South Platform. Further chipping along the edges could have occurred when the structure was abandoned and began to crumble.</page><page sequence="338">Fig. 5.32 Comparison of the (A) front and (B) back surfaces of SP-2, Monte Alban. The comparison in Figure 5.32 also indicates that work on the initial sketch was discontinued because of a miscalculation of space. The proportions of the glyph upon which the personage appears standing did not leave enough room to include the two footprints of the columnar inscription. In the last version certain details of the personage s helmet are slightly different, particularly the shape of the appendage hanging in front of the chest, which in the early version was in- tended to be a bifid tongue and in the subsequent carving became rattlesnake ratdes with a scroll at the tip. Condition of SP-3 SP-3 was removed from Monte Alban, transferred a number of times while at the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City, and then re- turned to Monte Alban and reset in the location where it was found. When documented by Soriano, the stone was already chipped in the upper left corner and a small section along the right upper edge had broken off (Fig. 5.33, arrows 1 and 2). In addition, a portion of the lower right corner was missing (arrow 3). Today the monolith is broken into two pieces. The fracture line has a "V" shape and runs across the middle of the block (arrow 4). This fissure, however, appears to be barely indicated in Soriano s drawing (cf. Batres 1902: pl. in, no. 2). There- fore, it is possible that the stone cracked as a result of vandalism that took place once the South Platform was abandoned. The portions of the lateral and upper sur- faces that are still intact are very well dressed, as well as the back surface. These conditions indicate that origi- nally the monolith was a nicely faced rectangular prism. 321</page><page sequence="339">Fig. 5.33 Present condition of SP-3, Monte Alban. Condition of SP-5 Monument SP-5 was discovered broken and in- complete at the beginning of this century, even though it was found in situ. The fragment corresponding to the lower portion of the stone was removed from Monte Alban and sent to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City by Batres. Sub- sequendy,it was relocated several times while in Mexico City and then sent back to Monte Alban to be em- 322 bedded again in the basal body of the South Platform. It was removed once more and taken to the Museo de Monte Alban, where it stands today. Despite all these changes, the piece has not suffered additional damage. In the 1960s, Scott documented a fragment of a stone lying halfway down the western slope of Mound D in the Vertice Geodesico - i.e., an architectural group located more than 400 m to the north of the South Platform (see Fig. 4.26). At the time, the fragment was seen as part of a step carved in Izapa style. Because the</page><page sequence="340">Fig. 5.34 Stone found in the Vertice Geodesico, North Platform, Monte Alban (A and B after Scott 1978, 2: E-3). relief was being viewed upside down, the representa- tion was "indistinct; perhaps standing figure with arms doubled back onto shoulders, facing left" (Scott 1978 [II]: E-3) (Fig. 5. 34). This fragment, now in the Museo de Monte Alban, is a portion of the upper half of SP-5. In the plaza of the Vertice Geodesico, and adjacent to temple A, lies yet another small fragment that is also part of this monolith (Fig. 5.35A).13 Such a dispersion of fragments could have a num- ber of alternative explanations. The fact that the larger upper fragment (VGD-1) was found halfway down the slope of a mound suggests that it had fallen from a structure above. If so, the breakage of SP-5 took place in antiquity, and only a portion of it was used in the construction of the South Platform s basal wall. How- ever, based on the case of SP-7, which is discussed later, the breakage of SP-5 and the wide dispersion of its constituent fragments also could be the result of post-abandonment vandalism and subsequent drag- ging.14 The other smaller upper fragments (including VGD-3) may have broken off from VGD-1 while the latter was being moved away from the South Platform 13 In June 1988 I conducted, with partial results, a surface search for other fragments of this stone in and around the Vertice Geodesico. Two more plain fragments were close to VGD-3. One has three of its surfaces well faced and must be part of the upper left corner of SP-5. The other piece has two of its surfaces well dressed and could correspond to any of the vari- ous missing portions. The removal of the ramp that was built by Caso to retrieve the debris in the plaza of the Vertice Geodesico, conducted during the "Proyecto Especial, 1992- 94," did not yield additional fragments (Marcus Winter, per- sonal communication, 1994). VGD-1 is now what Scott desig- nated E-3. Another designation for this fragment is stone 215 (Garcia Moll, Patterson, and Winter 1986: pl. 267). The small fragment VGD-3 is also known as stone 217 (ibid.). 14 Nicolas Leon (1905b: 410) cites a news document that gives an idea of the vandalism that took place at Monte Alban dur- ing the 18th century: "When Mr. Juan Antonio Corsi was Mayor, his son Mr. Franscisco Corsi, who is currendy accoun- tant in the Tax Tribunal of New Spain, told me that when his father explored the ruins [of Monte Alban] he ordered the ex- cavation of one of the mounds where several idols and stucco floors had been found, and encountered a tomb stone that had a number of lines with unknown characters, and that when he wanted to bring the stone to the city of Oaxaca, it was neces- sary to cut it into four pieces, and doing so the fragments are today in the ward of La Trinidad, in the house that the Mayor built, used as the garden's drainage." 323</page><page sequence="341">a o 'C o g a o u B 73 â¢13 0 1 .s u 1 c o â a a o &lt;j Â£ &lt;u M B a&lt; .2 @ lO cx C/3 ^C/3 Â«s &lt;u â M c o s o Â§ If* (Li g in co u-5 bh Â£ 324</page><page sequence="342">or much later when the fragment had been left loose. It is therefore just as plausible that SP-5 was in one piece when erected in the northwestern corner of the South Platform. The right, bottom, and back surfaces of the fragment found embedded in the platform, as well as those lateral ones still extant in the loose fragments found in the Vertice Geodesico, are all dressed in straight planes and fin- ished with fine textures (Fig. 5.35B, arrows 1 to 3). In contrast, the left lateral surface in the lower fragment is irregular and coarse, a condition indicating a fracture (arrow 4). Because the lower piece was found embed- ded, SP-5 was most probably placed in the South Plat- form as a single but already slighdy incomplete stone. Whatever the processes that led to the wide dissemina- tion of its parts, the monolith originally must have been another nicely worked rectangular prism (Fig. 5.35C). Condition of SP-6 Stone SP-6 had the same fate as most of the cor- ner monoliths. It was taken away from Monte Alban and sent to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City, moved a number of times while there, and then sent back to Monte Alban and placed near the South Platform. Eventually, it was taken to the Museo de Monte Alban, where it is today. Com- parison of its present state with the rendering by Soriano and the photograph by Batres indicates that the stone has not been damaged since it was docu- mented in 1902. At the beginning of this century, the upper right corner of the monolith was already miss- ing (Fig. 5.36, arrow 1). In addition, the stone was chipped along most of the right edge in the main sur- face (a), so that the carved elements adjacent to it were incomplete (arrow 2). Flaking is also evident in the upper left corner (arrow 3). Less indicative of a break- age is the sharp irregularity in the lower right side of the stone, but the edge along it is chipped (arrow 4). In contrast, the top and back surfaces are faced in straight planes and finished with a rather coarse tex- ture. Most of the damage could have occurred when the stone was already embedded in the South Plat- form but after the structure was abandoned. However, the angle and texture left by the missing portion on the upper right corner suggest a defect that could have originated when the block was quarried. The irregu- larity in the lower right side is more difficult to ex- plain. Because the stone was found embedded, it is plausible that it was already broken when placed in the northwestern corner of the platform. Yet, it can- not be argued conclusively that the monolith was origi- nally a rectangular prism with all its angles well de- fined. Condition of SP- 7 SP-7 was documented during the nineteenth cen- tury as a complete stone by Dupaix (in Alcina Franch 1969) and Carriedo (n.d.). Although in 1902 only the lower portion of the monolith was found, it is pos- sible that the missing part or parts are still scattered or buried somewhere at the site. Because it was evidently found in situ by Dupaix and Batres, the stone must have been mutilated there. The remaining fragment was taken to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City at the beginning of this cen- tury and was moved several times while it was there. Then it was returned to Monte Alban, set down as a loose stone near the South Platform, and then taken to the museum at the site. Some time after its return to Monte Alban the fragment suffered further dam- age. Today, the right bottom corner in surface A is bro- ken off and the detached carved fragment is lost (Fig. 5.37A, arrow 1). Fortunately, the relief can be accu- rately reconstituted by using two published photo- graphs (Caso 1928: 144; 1965a: 856) (Fig. 5.37B). The reconstruction on paper of the monolith s upper part, however, presents a number of difficulties. Using Castaneda's drawing in the edition of Alcina Franch (1969) as a general guide, and relying more on the known proportions of the human figures carved in SP-5, SP-6, and SP-8, an approximate height of 1.90 m for the entire block is obtained. Dupaix's de- scription, however, states that the stone was approxi- mately 1 .68 m tall and more or less 1 .27 m wide. From Castaneda's drawing, which was done to scale, the same dimensions can be derived.15 A second method for corroborating these figures is by a simple relationship: 15 Dupaix's measurements and Castaneda's scale are in varas, a unit approximately equivalent to 84 cm (33 inches) (Taylor 1972: 261). 325</page><page sequence="343">Fig. 5.36 Present condition of SP-6, Monte Alban. because the width of the stone is known (approxi- mately 1.31 m), the height of the block - as derived from the early rendering - is again less than 1.80 m. The difference in the vertical dimension between Dupaix's data and the reconstructed drawing, as well as a more detailed comparison between the existing lower half and Castaneda's rendering, discloses an in- teresting detail: the stone must have been slightly bur- ied at the base when it was documented by these early explorers. An inspection of Figure 5.38A reveals that Castaneda's illustration of surface b is slightly inaccu- rate in proportions (numerals in relation to cartouche) and composition (the human figure is shown standing 326 at the center of the bottom glyph, when in fact it is to the right). On the other hand, and notwithstanding the curious perspective, surface a in Castaneda's ver- sion includes five individuals facing in the same direc- tion and six groups of glyphs, each group in front of a human figure (the glyphs are rendered as phytomorphic elements and were described by Dupaix as unknown figures). Peculiarly, the lower side of the carved scene in Castaneda's drawing begins with a column of glyphs and not with a personage, as is the case in the actual relief. Note also that in the nineteenth century draw- ing the relief in surface b coincides with the bottom edge of the stone. Thus, the discrepancies just noted in the rendering of surfaces a and b are not only due to</page><page sequence="344">Fig. 5.37 (A) Present condition of SP-7, Monte Alban, and (B) Reconstruction of carving surface a. 327</page><page sequence="345">Fig. 5.38 (A) Reconstruction of the bottom portion of Monte Alban s SP-7 (left) and Castaneda's rendering of the stone (right), and (B) a full reconstruction of the monolith. 328</page><page sequence="346">errors in composition and proportions but to the fact that the plain area below the carvings in surface b and the lower (or right) human figure in surface a were hidden from Castaneda's view. If the monolith had been entirely above ground, he would have seen six per- sonages on the narrow surface and the stone would have been some 1.90 m tall. Caso's comment on the drawing made by Carriedo in 1840 is relevant in this context: On plate 10 of the atlas that accompanies the manuscript of Carriedo, which is kept today in the National Library,16 appears the draw- ing of the missing carving on the stela's side surface. Unfortunately, the renderings of Castaneda and Carriedo are so deficient that they do not provide any useful data, except for the occurrence of two more personages in addition to those that appear in the extant lower fragment of the stone. (Caso 1928: 86, emphasis added) In this other rendering, Carriedo did document six personages and, as seems to be implied in Casos commentary, all were facing in the same direction.17 There is also evidence to suggest that when Castaneda documented SP-7, the stone was probably broken and incomplete in the upper right corner and that, therefore, surface a could have had more than six carved personages. For instance, if two more human figures are added to surface a using the size of the available ones, a major discrepancy becomes evident: not all the lateral area obtained from the inferred height of 1.90 m can be filled in (Fig. 5.38B). The other alternative of decreasing the height of the block does not leave enough room to accommodate the recon- structed personage in surface b. Even if the upper left corner was broken at the beginning of the nineteenth century, it cannot neces- sarily be deduced that the monolith was already in- complete before its placement in the southwestern corner of the South Platform. Such breakage could have happened once the structure fell into disuse and began crumbling. The examination of all surfaces on the existing lower half of SP-7 yields important evi- dence. Although the bottom side cannot be inspected because of the current position of the fragment, the uncarved surfaces to the left and in the back are dressed in straight planes. Most likely, the entire stone was at one time a well-faced rectangular block. Although the state of completeness of SP-7 does not allow one to derive demonstrable evidence of its condition when it was placed in the southwestern corner of the platform, the relative disposition of the reliefs on both surfaces seems awkward and suggests reutilization. Hasso Von Winning made an important observation about the relief carved on surface a: The style of this relief is very different from that on the frontal surface (side b) and must have been executed later in time , once the stone had suffered damage. That this was so is indi- cated by the higher level at which the feet of individual D (extreme right) were carved, as these were not affected by the breakage in the inferior part. (Von Winning 1984: 9, em- phasis added) (Fig. 5.37B, arrow 2) The implications of this comment will be treated later on. First, I want to comment on the reconstitu- tion of the inscription in surface B (Fig. 5.39). Castaneda's drawing shows two main glyphs, the lower one with two additional discrete elements at either side. Caso interpreted the upper glyph as the repre- sentation of a bent hill. Because of the coefficients, the second glyph was taken as a day sign and labeled with the letter T (Caso 1928: 85). Contextual analysis conducted later in this chapter indicates that the up- per sign is a year glyph. The closest resemblance of the lower sign with any of the known bearers is with glyph E. Actually, both glyphs resolve - with few modifica- tions - into these two. The elements flanking the bearer E (downward footprints?) remain unexplained. 16 Carriedo s atlas and manuscript were looked for in the vari- ous branches and special collections of the national library in June 1989, but no catalogue entry was found. 17 The illustration of SP-7 in the Mexican edition of Dupaix's work (Villasenor 1978) also shows six personages (see Fig. 5.9B). 329</page><page sequence="347">Condition of SP-8 SP-8 has also been moved a number of times. It was first sent to the Museo National de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City, transferred upon changes in the museums installations, and then returned to Monte Alban to be embedded in the northwestern corner of the platform. It stands there today, and all the surfaces other than the bottom are exposed and visible. However, it is precisely the condition of the underside that provides the first clue about the in- completeness of the stone. Soriano's drawing of this surface indicates that most of a fifth register at one end is missing. Caso's 1928 rendering (Fig. 5.40A) was based on Soriano's but omits the reputed vestige and therefore documents only four registers. The only published photograph of the bot- tom surface is at an angle (cf. Von Winning 1983: 59, fig. 2a) and does not allow a solution of the matter. But, as demonstrated by an unpublished photograph (Fig. 5.40B), most of a register at the extreme left is indeed missing (arrow 1), confirming that Soriano's rendering is accurate in that respect. When the absent portion is reconstructed by using the dimensions of the other squares, and when vertical projections are extended toward the upper side of the stone, it be- comes evident that SP-8 too originally must have been an almost quadrangular block. This reconstruction also indicates that surface a is incomplete, with two regis- ters missing (Fig. 5.40C, arrows 2 and 3). Also, the carv- ing on the central right square is partially obliterated (arrow 4). The reconstitution of the broken epigraphic elements demonstrates that about 10 cm on the right side are missing.

Direct observation of the condition of the lower and upper surfaces reinforces this deduc- tion.The stepped back side is dressed in straight planes. Thus, it can be concluded that this monolith was at one time a nicely faced block and that when embed- ded in the southeastern corner of the South Platform it was already incomplete. Condition of SP-9 Compared with most of the other corner mono- liths, SP-9 has not been moved much. Shortly after its discovery in 1958, the stone was sent to the Museo Nacional de Antropologia e Historia in Mexico City, and it has been transferred only because of changes in the museum's installations. Its present condition is the same as when it was found.The upper surface has a straight face finished with a coarse texture, a characteristic that gave the stone its former name, Estela Lisa (plain stela). In contrast, the bottom surface is evenly dressed and has a fine texture. The back surface cannot be inspected be- cause of the way the monolith is displayed. However, from available photographs of the stone in situ (Acosta 1959: figs. 9, 14), it appears to be evenly faced. The surface with reliefs is incomplete at the left bottom corner (Fig. 5.41, arrow l).The course of the left lateral surface, which follows a sharp angle from the carved broken corner, suggests that both condi- Fig. 5.41 Present condition of SP-9, Monte Alban. 332</page><page sequence="350">tions are the result of a sharp blow. The right side of the carved surface is slightly chipped (arrow 2) and the lateral right surface is quite irregular, having a pro- nounced inner curvature (arrow 3). The texture of this surface is uneven. These characteristics also indicate another fracture. To further evaluate the state of completeness of SP-9, a comparison with SP-7a might be profitable, because both contain similar reliefs (Fig. 5.42). One striking difference is that in SP-7a the glyphs accom- panying the individuals appear in front of each figure, whereas in SP-9 they appear behind. Could it be that there is a missing personage in SP-9? Acosta (1959: 20) explicitly states that on the left end there is not enough space for another figure, yet he never men- tions the clear fact that the corner is broken! Direct Fig. 5.42 SP-9, SP-7a, and reconstruction of SP-9, Monte Alban. 333</page><page sequence="351">inspection of the upper left angle in the relief indeed discloses traces of a badly eroded carved element (Fig. 5.42, arrow 4). If another figure is added to SP-9, the length of the carved surface would be slightly larger than that of SP-7a,but the depicted processions would include six personages each. Further comparison shows that, whereas in SP-9 five individuals confront another, in SP-7a all six figures face in the same direction. If both reliefs had the same format but a different number of individuals depicted in the scenes, then SP-7a would have had a seventh personage that confronted the other six. Such a possibility, of course, would solve the prob- lem generated when reviewing the reliability of Castaneda's drawing and when trying to reconstitute the upper half of the stone. But returning to SP-9, all the direct and indirect evidence indicates that the monolith was already incomplete when it was em- bedded in the northwestern corner of the South Plat- form. The following general conclusions result from the preceding analysis of the state of completeness of all the corner stones: 1 . Although some of the damage evident to- day in the edges and corners of the monoliths can be attributed to ancient vandalism once the South Platform was abandoned, and to a much lesser degree to the various movements they have been subjected to in modern times, several decisive cases of missing portions dem- onstrate that, although found in situ , the stones were not in primary context. This is most evi- dent in the case of SP-1, SP-8, and SP-9. 2. After being quarried, but before being carved with reliefs, almost all the monoliths were worked into nicely dressed and well-faced rectangular prisms. The only possible excep- tions are SP-2 and SP-6. Although well faced, these stones have a slanted surface. The Monoliths as Narrative Compositions Because some of the carvings on the monoliths from the South Platform were executed on narrow 334 surfaces, a condition that must have imposed certain restrictions on the composition, and because the theme of the carvings is apparendy different from that ex- ecuted on the larger surfaces, it seems justifiable to treat them separately in the following discussion. The intent is to reconstruct their original context, one in which the information in each stone was self-con- tained and where their arrangement as a group added layers of meaning that are otherwise not evident. I begin by focusing on the carvings in the larger sur- faces (program A), followed by a discussion of the carv- ings on the narrow surfaces (program B). Program A If, as has been concluded, the stones from the South Platform were not in primary context, how were they set up originally? Although the whole basal perim- eter of the structure has not been cleared, leaving the possibility that the total number of carved stones at the locality still might be unknown, there are sufficient rea- sons to propose that SP-1 , SP-2, SP-3, SP-5, SP-6, SP-7, and SP-8 formed a coherent narrative composition.This does not mean that the set could not have been related to other still unknown program(s). If the listed monoliths are placed as in Figure 5.43A, an alternative dictated in part by the fact that SP-2 and SP-6 were evidendy intended to be corner stones, several patterns emerge: 1 . Stones SP-1 , SP-7, and SP-8 become the focal point of the program. Together, they form a composite processional scene in which two individuals are shown apparendy walking toward and confronting a third person, who appears seated. That this central procession did not have other monoliths as constituent ele- ments will be demonstrated later on. 2. Within the central scene, SP-1 is the most important carving. The seated personage is richly dressed, wearing an imposing headdress, and carrying elaborate paraphernalia. The person's importance is furthermore accentu- ated by prolific epigraphy. In contrast, the human figures carved in SP-7 and SP-8 wear less imposing headdresses, have only loincloths,</page><page sequence="352">and are shown with their arms tied behind their backs. Their legs also appear tied just below the knees (Fig. 5.43B). 3. Considering the narrative composition as a whole, the personages to the left of the central scene (those in SP-2 and SP-3) ap- pear dressed in animal disguises and wearing elaborate headdresses. They are also shown bound, but exclusively by the arms. 4. To the right of the central scene, the in- dividuals depicted in SP-5 and SP-6 wear simple headdresses and are dressed only in loincloths. Like the personages shown in SP-7 and SP-8, these too are represented with their arms tied in the back and with their legs tied just below the knees. 5. Taken as pairs, the personages in SP-2/ SP-3, SP-7/SP-8, and SP-5/SP-6 are differ- entiated by "sound scrolls." These appear only with the individuals standing on the right of each pair. Further symmetries are displayed in the monoliths flanking the central procession: 6. The stones on both extremes of the pro- gram, SP-2 and SP-6, depict individuals fac- ing toward the center of the composition. Because, as mentioned before, these mono- liths were evidently conceived as corner stones, the surfaces with the carved person- ages could not be seen if the set was viewed frontally. Only the narrow surfaces carved with hieroglyphic texts could be seen from a fron- tal point of view. Even if looked at from the side, only one human figure in the corner stones could be seen at a time. 7. The stones on either side of the central scene, SP-3 and SP-5, depict individuals fac- ing away from the center of the composi- tion. The accompanying epigraphic texts have a symmetrical arrangement in both mono- liths, which will be clarified later. 8. The stones forming the central scene and those flanking them (SP-3, SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-5) are all blocks of green volcanic tuff of approximately the same height. The vol- canic tuff does not occur naturally at Monte Alban. Therefore, these stones were quarried and brought to the site from a distant source, probably in the Etla valley. 9. The stones at both ends of the narrative composition (SP-2 and SP-6) appear to be of sedimentary origin and have the same ap- proximate height.These are much shorter than the other stones. It is possible that both mono- liths could have been quarried at Monte Alban itself. As noted before, these two stones are the only ones that probably were not com- pletely rectangular. The arrangement discussed so far would have had a span of some 8.5 m, and the architectural context would necessarily imply a quadrangular or rectangu- lar platform with at least one decorated facade. It seems logical to assume that no staircase interrupted the nar- rative composition. Yet the hypothetical platform could have had one or two staircases located on undeco- rated sides. Perhaps other facades within the same plat- form or in superimposed tiers were also decorated, forming a still larger and more inclusive narrative com- position (Fig. 5. 44). 18 Program B So far the side carvings in SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8 have not been taken into account, nor has SP-9. To- gether, these stones provide a total of six narrow re- liefs, which can be classed in two groups: inscriptions 18 An earlier version of Building H in Monte Alban, at the center of the Main Plaza, is the only known example of a struc- ture with two staircases on opposite sides (Caso 1935: 8). Work by Marcus Winter (personal communication, 1989) has clari- fied that, at one time, the room on top of the building also had two entrances, which were aligned with the stairs. 335</page><page sequence="353">M 1) 8P a 0 C &lt;u a. .2 T3 a 1 c o "S o r 0 0 1 1 aJ 3 â I C i u 6 0 v s 1 Â£ â¢a o C/3 ^C/5 Â£ 1) 3 o s 0 1 1) U) g cn in bh 'Â£ 336</page><page sequence="354">I o l&gt; a.

Some epigraphic repeti- tions tie the carvings in SP-7a and SP-8b (Caso 1928: 87, 88), and others do the same with SP-lb and SP-9 (Acosta 1959: 28). The latter involve not only the calendrical glyphs, as noted by Acosta, but the noncalendrical ones as well. In addition, there are two sequences of glyphs in SP-8a that are also repeated in SP-9 (Fig. 5.45). Another repetition occurs in SP-la and SP-8b: the image of a seated anthropomorphic jaguar. Although in both instances the jaguar's posture is the same, in one it is represented frontally and in the other it appears in profile (Fig. 5.46). As originally noted by Caso (1928), the links be- tween the two groups of reliefs indicate that each framed inscription in SP-la/b and SP-8a/b represents a personage in SP-7a and SP-9. Because the reliefs in the latter two clearly show processions, the same for- mat must apply for the framed inscriptions. Although these include not the pictographs of human beings but symbolic substitutions, the orientation of the glyphs indicates the direction of the processions. There are six of these: three that confront and three that depart from the prominent figures (Fig. 5.47). Another implication of the epigraphic repetitions is that, through either direct or indirect ties, the six narrow carvings in the four monoliths are related. Because there are no glyphic repetitions between the carvings on the sides and those on the frontal surfaces, it can be proposed that the lateral scenes formed part of another self-contained narrative composition, one completely unrelated to the reliefs carved on the larger faces. If so, the programs would have been executed at different times. How were the narrow reliefs originally conceived as a single program? The first clue is given by the surface treatment in SP-9. As noted before, its under- side is finely finished. In contrast, the top surface, though dressed, does not have a fine texture. There- fore, this stone was originally used as a lintel or a roof slab. Furthermore, because SP-1 and SP-8 have two side carvings each, and these are sculpted so that the glyphs and images on opposite sides simultaneously acquire a vertical and standard "reading" position when the monoliths are placed horizontally, the only way 338 the inscriptions on both ends could have been seen as a program would be if these two stones were also set as lintels or roof slabs. Acostas arguments against their use as lintels are - as he himself recognized - not definitive. If the pro- tuberances on the back surfaces of SP-1 and SP-8 did not function as counterweights or as devices for better adherence to an embedding matrix, then the stones could not necessarily have been intended to stand ver- tically. On the other hand, their length-width ratio is different compared with other known lintels, which also could mean that not all buildings and their en- trances had the same configurations or the same di- mensions. On the basis of what is known about the distribution of architectural space in Monte Alban, the monoliths could have been lintels to a structure with rooms arranged around a central quadrangular area. The possibilities within such a model are varied, rang- ing from a public monumental building to a more pri- vate, enclosed one, or even to an underground mortu- ary facility. Before plausible alternatives are explored, one da- tum has to be confirmed: the program most probably included only six carved surfaces. The verifiable con- dition of the back sides in SP-7 and SP-9 does not indicate that these monoliths broke in half, a process that would have generated two more unattested carved surfaces. Nor can it be proposed that SP-7 is the bro- ken - but later retouched - half of SP-9. If these two monoliths were to be placed one against the other, a simultaneous vertical disposition of both carved sur- faces would be accomplished, but the size of the re- sulting composite block would have been 3.97 x 2.76 m. These dimensions exceed the length-width ratio of SP-1 and SP-8. By the same token, the length-width ratios of SP-7 and SP-9 taken separately make them not only smaller but also elongated rather than even sided. Yet, this gives us a further clue, because this way the four blocks can be grouped in pairs. In an archi- tectural model that is characterized by symmetrical arrangements, pairs would be at opposite ends. There- fore, in the quadripartite configuration envisioned pre- viously, SP-1 and SP-8 would have been placed along one axis, and SP-7 and SP-9 would be along the per- pendicular one. If four of the six carved surfaces were meant to</page><page sequence="356">Fig. 5.45 Epigraphic repetitions in the narrow reliefs of SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9, Monte Alban. 339</page><page sequence="357">Fig. 5.46 Resolution of (a) a profile jaguar in SP-8b into (b) the frontal jaguar in SP-la, Monte Alban. face outward, then the lintels would have been placed in a four-entrance structure. There is an actual archaeo- logical example of this type at Monte Alban: the build- ing in terrace 18 that contains tombs 103-110-112 (Fig. 5.48) .When the silhouette of the lintels is super- imposed in the structure's layout, however, it becomes evident that SP-1 barely covers enough area to have its paired carved surfaces exposed. Even if the original setting of the stones allowed for this, the inward-look- ing reliefs of SP-1 and SP-8 would have been facing the interior of rooms. There is also a sense of dispro- portion when comparing these monoliths with the lintel (shown in black on Fig. 5.48) that was originally located over the west entrance of the building.19 The fact that the large blocks had small inscrip- tions apparendy not meant to be seen from great dis- tances suggests that the structure that originally had them must have been much smaller than the above- mentioned alternative. If the stones are placed in a quadripartite arrangement but as close as possible, the minimum area they can cover is 6.50 x 5.51 m.This way, the monoliths could have been lintels and/or roof slabs to four small and adjacent rooms, covering a total area of 33.48 m2.The central open courtyard would have measured 4.97 m2 (2.40 x 2.07 m). Such dimen- sions further suggest that the structure could have been enclosed within a larger architectural setting. If so, a more plausible alternative would be a quadripartite construction at the center of a major plaza. At Monte Alban, there are several square low platforms in such contexts, the so-called adoratorios. Table 5.5 summa- rizes some of their characteristics. The exploration of the adoratorio at the center of the Patio Hundido yielded evidence suggesting that the platform could have been the basal body to a four- fold configuration similar to the hypothetical struc- ture that supported the carved stones (Fig. 5. 49 A). Its stratigraphic excavation indicated the occurrence of three building phases. Traces of a portico supported by columns were discovered in the second version of the adoratorio (Caso 1935: 6-7). Because of destruc- tion from looting activities, the basal configuration of the third version is only partially known, with only one staircase attested. On the basis of Caso's descrip- tions (1935, 1939: 181), Figure 5.49B presents a com- posite sketch of the south-north profile at the local- ity.20 19 This lintel (MA-TR/18-1) today lies halfway down the western slope of the mound, which formerly was called el monticulo de la piedra labrada ("the mound of the carved stone") (Caso 1938: 68). As the name indicates, one of the narrow faces of the stone is carved with an inscription. The calendrical glyph on it is shown in Figure 4.112, no. 5. 20 In the profile's sketch, the placement of the carved stela (MA-PH-1) and the orientation of its main carved surface are hypothetical. When found by Batres, the stone's fragments were scattered nearby. Yet it is possible that the monument originally had been at the center of the small courtyard demarcated by a quadripartite structure on top of the platform. Although Caso's data in the 1935 and 1939 reports differ slightly, the sketch follows the later description. Caso could not determine whether the Monte Alban Ilia offering was associated with the second or the third phase of construction. If the placement of the stela is correct, its carving style - which does not correspond to pe- riod Ilia - suggests that the offering was most likely associated 340</page><page sequence="358">Fig. 5.47 Direction of the processions in the narrow reliefs of SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9, Monte Alban. 341</page><page sequence="359">Table 5.5 Data on Size and Configuration of Adoratorios at Monte AlbAn Number of Location Dimensions Area staircases Complex Y 4.50 x 4.50 m 20.25 m four Complex Md.

There is another indirect piece of evidence that demonstrates the existence of small structures with four accesses. The excavation of an offering at the base of the staircase to temple B - an enclosure on the North Platform adjacent to the Vertice Geodesico on the west side - yielded a Monte Alban II clay model of a building without stairs but with open porticos on the four sides and an aperture in the center (Caso 1939: 179-181) (Fig. 5.50). The quadripartite hypothetical building could still be simplified by proposing only two stairs and two entrances, a deduction that results by assuming that four of the reliefs in the stones were meant to face inward (Figs. 5.51, 5.52). This possibility is supported by the fact that two of the six carved surfaces have fewer inscribed registers, and hence the glyphs are larger, presumably intended to be seen at a relative distance.The reliefs with more inscriptions had smaller glyphs, visible only within a short range. This differ- ence also might explain why the back surfaces in SP-1 and SP-8 have protuberances.While providing a larger surface for the carving of bigger glyphs on one side, they reduced the overall weight of the blocks.21 The configuration of a quadrangular building with two entrances leads to another plausible alternative: that the monoliths were placed in a large and special two-chambered tomb. The only known example of this type is tomb 5 from Cerro de la Campana in Suchilquitongo, Oaxaca (Fig. 5.53). By superimpos- ing the silhouette of the stones on the tomb's layout, it becomes clear that, if such was the original context of program B, the mortuary facility of which they formed part would have had longer entrances and would have been still larger than the Suchilquitongo tomb. An with the second addition. The offering included jade objects, green stone beads, green stone anthropomorphic figurines with traces of red paint, a double-spouted ceramic vessel full of jade beads, obsidian blades, and the skeletons of two animals, prob- ably an eagle and a jaguar (Caso 1935: 6). 21 Although plain, the lintel over the entrance to the house of tomb 105 at Monte Alban (in terrace 1456) also has a protu- berance, but this one is behind the anterior surface and covers much of the block. Thus, this trait exhibits an inverse relation- ship compared with SP-1 and SP-8. The lintel in the house for tomb 105 could have resulted after cutting stones like SP-1 or SP-8 from an original block. Hypothetically, such a block ini- tially could have measured 4.15 x 1.64 x 0.90 m, enough to obtain in addition two stones about the size and configuration of SP-1. In the case of the lintel for the house of tomb 105, there would have been no consideration of reducing its weight, as in SP-1 and SP-8, because it was meant to rest on multiton, monolithic jambs. In contrast, the lintels of program B could have been supported by columns or masonry walls. Such weaker supports necessarily would have required a reduction of the weight placed over them. 342</page><page sequence="360">important architectural referent provided by tomb 5, however, is the double function of large monolithic blocks as lintels and roof slabs to small enclosures (cf.

Similar masonry crests could have decorated the upper portion of the hypothetical configuration shown in Figure 5.52. So far I have established conclusively that, because of the damage on the corner monoliths from the South Platform, the stones were not found in a primary con- text. I have also entertained the possibility that the stones formed part of two narrative compositions. In support of the proposed primary arrangements, I have presented various alternatives based on architectural settings for which we have actual referents in the ar- chaeological record. Because one reconstruction en- tails use of the monoliths as orthostats (program A) and the other as lintels (program B), my arguments necessarily imply that the compositions were not si- multaneous. What needs to be resolved now is the most plausible sequence of use by determining which se- riation (A to B or B to A) best fits the available data. Also, their third reuse as building material in the basal wall of the South Platform must be addressed.

These depend on the location of the carving workshop, which could have been at the quarry, distant from both the quarry and the display area, or near the locus of display. How- ever, the details of such alternative sequences cannot be deduced from the available evidence, particularly with regard to the extraction, transportation, and carv- ing techniques.The two sets of carvings, however, must have been done with the stones in a horizontal posi- tion, allowing the sculptors ample movement and ac- cess to all sides of the blocks. That the reliefs could not have been executed once the stones had been placed in their architectural contexts is suggested by two lines of evidence. One is the failed carved version in the back of SP-2.The other is the procedure followed by present-day stone workers from Suchilquitongo, where stone carving and sculpture as a craft specialization can be documented since Pre-Hispanic times. Figure 5.54 shows one of the most talented sculptors in the community working on a stone reproduction of the facade of tomb 5 at Cerro de la Campana. The alter- native sequences to be considered begin in a locus of use rather than a quarrying or manufacturing setting. It is from this point that two possibilities can be ex- amined. If the argument of Von Winning about the history of SP-7 is adopted, that is, that its narrower side a was carved after side b (see p. 328), then we have the following: Fig. 5.54 Present-day stone-carving techniques demonstrated by a sculptor from Suchilquitongo, Oaxaca. 349</page><page sequence="367">1. Primary context: Stones SP-1 to SP-8 are set as program A in the facade of a building. 2 Secondary context: Program A is dis- manded. SP-7 suffers a litde breakage in one of the corners and, together with SP-1 and SP-8, is reused. Five lateral surfaces in these blocks are worked. Along with a newly carved but as yet unrelated monolith (SP-9), the stones are reset as program B in another structure. 3. Tertiary context: Program B is dis- mantled, and the constituent stones are reused, together with those discarded from program A, as corner stones in the South Platform. This alternative provides a scenario in which three monoliths, when used as lintels or roof slabs, would have had visible, yet unrelated, carvings on their lower sides. Furthermore, the condition of the stones that was detailed in the analysis of their state of complete- ness cannot be satisfactorily explained. For instance, it implies that SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9 were not dam- aged at all after being used and removed from their primary context. It also implies that SP-2, SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6 had to be taken as construction material in their secondary context and that, despite having been used twice, the stones were not so damaged when they were placed in the South Platform. Consequendy, the other sequence - one that better accounts for the dam- age on the stones - would be the following: 1. Primary context: SP-1, SP-7, SP-8, and SP-9 are set as program B, placing them as lintels or roof slabs of a quadripartite struc- ture. The defect in SP-7a noted by Von Win- ning would have originated during the quar- rying or transportation of the uncarved stone (see Fig. 5.52). 2. Secondary context: Program B is dis- mantled and all the monoliths are damaged. Three of them (SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8) are reused and three new reliefs are carved in them. This set is complemented by four re- cendy quarried or reused but plain blocks (SP- 2, SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6). After they are carved, 350 they all are set up as program A. Because, upon dismantling, SP-9 broke badly and could not be used for the purpose of carving a relief in its largest, finely textured surface, the stone was taken at this stage as construction mate- rial (i.e., with its carved surface embedded). This way SP-9 most likely would have been set in the same structure decorated by pro- gram A (see Fig. 5.44) 3. Tertiary context: The building with pro- gram A is dismanded and the stones, espe- cially SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8, undergo further damage. SP-9, used already as construction material, might have had additional minor breakage. All are then reused as offertory markers in the corners of the last major phase of construction in the South Platform. Dur- ing the tertiary context, the carvings would not have been visible because the monoliths most probably were covered by a thick layer of stucco (see Figs. 5.22 and 5.23). This seriation also conforms to an expected pat- tern: the monoliths that were reused more times (SP-1 , SP-8, SP-7, and SP-9) would be less complete, and those that were used less (SP-2, SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6) were the least fragmented and incomplete (at least until their tertiary context). It should be noted that the post- abandonment damages to SP-3, SP-5, and SP-7 have a common pattern.The monoliths were broken in half, and at least in two cases - if the interpretation of SP-5 is correct - the detached upper portions were dragged away. If Acosta's argument about the function of the protuberances in SP-1 and SP-8 were to be correct, it does not invalidate the preceding arguments, because those features could have been made between the pri- mary and secondary uses of the stones. Consequendy, it can be concluded within the internal logic of the model developed so far that program B was earlier than program A. Yet, although the relative sequence of the programs can be deduced from their state of com- pleteness, it still is necessary to determine the approxi- mate absolute chronology of the narratives. To do so, a stylistic and iconographic analysis is required.</page><page sequence="368">Style and Iconography of the Narratives Program B As mentioned before, the compositional format of program B consists of six processions, two of them with pictographic representations of individuals and four of them conveyed by means of symbolic substi- tutions. The secondary figures in the reliefs of SP-7a and SP-9 are presented in profile, showing two legs but only one hand. In contrast, the extant main per- sonage in the relief on SP-9 is only the bust of an old toothless man. It lacks lower extremities but shows both hands. Much of the representation is encompassed by an elaborate headdress. Figure 5.55 shows an analytical view indicating the different motifs that make up the agglutinated para- phernalia. The most conspicuous components are the glyph U in its sectioned and unfolded versions (a- b). There is also a sectioned view of a glyph M (c), and what might be a glyph D (d). Attached to these motifs are other various adornments in the shape of stripes, circles, plaques, and knots (e).The back of the head- dress is topped by a rectangular element decorated with stripes. Within the rectangle appears half of a glyph I (f). Another unfolded version of a glyph U (g) is be- low, and then there is a copal bag (h). A bird mask covers the eye of the personage. The tip of the beak is adorned by two circular pendants. The figure s ear- plug is also clear. The gesture of the personage in- volves both hands grasping some kind of short objects (i).The bottom of the bust ends in couplets of pen- dants. A short cape appears to be hanging behind the figure (j).The two iconographic elements at the bot- tom (k) are apparendy made of woven mats, but their identification remains elusive. The secondary figures in SP-9, although in iden- tical posture and hand gesture, have different facial traits, as if they were intended to be portraits (Fig. 5.56A). Their headdresses are much simpler than that of the main figure and they vary with each individual. The one worn by the third figure has an image of Cociyo (glyph M).The others are made up of plaques, stripes, and knots. Despite their individuality, the personages have the same type of garments and sandals. The pro- portion of head size to body size in these representa- tions is approximately 1:3. Each of the extant secondary figures in SP-7a has a different hand gesture although all apparendy are car- rying copal bags. Their facial traits vary as well, as do portions of their headdresses. Actually, what distin- guishes the headgears is an image attached to the back (Fig. 5.56B).These include, from left to right, a Tlaloc head (glyph Gamma), a "Serpent" head (glyph Y), a Cociyo head (glyph M), and a "Jaguar" head (glyph B).The portion of the headdress that is the same in all individuals is the one used as a symbolic substitution for human figures in the carvings from SP-la and SP-8b. As noted by Von Winning (1984: 10), the rep- resentations in SP-8b of these "Triple Adornments" seem to be on top of the conical bases of braziers (Fig. 5.57). The garments of the personages in SP-7a are similar but vary from those of the figures in SP-9. Sandals are barely discernible. The proportions of the human body in SP-7a are approximately 1:4. Despite a similar pictorial composition in the re- liefs from SP-7a and SP-9, the human figures have slighdy different proportions, and the general treat- ment of the lines is very different. On the other hand, even though the spatial convention in the carving on SP-9 (uncircumscribed reliefs) varies from that in the carvings on SP-la/b and SP-8a/b (reliefs set within frames), there is the impression that the narrow carv- ings in SP-9, SP-1, and SP-8 were executed by the same sculptor. The more slender, less rigid tracing of the forms in SP-7a must be the work of another artist, perhaps an apprentice or a surrogate stone carver. Program A The pictorial composition of this narrative has been detailed before. It includes a central procession with two secondary figures confronting another, more prominent one. Four other secondary personages flank the scene. Figure 5.58 presents an analytical view of the main individual in SP-lc. Approximately a third of the entire figure was devoted to the elaborate head- dress. Its major constituent elements are a glyph U (a), a glyph D (b), and a tied bag (c). Other parts include adornments of stripes (d) and other unidentified ele- ments (e). 351</page><page sequence="369">Fig. 5.55 Analytical view of main personage in SP-9, Monte Alban. Aside from the headdress, the personage wears a jaguar outfit, including the head, the tail, and the claws from all the extremities. The ones on the arms hang or project from the wrists, and that on the lower part appears as actual footgear. A broad band at the level of the waist might represent a belt. From the analytical diagram, it can also be noted that the body is repre- sented peculiarly. The upper torso is in frontal view, showing both arms, with one of the hands grasping a decorated bone-tipped spear (f) and the other with a short, yet now obliterated object (g). Despite the ad- vanced stage of erosion in the area of the head and the chest, the facial features appear to be those of an old individual (recessed lips exposing only a tooth). Some 352 paraphernalia hang from the neck and shoulders, cov- ering the chest. A pectoral with a human face and hanging shells can be discerned (h) as well as an ele- ment that - on the basis of other carvings - might be the representation of a zoomorphic face (i) (Fig. 5.59). In contrast to the frontal upper part of the personage's body, the lower half appears in profile, and only one leg is shown. From the personage's back a radiating arrangement of stripes protrudes (j). He might wear a short cape (k).The individual appears seated on a cush- ion decorated with a symmetrical pattern of semicircles and curved lines (1). The lesser individuals are shown in profile, but the two upper and lower extremities are represented.

Although the flanking person- ages are in the same plane as the central scene, their opposing stance suggests multiple processions in a single composition. The proportion of the human figures, main and secondary alike, is approximately 1:5. By comparing programs B and A, the following can be established: 1. The compositional format in both pro- 353</page><page sequence="371">Fig. 5.57 Headdress element in SP-7a used as a substitute for personages in SP-la and SP-8b, and its comparison with a Monte Alban Ilia brazier. grains is partially similar. Both entail proces- sional profile figures. The processions in nar- rative B are carved in single surfaces, and the personages (and symbolic substitutions) are depicted in such a way that a direction is in- 354 tended (toward or away from a main figure). This effect suggests that the individuals are coeval and spatially related. Narrative A is pe- culiar in that the procession is composite - that is, each of the figures is carved in a dis- 1.

As will become evident when the epigraphy is discussed, such varied directions are correlated to temporal and not spatial references. 2. Both narratives are two-dimensional. Ex- cept for garments, there is no overlapping of elements. However, the form of the human body differs in both programs. The treatment of the extant main figures from program B is varied, including a full frontal view (seated jaguar in SP-la), a fiill profile view (seated jaguar in SP-8b), and a partial frontal view (bust in SP-9).The secondary personages in narrative B are shown in full profile but are depicted with two legs and only one hand. In contrast, the main personage in program A is shown as a full figure, with a torso in frontal view and a lower body in profile. The sec- ondary figures in program A are shown in full profile but including both legs and both arms. Taken in isolation, the upper body ges- ture of the main figure in program A re- 355</page><page sequence="373">sembles that of the bust in SP-9 (Fig. 5.60). 3 . The most striking difference between the two programs is the proportion of the hu- man body (head to body size). Nevertheless, the ratio of the figures in narrative B is not consistent, being approximately 1:3 in SP-9 and 1:4 in SP-7a. Such treatment of the hu- man body is conventional. The proportion of the personages in narrative A is 1 :5.This treat- ment is more realistic. 4. The occurrence of frames circumscrib- ing the reliefs is a trait unique to four surfaces from program B. Such a spatial convention does not occur in the other two narrow sur- faces of program B, nor does it occur in pro- gram A, where, actually, there was no interest in retouching the reused broken stones to convert them into rectangular prisms or to frame the carved scenes. Fig. 5.59 Hanging zoomorphic motif found in several Zapotec carvings. Fig. 5.60 Hand gestures of main figures in SP-lc and SP-9, Monte Alban. 356</page><page sequence="374">The preceding analysis suggests that stylistically the programs are not very different. The two main varia- tions that distinguish one from the other (form and proportion of the human body) occur mixed in an- other single carved stone that has also a processional format, the so-called Lapida de Bazan (MA-TR/24-1) (Fig. 5.61). Here, the personage to the right is shown in profile, with both upper and lower extremities rep- resented. Its proportion is 1:6. The figure to the left also appears in profile, with two legs shown but only one hand. Its proportion is slightly more than 1:4. Another closer correspondence between programs B and A can be established by means of triangulations with MA-TR/24-1 .Aside from the jaguar outfit, there are some motifs in the paraphernalia and the head- dress of the right figure in the Lapida de Bazan that are identical to those in the garment and headdress of program As main personage (Fig. 5.62). Consequently, the differences between narratives B and A appear to have been dictated by the shape of the carved surfaces and their intended architectural function. The most notable difference between them is the amount and character of the accompanying in- scriptions, but there are a few direct similarities be- tween the two programs. In terms of iconographic conventions, they resemble each other in the way roof- Fig. 5.61 MA-TR/24-1 (Lapida de Bazan), Monte Alban. 357</page><page sequence="375">tops of buildings and jaguars are represented (Fig. 5.63). All the noted direct and indirect similarities sug- gest that the lapse of time between the carving and setting of program B and the execution and erection of program A was not long. The structure with the roof slabs or lintels would have been dismantled after a relatively short existence. In this sense, the sequence of the programs could be viewed as two successive episodes. Chronology of the Programs There are four comparisons by which the programs can be anchored to a relative and then to an approxi- mate absolute chronology. Three involve iconographic elements in program B that can be linked directly to ceramic artifacts. One of these has already been illus- trated in Figure 5.57, in which the headdresses of the personages in SP-7a are compared with a Monte Alban Ilia brazier. In addition, the head of the main person- age in SP-9 occurs as a calendrical name (glyph X) in a vase from Atzompa that also belongs to the Monte Alban Ilia assemblage (Fig. 5.64). Caso's judgment placed the vase specifically at the end of period Ilia. Admittedly, this tie is weak, because other ceramic rep- resentations in effigy vessels of the same category seem to span at least from the period of Transition II- Ilia to the end of period Illb (Caso and Bernal 1952: 187). The third link involves the upper element behind the same main figure and two identical ceramic blocks found at Atzompa, which also pertain to late Monte Alban Ilia (ibid.: 340, fig. 606). These objects, which are large and heavy, appear to be merlons used in the decoration of a building (ibid.: 342). The link, how- ever, is not strong because the resemblance between the carved element and the merlons is only general. The fourth link is indirect but is perhaps the stron- gest one. It involves similarities in the representation of headdresses between some personages in programs B and A and two figures from the murals in tomb 105 at Monte Alban (Fig. 5.65). Being parts of garments, the headdresses are also influenced by trends of fash- ion, and in this sense they can be appropriate time markers. Because tomb 105 was found empty, the mortuary facility could not be anchored to the rela- tive ceramic chronology. However, on the basis of style, 358 the murals of the tomb have been placed in period III, predating those from tombs 103 and 104 (Caso 1938: 92; Miller 1988: 243). The latter had mixed offerings with ceramic objects pertaining to the late Ilia and early IHb periods. The four links then point consistently to late Ilia as the relative date of the programs. On present chro- nometric measurements, this period spans approxi- mately between a.d. 200 and 450 (Drennan 1983). Consequently, the carving and placement of program B could have taken place sometime between a.d. 350 and 450. The execution and erection of program A followed soon after and could have occurred no later than a.d. 550. This anchorage, dating the primary and secondary contexts of the monoliths, implies that their place- ment in the corners of the South Platform (tertiary context) occurred in period IHb, sometime between a.d. 500 and 800. If so, how can the contradictory evidence provided by the ceramic vessels found in the corner offerings be explained? First, the assertion that the spouted jars are diagnostics of period Ilia should be examined in detail. Figure 5.66 illustrates an ar- rangement by periods of several examples of spouted vessels that have been recovered in archaeological ex- cavations, mainly at Monte Alban. The two jars found in the stone boxes (inset) resemble the vessel labeled K, which was classified by Caso, Bernal, and Acosta (1967: 289) as pertaining to the transition between periods II and Ilia. Therefore, the spouted jars in ques- tion in fact could have been made as late as early Ilia, around a.d. 300. At Monte Alban there is ample evidence that stones carved in early styles were reused as corner markers in later construction projects. Such reuses have been docu- mented in the basal platforms of buildings M, IV, I, Q, North Platform, and 7V (Scott 1978: 37, 41). A similar process can be assumed as well for the contents of the stone boxes, so that, when placed as votive caches un- derneath the corners of the South Platform, the ob- jects were already old. Their pristine condition could have been precisely the result of their former place- ment as corner offerings to another building that was partially dismanded at a later time. This possibility even provides a hint about the series of events that led to the present configuration of the South Platform (Fig. 5.67).</page><page sequence="376">&lt;9 % &lt;D 2 0 s T- I 1 Tj- CN ' p 6 H s a â  T3 Â§ u r- I I PL, C/3 .s C/J a 3&gt; d 1-4 OS â  â¢- &gt; &lt;U â¢a o fl S "S o U CN vq in bh Â£ 359</page><page sequence="377">Fig. 5.63 Iconographic resemblances between programs B and A, Monte Alban.

Most likely, however, this earlier staircase could be related to an unattested basal perimeter whose cor- ners and votive caches (with the spouted vessels) were dismanded later. If so, the inner structure at the South Platform would date to Monte Alban Ilia - that is, sometime between a.d. 200 and 400. As the earliest known construction at the South Platform was under way (or perhaps slighdy later), program B was being built in an unknown locality around the Main Plaza of Monte Alban. After a short span, program B was dismanded, and the structure with program A was erected in another unknown locality at the core of the city. Probably this later program stood up longer than its predecessor but was eventually dismanded too. The last major phase of construction at the South Plat- form - when another staircase was added and the pe- rimeter of the structure was enlarged - began at the same time or slighdy after the dismantling of program A. By then, the spouted vessels that were removed from the caches in the earlier corners and placed again as offerings underneath the new angles were chronologi- cally unrelated to the construction event, because they were at least 300 years older. The same happened with the carved stones, which by then had already been used twice. Analysis and Interpretation of the Programs Having outlined the possible original configura- tion of the two narrative compositions, and approxi- mately when they were carved and placed in their architectural contexts, I proceed with an examination and interpretation of the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Epigraphic Analysis of Program B Because program B is the oldest narrative program, when only four monoliths were arranged to form a quadripartite structure with a small interior courtyard, its constituent monoliths are the most damaged and 362 incomplete. Thus, what needs to be established first is how much of the program is missing. For this pur- pose, the individuals depicted pictographically (in SP-7a and SP-9) and their symbolic substitutions (in SP-la/ b and SP-8a/b) are taken as "registers." This way, the total number of expected figures can be estimated and compared with the total number of available ones (Table 5.6). The results listed in the table indicate that only 71 percent of the epigraphy is available (see blank spaces in Fig. 5.47). With almost a third of the program lost, the possibilities of a comprehensive interpretation are reduced. Nevertheless, it still is feasible to delineate some general observations. It already has been estab- lished that the reliefs depict processions toward or away from main personages. The associated epigraphy typi- cally consists of a combination of a calendrical nota- tion (a sign accompanied by coefficients) and a noncalendrical glyph. The latter is usually composite and compounded: two, sometimes three, glyphs that are agglutinated to form another distinctive one (Fig. 5.68). The arrangement of the two types of glyphs in each combination is not fixed. For instance, there are sets in which the calendrical sign appears below the noncalendrical compound (10 times) or vice versa (5 times); there are also cases in which the latter occurs to the left of the calendrical glyph (3 times) or the opposite, with the noncalendrical sign to the right (1 time). From at least one of the available cases it is clear that variations crosscut the glyphic repetitions in dif- ferent stones. Examples in SP-7a and in SP-9 also make evident that shifts in the arrangement of the two types of glyphs occur in the same relief. An obvious proposal is that there is a relationship between the images (i.e., the personages and their sub- stitutions) and the short inscriptions. A specific link can be established if it is assumed that the inscriptions have a nominative function - that is, they stand for the calendrical and personal names of the individuals. This is the premise advanced by Marcus (1980, 1983h, 1992), but here it is applied consistendy, not selec- tively. The assumption rests on ethnohistoric evidence. At the time of the Spanish contact, people in Oaxaca were addressed by these two types of names (Smith 1973b; Caso 1977; Joseph Whitecotton 1982,1990). Figure 5.69 presents the calendrical names from</page><page sequence="380">ri &lt;L&gt; 4-&gt; a o 2 5 l-i s â¢fl 3 O CO &lt;D â fl â M !&gt; &lt;L&gt; o 6 o 0 c 1 u vq LO W) Â£ 363</page><page sequence="381">Fig. 5.68 Typical inscriptions in the narrow reliefs of the corner monoliths, South Platform, Monte Alban. each relief. The seated jaguars in SP-lb and SP-8b are interpreted as instances of glyph B. They are unique. Whereas one of them lacks the coefficient 5, the one with the numeral bar is devoid of noncalendrical com- pound. This indicates that the registers with the jag- uars have a complementary relationship. Thus, the rep- etition noted on the basis of posture is confirmed (see Fig. 5.46), and the omitted coefficient in one of the B glyphs can be deduced from its complementary coun- terpart.That is why eight and not just seven calendrical names occur twice. Figure 5.70 pairs the glyphic rep- etitions. If these repetitions are merged, only 13 dif- ferent names remain. These are 5B, 7T, 5C, 13A, 3C, 90, IN, 6V, 12H, 5E, 8N, 13N, and IF. By organizing all the names so that the repetitions across stones are aligned, an interesting pattern emerges (Table 5.7). It has been deduced that the program contained 31 named individuals, and if we assume that not only 8 but all those persons were named twice, then there would have been at the most 16 different names. If so, even though 11 personages or their accompanying hieroglyphic inscriptions are not available, only the names of 3 individuals would be actually missing. By tracing the series of repetitions in the presumed archi- tectural arrangement of the program, further patterns become apparent (Fig. 5.71) as follows: Table 5.6 Expected and Available Registers in Program B, Monte AlbAn SP-la SP-lb SP-8a SP-8b SP-7a SP-9 Total Expected registers 4 5 4 5 7 6 31 (100%) Available registers 3 4 2 4 4 5 22 (71%) Expected totals per stone 9 9 7 6 31 (100%) Actual totals per stone 7 6 4 5 22 (71%) 364</page><page sequence="382">Fig. 5.69 Calendrical names in the narrow reliefs of the corner monoliths, South Platform, Monte Alban. 1. The prominent personages were placed in symmetrically opposed registers (thick ar- rows). Therefore, their location within the program is ascertained. 2. The sequence of secondary personages at the end of the procession in SP-7a is re- peated at the beginning of the procession in SP-8b. Because of the direction of the pro- cessions in these two reliefs (toward and away from the main personage), the repetition fol- lows an inverse order - that is, the last indi- vidual in SP-7a (12H) is the first one in SP-8b, and so on. 3. Two of the secondary figures in SP-lb occur again in the procession carved in SP-9. In this case, however, the repetition - although also inverted - is not sequential. Otherwise, the person named 3C in SP-lb would have been depicted between those named 13A and 90 in SP-9. 4. The secondary figures at the beginning 365</page><page sequence="383">Fig. 5.70 Pairing of repeated calendrical names in the narrow reliefs of the corner monoliths, South Platform, Monte Alban. 366 of the procession depicted in SP-8a are the ones that appear, in the same order, at the beginning of the procession in SP-9. These patterns warrant an attempt to determine the identity of some of the individuals in the missing registers. The repetitions between SP-lb, SP-8a, and SP-9 indicate that the unattested figure at the end of the procession in SP-8a was named IF. If the identity of the secondary personages is the same in these three reliefs, then the most likely assumption is that the main figure in SP-lb and SP-8a would have been the one appearing in SP-9 - that is, the personage named 13N. If these deductions are correct, then not all the indi- viduals in the program were named twice. If SP-lb, SP-8a, and SP-9 are linked in this way, then the same must hold true for SP-la, SP-8b, and SP-7a. Indeed, the "Triple Adornment" type of head- dress being worn by the individuals in SP-7a occurs as a substitute in the frames of the processions carved in SP-la and SP-8b only. That the prominent individual in SP-7a was 5B follows from this correspondence. Considering pattern 4 listed above, the two secondary figures at the beginning of the procession in SP-7a were named 7T and 5C. If so, the identity of the third person in the line would be undeterminable because the glyphs that accompanied the last individual in the procession on SP-la are unattested. Another implica- tion is that the anonymous personage at the end of the procession in SP-8b was represented only once in the program. Elucidating the names of the first three secondary figures in SP-7a is not as straightforward. The nonsequential repetition noted in pattern 3 generates two more alternatives (Table 5.8). In the second and third cases, either 5C or 7T would have been repre- sented only once in the narrative, and the unknown personages in SP-la and SP-8b would have been named twice. Yet, if the pattern of the processions in the set formed by SP-9, SP-8a, and SP-lb is consid- ered, it can be assumed that the first alternative for SP-7a is most likely. If so, the reconstructed proces- sions could be diagrammed as in Table 5.9. From this table it becomes evident that the program depicts two sequential events. First, two distinct series of second- ary personages each confront a main figure. In each</page><page sequence="384">set of stones, this confrontation is repeated twice, but the reliefs facing the architectural interior include more secondary personages than those facing the exterior. Apparently after having deposited offerings to the main figures, as suggested by the substitutions in SP-8b, the two groups of secondary individuals depart from the main personages. There is, however, a peculiar detail in set l.The departing procession names an individual (c f 3C) who was not mentioned in the confronting processions. The reason for this remains obscure. At this point, it is possible to summarize that pro- gram B had 16 different personages: 2 of them were named three times (5B and 13N), 1 1 were represented twice (IN, 6V, IF, 90, 13A, 7V, 5C, 8N, 5E, 12H, and one unattested name), and 3 appeared only once (3C and two unattested names). Before exploring the possible significance of the narrative program, it is necessary to examine the noncalendrical glyphs, which are the presumed per- sonal names of the individuals involved. Figures 5.72 and 5.73 present, respectively, the compounds in each register on SP-l/SP-8 and SP-7/SP-9. Given the re- construction of identities discussed above, the missing compounds are listed in the order in which they pre- sumably appeared. In this instance, there are seven rep- etitions, leaving only 14 distinct personal names. Con- sequently, one of the three anonymous individuals in the program is known by its personal name. This per- sonage occurs at the end of the intended procession in SP-la and was represented only once in the pro- gram. Figure 5.74 illustrates the noncalendrical rep- etitions. The repetitions make it possible to analyze the variations in the representation of the noncalendrical glyphs (Fig. 5.75).

There are instances, however, in which the compounds do not exhibit major differ- ences (E). As can be noted, some of the constituent glyphs in the compounds are repeated in different com- binations. The total number of discrete glyphs used to generate the personal names in the program is 25. Two more glyphs remain to be discussed. One ap- pears in the second register in SP-8a and seems to represent a plant. It is plausible that the sign is actually part of the noncalendrical compound; if so, it will be the only instance in the program of a composite glyph 368 whose constituents are separated. Other instances of plant representations are known in the corpus and, by their contexts, they do not appear to be personal names (Fig. 5.76). The other remaining sign is in the first register of SP-8b, upon which the prominent personage 5B is seated. It has a geometric shape with another sign set inside it. The latter is a "Trispiral" glyph, as those used in the compounds for the personal names. The former has long been interpreted as the conventionalized rep- resentation of a hill. This, and its frequent appearance as a pedestal for seated or standing human figures, has</page><page sequence="386">Fig. 5.71 Epigraphic repetitions traced on the hypothetical arrangement of program B, Monte Alban. 369</page><page sequence="387">Fig. 5.72 Personal names in SP-la/b and SP-8a/b, Monte Alban. led to the conclusion that it is a locative indicator (Batres 1902: pl. n; Caso 1928: 68). Although, as noted by Caso (1947: 24), the glyph might also be the picto- graph of an artificial feature (i.e., a pyramid), the toponymic value would still hold. Among other Mesoamerican peoples (Maya and Aztecs), pyramids seem to have been viewed as "sacred hills" (Matos Moctezuma 1987: 194; Stuart and Houston 1989: 89). The specific combination of the "Hill" and the "Trispiral" glyphs has been documented in other stones from Monte Alban and in an unprovenanced urn of a seated personage, all dating to period Ilia (Fig. 5.77). Because of the patterns in the narrative, it is plau- 370 sible that the personage 13N that was presumably carved in the right register on SP-lb was also seated on top of a "Hill" glyph. The energy in terms of re- sources and labor invested in the program suggests that the two prominent personages 5B and 13N were mem- bers of the ruling elite of Monte Alban. Thus the to- ponym "Hill-Trispiral" might be the glyphic name of that site. Yet this interpretation can be supported only if the missing carving is found and if 13N indeed ap- pears on top of a "Hill-Trispiral" glyph. So far, it has been proposed that the function of the noncalendrical compounds in program B is also nominative (names of people and of a place), but what SP-1a M-volutes-sound scroll* SP-8a Knot-twisted ends* Bundle Hill-dots/Leg-ring E-flame volutes W ...

In Chapter 1 , it was postulated that the Zapotec script, as other pristine writing systems, encodes units of speech. The glyphic reconstruction of the day list in Chapter 4 implies that at least some of the graphs in the script stand for logograms or words. The correspondence between the meaning of certain terms in sixteenth-century Zapotec and the pictogra- phy of signs accompanied by coefficients encourages the use of Cordova s Vocabulario to deal with the noncalendrical glyphs. Reliance on this source to de- cipher inscriptions pertaining to the fifth or sixth cen- tury a.d. cannot be fully justified until the archaic lan- guage is reconstructed, so the following "phonetic" equivalences should be seen as hypothetical. Specific correlations between day signs and lexical entries in Cordovas Vocabulario provide at least one "phonetic value" for each of the main calendrical glyphs, even if the approximate meaning in English or Spanish re- mains unknown. Most of the noncalendrical com- pounds in program B cannot be related to entries in Cordova s Vocabulario because the pictography of their constituent signs is not readily apparent. However, some of the compounds for the personal names in program B include signs that are counter- parts of calendrical glyphs (B, E, J, M, U, and Y), and these presumably could share the same phonetic val- ues. Because of their characteristics, the full names of the last three personages in the procession on SP-9 are the only ones currently suitable for attempting "pho- netic readings" (Table 5.10). As shown in this table, plausible readings for the names of the sixth and fourth personages would be Cozio Xoo Picitella chijno (Strong Lightning- 13 Knot), and ? Peche Xoo Quiaguela chaga ( ? Jaguar Ferocious-1 Night). The reading of the noncalendrical compounds accompanying these two individuals results in names very similar to those in lienzos and colonial legal documents, where names 371 SP-7 M-volutes-sound scroll* SP-9 Knot-twisted ends gg Bundle* Hill-dots/Leg-ring e E-flame volutes* rsSQl Trispiral-J ^ B-headdress Cartouche-three endings-dots Temple-footprints Bracketed leaf-stripes ^ E-M jjlli) Trispiral-bracketed leaf s&gt; * Presumed personal names; their glyphic representation is unattested.</page><page sequence="389">Fig. 5.74 Pairing of repeated personal names in the narrow reliefs of the corner monoliths, South Platform, Monte Alban. are written in Zapotec but using the European alpha- betic script (cf. Joseph Whitecotton 1982: 328-329). The name of the fifth personage is of particular in- terest because it might be an example of the homo- phonic principle, and one in which two signs stand for morphemes that make up a word. In Cordova's Vocabulario there are some entries that state the fol- lowing: 1 . Caminante Vemcooneza [Walker] Zaa neza Yooneza (69) 2. Mensajero.Vide embaxador Cochijna [Messenger, see ambassador] cotij huetoaticha cooneza (264v) 3. Via, vide camino Neza (425) [Path, see road] 4. Viaje, vide jornada Quela [Travel, see journey] cooneza (425) 5. No entry for "merchant" [Comerciante] The last term in the first entry (Yooneza) matches the two separate readings of the pictographs for temple/ house (yoho, Cordova [74 and 396v]) and road (neza, Cordova [425]). The phonetic rendering of the individuals name would thus be Yooneza Pelloo caa, which can be translated as "Walker or "Traveler-9 Monkey." An Interpretation of Program B There are several reasons for suggesting that the program is commemorative and preeminently of funerary character. This, however, does not necessarily mean that the quadripartite structure with carved lin- tels was a tomb or directly associated with a tomb. The funerary character of the program is suggested by the following: 1 . Processions like those in the program are also found in clear mortuary contexts (mu- rals in Monte Alban tombs 104, 105, 112; 372</page><page sequence="390">s 0 s s w-l 1 s 3 0 or) 1 0 a 1 1-4 V C u O u &lt;u â fl O 03 u ;=!

In all these instances, personages carry incense bags. 2. The representation of 13N as a bust sug- gests that one set of secondary figures are paying homage to a deceased personage. This is reinforced by the unfolded version of glyph U in his headdress. As mentioned in Chapter 4, this variant of glyph U is frequently asso- ciated with mortuary contexts. The two uni- dentified objects just below the bust of 13N - made, apparently, of woven mats - might be parts of his own mortuary bundle. 3. In the two representations of 5B there is no indication that he is dead. The secondary figures associated with him appear to be pay- ing homage and also leaving offerings. If so, 5B could have been the successor to 13N and the one who ordered the construction of the program to honor his immediate ancestor and legitimize his descent. In SP-8b, the present- ing of braziers, perhaps intended for the burn- ing of incense, might also have been con- nected with funerary rituals. The preceding interpretations have another impli- cation: if 5B and 13N were successive rulers, then the "Hill-Trispiral" could indeed be the glyphic name of Monte Alban or of a locality within it. Given the ex- clusively nominative character of the accompanying inscriptions, the place of origin and occupation of the other 14 secondary figures is not given. Omission of that information might imply that all of them are members of the Monte Alban elite, perhaps lineage heads of 14 of the 15 subdivisions identified at the site by Blanton (1978) (the two successive rulers account- ing for the remaining subdivision). Or, as Von Win- ning suggested (1983), the secondary figures could have been rulers of primary communities subject to the Monte Alban polity. Epigraphic Analysis of Program A Unlike program B, most of the epigraphic and iconographic content of this narrative is available. As 376 reconstituted, the program provides several texts, and almost all are well preserved. The only incomplete one is in SP-5. Yet, because this inscription evidently dis- plays a symmetrical arrangement in relation to the one in SP-3, it is possible to assess how much is missing by comparing them (Fig. 5.78). Based on the correspondences between the two inscriptions and their arrangement, at least two glyphs and a coefficient appear lost from the text in SP-5. The columnar texts in both stones begin and end with annual dates. In the SP-3 inscription, the upper year bearer has a coefficient with a value of one unit less than the one in the lower year bearer (10M-11M). It is assumed that the same holds true for the text in SP-5. However, the reading of the extant coefficient in its lower year bearer is problematic. The numeral could be a vertical bar only, but there is an apparent dot below it. Presumably, this number could be either 6 or 5, which in turn would indicate that the missing coefficient of the upper year bearer could have been 5 or 4. However, the first alternative (years 5G and 6G) seems less likely because the lower coefficient would exhibit a unique relationship between bar(s) and dot(s). The second alternative (years 4G and 5G) will be fol- lowed, but in due time its implications will be com- pared with those of the discarded alternative. From Figure 5.79 it can be noted that the narra- tive, which is made up of seven monoliths, has a total of nine texts. SP-1 has three; SP-6 has two; and SP-2, SP-3, and SP-5 have one each. The remaining text is actually distributed between SP-7 and SP-8. All the texts in the program begin with an annual date. Of these, the first glyph in text A on SP-1 is unique. It does not resemble the year glyph in the other inscrip- tions, or in the known corpus, but the context sug- gests that this glyph must function as a year bearer. It is certainly a glyph E with a band on top knotted on both sides of the cartouche, as if "binding" the glyph. Yet there is no coefficient. The use of the pictograph of a rope as an alternative way of depicting the year glyph in several Mesoamerican cultures (Caso 1962; Nicholson 1966) indirecdy reinforces what the con- textual comparison indicates. The coefficient, there- fore, must be implicit. Its omission suggests the notion of completion, and, if so, the intended number most likely would have been 13 instead of l.This conclu-</page><page sequence="394">Fig. 5.78 Texts in SP-3 and SP-5, Monte Alban. sion implies that the peculiar glyph represents the end of the 52-year cycle, which would corroborate the placement of glyph E as the senior year bearer in the Zapotec calendrical system.22 The implications of a closing cycle 13E versus IE will also be compared later. By interpreting the initial glyph in text A from SP-1 as another, though special, year bearer, the pro- gram includes 10 annual dates. Determining the coef- ficient of the special year bearer is not as problematic as elucidating their sequence. The possibilities are stag- gering because the permutations can generate 1 x 2 x 3x4x5x6x7x8x9x10 = 3,628,800 alternatives. But certain logical and parsimonious assumptions will reduce the combinations to a manageable degree. Looking at the overall composition of the program (see Fig. 5.43), it is obvious that the most important inscriptions are those in SP-1. Three texts are associ- ated with the only personage appearing seated, not bound, elaborately dressed, and accompanied by much paraphernalia. Because each of these three texts has an annual date, the possible permutations present only six alternative reading sequences. Table 5.11 is a Cal- 22 There is only one other possible example of a "binding" glyph in this corpus. It occurs on a small slab found by Saville in tomb 1 at Quicopecua (cf. Caso 1928: 181, fig. 80; Spinden 1922: 146, pl. xxvma; Marcus 1983i: 193). A detailed com- ment of its carving appears in Urcid (n.d.c, 1: 379, n. 34). 377</page><page sequence="395">Fig. 5.79 Texts in program A, Monte Alban. endar Round, with the Zapotec year bearers, that will help in calculating the number of years involved in each sequence. This matrix can be read in two ways: forward (from top to bottom and left to right) or back- ward (from bottom to top and right to left). These two alternatives depend on the point of departure, which could be the earliest event (forward count) or the lat- est event (backward count). In Table 5.12, the calcula- tions are generated as backward counts (above) or for- ward counts (below). The spans in both cases are de- rived in terms of elapsed and not elapsing time. How- ever, consideration is given to the upper chart because it is assumed that the first date in the reading sequence refers to the latest event being commemorated. Of all the possibilities in the upper chart of Table 5.12, the first one is preferred because it takes into account three properties. One is the reading order of linear vertical texts, which more commonly begins from top to bottom and proceeds from left to right.23 The other two properties are quite remarkable. They are actually patterns that sometimes occur in isolation 378 in the other alternative permutations (including those of the lower chart in Table 5.12) but coincide only in the first sequence. The first pattern is that the annual dates in the other six texts fall within the span gener- ated by the year bearers in SP-1. By plotting these dates in the generated lapse of 60 years, their distribu- tion is shown in Table 5.13. This other table starts at the bottom (earliest date) and proceeds to the top (lat- est event). The connecting line on the left side marks the annual dates in SP-1. The connecting lines on the right side mark the paired annual dates given in SP-3 and SP-5. The two columns of numbers at the ex- treme right give (1) accumulated number of years from date to date (left column), and (2) spans between dates (right column). The second pattern is that the time span between 23 As shown in other contexts of this study, several formats and reading orders for texts are now known. Despite the varia- tions, the year glyph usually marks the beginning of the read- ing sequence (see Figs. 4.156, 4.157, 5.92, and 6.9).</page><page sequence="396">Table 5.11 The Zapotec Calendar Round Arranged as a Matrix IE 1 M 1 G IN 2 M 2 G 2 N 2 E 3 G 3 N 3 E 3 M 4 N 4 E 4 M 4 G 5 E 5 M 5 G 5 N 6 M 6 G 6 N 6 E 7 G 7 N 7 E 7 M 8 N 8 E 8 M 8 G 9 E 9 M 9 G 9 N 10 M 10 G 10 N 10 E 11 G 11N 11E 11 M 12 N 12 E 12 M 12 G 13 E 13 M 13 G 13 N the inverted year bearers in SP-3 and SP-5 is 12 years in each case. The chronological patterns that result if the two annual dates in SP-5 are taken to be 5G and 6G appear in Table 5. 14. When comparing Tables 5.13 and 5.14, one can see that in the latter the plotting of the alternative dates in SP-3 and SP-5 generates a gap of 19 years in the middle of the sequence, whereas in Table 5.13 the distribution of dates in the sequence is more even. A summary of the occurrence of these properties in all the alternative reading sequences, including those that assume coefficient 1 for the "binding" year glyph in text A from SP-1, is shown in Table 5.15. Because the sequence 13E -âº 8E -âº 5E generates 60 years, its "unfolding" includes a complete Calendar Round. Therefore, the three 13E dates (in SP-l,SP-2, and SP-7/8) leave the possibility that those in SP-2 and SP-7/8 could be plotted in one of two points. The procession formed by SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8 sug- gests that the individuals are not only spatially but also chronologically related. Therefore, it appears that the annual date in SP-7/8 refers to the same year (but perhaps not to the same event) as the one being com- memorated in SP-1 . On the other hand, because SP-2 is at one end of the narrative and proceeds in the op- posite direction to the secondary figures in the central procession, its date 13E might be the one falling 52 years before that in SP-1 and SP-7/8. These two dif- ferent dates with the bearer 13E were assumed while Table 5.15 was being generated. By tracing the chronological sequence of dates in the epigraphic arrangement of the program, some of the complex interrelationships between images and texts are further disentangled (Fig. 5.80). For instance, the earliest and third dates (nos. 1 and 3) - together with their associated texts - refer to events for which there are no accompanying images. The text in SP-6b (no. 5) might also bear no direct relation to what is being depicted in the processions. All the other dates and their texts appear to be direcdy related to the images. In comparing the nine texts, another interesting pattern becomes evident (Fig. 5.81): the existence of a standard sequence that consists of six type positions. With few exceptions, the texts can be arranged to conform to the sequence. Of those that do, some oc- casionally omit one or two of the type positions. The two inverted signs at the end of the texts in SP-3 and SP-5 have not been counted as type positions because they are "mirror" glyphs of the first two glyphs in the standard sequence, even though the bearers have dif- ferent coefficients.The bottom of Figure 5.81 includes 379</page><page sequence="397">Table 5.12 Intervals and Spans of Six Alternative Reading Sequences for the Three Annual Dates in SP-lc, Monte AlbAn: (top) if the "Binding" Glyph WERE 13E AND (BOTTOM) IF THE "BINDING" GLYPH WERE IE Latest Middle Earliest date date date Intervals Span 13E 8E 5E = 0-44-16 = 60 years 13E 5E 8E = 0-8-36 = 44 years 8E 5E 13E = 0-16-44 = 60 years 8E 13E 5E = 0-8-8 = 16 years 5E 13E 8E = 0-44-44 = 88 years 5E 8E 13E = 0-36-8 = 45 years Latest Middle Earliest date date date Intervals Span IE 8E 5E = 0-33-16 = 49 years IE 5E 8E = 0-48-36 = 84 years 8E 5E IE = 0-16-4 = 20 years 8E IE 5E = 0-20-48 = 68 years 5E IE 8E = 0-4-32 = 36 years 5E 8E IE = 0-36-20 = 56 years the "Hill" glyphs upon which the depicted person- ages are standing, but these have not been considered part of the standard sequence either. The sign following the year glyph/year bearer is the "Fish" glyph, which appears in the program six times (Fig. 5. 82). 24 In three instances it occupies the second position (SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6a) and its rep- resentation involves only the head facing upward. In two other cases, the head appears as an inversion to the second position, occupying the seventh place in the texts on SP-3 and SP-5. Here, the heads are fac- ing downward. The last example is peculiar in that it occurs at the end of a text and the head is shown with a sound scroll and a body (SP-6b).The glyph occurs only in stones that have two annual dates each (SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6a/b). While initially I suggested that the glyph could be a semantic indicator of the direc- tion in the count of time given by annual markers (Urcid n.d.c, 1: 297-298), Terrence Kaufman (personal communication, 1994) has proposed an insightful al- ternative: that the glyph is a logogram that means "cap- tive." Other available examples of the "Fish" glyph in 24 Caso (1928: 66) described this glyph as the representation of a fish or a turtle. Here, its specific pictographic identification as fish is based on examples that show a tail and fins; on its resemblance with Olmec, Izapa, and Maya representations of fish; and on the fact that the glyphs include teeth, an osteologi- cal trait absent in turtles. 380</page><page sequence="398">Table 5.13 Unfolding of Annual Dates in Program A, Monte AlbAn 13 E Latest annual date (recorded in SP-1 and SP-7) 60 3 12 N 11 G 10 M Ninth annual date (recorded in SP-3) 57 12 9 E 8 N 7 G 6 M 5 E 4 N 3 G 2 M 1 E 13 N 12 G 11 M Eighth annual date (recorded in SP-3 as inverted date) 45 7 10 E 9 N 8 G 7 M 6 E 5 N 4 G Seventh annual date* (recorded in SP-5) 38 12 3 M 2 E 1 N 13 G 12 M 11 E 10 N 9 G 8 M 7 E 6 N 5 G Sixth annual date (recorded in SP-5 as inverted date) 26 4 4 M 3 E 2 N 1 G Fifth annual date (recorded in SP-6b) 22 4 13 M 12 E 11 N 10 G Fourth annual date (recorded in SP-6a) 18 2 9 M 8 E Third annual date (recorded in SP-1) 16 8 7 N 6 G 5 M 4 E 3 N 2 G 1 M 13 E Second annual date recorded in SP-2 8 8 12 N 11 G 10 M 9 E 8 N 7 G 6 M 5 E Earliest annual date (recorded in SP-1) 0 0 * Â»rnnstnirtiÂ«H Hate 381</page><page sequence="399">Table 5.14 Alternative Unfolding of Annual Dates in Program A, Monte Alb An, if Year Bearers in SP-5 are Assumed to be 5G and 6G 382 I j h Latest annual date (recorded in bF-l and bir-/) 6U 3 12 N II G 10 M Ninth annual date (recorded in SP-3) 57 12 9 E 8 N 7 G 6 M 5 E 4 N 3 G 2 M 1 E 13 N 12 G 11 M Eighth annual date (recorded in SP-3 as inverted date) 45 19 10 E 9 N 8 G 7 M 6 E 5 N 4 G 3 M 2 E 1 N 13 G 12 M 11 E 10 N 9 G 8 M 7 E 6 N 5 G Seventh annual date* (recorded in SP-5) 26 4 4 M 3 E 2 N 1 G Sixth annual date (recorded in SP-6b) 22 4 13 M 12 E 11 N 10 G Fifth annual date (recorded in SP-6a) 18 2 9 M 8 E Fourth annual date (recorded in SP-1) 16 2 7 N 6 G Third annual date (recorded in SP-5 as inverted date) 14 6 5 M 4 E 3 N 2 G 1 M 13 E Second annual date recorded in SP-2 8 8 12 N 11 G 10 M 9 E 8 N 7 G 6 M 5 E Earliest annual date (recorded in SP-1) 0 0 * reconstructed date</page><page sequence="400">Table 5.15 Properties of Alternative Calendrical Sequences in Program A, Monte AlbAn Inclusion of all Identical intervals Reading format Reading Intervals Span annual dates in in annual dates on top to bottom sequence generated span SP-3 and SP-5 and left to right 13E-8E-1E 0-44-16 60 y yes yes yes 13E-5E-8E 0-8-36 44 y no yes no 8E-5E-13E 0-16-44 60 y yes yes no 8E-13E-5E 0-8-8 16 y no - no 5E-13E-8E 0-44-44 88 y no no no 5E-8E-13E 0-36-8 44 y no - no 1E-8E-5E 0-33-16 49 y yes no yes 1E-5E-8E 0-48-36 84 y yes yes no 8E-5E-1E 0-16-4 20 y no - no 8E-1E-5E 0-20-48 68 y yes yes no 5E-8E-1E 0-4-32 36 y no - no 5E-1E-8E 0-36-20 56 y yes no no the corpus suggest that the sign had multiple uses, in- cluding the formation of personal names (Fig. 5.83, nos. 1-3 and 5-8). Yet, supporting Kaufman's reading in the context of program A is an expression in Cordova's Vocabulario for "to take with a fishhook, to fish" [tomar con anzuelo, pescai-Ticahaya pela], an ac- tion that is analogous to that of "to capture in war, captive, or to be captured" [cativar en guerra, cativo ser o cativado- Tiawytf pinini] ([1578] Cordova 1987: 405v, 75 v). The third position in the standard sequence of the texts is occupied by glyphic compounds that in al- most all cases include human footprints. The direction of the prints varies and must have a specific signifi- cance, probably as verbal affixes. In other Mesoamerican writing systems, footprints were used as semantic signs for travel. Because one has to reach, pass, or depart from somewhere, the associated aggre- gations of signs most likely have a toponymic value. Consequendy, it is possible to deduce that the missing glyph in the text on SP-5 gave the name of a locality. The composition of the available compounds varies (Fig. 5.84). A couple of them have two constituent signs (SP-2a and SP-3), and three have three to six. Two compounds are characterized by conflation (SP-2a and SP-lc, text B).The interpretation of these glyphic aggregates as place names is supported by the following three other details: 1. The compounds in texts A and C on SP-lc include the "Hill" glyph, which has been established as being a locative indicator. 2. The compounds in the text on SP-2a and text B on SP-lc include glyph E, which, as argued in Chapter 4, represents the surface of the earth and its quadripartite division. Whereas the "Hill" glyph refers to localities on top of a geographic prominence or pyra- mid, glyph E might refer to places in flat, al- luvial plains or plazas.

One of these (no. 1) might even include four embedded darts in each corner of the cartouche with glyph E and scrolls of smoke, denoting its conquest. 3. The compound in the text on SP-3 in- cludes a sign that is identical to two elements that form part of the "Hill" glyph upon which the main personage in SP-lc is seated. This sign has a conical form topped with a tripar- tite finial and a V-shaped element set inside it. The latter element is identical to the one inserted in the main "Hill" glyph on SP-lc. This gives the impression that the sign is a conventionalized version of a "Hill" glyph. Despite the similarities just noted, the com- pound in SP-3 includes a conch shell, sug- gesting that the two names might refer to dif- ferent localities. The link between the toponym in the text on SP-3 and the "Hill" glyph upon which the main figure of the program is seated yields an interesting implica- tion - that is, the recognition of a paramount place name. The sign in SP-lc is the most elaborate of the toponymic glyphs in the program. Its constituent ele- ments are isolated in Figure 5.86. The V-shaped element inserted in the "Hill" glyph is repeated in the elements that curve on top of each of the unfolded images of glyph U. Because the ped- estal with such unfolded imagery has been documented only in stones found at Monte Alban and its near pe- riphery, Caso and Bernal (1952: 211) interpreted it as its toponymic glyph, or that of a nearby site (Fig. 5. 87). 25 The upper V-shaped element has also been attested in other stones found at Monte Alban and in surround- ing places (Fig. 5.88). In these instances, the V-shaped element appears in combination with different com- pounds, indicating that it cannot be the sole constitu- ent of the place name of Monte Alban. Caso and Bernal's interpretation of the lower sign is not invali- dated, but the known proveniences for the carvings in which the V-shaped element appears suggest that the latter is also somehow related to Monte Alban. All the toponymic glyphs at the bottom of pro- gram A are different (Fig. 5. 89). They consist of com- pounds inserted in the "Hill" glyphs, and all are char- acterized by conflation. The diagonal bands in the backgrounds appear to be defining traits of the "Hill" glyph. These also appear in two of the "Hill" glyphs in the texts, where their direction in all instances is the same. In other cases, the diagonal bands are not indi- cated (SP-7b, SP-5, and SP-6a), and such omission might be due to the shape and size of the compounds inserted in the "Hill" glyphs. The compounds vary in the number of constituents, ranging from one (SP-5 and SP-6a), to two (SP-2, SP-3, and SP-7b), to three (SP-8).The combination in SP-2 also appears in pro- gram B as a personal name. Therefore, some of the compounds inside the "Hill" glyphs must be logograms as well. Given the characteristics of the compounds, the homophonic and acrophonic principles are prob- ably involved as well. Because the "Hill" sign is also used in the formation of personal names, it cannot be simply a semantic sign when functioning as a top- onym. Rather, it must have a phonetic value that forms part of the place names. Whittaker (n.d.) has already suggested the value tani, a proposition that is sup- ported by the glosses naming hills in the Lienzo de Guevea, and by the entry in Cordova s Vocabulario ([1578] 1987: 107) for "peak of the mountains" (Cerro de Sierra - Pecootam, tanih uini, ho tarn). Taking into account the toponymic glyphs at the bottom and those appearing in the third position of the standard sequence in the texts, the narrative of program A makes refer- ence to 12 distinct localities.The toponymic compound now lost from the text in SP-5 might have named another place. Some of the constituents of the place names from program A are pictographic (e.g., a jaguar, a conch, three flint knives, a knot, a serpent, a human bust with headdress, a temple), and isolated phonetic values de- rived from Cordova's Vocabulario could be assigned to them. But if the acrophonic principle is indeed in- volved, the rules for combining phonetic values re- main to be determined. Even if the names could be 25 Glyph U occurs as a pedestal also in a stone from El Meson, Veracruz (cf.

Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that most of the present toponyms in Oaxaca are in Nahuad (Martinez Gracida 1883;Bradomin 195 5). As the late script of the central highlands also made use of the homophonic principle (Dibble 1971; Nicholson 1973), and the Nahuatl and Zapotec languages belong to different families, such appellatives might not have any semantic resemblance to the original local names. Furthermore, the Zapotec names of many localities and their meanings have been lost in recent (colonial and modern) times (Zuniga 1982: 114- 11 6). Those of the most ancient, long ago abandoned sites, could have been forgotten since Pre- Hispanic times. Another problem is that the places re- corded in the inscriptions might not necessarily have 389 SP-2a SP~3 *3 J? ^ J -M._ ^ Â© Â£0 CD SP-lc (text B) SP-lc (text A) # ' &lt;- ANN !i SP-lc (text C)</page><page sequence="407">Fig. 5.85 Other toponymic signs with glyph E in the Zapotec corpus. been names of settlements.They could as well be names of geographical or artificial features that had a special significance (hills, caves, gorges, pyramids, plazas, ballcourts, or other architectural complexes).26 To at least identify some of the places recorded in the inscriptions an alternative method is available, in- volving the comparison of toponymic glyphs docu- mented at different sites. This approach, however, re- quires data that, if ever recorded in the inscriptions, are not available at the present time. There is one in- stance in which one of the "Hill" glyphs in program A seems to match pictographically the one recorded in two stones from the archaeological site of Dainzu-Macuilxochid, a site located 23 km to the east of Monte Alban (Fig. 5.90). By its theme and style, one of the examples is known to pertain to period II (DAN Boulder-5). The other carving might date to the Transition II- Ilia or Ilia (MAC-2). Although the actual phonetic reading for this toponymic glyph is unknown, the preceding identification, if correct, would bear important historical implications, especially with regard to the relations of Dainzu-Macuilxochid 26 Some of the many problems the study of Oaxacan locatives presents have been treated by Paddock in several case studies (1982: 346-347; 1989b, 1990b, 1990c, 1990d, 1990e, 1990f). On the other hand, and as discussed in Chapter 2, other au- thors have taken an uncritical approach to the etymology of Oaxacan place names and the interpretation and identification of Zapotec toponymic glyphs (Marcus 1976a: 127-131; 1983b: 106-108; 1992: 394-400; Whittaker n.d.: 111-182). 390 1 2 3 4 1.

The fourth position in the standard sequence of the texts from program A includes glyphs accompa- nied by coefficients. So far, the columnar inscriptions consist of (1) annual dates, (2) a logogram that could be read as "captive," and (3) place names. When the calendrics were analyzed, the discussion was focused on events and one would expect reference to the pro- tagonists of those events. The remaining positions in the standard sequence include compounds that involve hands and body parts (fifth position), and the "Bag" glyph (sixth position). I therefore propose that the glyphs with coefficients located in the fourth place are the names of the personages involved. Thus, these glyphs would not have a chronological fiinction.Table 5.16 shows the list of names with their equivalents in trifinial ornament "hm" 9lyph uvx 'xu V-shaped element ^^^^w-tfolded image of glyph appended elements that combine the "hill" glyph, the trifinial ornament, and the V-shaped element</page><page sequence="409">Fig. 5.87 Lower element of the "Hill" glyph in SP-lc and its presence in other stones from the environs of Monte Alban. ^ xy 1 2 * ^ 2 * 1.

However, it already has been considered that, by their associated dates, the two sec- ondary texts in SP-lc are not related to the imagery of the composition. Therefore, the individuals named 12B and 8Z are not shown in the program. The correlation between a calendrical name and a human figure seems straightforward in some cases. For instance, the bound personage with jaguar outfit in SP-2a is named 3 A; the prisoner in animal disguise on SP-3 has the appellative 12D; and the captives in stones SP-5, SP-6a, and SP-8 are named, respectively, 8P, 2S, and 3J. Remaining to be identified are the seated, most important personage, and the bound figure that first confronts him. The names that remain are 13F and 7 A. It will be consistent with all the preceding arguments to assume that the most prominent personage is named twice. The calendrical name 7 A, which is mentioned in the first text in SP-lc, would then refer to the bound figure depicted in SP-7b. If this is so, the inscriptions and the images indicate that the prominent personage 13F was involved in the three events that occurred in the years 13E, 1G, and the subse- quent 13E.The largest interval is an entire Calendar Round (52 years) and the shortest, included in it, is 14 years. The fifth position in the standard sequence involves glyphic compounds that consist primarily of hands and body parts (upper and lower torsos) (Fig. 5.91). In terms of the number of constituent glyphs, the com- position varies in the five examples. Whereas three of the texts do not have glyphs that correspond to this position, text B in SP-lc appears to have two com- pounds of this type. The first one appears out of the sequence, occupying a second position (see Fig. 5.81). The other one indeed can be taken as a fifth-position glyph. It has been the consensus that glyphic compounds with hands are verbs (Caso 1947: 12;Whittaker n.d.: 28, fig. 6; Justeson 1986: 448, 450, figs. 6 and 7). If the fifth position of the standard sequence in program A indeed refers to actions, or at least includes verbal af- fixes, then their omission in four of the texts would probably be related to incompleteness or artistic con- siderations. It also is likely that the absence of some syntactical elements in program A might have been complemented by the images. The intended meaning also could have been deduced from the overall con- text.

Reeck (1982: 372), for instance, has com- mented about the complex morphology of verbs in sixteenth-century Zapotec. However, the fact that all the compounds that were recorded are different would mean that, if verbs, they are not making reference to what is being depicted in the narrative, where the com- mon theme is the presentation of bound personages. So far, then, the contextual analysis does not eliminate the possibility that the fifth position of the standard sequence might refer to verbs or might include verbal affixes. Another detail supports the possible inclusion of verbal affixes. The gestures of the hands suggest that these clusters are counts of some kind of units. This is best exemplified by the glyph in SP-3, in which the upper half of a human figure is extending two fin- gers. From other known complete texts that include the fifth position of the standard sequence, there is confirmation for the counting of units, as well as some indication that the units being counted might have something to do with calendrics (Fig. 5.92).

However, because this is not a recurrent pattern, the correspondences between the counting of units and the calendrics might be alea- tory. In the case of program A, there is certainly no indication of such a relationship. The glyph in the last position of the standard se- quence is the pictograph of a bag tied with a knot (Fig. 5.93). The sign appears in five texts only. The glyph in the inscription on SP-3 consists exclusively of the knot. Another occurrence is in text C on SP-lc, which is not related to the images in the narrative. Yet, the fact that the same glyph is repeated several times suggests that it might be related to the bound indi- viduals depicted in the images. Whittaker (n.d.: 42, 45; 1992: 10) had already sug- gested that the "Bag" glyph is a verbal or adjectival element that denotes binding of prisoners or time periods, and that - if it refers to prisoners - the sign could be read as captured. Terrence Kaufman (per- sonal communication, 1994), on the other hand, pro- poses it as a logogram that means lord. Taking into account that nonverb-final basic word order is a com- mon Mesoamerican linguistic trait (Campbell and Kaufman 1985: 192) and that the fifth position in the standard sequence most likely refers to verbs, Kaufman s proposition about the value of the "Bag" glyph is more convincing. Yet, if we consider the theme of program A, there is the possibility that the "Bag" glyph means captor. That the homophonic principle is apparently 395</page><page sequence="413">Table 5.16 Calendrical Names in Program A, Monte Alb an, and Their Possible Phonetic Reading Calendrical 16th-century Glyph name equivalent 1 (Sj 3A Calatella cayo ooo 2* 13F Pizeela chijiio 3 12D Pinij chijbicato 4 (53? 7 A Pillatella cache Â©G 5 12B Pillaache chijbicato 6 8Z Caleaueca xono uuo n y 7 3J Pelaana cayo 8 8P Neloppa xono 9 2S Pelachi cato * occurs twice (in SP-2b and SP-6b) not involved in the use of the "Bag" glyph to denote lord or captor is evident from the following entries in Cordova's Vocabulario: 1 . bolsa para dineros Pigotitiyoo tomines [bag for money] Quiti pigoti (57v) 2. bolsa frunzida con cerraderos Pifofcnacoxotohuani [bag gathered with closings] Piforttohuanagoxoni (57v) 3.

Prendedor Peni cocaani (325 v) [captor] The preceding analysis suggests that the standard sequence reflects a syntax. The most common order of the grammatical constituents would be temporal markers (year date), locatives (place name), subject (the 396</page><page sequence="414">Fig. 5.91 Glyphic compounds in the fifth position of the glyphic standard sequence in program A, Monte Alban. calendrical name of personages), verb (compounds in fifth position), and object ("Bag" glyph). In one case, the verb precedes the subject, but then the text does not include the object (text B in SP-lc). It also is pos- sible that the glyphic compounds in the third and fifth positions might have auxiliary verbs. None of this, however, includes signs whose pictography could be unequivocally interpreted as sacrifice. Yet, the images as well as the proposed readings for the "Fish" and "Bag" glyphs imply human immolations. If so, the stan- dard sequence and its variations encode not simple sentences but a number of grammatically complex utterances. These in turn have intricate relations with the images. As noted before, except for the calendrical names, no glyph or compound in program A can be read pho- netically at this stage. Nevertheless, further addi- tions to the list of the signary in the script can be accomplished. By breaking down the compounds that form the toponymic glyphs in the texts and in the pedestals of the personages, disjoining the compounds in the fifth position, and then adding all the resulting signs to the single noncalendrical glyphs in the texts, a total of 35 different signs results. Eleven of these also occur in program B, making a total of 49 different glyphs in both narratives (Figs. 5.94 to 5. 96). The glyphs in these figures have been identified numerically and in a progressive order, starting the series with number 100. With such an expanding designation system, it will be possible to make future additions to the signary. In the case of noncalendrical glyphs that have calendrical counterparts, the labeling of the latter was added at the extreme left. An Interpretation of Program A An overall interpretation of the narrative is diffi- cult because of the unsolved meaning of the glyphs in the fifth position of the standard sequence. Although the chronological framework makes sense in terms of the indigenous calendar, the complex interrelation- ship between images and texts aggravates the matter. This interrelationship is not simply complementary, at least not in the sense that "it concerns differences of representation in time (text) and space (image)" (Kubler 1969: 4). In program A, both texts and images convey information about different times, although the vari- ous processions confronting the main personage could have occurred in the same built environment. One of the first questions that come to mind is to what do the annual dates refer. The imagery of pris- oners suggests the commemoration of war events or the sacrifice of captured enemies. The distribution of the annual dates, however, cannot easily be explained 397 SP-2b SP-3 SP-lc (text A&gt; SP-lc (text B)</page><page sequence="415">&lt;u u S a" u C/5 l (/) o G O ;g ' ' 5/3 o a, 3 D *5 ,g â fl 3 fr o U u u 4- ' o 8- N % .3 s 1) 4-&gt; o â fl o (N OS ir&gt; â¢ SP tL, 398 * Â§18Â® Â® | O â¢r- to 51 (Ifl# ISA-' Hi ^ ISA-' "O Q) t- 4-&gt; aj +J QJ +j &gt; Â«â¦- ,r'. io -a c o /p^j C &lt;D *1- ^3L Tcr~j 5 s- c s- fc/ntar 3 a&gt; a&gt; Â« _____ rjgl//g$C r- Q.

There are nine personages named, one of them is not a prisoner. This leaves eight captives. On the other hand, there are 10 dates, but the last one (the second Calendar Round completion) celebrates two events. Apparently two of the prisoners (7A and 3J) were involved. This leaves six named individuals and nine dates. By further tracing the correspondence of annual dates and the "Fish" and "Bag" glyphs, there is at least one annual date (8E) and one individual (12B) that apparently have anything to do with warfare, cap- ture, or sacrifice. Eliminating it for the moment would result in a discrepancy between five prisoners and eight dates. Yet, the extra three dates (1G, 5G, and 1 1M) are accompanied by a "Fish" (capture) glyph. If these dates are also taken as commemorations of sacrifices, then the names of three captives would not have been re- corded in the program. In addition to the celebrations at the end of each Calendar Round, the plotting of dates that presum- ably involved warfare or human sacrifice generates multiple patterned intervals. Seven of them are spaced every other 4, 8, or 12 years. Such a recurrence strongly suggests that the third date in the sequence (8E) also refers to a warfare event (with 12B as the prisoner) because it fell 8 years after the second date 13E re- corded in SP-2a (the presumed sacrifice of 3A). By considering it a warfare or sacrifice event, this date generates a span of 2 years until the next date 10G on SP-6a (the presumed sacrifice of 2S).The remaining two dates in the program (11M and the second Cal- endar Round 13E) generate spans of 7 and 3 years between presumed wars or immolations. In terms of the actual capture of prisoners, randomness would be expected if warfare took place exclusively in a milieu of changing internal or external political motives. Yet, the dates in the narrative include mostly calendrically prescribed events at intervals that are multiples of 2 (4, 8, 12, 52) and only two incidents that fell very close to the patterned periods of 4 and 8 years. Using the synchronologies of the Christian, Mixtec, and Zapotec calendars proposed by Cline (1975), the two consecu- tive Calendar Round completions commemorated in program A would have occurred on two of the fol- lowing dates: year 13 Xoo (13 Earthquake) = a.d. 352, 405, 458, 511, or 564. By correlating the presumed dates of sacrifice with each one of the bound personages and implied pris- oners in the program (Table 5.17), a specific scenario can be considered. There is no apparent contradiction between the total span of 60 years and the possible life span of 13F, but the fact that his name appears in two consecutive Calendar Round completions would make him a very unlikely protagonist (other than observer) for the earliest event celebrated in the program. As- suming that he was 65 years old when the program was ordered and erected, he would have been 5 years old at the time of the first recorded sacrifice in the year 5E. Concomitantly, he presumably would have been too old to be directly involved in the capture and sacrifice of 7 A and 3J. If 13F was direcdy respon- sible for the capture and sacrifice of 3A in the earliest recorded completion of the Calendar Round, and as- suming that he was by then at least 20 years old (i.e., fully capable of a military deed), then his age at the time of the last recorded sacrifice would have been 72 years (Table 5. 18).

In the case of the last events, however, he could have been in power while someone else was conducting warfare under his rulership.The same could have been the case with the capture and sacrifice of 12D in the year 10M (when 13F would have been 69 years old), and perhaps of 8P in the year 4G (when he would have been 50 years old). In the case of the conquests and immolations celebrated in the years 8E and 10G (involving the pre- sumed capture and sacrifice of 12B and 2S), 13F would have been 28 and 30 years old, respectively. Conse- quently, in these two events he could have been the actual captor and sacrificer. The differences in garments and paraphernalia in the bound individuals (3 A and 12D versus 7 A, 3J, 8P, and 2S) suggest a hierarchy of prisoners - that is, ac- tual rulers from other localities in contrast to warriors that did not belong to the ruling elite or the nobility. Thus, the omission of three names and their accom- panying images could have been due to the low status of the captives. The 12 or 13 different place names in the narrative are difficult to integrate into this hypothetical sce- nario. It seems logical to assume that the toponyms at the bottom give the place of origin of the depicted personages. If the footprints accompanying the place names in the texts are indeed verbal affixes, their full significance will depend partially on the meaning con- veyed by the direction of the "travel" signs. Perhaps these are places connected exclusively with 13F and his doings. Together they might represent a map. As- suming, as was the cartographic convention in other parts of Mesoamerica, that the upward footprints de- note east, geographic orientations can be deduced from the direction of footprints in the textual toponyms of program A. Considering the proposed sequence of dates in the narrative, the mentioned route would start in the east (SP-1[A]) and then proceed west (SP-3), west (SP-5), north (SP-1 [B]), and west (divergent path?) (SP-2). The toponym in text SP-1[C] has no foot- print, perhaps implying no travel.These localities could even be within Monte Alban. If they were related to the compounds in the fifth position of the standard sequence, more information about specific events in the life of the main protagonist 13F would be given. The interpretive problems presented by the narra- tive might find a solution as more epigraphic data be- come available.

Summary Remarks Although the corner monoliths of the South Plat- form at Monte Alban were found in situ by Batres (in 1902) and by Acosta (in 1958), they were not in a primary context. Analysis of their physical character- istics and of the archaeological context in which they were embedded discloses that the stones had been used twice before they were set as corner markers in the platform. In the primary context (sometime between a.d. 350 and 450), SP-1, SP-8, SP-7,and SP-9 formed a set and were used as lintels or roof slabs. Carved exclusively on one or two of their narrow surfaces, they yield a total of six reliefs. Their undersides were well dressed. Most probably the monoliths were set in a quadripar- tite structure that had two entrances opposite each other from the outside and four internal accesses that led from an inner courtyard into four surrounding rooms. Two of the inscriptions could be seen as the entrances were approached. The other four carvings could be seen only after the inner courtyard had been reached. The six reliefs form a narrative recording six proces- sions, two of them executed pictographically and four rendered by means of glyphic substitutions. Each pro- cession shows several secondary personages confront- ing and departing from a main figure. In total, 2 promi- nent individuals and 14 secondary ones are represented. The main figures are interpreted here as successive rul- ers of Monte Alban, and the subordinate personages are members of the city's elite, perhaps lineage heads of 14 of the 15 "barrios" of Monte Alban or rulers of subordinate communities. I have assumed that the ac- companying inscriptions are exclusively nominative, providing the calendrical and personal names of the individuals involved. The calendrical glyphs are logographic, and therefore the names of the two main figures can be read, using sixteenth-century Zapotec, as Pelaache (5 Jaguar [glyph 5B]) and Pizopiya (13 "Brush" or "Soap Plant" [glyph 13N]). The glyphic compounds denoting the personal names appear to be logographic as well, and some of them might involve the homophonic principle. Among the signs constituting the compounds are noncalendrical versions of calendrical glyphs. In those instances, by applying the "phonetic" values established upon the reconstruction of the glyphic day list, the personal names that are thus interpreted are remark- ably similar to examples of appellatives in the colonial lienzos and legal documents. For instance, the com- plete names of the last three individuals in the proces- sion on SP-9 can be read phonetically as Cozio Xoo Picitella chijno (Strong Lightning-13 Knot), Yooneza Pelloo caa (Walker/Traveler-9 Monkey), and (?) Pecetao- Quiaguela chaga ( ? Ferocious Jaguar-1 Night). The narrative program could have been commis- sioned by lord 5B to commemorate his ascendance to power and to pay homage to his deceased ancestor, lord 13N.The visiting parties of secondary personages are different for each ruler, and they are shown ap- proaching them twice but departing from them only once. The coming and going of secondary nobles show slight variations in terms of number and identity of individuals. Probably after a short existence the structure with the carved lintels or roof slabs was dismantled, appar- ently with the intention of reusing the monoliths to carve another unrelated narrative. In the process, how- ever, SP-9 broke in such a way that it became useless for that purpose. The remaining three stones (SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8) and four newly quarried or reused but plain blocks (SP-2, SP-3, SP-5, and SP-6) were then carved on one of their largest respective surfaces (in what was the underside in the case of the former lintels) and set as orthostats in the facade of a building to form a composite narrative. The stones SP-2 and SP-6, with two coevally carved surfaces each, were intended as corner markers. Therefore, they mark both ends of the narrative. In this secondary context, SP-9 must have been used as construction material in the same building decorated by the composite program. Its narrow relief, like those in SP-1, SP-7, and SP-8 (whose content was by then irrelevant), was embed- ded and hidden from view. The reconstruction of the narrative s original con- 405</page><page sequence="423">figuration disclosed the recording of multiple proces- sions in which secondary personages (prisoners bound by their arms or legs) confront singly or in pairs, di- rectly or indirectly, a main figure. This individual, iden- tified by his calendrical name as 13F (Pizeela, 13 Night], was evidently another ruler of Monte Alban. The reconstruction of the narrative also allowed com- parison of nine complete columnar inscriptions. All these texts display a standard sequence with some varia- tions. The most common order starts with an annual date (year glyph/year bearer) followed by the "Fish" glyph. This sign appears to be a logogram that means captive. Next comes a toponymic compound with footprints, then a calendrical glyph with a nominative function (naming the individuals portrayed), and then a glyphic compound that could stand for verbal ex- pressions. The standard sequence ends with the picto- graph of a tied bag, a logogram that could mean cap- tor. Although not all the texts fill in all the positions, and some appear in a different order, the standard se- quence and its variations could reflect the syntaxis of the ancient Zapotec language. As a mirror image of the standard sequence, the epigraphy of the narrative includes two annual dates that appear inverted. There are also other toponymic compounds carved directly under the depicted personages, but these do not form part of the standard sequence. The occurrence of multiple annual dates in the program provides a unique situation for testing the model of year bearers proposed in the previous chap- ter. By determining a sequence in which all the dates are supposed to be read that takes into account the images and certain calendrical patterns, it is possible to do the following: 1. Identify a unique example of the year glyph - i.e., a "binding" glyph denoting the completion of a Calendar Round (this glyph was not detected in the analyses conducted in Chapter 4). The bearer is glyph E, and, al- though the accompanying coefficient was omitted, the contextual analysis suggests that the intended value was 13. Thus, Zapotec Calendar Rounds could have begun in the years named 13 E (Picixoo or 13 Earth- quake). 2. Account for the calendrical framework recorded in the program. The unfolding of the annual dates yielded a span of 60 years, and the intervals between the dates tend to be multiples of two years (4, 8, 12, 52). Despite the interpretive complexities, the resulting chronological span (60 years), the patterns in some of the intervals (multiples of 2), and the identification of the "binding" glyph (Calendar Round comple- tion), all point to a positive and successful test of the model of year bearers that postulates the se- quence E (17th) -âº M (2nd) -âº G (7th) -* N (12th). The span of 60 years in the temporal framework of program A is approximately equivalent to two human generations. Because only one prominent individual is shown in the narrative (Lord 13F), all the dates can- not refer to his deeds.The carving of the program and the construction of the building decorated by it were evidently ordered by him to celebrate a Calendar Round completion, so that either the earliest events recounted in the inscriptions have to be attributed to an unnamed ancestor of his or the last recorded events were carried out by other (anonymous) individual(s) under his rulership.The depiction of bound prisoners and the patterned intervals of the dates suggest the sacrifice of prisoners during rituals that were calendrically prescribed. Program A apparently stood longer than its prede- cessor (program B), but it was eventually dismantled too. All the stones, including SP-9, were then used as construction material when the perimeter of the South Platform was enlarged. In their tertiary context, the narrow reliefs that conformed program B were em- bedded in the supporting matrix of the basal wall, and the large reliefs that conformed program A most prob- ably were covered by a thick layer of stucco. The place- ment of the monoliths in the South Platform could have occurred sometime between a.d. 600 and 700 and could have been carried out by a distant successor of Lord 13F. By then, the content of the inscriptions (in both narrow and anterior surfaces) was probably irrelevant. Yet the reuse of the stones in the corners, the dedication of offertory caches underneath them, and their sprinkling with red paint on the bottom sides indicate that they still had a special value. 406</page><page sequence="424">The comparison between the earlier program B and the later program A does not evince marked sty- listic differences, suggesting a short lapse between them. The processional format in program A was evidently derived from the format used in program B. It also resembles antecedent and coeval formats in tomb murals. The differences between the programs appear to be mostly related to their architectural function: the narrative of program B was carved on narrow sur- faces of lintels, whereas the narrative of program A was carved on the large surfaces of stones that were meant to be orthostats decorating the entire side of a platform. In terms of the epigraphy, program B differs from program A in that there is no temporal frame- work (no glyphs with a chronological function). Also, in program B the appellatives of the personages in- clude both their calendrical and their personal names. In contrast, program A has a complex calendrical frame- work with 10 annual dates involving relays and iden- tifies all the personages exclusively by their calendrical names.27 In both narratives the epigraphy is comple- mentary with the imagery, but in program A the rela- tionship between image and text is much more intri- cate because of the various chronological referents. In the texts, the omission of certain types of positions from the standard sequence appears to stem from ar- tistic considerations. It is plausible that the omitted information could have been inferred (as has been done here) from the overall narrative. It is also possible that the composition of the program might have been much more inclusive than what is currendy available. The epigraphic interpretations of programs B and A imply that, although both were fundamentally com- memorative and had political overtones, they were very different in character. The earlier one (program B) apparently had a funerary and genealogical motive, showing the paying of homage to two rulers by sub- ordinate individuals. Because of the exclusively nomi- native function of the accompanying inscriptions and the lack of a calendrical framework, the genealogical link and the direction of succession between the two principal figures (13N and 5B) is admittedly inferred. Program A, on the other hand, seems to be of a glori- fying nature. It records the celebration of rituals that involved human sacrifice on prescribed occasions - i.e., period endings. Implicitly, these rituals indicate warfare events. Because only one prominent person- age is mentioned, his genealogical ties cannot be de- termined. If, because of their stylistic resemblances, the two narratives were the product of two successive construction events, the apparent short interval be- tween them would indicate that the ruler 13F of pro- gram A succeeded ruler 5B of program B. The dis- mantling of a commemorative structure (program B) to obtain materials to build and decorate another (pro- gram A), and the apparent lack of a genealogical reg- ister Unking ruler 13F to his ancestry, might imply a discontinuity in the ruling succession of Monte Alban (13N -* 5B/13F). Separate analyses of programs B and A yielded a contradiction, one that became accentuated by the inferences just mentioned. The toponymic glyph as- sociated with ruler 5B in program B ("Hill-Trispiral") is different from the toponymic sign associated with the ruler 13F in program A ("Hill V-shaped"). There are a number of alternatives that can account for the differences in the toponymic signs without invalidat- ing that both individuals belonged to the ruling elite (but from different lineages?) of Monte Alban: 1 . The two toponymic glyphs refer to dif- ferent architectural features or geographic sec- tors within the city. The archaeological site subdivisions (Monte Alban proper, Atzompa, El Gallo, Monte Alban Chico, and others) could have had their own toponymic glyphs. Such a possibility is reinforced by data in the 1771 Mapa de Xoxocotlan (cf. Smith 1973a: 202-210, 338-339, figs. 162 and 163), where several landmarks in Monte Alban are indi- vidually identified. 2. One place name is more inclusive than the other. So far, the "U-pedestal" and the 27 This difference in the programs does not mean that the prac- tice of writing personal names fell into disuse during Monte Alban Illb. Several carved stones from that period contain both calendrical and personal names of individuals (see stone ZAA-8a in Fig. 4.153). 407</page><page sequence="425">"V-shaped" element, together or separate, have a larger geographic distribution that in- cludes Monte Alban and sites in its piedmont and adjacent alluvial plains. Perhaps the "Trispiral" glyph denotes a locality within such a larger geographic unit. 3. There was a change in glyphic represen- tation through time. So far, the known ex- amples of the "Hill-Trispiral" glyph appear to pertain to the Monte Alban Ilia period. Probably this form was subsequendy replaced, during late Ilia or early Illb, by the "U-pedestal" or the "Hill V-shaped" element. However, the apparent chronological distinc- tion might simply be due to sample error. 4. Both glyphs had the same or similar pho- netic value. Currently, none of the toponyms in programs B and A can be read phonetically. However, by compar- ing the place signs on the narratives with others in the corpus, a specific locality was apparently identified: Dainzu-Macuilxochid.This is a large nearby site known to have been coeval with Monte Alban. The strategy of comparing place signs and identifying similarities can have important implications about political geog- raphy, but it does not solve the problem of decipher- ing the glyphic names. Whatever the solution to the problem of the glyphic names of Monte Alban, it is clear that until the tombs of its rulers are located and exposed, the extent to which conflicts within or be- tween ruling elites were important factors in its his- tory will remain undeterminable. 408</page><page sequence="426">CHAPTER 6 Conclusions Overview Understanding Zapotec hieroglyphic writing involves different levels of decipherment. Given that the signs used in the script are largely pictographic, the first level is the identification of what they represent. The second layer entails elucidating the encoded speech; attaining this stage is being able to read the inscrip- tions in Zapotec. The third level is comprehending what the message means. Because of the relationship between image and text in Zapotec writing, a full understanding of the inscriptions cannot be accom- plished without incorporating the semasiographic component of the script. Furthermore, being able to transcribe the phonetic clues of the script does not necessarily lead to an understanding of the intended meaning. In Mesoamerica, as in many other parts of the world, writing was imbued with divine origin and messages - whether political, economical, or mytho- logical - were often rendered in a metaphorical vein. The different levels of decipherment can be conceived of as hierarchical, although they do not necessarily have to follow a specific order. For instance, as shown by the history of decipherment of other scripts, the meaning of a sign can be known even though its pho- netic rendering remains obscure, or the phonetic value can be fully realized while the pictographic origin of the sign remains puzzling. In view of these different levels in the process of understanding a script, it follows that Zapotec writing remains largely undeciphered. Certain conditions, like the reconstruction of pre-Zapotec and the documen- tation of more epigraphic examples, will have to be satisfied before the task of decipherment can advance on a solid basis. The approaches used in this study, re- lying on internal glyphic comparisons and a consider- ation of the context of the inscriptions, yielded re- sults that should serve as building premises for future work. The conclusions arrived at through the use of the comparative and the contextual methods refer to (1) the logosyllabic nature of the script; (2) the struc- ture of the Zapotec calendar, both in terms of its shared features with and distinctive traits from other Mesoamerican calendars; and (3) the historical con- tent of two narrative inscriptions from the ancient city of Monte Alban that date between a.d. 300 and 600. The Logosyllabic Nature of Zapotec Writing Like other Mesoamerican scripts, Zapotec writing is a mixed system with two components that are inex- tricably related: narrative images combined with glyphs that are variously arranged. This mixture is not the result of accretion through time but is an inherent trait of the script from its earliest known manifesta- tions until its last developmental phase before being replaced by Mixtec writing (another mixed script). Although the images might be exclusively semantic, the signary used in the glyphic arrangements appar- ently comprises both semantic and phonetic signs.The two components of the script have a complementary relationship, which varies in complexity depending on the degree of elaboration of narrative programs. The slab in Figure 6.1 illustrates the nature and interplay of both components during the later stage of the Zapotec script (around a.d. 800). Some of the semasiography can be recognized even though the ancient cognitive premises underlying it are unknown. For instance, the composition is divided into two reg- isters and each has two seated individuals confronting each other.The figures are identified by their calendrical 409</page><page sequence="427">names, placed behind and above their heads. The gar- ments indicate that those to the left are females and those to the right are males.The females are accompa- nied by sound scrolls emanating from their mouths. The personages in the lower register have the same garments, postures, hand gestures, and objects in their hands as those in the upper register. The fact that the calendrical names are all different indicates that, de- spite the similarities in clothing, the reliefs depict four different personages. The male in the upper register is further differentiated from the one below by a beard, a pendant, and a nose plug. Biconical braziers appear between the couples, and the one in the lower register has applique decorations. This type of ceramic form and surface treatment are diagnostic of late Monte Alban III b and early Monte Alban IV (cf. Paddock, Mogor, and Lind 1 968: figs. 1 0, 23) . Both braziers have pictographs of flames or smoke, and therefore the rounded objects depicted on them are most probably balls of copal (resin). This identification allows one to assume that balls of copal are also a part of the objects being held by the male figures. The unfolded version of glyph U, a sign pardy derived from an avian image, is shown above the scene in the upper register. An upside-down personage dressed in a jaguar outfit comes out of its jaws. This figure wears a buccal mask, has an earplug, and holds a beaded strand in one hand. The objects being held by the females, though most probably pictographic, can- not be recognized. Other elements like the strand of beads, the leaves attached to the unfolded version of glyph U, and the avian configuration of the latter can be described but their meaning remains indeterminate. Notwithstanding these unsolved questions, an in- terpretation of the semasiography could be that the reliefs in the slab depict married couples. An age dif- ference among the males is hinted by the beard and sumptuary goods on one of them. This detail suggests that the slab is a genealogical register. However, the trace of consanguinial relations is not self-evident, and affinal links might crosscut registers. The pairs are en- gaged in a ritual involving the presentation of offer- ings, one of which is copal. Part of the ceremony is propitiatory and perhaps intended to invoke an ances- tor who, dressed in a jaguar outfit, is coming out of the jaws of the avian image. The latter might represent a portal to the underworld (place of departed souls). This interpretation of the semasiography, although partial or faulty, has been made in a language differ- ent from that of the person who actually carved the slab. It could be phrased or stated in many other ways and languages, including Zapotec. By denoting ideas direcdy, the message conveyed by the images has ulti- mately loose or flexible linguistic referents. The glyphic component in the slab comprises iso- lated signs that give the names of the mortals. Being calendrical appellatives, they are made up of symbols and pictographs. The numeral notations are symbolic because the relationship between a bar and the value 5, or between a dot and the value 1, is arbitrary. As long as these arbitrary conventions are known, these semantic signs can be read in several different lan- guages. The other parts of the calendrical glyphs are pictographic. Inasmuch as these pictographs can be recognized, the names can also be rendered in several languages. Within the system in which the slab was made and used, however, these glyphs had a fixed and specific relationship to units of Zapotec speech, and these units were words. The calendrical names can be transcribed, using the sixteenth-century or- thography of Juan de Cordova, as follows: 9 3 L (Peoloo Cayo) cf ? O (? Loo) 9 10 G (Pillachina Chij) cf 6 N (Qualapiya xopa) How are these specific readings justified? In the process of reconstructing the glyphic day list in Chap- ter 4 it became evident that the pictography of sev- eral calendrical glyphs - some of which are unique to central Oaxaca - corresponds to the meaning of some of the sixteenth-century day names in Zapotec. Such concordance implies that the script is logographic. Furthermore, most of the day glyphs dis- play graphic continuity throughout the entire devel- opment of the script, adding strong support for the assumption that an archaic form of the Zapotec lan- guage is encoded even in the earliest known inscrip- tions. Yet, because the readings presented here are based on a derived and much later version of the ancient language, they are only hypothetical. The pictographs in the Zapotec signary depict ani- mals, plants, body parts, and material culture. In some 410</page><page sequence="428">Fig. 6.1 A slab displaying the complementary relationship between semasiography and glottography in the Zapotec script, Museum of Natural History, New York (cat. no. 30.3/121 1-12) 411 yg r- 1/1 0 12.5 cm Analytical view of slab</page><page sequence="429">contexts, the glyphs themselves are made up of a single entity. In other cases, however, they comprise aggre- gations of iconographic elements, making their pic- tography difficult to establish. Glyph C is the most notorious example of this class. Fewer signs are sym- bolic, depicting supernatural entities or cultural con- structs (Fig. 6.2). When the pictography of a glyph is recognizable and the sign is used as a logograph, eluci- dation of its phonetic value can be approached by searching entries that refer to the pictograph in Zapotec vocabularies. However, the temporal gap between the inscriptions and the earliest vocabulary (Cordova's six- teenth-century Vocabulario) presents an obstacle. There may be cases in which, even if the pictography of a sign is identified, a relevant term for the object or action might not be contained in the vocabulary. Without knowing the underlying cultural conven- tions, the phonetic reading and the meaning of most of the symbolic signs is difficult to establish, as in the case of glyphs W and I. If signs were being used not for their meaning but for their sound value, the eluci- dation of the intended phonetic referent requires knowledge of the modern and ancient languages. The underlying emic knowledge for distinguishing when signs were used in the inscriptions on the basis of their semantic referent and when they were used on the basis of their homophonic value has to be resolved too. The method used in Chapter 5, which focused on epigraphic contexts and patterns, corroborated the logographic nature of the script, specifically in the case of calendrical and personal names. By using the linguistic correspondences established in the recon- struction of the glyphic day list, the "reading" of some noncalendrical nominative compounds in program B from the South Platform s monoliths at Monte Alban yields names that are very similar to personal appellatives known from sixteenth-century documents written in Zapotec but using the European script (Fig. 6.3). At least one of these names could involve the homophonic principle (Fig. 6.4). Although the signs conforming the noncalendrical compound in this name are pictographic (a house or temple and a path- way with footprints), they could have been used be- cause of their sound instead of their meaning. Unless Zapotec inscriptions refer to a limited range of messages, or the information contained therein en- compasses only specific types of themes, a purely logographic system seems unlikely. An exclusively logographic script - something unknown in the his- tory of phonetic writing worldwide - would require a large amount of signs if it were to render a wide range of information. Syllabaries, on the other hand, require fewer than 150 signs to do so (Gelb 1963; Knorozov 1965; Pope 1975; Justeson n.d.).Thus, one would expect a sizeable but finite signary if the Zapotec script combined the use of logographs and syllabic signs. However, there are difficulties in determining the number of signs in the repertoire of the scribes. One is the lack of a large epigraphic corpus. Because the available body of complete texts is limited compared with the number of distinct signs in them, there is litde reason to assume that most of the graphs in the signary appear in the present sample. Another diffi- culty is the prolonged use of the script and its wide geographic distribution, which introduces chronologi- cal and spatial variations. Other sources of variation include the type of calligraphy involved, the use of different instruments and media for writing, and spe- cific compositional and aesthetic requirements of the inscriptions. For example, the epigraphic repetitions attested in program B clearly demonstrate how the same glyphs present differences attributable to addi- tions, deletions, conflations, alterations of configura- tion, substitutions, and inversions (rotation by 90 and 180 degrees). All these factors make it difficult to evaluate accu- rately the range of variability in representing signs and hence to identify different graphs from simple vari- ants of the same glyph. Nevertheless, and without in- cluding the calendrical glyphs, a tentative and conser- vative count of distinct glyphs in the corpus of Monte Alban I and II (as derived from Caso 1947) is some 80 signs. A separate count of noncalendrical glyphs from the two narratives reconstructed in Chapter 5, from the narrative program of tomb 5 at Cerro de la Campana in Suchilquitongo (Urcid 1992), and from other miscellaneous inscriptions that date to Monte Alban Ilia and Illb (Urcid 1995a, 1995b, n.d.h; Urcid, Winter, and Matadamas 1994) yields a signary of at least 60 to 80 graphs. If the coeval calendrical signs in the early and late samples are taken into consideration, the inventory of the script in each of the major de- velopmental phases is slightly more than 100.

Another hint about the logosyllabic nature of the script comes from the way glyphic compounds are formed and the different combinations in which cer- tain glyphs occur (Fig. 6.5). The number of signs that make up compounds and their combinations strongly suggests that their use is based on the acrophonic prin- ciple, in which the sign stands for the stressed syllable of the word that is being denoted, or that the glyphs are used because of an arbitrary association between sign and syllabic units devoid of semantic referents. Many noncalendrical glyphs are compounds whose composition varies from one to four signs. The signs employed in the compounds are used in different com- binations, which is a trait of other known logosyllabic systems like the Maya. In Table 6.1 the relative pro- portions of types of noncalendrical compounds from the narrative programs discussed in Chapter 5 is com- pared with that of Maya compounds in the codical inscriptions. The distribution in both samples is very similar. The relative frequency of monographic signs in the Zapotec sample irrefutably proves that isolated glyphs Fig. 6.5 Glyphic combinations in the Zapotec corpus involving the "Seated Half-body" sign. represent words.The most frequent compounds in both samples are those with two and three signs. In the Maya script, signs containing compounds have been found to denote syllabic sounds (Justeson n.d.: 254-273; Mathews 1984: 311-14; Houston 1989: 38-42). Based on an impressionistic comparison of the con- figuration between Zapotec and Maya glyphs, it ap- pears that the writing system in central Oaxaca relied more on the use of logographs than did the Maya and that syllabic signs were employed less frequendy. In some instances, they could have been used at least as phonetic complements. Although limited use of a syllabary in the Zapotec script cannot be ruled out at present, the absence of full syllabic spellings of root morphemes can be postulated on the basis of the ar- rangement of digraphic and trigraphic compounds. In contrast to the Maya, Zapotec compounds appar- ently do not have a fixed arrangement that allows a consistent separation of roots from affixes. The ab- sence of affixes in specific and recurrent positions has implications about the rules for putting together syl- labic spellings - as in the case of synharmony in Maya writing (Knorozov 1956: 472; 1958: 290). Even if a sporadic use of the syllabic component occurs in Zapotec writing, the paucity of epigraphic data does not permit differentiating roots and affixes in the com- pounds. There is so far no clue about how units of speech smaller than the morphemes, even when used as phonetic complements, could have been used in the Zapotec system. Yet, the currently available pho- nological reconstructions of proto-Zapotec (Swadesh 1947; Fernandez de Miranda 1995) suggest that, if the script involves a syllabary, between 60 and 70 CV signs would have been required to encode the language. Another trait that emerges despite the scanty ma- terial available is the multiple functions of some glyphs (e.g., glyphs I, "Fish," and "Hill") (Fig. 6.6). Different functions depending on the context lead to the possi- bility for polyvalence of signs. The converse situation of allographs is not determinable at this stage. Because tone and glottal stops were features of the ancient lan- guage as they are of all the present-day variants of Zapotec (Swadesh 1947; Fernandez de Miranda 1995), the difficulty of representing them in the script makes use of the homophonic principle not only likely but probably quite recurrent. 416</page><page sequence="434">Table 6.1 Comparison of the Composition of Glyphic Compounds in Maya Codices and in Programs B and A from Monte AlbAn (data on Maya Glyphs after Knorozov 1965: 158) Composition Maya Programs B and A of compound codices from Monte Alban Monographic 2.3% 12.0% Digraphic 29.5% 36.0% Trigraphic 57.3% 36.0% Tetragraphic 10.6% 15.0% Pentagraphic 0.3% 0.0% The reconstruction in Chapter 5 of one narrative composition (program A) disclosed other aspects of Zapotec writing. The occurrence of glyphs in linear arrangements following a standard sequence suggests that the order approximates the syntactical properties of the language. The encoding of speech is then at the phonetic (words and syllables) and morphological levels (grammatical constructions following the word order subject, verb, object). Because not all linear inscrip- tions include all the type positions of the standard se- quence or display variations in the order, it is plausible that the texts are grammatically incomplete. Yet, the variable omission of glyphs in relation to the standard sequence in program A indicates that the deviations are probably dictated by artistic requirements or other nonlinguistic criteria. It also is possible that informa- tion not included in the texts was deducible from the semantic component. On the basis of their apparent context, two types of texts can be distinguished: public and mortuary. In some cases, the functions overlap, because inscriptions of mortuary character occur in public settings (Fig. 6.7). In terms of format, texts were linear, agglutinated, or dispersed (Fig. 6.8). Most of the glyphs in the last two formats can be rearranged to conform to one of the standard sequences of lineal inscriptions. Four main standard sequences have been identified (Fig. 6.9): (a) a linear/dispersed sequence in the Monte Alban II corpus; (b) a linear sequence in the Monte Alban I and Monte Alban II Ia-b corpora (this sequence ends with the "Bag" glyph); (c) a linear sequence in the Monte Alban Illa-b corpus (this sequence ends with the "Fish" glyph); and (d) a linear sequence in the Monte Alban Illb corpus (this sequence involves glyph I). Except for (c), an exception that could be simply the result of incomplete evidence, the year glyph/year bearer is a glyphic compound that consistently occurs in the other standard sequences. In sequences (b) and (d) this sign combination invariably marks the begin- ning of the inscriptions, meaning that annual dates represent the starting point of the texts. The reading order in the various formats can be determined based on this observation. The reading directions are quite varied, with the four basic modes and their combina- tions being represented: top to bottom, bottom to top, left to right, and right to left (Fig. 6.10). For instance, in the case of single vertical texts, the reading order could start at the top or at the bottom. The available examples of double vertical texts are read by columns from top to bottom and left to right or bottom to top and left to right, or top to bottom and right to left. Linear and horizontal texts are read from left to right, right to left, or center to left to right, depending on 417</page><page sequence="435">60 | 2 O % N .s Â£ w) &lt;u â fi o S o â -d Â£ vÂ£&gt; vd E i2 w S 2 3 3 â EE , E C T3 , ^ Â£ CM .s&gt; Â§ &lt;*, Â° Â£ CM S)i o Â« Â« 3? - at % o 5 i 5?

In the case of texts that are not linear, the reading sequence ap- pears rather flexible. As more is learned about stan- dard sequences, the reading orders in agglutinated and dispersed texts will be clarified. The recognition of several formats, standard sequences, and reading or- ders makes previous characterizations of the Zapotec script obsolete. Describing formats that do not follow lineal arrangements as "confused" and "inexact" (Prem 1973: 51-52) reflects an ethnocentric bias. The cur- rent evidence also demonstrates the inadequacy of de- scribing the nature of the script on the basis of few or even single examples. For instance Justeson, while re- ferring to the scanty materials pertaining to the Monte Alban I period, commented, The content of Oaxacan inscriptions was ap- parendy quite limited; it is almost exclusively calendrical, even if the import of the dates is historical. No signs suggesting grammatical markers appear in the texts, so the language is poorly reflected. This would appear to have Key to Fig. 6.10 I. MNA-1 2 CCA-llc-b 3. QUI-1 4. MA-NP-5 5. MA-SP-2 6.

MA-D-142 been a limited purpose writing system with little relation to a spoken language beyond the order of reading; . . . litde phonologization if any need be proposed. (Justeson n.d.: 250- 251) By relying exclusively on the inscription in the murals from tomb 104 at Monte Alban, Clancy con- cluded, Zapotec texts are truly laconic and are often composed in an irregular fashion that makes their reading order and sentence structure a matter of concern. It seems likely that this writing system utilized simple sentences and lists or tallies of things, names, and dates. The message of this writing system, if taken only from the glyphic texts themselves, probably could not approximate everyday speech. (Clancy 1983: 234) The "laconic" nature might be explained in terms of the language's being slightly synthetic, with no par- ticles to articulate the elements of sentences, and based on juxtaposition as a means for relating those elements. Incompleteness, which is a feature of all writing sys- tems (Sampson 1985: 35-38; DeFrancis 1989: 264), also must be considered. Nonlinguistic variables, such as artistic requirements that could even contradict ex- pected linguistic patterns (Justeson n.d.: 21 , 29), should be contemplated. As demonstrated by the study of the monoliths from the South Platform at Monte Alban, and particularly program A, there is no doubt that the "contents of text and image . . . [are] linked in a spe- cial kind of anchored reciprocity" (Clancy 1983: 234), but there is no justification for contending that "there should be less of a distinction between Zapotec image and text than is the case for the Maya" (ibid.). It has been generally assumed that most of the con- tent in linear texts is calendrical (Caso 1928, 1947; Justeson n.d.; Marcus 1983a;Whittaker n.d.;Edmonson 1988). Yet, by determining in Chapter 4 that in the Monte Alban II texts there is no triple calendrical an- chorage for an event (year-"month" or trecena- day), the glyphs accompanied by numbers (except for the year bearers and glyph W) most probably have a nomi- 423</page><page sequence="441">native function - i.e., they refer to names of individu- als. Furthermore, the possibility that the Monte Alban I texts might represent an early version of the stan- dard sequence, beginning with an annual date and ending with the "Bag" glyph, suggests that their con- tent is more than calendrics. Many of the late Zapotec inscriptions are genealogical records and as such could be considered as lists of names. Such records, however, represent only a fraction of a wider range of plausible applications of writing, several of which most prob- ably did not survive in the archaeological record. It was argued that the standard sequence begin- ning with a year date and ending with the "Fish" or the "Bag" glyph closely reflects the syntax of the Zapotec language. This conclusion is derived from contextual epigraphic analysis of nine columnar in- scriptions pertaining to the same narrative program (see Fig. 5.81). As remarked before, this sequence seems to have been used, with expected variations, through- out the entire development of the script. The best- known version of this sequence dates between a.d. 400 and 800. In its most common form it starts with temporals and locatives.The subsequent order includes names of individuals, verbs, and either the "Fish" or the "Bag" glyph. Such order and its variations could reflect the structure of predicate, subject, and object, which is the most common word order in present-day variants of Zapotec. Aside from supporting the assumption that the in- scriptions encode an archaic form of the Zapotec lan- guage, the reconstruction of the glyphic day list has further implications concerning the evolution of the script. The year glyph and most of the day signs show pervasive continuity and conservatism throughout more than 1000 years. Continuities can also be dis- cerned in other signs, including the "Hill" glyph (Fig. 6.11, glyph 115) and the "Seated Half-body" glyph (glyph 128). The paucity of epigraphic data does not allow tracing discontinuities in detail. As Caso sug- gested, apparent omissions could be simply due to lack of evidence. However, considering the present ratio of early (Monte Alban periods I and II) versus late (Monte Alban periods III and IV) glyphs, the relative early abundance of glyphs W and "Cloud-Rain" (glyph 149) compared with their absence in the later corpus suggests that at least these two signs fell into disuse in later stages. Although continuities are obvious, it has also been shown that glyphs present much variability. Writing no doubt was an art, and the scribes, although following certain canons, evidently had much free- dom in terms of glyphic attributes, sign compositions, and glyphic arrangements. Because of the few but variable formats, standard sequences, and reading orders, there are no detectable marked changes through time in these traits. The con- tinuity in the standard sequence "Year date-Bag" glyph has already been mentioned. Also, Whittaker proposed that the standard sequence in the slabs from Building J (Monte Alban period II) conforms to the syntactical order of present-day Zapotec (verb, subject, object). The evolutionary schemes proposed by Prem (1973) and Whittaker (1992, n.d.) cannot be main- tained. The script in Monte Alban periods Ilia and Illb was not a degeneration of its earlier form nor was it dead. During late Monte Alban IHb, texts still dis- played different formats, standard sequences, and read- ing orders. The climax of the script in terms of its complexity cannot be confined to the earlier periods. From the available material, one might propose that the apparent lack of glyphic compounds in the Monte Alban I inscriptions indicates a pervasive use of logographic signs during the early stage of the script and an increased use of syllabic signs through time. A problem that remains to be solved is to account for the differences between the Zapotec and Mixtec scripts, as well as the impact or legacy the former might have had on the latter. Although in the fifteenth-cen- tury codices from the Mixteca Alta no linear arrange- ments of glyphs appear, some early Mixtec inscrip- tions display glyphic sequences (Fig. 6.12; see also Fig. 4.49, no. 3). The differences between the Zapotec and Mixtec systems on the one hand, and the concordance between Zapotec epigraphy and Cordova's linguistic data on the other, imply that despite the well-docu- mented Mixtec control of several Zapotec valley towns and the Mixtec-style codex from which Cordova ob- tained the information on the Sacred Calendar, a strong Zapotec oral tradition was still operative after the re- placement and disappearance of the script. Other evolutionary implications are becoming dis- cernible, particularly with regard to the geographic extent of the script through time and the influence 424</page><page sequence="442">Fig. 6.11 Some continuities and discontinuities of glyphic usages throughout the development of the Zapotec script. 425 Year Glyph 139 Glyph W Glyph 149 Glyph 128 Glyph 115 Glyph (abbreviated (Cloud/Rain) (Seated ("Hill" glyph) glyph U) lower body) MA.

While categories of calendrical glyphs were defined in Chap- ter 4, specific mention was made of the occurrence of Zapotec glyphs in other regions of Oaxaca and in the central highlands of Mesoamerica. In Figure 6.13 the available calendrical evidence from the Mixteca Alta (before the third century a.d.), the Mixteca Baja (between a.d. 500 and 900) and the Mixteca de la Costa (also between a.d. 500 and 900) is summarized. Notwithstanding the gaps and the lack of chrono- logical control, particularly for the epigraphic materi- als from the Mixteca Baja and the Mixteca de la Costa, it can be observed that the glyphs from these major regions of Oaxaca conform to the Zapotec conven- tions. The only exception from the coast is the single occurrence on a carved stone of a "Reptile Eye" glyph (RE) (Fig. 6.13, no. 30). This glyph, unknown in the Zapotec conventions, is frequendy found in the cen- tral highlands of Mesoamerica during the Middle and Late Classic (a.d. 400-800). Although glyphic evidence from the Mixteca Baja in northwestern Oaxaca was briefly mentioned in Chapter 4, 17 of the Zapotec day glyphs (including some variants) have now been identified in the Nuine calendrical system (Urcid n.d.d).The sharing of these glyphic conventions be- tween the two systems is not consistent with the pre- vailing view that the Nuine script and its calendar rep- resent a Mixtec prototype (Moser 1977). Rather, it seems that Nuine writing is a derivative or a regional variant of the Zapotec script (Urcid 1996). Key to Fig. 6.13 1. HAM-4b 21. MFR-906 2. HAM-5b 22. PAC-1 3. HAM-5b 23. GUA-lb 4.

Therefore, the conventions of calendrical and noncalendrical glyphs at Xochicalco, Teotenango, Cacaxtla, Tajin, and Tula should not be traced back only to the Teotihuacan glyphic system (Berlo 1989) but to more ancient roots. External comparisons of Zapotec noncalendrical glyphs with those from other Mesoamerican writing systems will no doubt lead to the identification of many similarities, some of which will disclose more about loans and borrowings. In Figure 6.14 some con- spicuous examples are presented, tracing the widespread distribution of certain glyphs in several scripts. Yet, as demonstrated throughout this study, many identities are purely morphological and do not necessarily im- ply the same semantic or phonetic values. The method of external comparisons to derive those possible val- ues, although undoubtedly useful, should be employed only when internal comparisons fail to give clues. Structure of the Zapotec Calendar The analysis conducted in Chapter 4 validates and further develops a number of conclusions proposed by Alfonso Caso since 1928. The most general one is that the chronological framework in Zapotec inscrip- tions conforms to what is known of the Mesoamerican calendar. There is now irrefutable evidence that, from the earliest inscriptions on, the Zapotecs reckoned the sacred count of 260 days, the solar count of 365 days, and the Calendar Round of 52 years. It is also evident that not all the glyphs accompanied by numbers nec- essarily have a chronological function. In most instances they actually have a nominative role - that is, they give the calendrical names of individuals. Yet, irrespective of their nominative or chronological function, these glyphs reflect direcdy or indirectly the configuration of the Zapotec calendar. By enlarging the previously available epigraphic sample through searches in the literature and in the field, I was able to compile partial or complete in- scriptions that yielded 700 glyphs with coefficients. With these data, I dealt with two main problems: one was the reconstruction of the glyphic day list, includ- ing the position of the year bearers, and the other was the translation, aided in part by epigraphic evidence, of the sixteenth-century Zapotec day names recorded by Friar Juan de Cordova. The large epigraphic sample allowed a formal identification of the attributes de- fining the type categories as well as an appreciation of the range of variation in the glyphs pertaining to each category. These advantages made the modification and expansion of Caso's classificatory scheme necessary. Thirty-nine glyphic categories have been defined so far. Twenty-six of these are designated with letters of the roman alphabet (A to Z, including the Spanish letter N, but excluding the letter W, which is used to designate a sign with a special function). The remain- ing 13 categories are designated with letters of the Greek alphabet (Alpha to Nu).The occurrence of so many categories does not invalidate the initial propo- sition that all the glyphs accompanied by coefficients 1 to 13 are an indirect reflection of the sacred count. Because the structure of this count is based on the existence of only 20 day names (or calendrical glyphs), the additional groups must be variants. This interpre- tation was advanced by Caso and is also a phenom- enon amply documented in the Maya glyphic day list, where day names are represented in the carved monu- ments by as many as three variant forms each and in the codical inscriptions by one or two forms (cf. Kelley 1976: 28, fig. 4). The relative frequency in the repre- sentation of the 39 Zapotec categories separated 20 signs that are more recurrent in the sample from 19 signs that are less frequent. Admittedly, the dividing line is arbitrary, but the separation of exacdy 20 glyphs is significant. The reconstruction of the day list proposed in this study (see Figs. 4.151 and 4.152) takes into account all the available evidence without presenting internal con- tradictions. Of the 20 main signs, 1 1 are correlated on the basis of the concordance between the pictography of the glyphs and the meaning of the Zapotec day names recorded by Cordova (signs V, M, G, Z, A, O, N, J, E, and X). Five glyphs are anchored primarily on the basis of external comparisons with other Mesoamerican calendars, but their linkage is substan- tiated by derivative concepts or metaphorical associa- tions (glyphs F, Y, H,T, and B). One glyph is related on the basis of internal iconographic comparisons (glyph C).The position of the remaining glyphs is then es- 428</page><page sequence="446">429 c'T 8 88 | J + + id J X&lt;+++ + + ^ 11 I i+l|SI+I AA Â® â¢"" Â°&gt; Ss^Â« â¢Â§ â¢Â§ 3 Â« Â§1-3 E Â£ r geocbS-WD Â§â¢ 1 2I |&amp;2 Â§Â§Â«| Â« c E Â£ c geocbS-WD EEcS c o ^ O w c | ^ E -o".E ai o ~ E a&gt; Â© EEcS 9 2 - ^ 2 75 o *= ^ E ^ -o".E o ~ - I il 1 fslilisi * isliifl 5^ -Q 2&lt;i &amp;Eao Â® n Â§.'â¬ O) Â« Â« &lt;oÂ£|mJJ 8"fi $0 Â© Â® &gt;Â£ o~Â§ o a cf Â© Â§ &lt; &lt; o o cq &lt; dq|z Â§|2|2-gm ,7&lt;~?&lt;,7~?A&lt;?c?~??^?Â«8"&lt;o&lt;o&lt;8&lt;o2 2 - Q-l&gt; -o-pi-3 ?Â®Â° 2 Â«j Â© wiooo&lt;ocoÂ©.pÂ©S7oP^Â®iSi2iSi2iSi2-ri-ri^-S-S&lt;Ti &lt;O&lt;O&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;S&lt; oz o'o'o'o | | - Q-l&gt; ?Â®Â° Â§ Â«j o !2 2Â§{SS(8^2SIS:s5oo2oi2Si2S5Jj)oooooio 50505595555355055520030 oz lEFE 8 "â Â§ Â« 2Â§{SS(8^2SIS:s5oo2oi2Si2S5Jj)oooooio PggPgP^^SxIrSwwwwwwOOOOOiS O 12 Â£ c sz 3 a o a T-osjco^mcorx-oocnoi-cNco^mcoh-coooi-cNco^i-mco o &gt;75 &gt;* N.coo&gt;Â©i-CMco^-w&lt;or&lt;.cQO&gt;Â©i-CMco^-m&lt;or*.coo&gt;Oi-cMco 1- 1- 1- T- 1- T- 1- 1- 1- 1- CM CM CM CM CM CM CM .E (jj O 0 CM CM CM CO CO CO CO CO CO CO CO TO CO Tf ^ ^ W lÂ« W W * * * + $ 8 R 3 3 id I H eps-i Â§ | u t S * ^ * * D I iw 61 1 3 5 5 5 3 Â« Â« | g 3 S 8 8 ft 8 8 3 u ! b Â»Â®s Â® Â© llBS^ t " - - -5 8 8 . fc &lt;3 8 8 s 8 -S i e oil e^R â  fl I 8 R 8 8 3 ^ âi Q | |f| Â® &lt;ecd | O ^ in S ^ co a fl cv â - Â£ Â£ g I sg{B^Â§l^l^iii|eegs | lis si i s I E , f i, SÂ§* jl ?! i S IS 2Â§ si 8g Â§5 St SJ Si 52 STj,- SÂ§* SB 25.2 -j?</page><page sequence="447">tablished by triangular arguments that involve, in some cases, external comparisons (glyphs N, D, and P).The possible positions of these latter glyphs is also nar- rowed down by the process of elimination. Regarding variant forms, two are linked on the basis of their function as year bearers (Alpha and U), one is correlated on the basis of linguistic concor- dance (Beta), one on the basis of th e pars pro toto prin- ciple (glyph Delta), six on the basis of external com- parisons with other calendars (I, K, Q, R, Gamma, and Epsilon), and another solely on the basis of internal iconographic comparisons (S). Eight of the variant glyphs (Zeta, Eta,Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Nu) remain to be anchored to their positions in the day list. Although the occurrence of alternative glyphs is beyond dispute, apparendy not all day signs had vari- ant forms. In the Maya list there are six cases of carved calendrical glyphs that do not have attested variants. So far, some day positions in the Zapotec list are oc- cupied by as many as two coeval variants. In contrast, the Maya day list presents in some cases as many as four variants in each position. Such differences be- tween the Zapotec and Maya glyphic day lists stem from the wider range of inscribed media in the Maya script (carved inscriptions and codices). If in the Zapotec list all the day names had at least one coeval alternative variant, it would mean that almost all the calendrical glyphs have been attested in the archaeo- logical record (although more examples are needed to verify the tentative categories Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, and Nu). Concomitant with the epigraphic reconstruction of the day list, it is possible to confirm, clarify, and improve the translations of 16 of Cordova's day names. The translation of three names (lachi, lache, and lape) remains tentative, and the esoteric meaning of two terms (laala and lapa) remains to be established (Table 6.2). The four main signs associated with the year glyph - signs E, G, M, and N - are among the glyphs placed in the day list on the basis of concordance be- tween their meaning and their pictography. Their an- chorage corroborates Caso's proposal that the Zapotec calendar had bearers occupying the 2nd-7th-12th-17th positions and yields a model with which the native computation of time, as recorded in some inscriptions, can be derived. The identification of the seniority of glyph E based on a variant that takes the form of an aged human face (glyph Alpha) implies that the order of the annual markers in the indigenous count of so- lar cycles proceeded in the sequence E -âº M -âº G -âº N-&gt;E-*M-&gt;G-+N... and so on. Because in Zapotec scribal practices the annual dates of the Calendar Round were not anchored to a Long Count system, the inscriptions cannot be dated calendrically. However, in those instances in which self-contained inscriptions include at least two annual dates, and the reading sequence of those dates can be established, the application of the model should give the minimum lapses or intervals recorded by the dates. The seniority of glyph E was established through in- ternal comparisons in Chapter 4, although elucidat- ing its coefficient at the beginning of the Calendar Round (52 years) remained unsolved. Yet, the con- textual epigraphic analysis in Chapter 5 suggests that the Zapotec reckoning could have begun with the year 13 Xoo. The results outlined above have further implica- tions. The structure of the Calendar Round can be illustrated by tabulating its end and beginning (Table 6.3). The matrices in this table list the day names by rows and the 20-day periods (veintenas) by columns. The upper matrix represents the last year of the Cal- endar Round. The last day of the 18th veintena in this year, day 360, was named 13 Xoo (13E).The lower matrix represents the first year of the Calendar Round. The last day of the 18th veintena in this year was named 1 Laa (1M). Because Zapotec time reckoning was done in terms of elapsed time, the date 13 Xoo marks the completion of the 52-year cycle and gives that same name to the following solar year. Hence, the name of the lower matrix is 13 Xoo. The subsequent year (not shown in Table 6.3) would have been named 1 Laa (1M) because that is the name of the 360th day in the year 13 Xoo. If the matrices in Table 6.3 are correct, the beginning of the Sacred Calendar (day 1 Chilla) in the year 13 Xoo coincided or took place on the 19th day of its 7th month. The diachronic reconstruction of the glyphic day list, although partial for the early periods because of the lack of data, makes it clear that 18 of the day glyphs 430</page><page sequence="448">Table 6.2 Status of the Translation of Cordova's Zapotec Day Names Cordova's Approximate Approximate Metaphorical day name meaning in meaning in associations (1886 [1578]) English Spanish 1 Chilla Alligator Lagarto earth ? 2 Laa Lightning Relampago fire 3 Laala/quela /Night Noche owl/night/house 4 Lachi Ballgame ?

The only two signs that, on the basis of present data, appear to have undergone transformations through time are those naming the first day (glyph V) and the 18th day (glyphs P and Q). The persistence of the four year bearers attests for uninterrupted sacred, solar, and Calendar Round reckonings throughout more than 1000 years. Other aspects of the Zapotec calendar are more difficult to deduce from the incomplete evidence. Ethnohistoric documentation makes evident that the Zapotecs kept track of months, naming them accord- ing to agricultural tasks or religious festivities. The analysis of glyph W conducted in Chapter 4 could not invalidate the proposition that this glyph might stand for "month" (Caso 1947; Edmonson 1988) or trecena (Whittaker n.d.) but disclosed that events re- corded in the early inscriptions might not have a triple anchorage in terms of year, month or trecena , and day of occurrence. Although the possibility that events were linked to year/month or year /trecena cannot be ruled out, there are not enough epigraphic examples to test these propositions. If glyph W reflects monthly computations of some kind, its apparent disappearance in the later stage of the script indicates the possibility that in the Monte Alban Ilia and Illb inscriptions months could have been recorded nominally (20 different noncalendrical glyphs) rather than by indicating their position in the solar cycle (one glyph associated with numbers 1-20 431</page><page sequence="449">Table 6.3 End and Beginning of the Zapotec Calendar Round 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 00 Lopa 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 Lape 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 Loo 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 Chilla 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8293 10 4 Laa 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 Laala 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 Lachi 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 Zee 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 Lana 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 China 1 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8293 Lapa 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 Nifa 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 Telia 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 Loo 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 Pija 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 Laa 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 Lache 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 Naa 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 Loo 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 Xoo 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 [l3 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 00 Laala 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 Lachi 7 1 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8293 Zee 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 Lana 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 China 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 Lapa 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 Nifa 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 Telia 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 Loo 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 Pija 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 Laa 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 Lache 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 Naa 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 Loo 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 Xoo 7 1 8293 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 829 Lopa 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 Lape 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 Loo 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 Chilla 11 5 12 6 13 7 O 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 Laa 12 6 13 7 1 8 2 9 3 10 4 11 5 12 6 13 7 fl| 432</page><page sequence="450">or 0-19). If so, the identification of month glyphs and the elucidation of their sequence in the solar count will depend on more epigraphic examples or the avail- ability of some sort of a clue. These two requirements might also shed light on the problem posed by glyph I. The comparative analy- sis of the available sample evinced that, as a glyph with coefficients, it has dual functions. In certain contexts, the sign seems to be a day name, and - following the suggestion of Terrence Kaufman (personal communi- cation, 1993) - has been correlated as a variant of the 16th position in the glyphic day list on the basis of its presumed pictography (conventionalized depiction of the sun) and the meaning of that day name in some Maya calendars. In other instances - mostly in inscrip- tions found in mortuary contexts - glyph I forms part of compounds that apparently record counts of some kind of units, perhaps calendrical in nature. Two Narratives of Power at Monte Alban As demonstrated in Chapter 5, the first step in de- termining the specific content of particular inscrip- tions requires an understanding of their archaeologi- cal context. In the case of carved monuments, the type of stone, its size and form, the way it was carved, its state of preservation, and its multiple physical associa- tions, including architectural, can yield clues to trace their trajectory from the moment the monoliths were quarried to when they finally became part of the ar- chaeological record. The application of such a con- textual method has made it increasingly evident that a substantial number of carved stones found in the cen- tral valleys of Oaxaca to date were originally part of narrative compositions decorating monumental as well as domestic architecture (Figs. 6.15 and 6. 16). Because of subsequent construction projects, many original nar- rative compositions were dismantled and their con- stituent elements were reused as construction mate- rial or set in such a way in certain buildings to repli- cate the cosmological principle of the four directions of the world. Thus, even though the specific content of the inscriptions in these reused monoliths eventu- ally might have become irrelevant, the stones were imbued with a special value. The reuse of carved stones makes it essential to distinguish between monuments being in situ and be- ing in a primary context. Inscribed stones, for example, can be found in place without necessarily implying that they are in an original context. The contextual approach advocated here can yield better results if all the carved examples that formed part of a given com- posite narrative are available. Its successful application also depends on good archaeological data, a condition that in turn entails very specific and detailed excava- tion strategies. The unavailability of these two condi- tions is, by far, the rule rather than the exception. But even in the cases in which the original configuration of programs cannot be accomplished, the contextual approach can be useful in imposing interpretive limi- tations. The two requirements of the contextual approach were satisfactorily fulfilled in the case of one set of carved stones from the South Platform at Monte Alban, allowing the reconstruction of two unrelated narra- tives carved successively on the same monoliths. Be- cause it was determined that the stones were not found in a primary context, there were no means to demon- strate a priori that all the pieces of the narrative pro- grams were available. After their most plausible con- figuration was reconstructed, and while the two pro- grams were analyzed independently, so many physical symmetries and epigraphic patterns were detected that these regularities in themselves constitute an indica- tion that the programs are indeed complete (although in the case of narrative B, portions of some stones and their inscriptions are missing). Even if the programs are not complete, viewing the stones as two separate, self-contained, and unre- lated sets discloses aspects of the script (like the oc- currence of a standard sequence) and of the content of the inscriptions (like the multiple chronological ref- erents associated with a ruler named 13F) that other- wise were not evident. In that respect, the usefulness of the contextual approach and of the specific recon- structions is demonstrated. The results of the analysis indicate that the placement of the corner monoliths did not entail a single use. Rather, the stones had to be traced through a series of multiple and successive events. By recognizing such a long process, the con- tent of the inscriptions acquired a deeper chronologi- 433</page><page sequence="451">*3* H I 3 o &amp; rt U o 0 u 1 3 0 0 u 1 a .3 i 1 â Â§&gt; I? c &lt;u 0 m vo â¢SP LL. 434 '=A. 1 a.

It has also pro- vided unsuspected views of architectural features at Monte Alban. The calendrical notations in program A played an important role in testing the E -âº M -âº G -âº N model of year bearers because of the multiple chronological referents. The results of the test confirmed the long- held view that the content of the inscriptions is pre- eminently historical (in terms of human life span and not of "objective" history). It also placed the narrative in program A within a cultural frame known from other parts of Mesoamerica: the celebration of period endings involving human sacrifice. While the model of year bearers was being tested, a crucial feature of the calendrical system was detected.The Zapotecs used a "binding" glyph (sign E) to denote the end of the 52-year cycle. This glyph lacks the coefficient but sev- eral patterns suggest that its intended value was 13, hence the deduction that the Calendar Round ended each time on a year 13 Xoo. Articulating the interpretive implications of the two consecutive programs (B-A) led to a glimpse of the royal succession at Monte Alban, identifying three of its rulers by their calendrical (and in some instances personal) names. Program B includes the names 13N and 5B associated with paramount individuals, and the iconographic and epigraphic analysis suggests that the narrative program was commissioned by the ruler 5B to legitimize his position and pay homage to his pre- decessor. Program A conspicuously repeats the name 13F, from which it is assumed that such was the name of the paramount personage in the narrative. The iden- tification of rulers, however, posed questions concern- ing the significance of certain toponymic glyphs. The comparative analysis has now widened the repertoire of signs that appear to represent aspects of the land- scape, with a distinction being made between locali- ties on elevated features (the "Hill" glyph) and locali- ties on flat areas (the "E" glyph). The variability of glyphic compounds within the "Hill" sign does not invalidate its previously suggested toponymic value. The variations have been commonly interpreted as the names of places with which a given site interacted (by commerce, political treaties, wars, and conquests). However, the implication of the reconstructed pro- grams from the South Platform, in which two appar- ently successive rulers of Monte Alban appear associ- ated with different "Hill" glyphs, indicates more com- plexity about place names. Although none of the toponymic glyphs in the corpus has been deciphered, several distributional patterns have emerged: (1) the existence of indistinct "Hill" glyphs in many sites (thus a generic meaning and not a specific nominal func- tion appears to be involved) (Fig. 6.17), (2) the pres- ence of different "Hill" and E glyphs in the same site (Fig. 6.18), (3) the appearance of similar "Hill" glyphs in different but neighboring sites (Fig. 5.90), and (4) the presence of identical or similar "Hill" glyphs in widely dispersed sites (Figs. 5.88 and 6.19). These spatial patterns suggest that the "Hill" and E glyphs might designate geographic as well as artificial features, including natural landmarks (hills, caves), setde- ments, subdivisions of settlements (barrios), and spe- cific architectural complexes within sites or wards (pyramids and plazas). Sites that are defined archaeologically as single units were probably emically subdivided, each division with its own name. It is con- ceivable that, depending on the level of interaction being recorded in the inscriptions, certain toponymic glyphs indeed might refer to larger aggregates or clus- ters of sites, but distinguishing representative units from those encompassed by them is currently impossible. Presumably, contextual analyses could help in differ- entiating toponymic glyphs that stand for local place names within a site from those that refer to supralocal place names. However, at site X or site Y, local names might not include the representative toponymic sign. But, at site Y, a single representative toponym for the subdivisions belonging to site X might be given. The fact that in program A the rulers 5B and 13F appear seated over different "Hill" signs indicates that these place names probably make reference to differ- ent sectors of Monte Alban and that the site might not have been referred to by a single name. In contrast, the wide distribution of the "V-shaped" Hill glyph in and around Monte Alban during Monte Alban Illb sug- gests that perhaps the lineages from neighboring sites were making reference to their origin from one of 436</page><page sequence="454">the Monte Alban subdivisions. The similarity between one of the "Hill" signs from program A and two "Hill" glyphs from Dainzu-Macuilxochitl (monoliths that are not coeval) led to the interpretation that one of the captives shown in program A came from that site. The identities noted in Figure 6.19, which involve three different and widely distributed sites, make it impos- sible to establish a point of origin for the place name being recorded on those stones. Also, the significance of such a wide distribution remains unknown. This study detailed a limited set of inscriptions that cover only a small span in the developmental trajec- tory of the script (a.d. 350-550). Their content is lim- ited too. Yet, there is evidence to argue that the Zapotec script had other purposes as well. There are public and mortuary inscriptions, narrating both historical and ritual events.That other uses are not evident most prob- ably is due to differential preservation in the archaeo- logical record. The results from Chapter 5 and from studies of inscriptions found in mortuary contexts (Urcid 1992, 1995a; Urcid and Paddock 1989; Urcid and Winter 1989) conform with the proposition that a relationship exists between logosyllabic scripts and hierarchical societies with unequal access to literacy. In such cases, literacy is associated with high statuses through roles which are directly involved in opera- tion of the control systems.

Literacy in such situations need not be extensive, so economy in the learning process is not crucial. In fact, if an extended period of education is required to master the script, the entry of elite youth into elite positions is slowed. Since elite posi- tions are proportionally few, this retards the over-supply of elite individuals . . .With large numbers of signs and often complex rules for their use, logosyllabic script . . . requires long education, itself necessitating sufficient wealth that the student can be spared more immedi- ately productive activity. (Justeson n.d.: 119 - 120) Although the historical character of Zapotec in- scriptions has been demonstrated, there is no reason to doubt that the script makes reference to other as- pects of the Zapotec worldview. Of particular interest are those related to supernatural beings. Iconographic analysis of certain inscriptions, of ceramic effigy ves- sels, and of ethnohistorical documents, particularly the Relaciones Geogrdjicas , has led to the identification of a multiplicity of gods (Caso andBernal 1952; Boos 1966, 1969;Boos and Shaplin 1969;Alcina Franch 1972;Von Winning 1986). Studies of mortuary practices (Lind and Urcid 1983,Urcid n.d.a,n.d.b,n.d.e) indicate that the Zapotecs venerated their ancestors. Thus, a dis- tinction between ancestors and deities must be made. Accordingly, what have been interpreted as calendrical names of gods in the Relaciones Geogrdjicas are often calendrical names of prominent or deified mortals. Under the assumption that Zapotec "urns" repre- sent deities or god impersonators, Caso and Bernal resorted to the lists of gods recorded by Cordova and by Balsalobre to classify the effigy vessels but had litde success in finding correspondences. Consequendy, their classification of 10 major deity complexes is based fun- damentally on iconographic criteria. In some instances major complexes or specific categories within a com- plex were identified by the calendrical glyphs that ap- pear on the "urns" (Table 6.4). However, the identification of deities is not neces- sarily secure if numerous instances of a given calendrical name are detected in the effigy vessels, even if the time dimension is introduced. The same applies to venerated ancestors.There are, nevertheless, two in- stances in which repetition of the glyphic couplets 2-J and 1-B in paired ceramic vases suggests reference to supernatural beings. Aside from these, the rest of the categories defined by Caso and Bernal are based on single occurrences of calendrical glyphs and their dubious or incorrect identification. There are now more effigy vessels with calendrical glyphs than those used by Caso and Bernal, and the variability of the associated signs does not corroborate their function as names of gods. In the case of "urns" in the eighth group shown in Table 6.4 ("God of the Broad Beak"), two examples interpreted here as embodiments of rulers or as three-dimensional annual dates have dif- ferent coefficients (see Fig. 4.39, nos. 1 and 2). The names of gods contained in the lists of Cordova and of Balsalobre suggest that deities had calendrical appellatives and that they were inextricably related to the calendar. However, the differences between the two lists and the variability in the ceramic effigy vessels do not lead to a straightforward identification of 13 de- ity complexes. Although a clarification of the Zapotec pantheon is beyond the purposes of this summary, the fact that certain glyphs (B, C, D, E, F, J, L, M, N, P?, S, U, V, X) have counterparts in the facial or costume attributes of some "urns" means that epigraphic data can help identify deity complexes associated with the calendar. Even though the problem of determining the calendrical appellatives of deities cannot currendy be solved, the analysis of glyphs has led to the distinc- tion of three different anthropozoomorphic images (Fig. 6.20). The first two correspond to calendrical glyphs M and U, and the third corresponds to the noncalendrical image designated "Xicani". The shape of the buccal appendages distinguishes these images. In glyph M the appendage is short and straight. In glyph U it is downwardly retroflexed and wide. The appendage of the "Xicani" is upwardly retroflexed. The identification of glyph M as Cociyo (God of Lightning and Rain) had already been established by Caso and Bernal (1952). Here it has merely been con- firmed. The recurrent association with mortuary con- texts suggests that glyph U, pardy derived from an avian image, represents a portal to the underworld and, by 440</page><page sequence="458">metonymy, the place of the dead. Hence, it might cor- respond to Cordova s"Dios del Infierno" (Pitao Pezelao, meaning Great Spirit 13 Lord), or to Balsalobre s "Lu- cifer" (Lera Huila). It was argued that the "Xicani" imagery appears to identify individuals that had the power of transforming themselves (a nahuat). Perhaps it might correspond to the god of omens recorded by Cordova and Balsalobre (Pitao Piyzi- Great Spirit ? Serpent, and Lexee). In epigraphic versions of glyphs U and "Xicani," both are frequently represented with an element identical to a numeral bar (see Figs. 4.113 [nos. 3 and 4], 4.150 [nos. 7 and 8]). Because this ele- ment appears on top of the glyphs, it seems unlikely that the bar has a numerical value. The associations of Fig. 6.20 Triad of Zapotec super naturals.

Guidelines for Future Research Given the necessary requirements to achieve the decipherment of a script, it is imperative to augment the epigraphic sample. This can be accomplished by means of surveys in present-day villages, by studies in museums and private collections, and by archaeo- logical excavations. Each one of these strategies has advantages and disadvantages. Excavations present financial and logistic problems; they are also time-consuming. Yet, chronological and contextual controls for the inscriptions can be secured. The re- cording of inscribed examples without archaeological contexts in museums and private collections may be accomplished faster and more economically, but pro- veniences and other important data would be unavail- able. Provided that inscriptions can be roughly seriated, macro-regional surveys will allow deter- mining the maximum geographic extent of the Zapotec script at different times. The generated maps eventually could be corroborated and im- proved with the results of excavations. Although it is difficult to predict where specific cultural deposits could be found, the knowledge of the archaeology of the central valleys of Oaxaca that has been accumulated since the beginning of this century clearly indicates potential contexts in which inscriptions are likely to occur. The search should con- centrate on primary sites and their monumental ar- chitecture, because large buildings were decorated with public inscriptions.Writing in elaborate tombs is more predictable. The location of such mortuary deposits can be established on the basis of certain patterns in the distribution of domestic space and can be cor- roborated, before excavation, by nondestructive remote sensing. Concomitant with the recovery of more epigraphic data, study of the present-day variants of the Zapotec language is necessary to reconstruct the archaic ver- sion encoded in the script (450 B.C. to a.d. 550). The task of reconstructing the language in turn will ben- efit from epigraphic guidelines. Once these two re- quirements are sufficiently fulfilled, the process of decipherment should focus - as in the case of other successfully decoded scripts (Pope 1975) - on personal names of individuals. Many of these names can al- ready be recognized in Zapotec inscriptions, and ethnohistoric documents with long lists of names ex- ist (Whitecotton 1990). Because of the temporal gap between the inscriptions and the ethnohistoric gene- alogies (some of which extend back to the twelfth and even the eleventh century) (Whitecotton 1990: 30, 106), it seems unlikely that specific individuals in both kinds of sources will be identified and recog- nized as being the same. Yet, the examples in the colo- nial documents provide an idea of the types of appellatives that might be expected in the inscriptions. Although there is some documentation on Zapotec place names (De la Fuente 1947; Zuniga 1982; Whitecotton 1990: app. D, tables 2.3 and 4.3), the use of locatives in the process of decipherment presents a different problem. First, published names of setdements in Zapotec are few; second, many present-day loca- tions are officially known only in Nahuad.The distri- bution of the Zapotec language in Pre-Hispanic times shifted by the expansion of Mixtec-speaking popula- tions, meaning that even before the Nahua intrusion and the Spanish contact, many Zapotec names might have been lost. Nevertheless, a profitable approach to the study of Zapotec toponyms should follow the method that has enabled the identification of place names in the Mixtec codices - that is, combining ar- chaeological survey and ethnolinguistic research (Smith 1973a; Jansen 1982; Pohl and Byland 1990). In summary, the comparative and contextual meth- ods yield limited answers for understanding the Zapotec script. Further advances in the study of the writing system are primarily contingent on two ma- jor and parallel developments: gathering of more epi- graphic data and reconstruction of the ancient lan- guage. Ethnographic and ethnohistorical studies should complement these efforts. It is only through such a combined approach that the phonetic aspects of the script might be deciphered. 442</page><page sequence="460">Bibliography Acosta, Jorge R. 1959 Exploraciones arqueologicas en Monte Alban, XVIIIa temporada (1958).

The order in which the materials are discussed in the text is followed, beginning with the year bearers N, M, E, G, Alpha, and U. The day glyphs are listed next in alphabetical order. Special glyphs I and W are not included here because their epigraphic contexts are provided in Figures 4.153, 4.154, 4.162, and 4.164. The identification code for inscriptions consists of the name of the locality from which they come (three letters), in some cases additional proveniences within a site, and a number. The key to the three-letter mne- monics and other locational abbreviations is presented in Appendix 2. The number appearing in parentheses at the end of each entry in this appendix refers to the value of the coefficient accompanying the glyph. In addition, a set of symbols indicates various characteristics of the signs. These are as follows: * incomplete glyph that has been reconstructed; enough of the sign remains to determine its configuration + blurred or eroded glyph that has been reconstituted into its most likely form based on overall resemblance â¼ painted glyph (H) coefficient missing because of breakage (â¦) coefficient that has been reconstructed on the basis of contextual analysis (#) eroded coefficient (*) arrangement of the coefficient has been modified for analytical purposes (O) unattested coefficient that may have existed on an adjacent carved block 471</page><page sequence="489">Year bearers N 1.
