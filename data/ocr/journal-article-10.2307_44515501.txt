<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Hanging Marsyas Reconsidered. A Roman Table Leg, Early Seleukid Art, and the School of Lysippos1 The story of Marsyas is one of the most popular myths of Graeco-Roman antiquity. A multitude of representations from it is trans- mitted in a wide range of artistic media. Not surprisingly, therefore, scholarly attention to the topic over time resulted in an extensive body of literature that deals with the various aspects of the myth and its representation in art. Problems of particular interest and intri- cacy are those of chronology, style, and meaning, but also that of narratival peculiar- ities in the Hellenistic renditions of Marsyas hanging suspended from a tree in preparation for the flaying. In the 1970's, two influential articles by A. H. Borbein and R. Fleischer revived the discussion. One called into ques- tion the traditional succession from the so - called white to the so - called red type. The other connected one of the two types, and the Florence Arrotino, with events in late 3rd century Seleukid history. In 1987, the present author published a study whose main purpose was to broaden the documentary base and to contribute to the intensification of the more strictly art-historical discussion. The results of that study corroborated neither Borbein's nor Fleischer's findings and sparked a good deal of partly aggressive reaction. The latest major addition to the bibliography is the 'proper' publication of H.A. Weis' disserta- tion dating back to the 1970's. It advocates the view that the White and the Red Marsyas do not constitute different types, but are merely different versions of one single artistic conception. Although it was recently said that decades of research did not even lead to so much as the inception of a communis opinio in the case of the Hanging Marsyas (A. Linfert), it seems to me that there is more of it than may immedi- ately be apparent. But doubtless, the differ- ences of opinion in many ways are still vast. More often than not, new monuments are the most effective catalysts for changes in perspec- tive and improving the conditions for consen- sus. A table leg from Lydia challenges the stu- dent of Hellenistic sculpture to reconsider the Marsyas problem, review the current state of the scholarly discussion, and push on toward a reliable chronological placement of the works in question and the mapping of their stylistic environment. I. A TABLE LEG WITH MARSYAS AND THE SCYTHIAN In May 1988, a Turkish farmer working his field in the area of Philadelphia, by the Tmo- los mountain in Lydia, chanced upon a marble object that turned out to be a table leg with figurai decoration (figs. 1 and 2). The man took it home and later sold it to a dealer in Istanbul. After the piece had reached the New York market, it was repossessed by the Ameri- can Turkish Society, which temporarily lent it</page><page sequence="2">90 Hugo Meyer 1-2.

In August of 1994, the exhibit was withdrawn and shipped back to Turkey.2 His arms crossed, Marsyas is hanging from a pine tree. He is looking down at the kneeling Scythian, who is returning his gaze while sharpening his knife on a stone. The Scythian is dressed in an animal skin whose loose rear end he has placed in his mouth. The measure obviously «serves to prevent the skin from slid- ing down and obstructing the torturer's pre- paratory activities. On the ground to the right, a double flute is depicted to indicate the source of the satyr's calamity. Its grim conse- quence is foreshadowed by the fawn skin dan- gling from an offshoot of the pine. Doubtless, it was worn by Marsyas prior to the inception of his ordeal. In the frontal view, the table leg proper, a fluted pillar, is almost completely hidden by the tree and the satyr's suspended figure. The table leg was fractured by the impact of the ploughing farmer's tractor. Break lines are visible in the middle of the pillar and the adja- cent tree trunk (fig. 2), above the satyr's right knee and below his left knee, in both his ank- les, and in that stretch of the second tree trunk corresponding to the legs of the fawn skin pla- ced upon it. There are some minor scratches 3. White-Marsyas group, reconstruction (photo H. Glöckler, Museum für Abgüsse, Munich). 4. Sarcophagus, Vatican, S. d.

The back sections of the Scythian's head and grindstone are only roughed out. This implies that, as is customary with table legs, the group was intended to be viewed frontally. The missing table top was not directly attached to the pil- lar, for there is no hole in its top. The total height of the table leg amounts to 1,195 m.3 The base upon which the group of Marsyas and his torturer is set has an upper and a lower moulding, and stands on four feet that, somewhat sketchily, imitate paws. These char- acteristics, along with the fluted pillar, are also found in other table legs from the same gen- eral area.4 They enhance the elegance of these pieces beyond their Attic counterparts whose non-figural components tend to be clumsier.5 On the basis of the chronology established for the Attic material by Th. Stephanidou - Tiveriou, a mid - second century date can be assumed for the trapezophoron from Philadel- phia.6 This is confirmed by comparisons with sarcophagi (fig. 4). 7 The quality of workman- ship is excellent, especially with regard to the almost complete detachment of the figure of Marsyas from pillar and tree. However, it fails to match the finesse of the very best among the extant table legs with figurai decoration, some of which must be called superb.8 Trapezophora with the hanging Marsyas are not at all uncommon.9 However, this table leg stands out for its combination of the sufferer with his tormentor. The two are connected by eye contact - as are the 'Arrotino' and the White Marsyas in the arrangement recon- structed several years ago from the evidence of Roman copies (fig. 3). 10 The reader will recall that the extant life-size examples of the hang- ing Marsyas can be subdivided into two groups going back to two different originals.11 All of the known life-size copies of the larger group (cf. infra, section VIII, for incremental evidence) were wrought in white marble (hence the 'white type'), whereas the majority of copies in the smaller cluster were executed in red marble (hence the 'red type'). The two types differ in the way the delinquent has been hung up for punishment.12 The red version is more brutal, for prior to his suspension the satyr's wrists were tied together. The pull of the suspended body forced the arms inward behind the satyr's head, with the elbows point- ing forward. Immense pain from distortions in shoulders, muscles, and joints is the instant result (fig. 6). The thorax expands radially, the abdominal muscles vertically, and breathing becomes extremely difficult. The White Mar- syas is a little better off, because his wrists were tied individually (fig. 5). His arms are placed much wider apart than those of the Red Marsyas. Consequently, there is less strain on shoulders, thorax, and belly. In this version the elbows, which unfortunately are not pre- served in any of the large-scale copies, must have been positioned laterally for anatomical reasons. Applying these criteria to the Phila- delphia table leg, it is obvious that the sculptor who carved it was using the white type as his model. Consequently, insofar as typological questions are concerned, it seems reasonable to view the figurai combination of the trapezoph- oron as a corroboration of the reconstruction suggested for the 'Arrotino Group' (fig. 3). Obviously, however, our reconstruction and the configuration in the table leg are not com-</page><page sequence="7">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 95 pletely identical. The dangling satyr is dis- played frontally, whereas the Scythian has been copied with his stance reversed (the Flor- ence Arrotino doubtless being the more faith- ful transmission).13 But all of this makes good sense, given the frontality required by the medium of the table leg. Trapezophora are einansichtig (i.e. supposed to be viewed from one particular vantage point).14 Also, the spa- tial depth that seems to have been an impor- tant element of the the original figure arrange- ment (fig. 3),15 had to be dramatically reduced. With this in mind, the emphasis on the visual contact between victim and torturer makes itself felt more intensely. As I argued in the process of reconstructing the Arrotino Group, there does not seem to be a need for a third figure, i.e. the triumphant Apollo to whose wrath Marsyas owed his sufferings. The Arrotino Group is what is known as a (pOCVTOC- ala, to wit a depiction that left the completion of its narrative context as an exercise to the beholder.16 The notion of the self-contained, yet narrati- vally incomplete, group did not always sit well with posterity. More often than not, later sculptors recounting the adventures of Mar- syas, as for instance on Roman sarcophagi, decided to add figures.17 Sometimes the tor- turer is given an assistant, while in other instances the Muses or Olympos, Marsyas' faithful disciple, form the additional cast. Understandably, however, the most popular expansion is the inclusion of victorious Apollo. But it is surely indicative that the representa- tions of the god chosen in these contexts are extremely heterogeneous.18 Consequently, advo- cating the presence of Apollo in the original group is not an easy task. A. Linfert recently offered a solution that merits closer inspection.19 II. THE STATE OF THE DISCUSSION Linfert bases his deliberations on R. Flei- scher's hypothesis, that Antiochos III may have commemorated his conquest of the usur- per Achaios by erecting a group of sculptures showing the punishment of Marsyas.20 Fleis- cher envisaged this group as consisting of the White or the Red Marsyas, the Scythian, and Apollo (the latter representing the Seleukid dynasty). But according to Linfert, such a vic- tory monument would defeat its purpose: it is «gossipy» («schwatzhaft») and unfocused. On the other hand, one must expect a memorial to a political event to state its message in unam- biguous and conclusive terms: therefore, Apollo and Marsyas, the latter naturally in the red version, (i.e. flayed, and all wounds and blood).21 Thus, the Scythian joins the white type, and this group may be younger than the one commissioned by Antiochos - but then again, maybe not.22 In any case, Linfert assu- res the reader, it is now quite certain (es «ist... sicherer geworden») that the original Red Mar- syas was created soon after 214/213, the date of the defeat and execution of Achaios. I fear that this is a circular argument. To begin with, treating Fleischer's hypothesis as a given clearly means begging the question, which Linfert concedes. Surely, Fleischer's idea has its fascination, but it remains a hypothesis that requires some sort of external corroboration.23 (In theory, that does not nec- essarily have to be a stylistic analysis demon- strating the compatibility of the group's alle- ged components, although it is hard to see how one might get around it.) But since the foundations are admittedly shaky, does it not seem a little daring to put so much stock in the one figure of whose presence we cannot even be sure, i.e. Apollo? And however one interprets the hue of the Red Marsyas - as an 10. The Arrotino. Florence, Uffizi (photo H.

Boehringer, Homer, pl. 22). intensifier to underscore the tension of the suspended body, or as a foreshadowing of the terminal ordeal24 -, he is not all wounds and blood, but still in possession of his skin and body hair. What a flayed body looks like can be seen in Adam Lenckhardťs Marsy as group in Munich (fig. 9). 25 In an article on the Terme Boxer (figs. 27, 28, 43) - a piece that figures prominently in P. H. von Blanckenhagen's essay on the inte- grating beholder26 - W. Geominy and St. Lehmann refer to the reconstruction in fig. 3 as an example of a (paVTOCGÍOC, and thus dis- count Apollo as a member of the original group.27 The principal view of the boxer is defined by asymmetries in the rest of the sta- tue.28 In applying the method that established the favoured view of the Arrotino,29 Geominy and Lehmann examine these asymmetries in detail before evaluating the composition of the figure as a whole. Their results confirm the view30 that the Terme Boxer belongs not to the 1st (or 4th),31 but to the 3rd century B. C. (cf. infra , section v). This is germane to the present query because the boxer and the Arro- tino are similar as regards the firm and precise treatment of the musculature on the trunk of the body, and in the convincing manner the muscles relate to the bone structure under- neath.32 Geominy and Lehmann pertinently compare the composition of the boxer to that of the Drunken Old Woman,33 and that com- parison places the boxer in approximately the mid 3rd century. I shall return to the issue. C. Maderna-Lauter does away with Apollo, but combines the Arrotino, as A. H. Borbein did, with the red type for which she accepts my date of c. 150 B.C.34 Maderna considers the white type to be classistic and datable to the 1st century B.C.,35 the reason being her assessment of the Berlin torso (fig. 7). I am happy to admit that I misjudged that particu- lar piece.36 It does indeed fit within the ambi- ence of the Sperlonga groups (Maderna after Hofter, cf. infra), not to the Gallienic period.37 However, it is worth specifying what led me astray (apart from the frontality of the piece, the incisions in the pectorals, and the rendition of the pubic hair).38 It is basically what Maderna refers to as the 'implanted abdominal shield' («wie eingesetzt wirkende Bauch- platte) » , i.e. the central area of the front of the torso that does not fully blend in with its sur- roundings. Maderna interprets this as a classi- 12. The Arrotino (photo DAIRom 78.2178).</page><page sequence="9">The hanging Marsyas reconsidered 97 cizing trait and refers to the Laokoon.39 But there is a striking amount of symmetry in the torso: cf. the grooves in the thighs, the shape of the pubic hair, the veins by the iliac crests, the sides of the abdominal shield, the rim of the rib cage, etc. None of this is paralleled in the Laokoon at all. It thus becomes obvious that the Berlin Marsyas is a conflation of the red and the white types.40 In the abdominal region, and also in the width of the chest, the characteristics of the red type prevail (fig. 6). Although it doubtless is an interesting and exceedingly well-wrought piece, the Berlin torso is only of limited value for the recon- struction of the original.41 Conflations similar to the Berlin piece, but mostly on a much smaller scale, induced H. A. Weis to adhere to an older notion, that there was only one Marsyas type.42 Weis places the red version in the late Hellenistic period. More precisely, she initially used a poem in the Anthologia Palatina to suggest ca. 90 B. C. as a terminus ante quem ,43 but subsequently argued for a date after 82 B. C. (Sulla's return to Italy).44 She originally called the white type Hadrianic, but now believes it to be a mid 1st century A. D. invention.45 In her view, the Arrotino goes with the latter. However, Weis assumes that both versions were created along with an Apollo and a Scythian.46 Weis deduced the date for the white version of the Marsyas from the date of its earliest copies. If there were indeed only one type, that would probably be a viable method. But the differences between red and white - strin- gently derived from the different modes of suspension47 - are too decisive to permit such a conclusion. Therefore, with the Berlin torso in its proper place, the Istanbul Marsyas resu- mes its position as the most faithful copy of the white type (fig. 8). It is free again to join the Arrotino in the 3rd century. (B. S. Ridg- way, who like Weis seems to conceive of one single type in two versions, declares that she «might accept a third-century date», but does not indicate which version she believes to be earlier.48 R. R. R. Smith speaks of two 'edi- tions' of the Marsyas, combines the white one with the Scythian, and suggests a date of 250- 200 B. C.).49 III. A RECENT NEW INTERPRETATION OF THE ARROTINO GROUP On the occasion of the Munich Lenckhardt- exhibition, R. Wünsche reconstructed a late 3rd century group (on the date cf. infra) that consists of the White Marsyas, the Arrotino, and a seated Apollo.50 The latter is included because of his important role in the Marsyas myth, but also because the god would provide a 'welcome counterweight' to the crouching Scythian. Wünsche places Marsyas - in the original a bronze figure suspended from a nat- ural tree51 - in the center, and the Arrotino on the left. As an onlooker, Apollo appears seated in the foreground to the right: what the god sees corresponds to the reconstruction in fig. 2. 52 Wünsche admits that in the body of mon- uments at our disposal there is no seated Apollo that could be grouped with the White Marsyas and the Arrotino with any degree of certainty.53 Wünsche's contribution contains a detailed new interpretation of the Arrotino as an artis- tic conception (fig. 10). The trunk of the body and the limbs are pertinently viewed as co- ordinated in such a way as to form a closed composition, from which the head breaks away by virtue of its forced upward turn. Wünsche disputes the interpretation according to which the tormentor - for a fleeting 13. Menander, Venice (photo H.

Dying Gaul, Capitoline Museum (after cast in Salzburg, Archäologisches Institut). moment, and probably in reaction to a groan or cry issued by Marsyas - interrupts his pre- paratory activities which, however, he will presently resume without compassion.54 In Wünsche's opinion, this reading cannot be correct because it overlooks that the Arrotino is a figure in motion. The Scythian is crouching with his left foot flat on the ground and turned outward. His right foot rests on its ball and toes but sup- ports the weight of his body with its heel.55 Doubtless, this allows the Arrotino to swivel around on his ankles. In Wünsche's view, this capability of pivot- ing within a certain perimeter is crucial for the Arrotino's ability to do his job. Keep in mind that he is not in a position to move his arms: «His right arm is resting firmly on the outer part of the right thigh, the left arm is pressing against the forcefully bent left leg. The right hand clutches the knife, while the fingers of the left hand are pressing the blade onto the whetstone [sic!, «Wetzstein»]. Given the position of arms and hands, sharpening by means of moving of the arms is impossible without one of the hands loosing the necessary contact with the knife. But the Scythian does 16.

White-Marsyas, Louvre MA 542 (Museum photo). not have to move his arms: the motion that produces the sharpening is carried out by the whole body in that it swings like a pendu- lum».56 This technique, Wünsche explains, permits the Arrotino to work like a machine. He does no longer have to check what he is doing, and thus is free to look around and possibly have a chat with his employer (who, in this case, would be Apollo).57 Wünsche conjectures that for this fascinatingly realistic rendition of the figure which is about to flay Marsyas, its unknown creator drew his inspi- ration from the work practice of itinerant cut- lery grinders .58 I must admit not knowing how well we are informed about the working habits of the ancient knife grinders. It seems to me, however, that Wünsche's explanation of the Arrotino does not apply anyway. There are basically two ways of sharpening a knife: whetting, and grinding (in Italian: affilare , and arrotare ; in German: wetzen , and schleifen ). Whetting is car- ried out by linear, grinding by circular move- ment, whether the grindstone is rotating or the blade is moved around in circles. If the latter technique is employed, the hand not holding the hilt is used to apply the blade to the grind- stone. That is what the Scythian is doing; and his Italian and German noms de guerre (l'arro- tino, der Schleifer) take that into account. If the figure is imagined in action, he surely swivels a little, but only so much as is needed to make the blade move around in narrow circles.59 But why is the Arrotino grinding his knife and not whetting it? In barber shops one used to see long straps . of thick leather, that were attached to the wall by their upper end. By pulling such a strap tight by its lower end, the barber could employ it to sharpen his razor. The technique applied in this process is a kind of grinding, for the edge is sharpened by upward and downward strokes of the flat blade. Razor blades are extremely thin, and grinding in general produces thinner blades than whetting. The Arrotino knows that and is also aware that a thin and fast-cutting blade will do him good service during his grisly assignment. That surely is a realistic, even eery detail in a situation already ghastly enough. Nothing in the Arrotino indicates that he is talking to Apollo 60 whose presence, con- sequently, remains purely hypothetical. As far as the date of the Arrotino group is concerned, Wünsche adopts Fleischer's inter-</page><page sequence="13">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 101 pretation of the monument as being commem- orative of the victory of Antiochos III over the usurper Achaios.61 Although he is aware that the argument runs the risk of becoming circu- lar, Wünsche believes the metaphorical read- ing to clinch the date reliably - more reliably than the portraits of Antiochos III (figs. 14, 19) and the head of the Dying Gaul (figs. 15, 16), which Wünsche had previously contended compared perfectly to the head of the Arrotino (figs. 12, 18).62 It is somewhat difficult to use the Louvre Antiochos as a comparison to establish late 3rd century dates, since the cor- rectness of the identification has been repeat- edly questioned of late.63 But certain similar- ities between it and the Arrotino do exist in the profile views, and - along with Antiochos' coins 64 - that should furnish an argument for keeping the Louvre head in the 3rd century. More precisely, both heads have slanted brows, curved noses, and emphasized cheek- bones. However, the Antiochos is more frontal than the Arrotino, whose facial elements are gradually receding into the depth of the head. The Arrotino's more 'tectonic' nature is clearly discernible in the frontal view as well. Also, its fleshiness, as well as the mobility of its skin and flesh differ greatly from the Anti- ochos. By the same token, there is little that the Scythian and the Dying Gaul have in com- mon. The Gaul's face is much less differen- tiated; the muscles and skin on his forehead are tighter and much less mobile. Rather, the Arrotino is closer to heads like the Getty Bear- ded Original, the Menander, and the portrait of Homer in the Apollonios type: all of these are considerably earlier (cf. infra, section IV). It follows that Fleischer's Achaios-hypothesis remains Wünsche's sole basis for dating the Arrotino group to the late 3rd century. The argument is, indeed, circular. With regard to the Red Marsyas, Wünsche considers as possible its creation within the time span ranging from the mid-2nd century B. C. to the early empire.65 In his view, the red type is Roman, not Greek, and Wünsche believes that its intensified display of pain reflects the abysmal side of the Roman soul: it was the same deficiency of the Roman charac- ter that urged both commoners and gentry to indulge in the bloodthirsty re-enactments of Greek myths, which Martial and others record in the amphitheater.66 Prisoners had to assume the roles of Orpheus, Ikaros, and other suffer- 23.

The figure of the hanging Marsyas was doubtless the most popular and certainly the only one capable of standing in for the whole sequence of events that led to the satyr's grim end.68 In Wünsche's opinion, however, an aesthetic of the gruesome («Greuelästhetik»),69 which also permits one to categorize as Roman the Laokoon and the Sperlonga groups, is responsible for the selection.70 - Alternative models of explanation are available.71 IV. «SCHULMEINUNG» AND TYPOLOGICAL METHOD Somewhat clamorously, M. Hofter aired his opinion 72 that the Red Marsyas was created around or soon after 150; that the white type 26 . Dying Gaul (detail), Capitoline Museum (photo Alinari, no. 5997). 27. Boxer Rome, Museo Nazionale Romano (photo H. Glöckler after cast in Munich, Museum für Abgüsse).</page><page sequence="15">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 103 is older than the red one; that the Istanbul White Marsyas (fig. 8) - not the Berlin copy (fig. 7) 73 - constitutes the most reliable trans- mission of its type; that the White Marsyas belongs with the Arrotino, and, further, that both of them date to the 3rd century. The rea- der will not be surprised to find me in agree- ment. But whereas in my opinion a date of ca. 280/270 B. C. seemed plausible, Hofter attrib- utes the Arrotino Group (along with an Apollo?)74 to the late 3rd century. He is aware that the date I proposed was assumed also by Amelung and Lippold.75 But that was decades ago, and today we know better («man ist sich einig»). Consequently, Hofter is shocked to find someone reconsidering such an obsolete position.76 (However, it may be remarked in passing that this outdated view was shared as recently as 1972 by D. Pinkwart,77 while K. Schefold in 1981 dated the Arrotino group to ca. 250). 78 The impression imposing itself here of a somewhat ingenuous faith in academic pro- gress is not the result of casual wording. Hof- ter believes in «Schulmeinung»79 (i.e. sets of opinions cherished by particular schools of thought), and therefore has a clear sense of what is permissible, and what is not. To put the Terme Boxer in the 3rd century is not, end of discussion.80 Asymmetries in sculpture do not determine preferred views, plain and simple.81 And if someone contends against an authority sanctified by «Schulmeinung», that for instance the Gabii Artemis is to be looked at from more than one vantage point, it is cer- tainly within reason to call that person a liar.82 Happily, the Terme Boxer did find its way back into the 3rd century. Equally happily, the Giza Gaul (fig. 20) - whom the contemporar- ies of Amelung and Lippold dated early but later generations have moved down to the late 3rd and 2nd centuries - was recently and com- pellingly returned to its proper date of ca. 270 B. C.83 For good measure, the example of the Berlin praying youth may be added.84 Each of these cases inspires confidence in the 28. Terme Boxer (photo G.

The Arrotino (after photo in Munich, Archäologisches Institut). time-tested methods of properly conducted art history - i.e. that kind of art history, which grants a basic power of control over what we are doing to the only kind of primary evidence we possess: the works of art themselves. No scholarly opinion on them can reasonably be dismissed or accepted on the basis of age or newness, and iurare in verba magistři (or by the biases of Zeitgeist) is not a scientific method.85 It comes with the territory of Hofter's «Schulmeinung» that his perception of develop- ment in art is strictly linear. The key to it all is typology («Bildung typologischer Reihen»),86 and Hofter privileges his readers with a page- and-a-half account of the 'true story' of Hel- lenistic sculpture 87 (which, owing to the employed jargon, is difficult to follow).88 There may remain a few rough spots, as for instance the portrait of Antisthenes, that some date to ca. 340, others to around 170 B. C.89 But not to worry, since, according to Hofter, the Antisthenes is closely related to the White Marsyas and furnishes additional proof that the latter goes with the Arrotino.90 The por- trait of Attalos I and a Pergamene head of Herakles in Berlin (no. 1675) are another case in point.91 Hofter assures the reader that both these works belong in the decade preceding the Great Altar. But, as regards the Attalos, this seems as problematic as a recent attempt to redub the head 'Seleukos Nikator'.92 Luck- ily, Hofter can point to a Bonn dissertation that presumably settles the matter.93 «Schul- meinung» is self-referential.94 Hofter contends that I am inserting the Arrotino and the White Marsyas in the tradi- tion of late Classical and early Hellenistic por- traits of intellectuals.95 This is viewed as a vio- lation of method, since 'wild heads' must be compared only with other 'wild heads,' etc. But I never presumed to apply the typological method. Nobody will doubt the importance of typological criteria, but they do have their pit- falls. As J.J. Pollitt observed,96 Krahmer's tri- partite system of Hellenistic composition is a case in point: its categories serve to screen the monuments, which in turn confirm the catego- ries and the system. (We should probably remind ourselves from time to time that Krah- mer's system was not developed indepen- dently, but is rather an adaptation of some of Wölfflins « Grundbegriffe » [«principles of art history»].) Thus the common usage e.g. of the term 'baroque' as characterizing a period style originating around 230 B. C., and petering out toward the middle of the 2nd century, is dubi- ous at best.97 By the same token, renascences of hairstyles are a well - known phenomenon - and that not only in the Hadrianic and early Antonine periods.98 A good example is the portrait of Diophantos from the chapel dedi- cated by Mithridates on Delos.99 It has been used to date «Poulsen's Vergil» (a.k.a. «Hau- smann's Theokritos»)100 to the time of the Delian chapel. However, the similarities between the two heads do not extend beyond the fringe of hair along the forehead.101 But in this instance one might just as well refer to the portrait of Seleukos I from Herculaneum102 - and this comparison has the advantage of applying likewise to the face. Like others in the late Hellenistic period, Diophantos seems to have had a predilection for 3rd-century hairstyles. I shall return to the issue in a sep- arate article. There is no alternative to criticism of style.103 Style is pervasive, and therefore can be used as a parameter in an environment replete with change. But to be given function- ality, it requires precise definition. The fewer the criteria needed to determine what is meant by 'style,' the better the chances of arriving at</page><page sequence="17">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 105 unambiguous conclusions. (This also seems important because subjectivity can never be completely eliminated from stylistic judg- ments). The 'style' of a piece of sculpture can be defined in terms of its 'plasticity.' The major- ity of Greek statues are anthropomorphic. In this context, the question of plasticity deter- mines how the sculptor went about convincing us that, indeed, we are looking at a human, or manlike, figure; how he dealt with and differ- entiated the various types of matter of which, for instance, a face consists-like skin, muscles, and bone. It will be obvious, that one of the limitations of the typological method - namely that 'wild' can be compared only with 'wild,' 'calm' only with 'calm,' but not hero with athlete or poet with satyr, etc. - can be dispensed with at once.104 The whole range of precisely as well as approximately dated monuments - Great Gauls and Epicureans, Hellenistic kings and Pergamene giants - can now be brought into play. Furthermore, the stylistic method, by and large, is capable of functioning indepen- dently of any model of artistic development and its alleged inherent logic. It 'statically' describes change, in that it takes a 'Zenonian' approach to artistic production as unfolding over time.105 That is to say that it captures evolution while allowing for the simultaneous existence of (potentially radically) different styles. Therefore, comparisons should be made and clusters formed primarily on the basis of the plasticity , not the typology, of the compa- randa. But on a secondary plane, and espe- cially within comparative clusters, there is ample room for developmental sequencing and typological considerations (let alone much broader considerations that might develop from there). V. THE ARROTINO GROUP AND STYLISTICALLY RELATED WORKS These clarifications should help to establish the desirable distance between the approach here pursued and the typological method - which Hofter, incidentally, calls antiquated («altmodisch»).106 It will now be easier to see the stylistic similarities upon which, more than anything else, I based my date for the Arro- tino group of ca. 280/270 B. C. When juxta- posed, the head of Menander 107 - here shown in the best of the extant copies, the one in Venice (fig. 13, 17) -, and that of the Arrotino 31. As fig. 27. display a number of similarities. In both heads, the bone structure reveals itself in the chin-and-jowl zone, the cheekbones, and the lateral sections of the eyebrows. In between, the impression of saggy flesh, covered by wil- ted skin, dominates. The strands of hair on top of the heads are characterized as thinning and lying loosely atop the thin layer of skin attached to the skull. An even closer comparison is provided by the portrait of Homer in the Apollonios type.108 The latter is almost unanimously accepted as a creation of ca. 300-270 B. C.109 Its most reliable copies are in the Capitoline Museum (Stanza dei Filosofi, no. 79) and Naples (inv. no. 6140) (figs. 11, 21). 110 In terms of their quality of workmanship as cop- ies, the Capitoline Homer and the Arrotino (are both Hadrianic), are remarkably similar (figs. 11, 21). There is the same relationship between firm points (chin, cheekbones, outer ends of eyebrows) and saggy areas. But in addition to that, the bulging lower brow with the divide above the nose, the rippled upper forehead, and the curliness of the unstable strands of hair are directly comparable. Natu- rally, the proportions of the Arrotino's face are</page><page sequence="18">106 Hugo Meyer 32. Antiochos I Soter, Naples (photo DAIRom 85.955). 33. Alexander Rondanini, Munich (photo H. Koppermann). less even than those of Homer's portrait. But that is because he had to be characterized as churlish. (The flattening of the forehead is employed for the same purpose (fig. 18): it is likewise found in the Giza Gaul [fig. 20].) However, on the whole the two images are strikingly close. In a short note entitled «On Seleukid Art», G. Lippold referred to the head of a centaur from the coffered ceiling of the Belevi mauso- leum (fig. 23) and declared that, stylistically, it closely resembled the head of the White Mar- syas (fig. 22).111 Although the figurai style of the Belevi reliefs is angular, clumsy, and somewhat sketchy,112 it is clear what Lippold had in mind: the bony eyebrows and cheek- bones, and the saggy flesh of the cheeks (but maybe also the bristling head of hair and the general appearance of the beard). As to the date of the mausoleum, the tendency to attrib- ute it to the 2nd decade of the 3rd century B. C. has gained momentum.113 Hofter's remark that some of the Lapith heads from the same context exhibit a resemblance to the por- trait of Menander is in keeping with that.114 The warrior on slab East II115 has on his fore- head bulges on either side of the vertical fur- rows above the nose (fig. 25). Above those bulges, the brow is traversed by a horizontal groove. That compares well to the same sec- tion in the poet's portrait (fig. 13). But the White Marsyas also is very similar, perhaps more intensely so - as is the Amman Daidalos (fig. 24) whose original Lippold placed chron- ologically contemporary with the Arrotino Group.116 A better comparison than the Belevi centaur is once again provided by the Apollonios- Homer (figs. 11, 21). Surely, its brow is less forcefully knitted. But that is a typological dif- ference, as is the greater compression of the satyr's facial features. Apart from that, how- ever, the similarities abound. There is the same kind of relationship between the bone of the forehead and the mobile flesh and skin upon it; between the firm cheekbones and the saggy tissue of the cheeks; between the cheeks as well as the lower lips, and the beard that is growing out of them; and finally between the beards of the poet and the beast: both of them are characterized by a similar kind of layering and tuftiness. Rather than being on the wane, the evidence in favour of an early date for the Arrotino</page><page sequence="19">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 107 Group seems to be gaining strength. But it may be worth our while to play devil's advo- cate and ask if there is anything that would recommend a late 3rd-century date. Clearly, there is nothing compelling in the heads of the known components of the Great Attalid Dedi- cation. Of these, only the Dying Gaul (figs. 15, 16) and the head type Vatican-Terme 117 have faces that are sufficiently structured to warrant comparison with the Arrotino (fig. 12) or the White Marsyas (fig. 22).118 In both cases, however, the physiognomical differenti- ation affects only the exterior of the heads. On the other hand, the heads from the Arrotino Group convey a clear sense of anatomical depth. The head of the Florence Guerriero Ferito - whose original can be dated to ca. 230/220 B. C., thanks to its similarity to the Barberini Faun - shows strong ethnic traits.119 So does the Arrotino. However, stylistically the two heads do not match: the Guerriero's skull is bonier, his flesh firmer, and the face as a whole much more compact. The moulding of the front of the trunks of their bodies suggests that the Terme Boxer and the Dying Gaul must not be too widely separated (figs. 26, 27). However, the Gaul is remarkably flat and on his sides does not pos- sess a lot of detailed musculature.120 But the boxer does, and so does the Arrotino (figs. 28, 29). With regard to facial detail, there is also less of a difference between the latter two than between either of them and the Capitoline Gaul (figs. 30, 31). Surely, the Terme Boxer, owing to its reliance on an older athlete schema (or general type; cf. the 4th-century bronze head from Olympia),121 is typologically very different from the Arrotino. But there are sty- listic commonalities. In both heads, the firm points of the cheekbones contrast with the limp flesh of the cheeks. Also, there is an undeniable resemblence in the general area comprising the eyes and the lower brow - cf. especially the curved eyebrows and the high orbitais. On the whole, however, the head of the boxer is firmed up, appears to be harder, while the surface of the Arrotino is character- ized by a mobility that is also typical of the portrait of Homer in the Apollonios type (figs. 11, 21) (and still lingers on in the Getty Bear- ded Original, which is datable to ca. 250 B. C.).122 Once again, the case for the early date of the Arrotino group appears solidified. 34. As fig. 32 (photo DAIRom 85.957). 35. Seleukos I, Naples (bronze) (photo H.

Berenike II, Alexandria (photo H. Johannes, DAI Cairo). (The Terme Boxer, and with it the Drunken Old Woman,123 are to be placed in between the Arrotino Group and the Great Gauls).124 There is more to be said, but for the continua- tion of this discussion a small digression will prove beneficial. VI. THE ARROTINO GROUP AS A VICTORY MONUMENT The 270's were the formative period in the establishment of a new Greek «Feindbild» (a generic representation of the enemy) to replace that of the Persians.125 In the aftermath of the incorporation of Persia into Alexander's empire, the old enemy ideal had become obso- lete. In the wake of the Celtic incursions from 280/279 on into Macedonian Greece and Asia Minor, it was replaced by the image of the fierce and barbarous Gaul. Stereotype and reality often jarred considerably. The kings of Bithynia and Pontus availed themselves of Gaulish military services, and compensated their symmachoi by lands for settlement, which became Galatia.126 In the 260's, Antiochos I attacked and routed the Galatians, and had himself glorified by the Greek communities as Saviour of the Hellenes. Following that, the Galatians were for decades a major pillar of Seleukid rule in Asia. There is a general inclination to interpret the Arrotino Group as a victory monument (fig. 3). Is it conceivable that it celebrated a defeat of Galatians? Lippold thought that it might allude to the salvation of Kelainai from a Gaulish attack.127 Marsyas, the river god, was said to have saved his compatriots for whom it was customary to revere the satyr's hide as a sacred relic. Understandibly, positive feedback to Lip- pold's hypothesis was limited. After all, the flaying of Marsyas is the theme of the group. But what if Marsyas, the delinquent, was sup- posed to stand for the Celtic perpetrators? The Gauls had offended Apollo not only at Delphi, but also at Myrina and Didyma. Part of the territory of Galatia had been carved out of old Phrygia, the homeland of Marsyas.128 Along these lines, the defeat and punishment of the satyr could be understood metaphorically as the conquest of the new enemy par excellence , the Galatians. The latter had a reputation for being cruel, but the Greeks themselves were</page><page sequence="21">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 109 not thoroughly high-minded when dealing with that particular kind of foe: Ptolemy II apparently had the 4,000 insurgent Gauls, to whose defeat the Giza head (fig. 20) testifies, burnt alive on an island in the Nile.129 So, from that point of view, too, the flaying of Marsyas would not seem inappropriate for the commemoration of a victory over Gauls. And one certainly must not underestimate the immensity of the shock to the Greek world that just when the whole oikoumene was suc- cumbing to Hellenization, the borders of the mother country were proved not to be safe anymore.130 Greek pride must have been ter- ribly hurt. The art-historical legend that among the Hellenistic depictions of Gauls those attribut- able to the Great Attalid Dedication take precedence over anything Alexandrian131 was dispelled by the indisputable redating of the Giza Gaul to the early 3rd century. Does that mean that Alexandria can claim priority? There is a good deal of information regarding monuments commemorating the conquest of Celtic armies. The Athenians celebrated their role in the defense of the Thermopylai (279 B. C.) with a painting by Kallippos which was set up in the bouleuterion .132 The Aitolians - after the liberation of Delphi in the winter of 279/278 - dedicated a sculpture group at the sanctuary, which showed Aitolia seated on a pile of Gaulish arms and armour and sur- rounded by Apollo (twice), Artemis, Athena, and the commanders of the Aitolian league.133 In 274, Pyrrhos had the Celtic shields cap- tured on the occasion of the defeat of Antigo- nos Gonatas put up in the temple of Athena Itonia,134 etc. But other than the votive relief from Kyzikos, datable to 278/277 B. C.,135 there is no indication that it was popular to erect images of the vanquished.136 However, the extant record is likely to be incomplete and, therefore, slanted. Anyway, it will not be too far - fetched to say that the head of the Arrotino (figs. 12, 18, 30), in spite of his being a Scythian, features some unmistakably Gaulish traits. The massive chin and cheek- bones, and the bony lower jaw, recur in the head of the Guerriero Ferito and some of the looters in the frieze from Civitalba.137 Also, tufts of down, rather than developed beards, are not uncommon in depictions of Celts.138 Therefore, the Arrotino might be viewed as testimony to attempts after 279 at detailed 38. As fig. 33. 39. As fig. 32 (photo DAIRom 85.959).</page><page sequence="22">110 Hugo Meyer 40. Albright-Knox «Seated Poet». Buffalo, Charles W. Goodyear Fund, 1936 (Museum photo). visualization of the new enemy ideal in areas outside Egypt. If the Arrotino Group were a monument to a victory not over Gauls in the general sense, but specifically over Galatians, it would prob- ably be easiest to imagine that it was created at the instigation of, or in honour of, Anti- ochos I Soter. The king had encountered Tolistoagians, Trokmers, and Tektosagians in battle during the years 277 to 275 B. C.139 At the time, the Gauls were fighting as symma- choi of Nikomedes I of Bithynia and the Northern League who were both opposing Seleukid aspirations to domination of Asia Minor. The First Syrian War afforded the league some respite, but from 270 on Anti- ochos resumed the struggle, this time focusing his attention on the Galatians. The latter had apparently taken possession of their Phrygian territory during the hiatus of the Syrian war.140 The Seleukid routed them with an army supported by elephants, presumably in 268. A multitude of honorific cults were ini- tiated, and the Ionian cities hailed Antiochos as their saviour. It is tempting to picture the origin of the Arrotino group amid these events. Theoretically, it would also be possible to think of Philetairos, Lord of Pergamon, as the one who commissioned the Arrotino group.141 He had come to the aid of Kyzikos, when the town was under siege by the Gauls.142 A well- known epigram found in Delos praises him as a source of inspiration for poets and sculptors alike, and specific reference is made to the fact that he expelled the Galatians from his fief- dom, i.e. from Mysia.143 But the war during which that happened was Antiochos' Galatian campaign of 270-268 B. C.144 It is more likely, therefore, that the Arrotino Group celebrated the king's achievements, not those of his satrap. It appears possible to muster additional support for this view. VII. SELEUKID ROYAL IMAGERY AND THE DATE OF THE ARROTINO GROUP The bronze bust of a chubby - faced, middle - aged king from the Villa of the Papyri (figs. 32, 34, 39; Naples, MN 5596) has been identi- 41. As fig. 33.</page><page sequence="23">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 111 42. The Arrotino; as fig. 10. fied with a whole range of Hellenistic rulers over the years. However, there is a clear pref- erence for the early Seleukids. More specifi- cally, the names of Antiochos I Soter (280-261 B. C.) and Antiochos II Theos (261-246 B. C.) have been brought up several times.145 E. Bus- chor dated the original to the 2nd quarter of the 3rd century.146 L. Laurenzi, following E. Pfuhl, pointed out that the head's stylistic characteristics do not differ profoundly from those of the portrait of Seleukos I Nikator, also in Naples (fig. 3 5). 147 The liveliness and volume of the tufts of hair above the forehead doubtless are similar,148 but the resemblance between the two hairstyles is utterly striking when the heads are seen in profile. Conse- quently, it is quite conceivable that bust no. 5596 does indeed show an early Seleukid. F. Hauser was the first to notice the strong similarity between bust no. 5596 and the head of the Alexander Rondanini (fig. 33). 149 P. Arndt150 and Th. Schreiber151 concurred, and just recently P. Moreno voiced the same opin- ion.152 The outlines of the two faces do indeed form the same type of oval. The eyebrows are flaring, the orbitais soft and slightly swollen; and the big eyes stand wide apart. In both heads the nose and upper lip are short, while the full lower lip is receding and sharply sep- arated from the broad and fleshy chin. It does not appear incomprehensible that Hauser was inclined to see the same historical personage in both these images. A problem seems to arise from the fact that the Rondanini Alexander is usually dated to approximately 330/320 B. C.153 However, that owes something to the fact that the identifica- tion of the statue as Alexander is taken for granted.154 Furtwängler and Wolters even dated the original to the period preceding the king's Asian campaign on the grounds of the figure's youthfulness. In stylistic terms, N. Himmelmann recently compared a female head in the Museo Barracco which is said to be from Attica and usually taken to be a frag- ment of a grave relief dating to ca. 330/320 B. C. (fig. 36). 155 Unquestionably, however, the latter is firmer and bonier than the 'Alexander' whose fleshiness foreshadows works like the portrait of Berenike II in Alex- 43.

C.; fig. 37). 156 As to the ren- dition of the 'Alexander's' body, Himmelmann refers to the 'Alexander sarcophagus',157 but it cannot be overlooked that the bodies of the nude figures in this monument are consider- ably fleshier and more rounded than the almost emaciated and angular 'Alexander'.158 For the latter neither the customary appella- tion nor the traditional date are binding in any sense. If there is a plausible comparison for the rendition of its body that can be securely dated to the beginning of the last 3rd of the 4th century, the present author must confess himsel unaware of it. Rather, the undeniable connections between the 'Alexander' and the Herculanean bronze bust (no. 5596), make it seem especially likely that the statue's original does not predate the beginning of the 3rd cen- tury B. C., nor even its 2nd quarter. The trunk of the body of the Alexander Rondanini is somewhat short and remarkably slender (fig. 41). Skin and bones are more dominant than flesh, and only the lower 48. As fig. 33. 49. The Arrotino (photo DAIRom 78.2157). abdominal zone and the external oblique mus- cles form bulges. Two horizontal creases tra- verse the figure's midriff, one of them skirting the lower ends of the thorax, the other cutting through the belly button. Exactly the same characteristics - but also the unusually strong tendons of the neck - reappear in the figure of the crouching Arrotino (fig. 42). This compar- ison cannot but add further, and likely deci- sive, strength to the advocates of an early date for the White-Marsyas Group of which the Scythian is an integral part. It is instructive to look once again at the Terme Boxer for whom a date of ca. 250 B. C. was proposed in section IV of this essay. The trunk of the boxer's body compares well to both the 'Alexander' and the Arrotino, but it is a trifle wider, a little fle- shier, and definitely less gaunt (fig. 43). Thus, it will not seem arbitrary to interpret these dif- ferences along the same lines as those between the 'Alexander'-Rondanini and Barracco heads: the boxer is slightly later than the Scythian and the 'Alexander.' The problem of the identity of the king por- trayed in the Herculanean bronze bust now seems soluble. In terms of his age, the ruler in question resembles the Pompey the Great in Copenhagen,159 and thus it will be safe to assume that the portrait was commissioned when the man was between 50 and 60 years old. As was mentioned above, the bust is usu-</page><page sequence="26">114 Hugo Meyer 50. As fig. 40: Trajanic portrait (recarved). ally dubbed either 'Antiochos l' or 'Antiochos Il' The latter can be dismissed, because he was born in 287 and only 40 when he was poi- soned in 246. He is clearly too young for the Naples bronze. Antiochos I, however, fits per- fectly. Born in 324, he turned fifty at the very beginning of the 2nd quarter of the 3rd cen- tury and was in his mid-fifties at the time of the famous battle of the elephants in ca. 268. Following that event, portrait statues of the king must have been set up in great numbers, and it seems quite conceivable that the arche- type of the Papyri bronze was one of them. The date once again agrees with, and thus confirms, the determination of ca. 270 B. C. for the White Marsy as and the Arrotino. As to the Rondanini ' Alexander ', Hauser thought that it represented the same person as the bronze no. 5596. Arndt - who on the basis of Hauser' s observation gave up his initial identification of the bronze bust as Philip II of Macedón - considered that neither impossible nor cogent: «es sind eben zwei ähnliche Phys- iognomien».160 Arndt preferred to keep up the traditional identification of the Munich statue as Alexander. Th. Schreiber likewise denied that the similarities between the two heads necessitated seeing in them one and the same person. Yet he acknowledged that an idealized, and probably posthumous, portrait of the king shown in bust no. 5596 could have resembled the head of the Rondanini figure - especially so, if the artist had in mind to assimilate his subject to images of Alexander the Great.161 Moreno believes no. 5596 to be Nikomedes I of Bithynia, but that is not borne out by the king's portrait as it is known from coins.162 (Moreno does not say whether he considers the Alexander Rondanini just a contemporary or another member of the Bithynian royal house). The Rondanini statue does not wear a dia- dem (fig. 38) (but will have been wreathed, fig. 44 [groove above neck]). Therefore, it may indeed be a portrait of Alexander whose origi- nal was created at about the same time as the archetype of the bronze portrait from Her- culaneum that more than likely represents An- tiochos I. Could a certain passage from Lucian163 establish a link between the two works? The episode recorded in it is supposed to have taken place on the eve of the battle of the elephants. Lucian writes: «When Anti- ochus Soter was about to engage the Galatians, he dreamed he saw Alexander standing by 51.

A monu- ment commemorating the premonition could very well have consisted of the figures of the king and the 08OÇ 'A^é^OCVÔpOÇ - just as in the group celebrating the liberation of Delphi the Aitolian commanders were mingled with their divine protectors (cf. above). As in the bronze statuette at Naples of Demetrios Poliorketes (fig. 47), 164 the two protagonists may be ima- gined to be scanning the terrain or observing the battle from an elevation. In the first two decades of the 3rd century, coins issued by Lysimachos165 show portraits of Alexander whose head of hair is subdivided into a cap-like upper and a wreath-like lower section (fig. 45). 166 This constitutes an affinity to the Alexander Rondanini (fig. 44) which did not escape scholarly attention.167 Nevertheless, it is impossible to consider these coins decisive in terms of the Rondanini 'Alexander's' iden- tity. If the statue is not Alexander as Schreiber and others have argued, it could perhaps be an early Seleukid prince. However, the high degree of idealization in both the figure's face and hair may make a heroic identity seem like- lier than a princely one. VIII. THE LYSIPPAN CONNECTION Lysippos' Kairos 168 was probably the most unusual piece of ancient Greek sculpture that ever existed.169 As is well known, the god, running on tiptoes, was balancing a set of sca- les on the edge of a razor while tipping one of its dishes with the extended index finger of his free hand (fig. 46). Double wings were atta- ched to his feet and back.170 On the back of the figure's head, the hair was trimmed short enough that nobody could seize it from behind. From above the forehead, a thick bunch of long strands projected forward to enable those who saw opportunity coming to grab it with resolve. John Tzetzes claims that the statue had been created on the occasion of Alexander the Great's lamentation of some unspecified missed opportunity.171 According to the orator Kallistratos (early 4th century A. D.),172 the Kairos was made of bronze and, therefore, likely to have been a sculpture in the round. Clearly, a figure such as that did not lend itself to copying in marble. Also, as G. Schwarz has shown, the Kairos probably stood at the royal palace in Pella:173 access to it will thus have been fairly restricted, and 52.

New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fletcher Fund, 1924 (24.97.104). sketches easier to obtain than moulds. It is indeed a relief adaptation extant in three cop- ies that constitutes the sole transmission of the Lysippan creation.174 The extant copies are: 1. a fragment in the Acropolis Museum that preserves little more than the left leg; 2. the fragment in the monastery of the Ben- edictines in Trogir, Dalmatia (figs. 46); lower legs and greater part of wings missing, left arm damaged; and 3. the Turin relief which is complete but may have been partly recarved in the early modern period;175 it is of modest quality of workmanship. Although the Trogir fragment's surface is in part rather worn, the piece is universally agreed to be the most accurate copy of Lysip- pos' lost masterpiece. Its composition with the curved trunk of the body and limbs extended before it calls for juxtaposition with the Alex- ander Rondanini (fig. 48). One will noticed at once that both these figures' bodies are not at all fleshy, but firm (or even sinewy), and slim at the hips. In each case, two sharp creases separate the oblique abdominal muscles from the straight one, with the latter seeming liter- ally to be pulled inward. The rim of the rib- cage is clearly articulated, and bulging muscles stand out as self-contained units.176 However, there are also differences. The Kairos, in spite of its firmness, conveys a sense of roundedness and harmonious flow of movement, whereas the Rondanini Alexander appears stiff and angular in all its views. In large areas, the surface of the figure is 'fractu- red' by criss-crossing indentations amidst iso- lated bulges of muscle. In between the 'Alexander' and the Kairos, the archetype of the bronze statuette of Demetrios Poliorketes (306-283 B. C.) - whose angularities are kept in balance by the unifying appearance of his cloak (fig. 47) - finds its place.177 The cape of the Arrotino does not have this effect (fig. 49). His body surface does not seem quite as 'frac- tured' as that of the 'Alexander,' and his angu- larities have been smoothed over. But of course, one has to keep in mind that we are</page><page sequence="29">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 117 dealing with (isolated) Roman copies. How- ever, the common elements suffice to confirm once more the early date for the White-Mar- syas Group. In NH 34. 65 Pliny says about Lysippos: «His main contributions to the art of sculpture are said to consist in his vivid rendering of the hair, in making the heads smaller than older artists had done, and the bodies slimmer and with less flesh»178 - corpora graciliora ac sic- ciora (literally: thinner and dryer). In the sub- sequent paragraph, Pliny speaks of Lysippos' son and pupil Euthykrates: «the latter however imitated not so much the refinement as the perseverance of his father, choosing to win approval by an austere rather than a lighter style of execution» - is constantiam potius imit- atus patris quam elegantiam austero maluit genere quam iucundo piacere . So, in addition to being slimmer and less fleshy than the statues by older masters, Lysippos' creations were also refined and, consequently, pleasant to look at. That is certainly true of the Kairos. The style of Euthykrates was harsher and tarter, an aus- tere style, and it will not seem arbitrary to call these terms quite fitting for the description of the Alexander Rondanini and related figures. The Arrotino was already mentioned; and probably one might also point to a seated sta- tue with a Trajanic head in Buffalo 179 whose original seems to have represented a poet, playwright, or philosopher honoured around 270-250 B. C. (figs. 40, 50). There is no intention here to contend that any or all of the archetypes of the aforemen- tioned works were actually wrought by Euthykrates. We cannot know that, and there will have been others who worked in his vein - just like Euthykrates' disciple Teisikrates reverted to the style of Lysippos, and that to such an extent «that many of his works can hardly be distinguished from those of the mas- ter» (NH 34, 67). Be that as it may, the link with the school of Lysippos 180 is as obvious as a connection with the Seleukid court - through the Alexander Rondanini and the Arrotino. And that makes good sense, for Lysippos himself had made a portrait of 54. Mantinea base.

CONCLUSION Our survey has led us far afield, far away from the table leg that caused us to embark on it (figs. 1-2). There, as was said above, the Scythian is holding one end of his dress in his mouth while grinding his knife. On the imme- diate narrative plane, this is a practical meas- ure ensuring swift completion of the task at hand. But it also may be viewed as enhancing the satyr's forsakenness in his darkest hour. For whereas the slightly parted lips of the Arrotino at least do not rule out the possibility of dialogue, in the trapezophoron a fleeting backward glance by the torturer constitutes the only 'exchange' between him and his victim prior to the ordeal itself. It remains to pick up a few loose ends. The number of (white marble) copies of the White Marsyas type is increased to seven by a frag- ment in the museum of the Kibbutz Sdot Yam (Caesarea) in Israel.182 It was found in a field and consists of a bearded head, a section of chest with armpits, and the upper halves of both upper arms. The back of the head and the scruff of the neck are only roughed out. The upper half of the face, and the hair adja- cent to the forehead, were flaked off in antiq- uity and are cracked. The lower half of the face and the beard are well preserved. Typical drilling in hair and beard permits dating of the piece to the late Antonine/ early Seveřan period. It will be published by Rivka Gersht in the corpus of sculptures from Caesarea. A fragment of a marble kithara in the Ross H. Auerbach collection is currently on display in the Metropolitan Museum, New York. The extant piece is the lower end of the instru- ment. It shows the Scythian in right profile on the left, the hanging Marsyas on the right, and between them a frontal Helios traversing the sky in a quadriga. Clearly, the latter figure cannot be assumed to have been a component of the original Hellenistic group; but the sculptor of the kithara seems to have felt awk- ward about the absence from it of the protago- nist, i.e. Apollo: the latter's identification with Helios- Sol was common in the imperial age and its propaganda. The New York kithara might, therefore, be an apt reinforcement of some of the aspects of B. Fehr's interpretation of the imagery of Marsyas and other perpetra- tors in Greek and Roman art.183 Ariel Herr- mann is preparing its publication. Appendix Was there an early classical hanging Marsyas? More food for thought The fragment from Thasos of a hanging Marsyas of Severe or severizing style gave rise to speculations whether the Hellenistic types had a precursor in the Early Classical period (fig. 51). 184 H.A. Weis185 recently drew atten- tion to the fact that in the seventies there was found, likewise in Thasos, «une réplique très exacte, inachevée, mais plus complète..., du Marsyas trouvé par P. Guillon en 1934» (fig. 52). 186 Like its head, its body too is fashioned in Severe forms (voluminous chest, slender hips, strong thighs). To Weis, «the discovery of a second statuette of the same type... has proved that [the statue found by Guillon, H. M.] was carved in the imperial period».187 It seems to me that that was not a moot point. The question to ask afresh concerns the nature of the tertium preceding the two copies: an original of the Severe Style, maybe a local one, or an imperial severizing variation on a Hel- lenistic theme, crafted by a local workshop specializing in decorative marble furniture? Although most peoples' intuition may nudge them toward accepting the second solution, it may be wise to remain prudent. After all, two of the three Marsyas types (and their confla- tions) that are common in Roman table legs go indisputably back to full scale Greek originals. And is it really a given that the Classical period never depicted the actual punishment of the satyr? On the famous and richly inscribed Thief Kra- ter by the Tarporley painter in the Metropolitan Museum 188 the perpetrator is shown on tiptoes with his arms up in the air and his fingers touch- ing each other at the tips (fig. 53). To the left, a policeman is threatening the thief with a stick, while on the right an old hag is gesticulating and yelling at both of them. In the background behind the policeman, there stands a youth who is carrying a folded garment on his left shoulder; an inscription calls him TPArOIAOX. The words flowing from the mouth of the old woman inform the reader that she is handing the thief over to the policeman - who by his hairstyle, facial features, and incomprehensible mumbling is identified as a barbarian. The krater dates to</page><page sequence="31">The hanging Marsy as reconsidered 119 about 400 and is Apulian, but the dialect of the inscriptions is Attic. It is undisputed that the lines are quotes from a play.189 This caused scholars to recall the Scythian policemen of Clas- sical Athens, a notion which was corroborated by the linguistically-founded determination that the policeman's NOPAPETTEBAO is not Messapian (as one would have expected if the scene and play were taking place at Tarentum).190 The thief who is looking down at the police- man's redoubtable stick says the following: KOC T8Ô8G8 ava TG) X8Ïp8, i.e. «he (scilicet: the policeman) has bound my two hands above» (Beazley). A Scythian tying up somebody else's hands above cannot but call to mind the unfor- tunate Marsyas; and already in the early 1930's F. Messerschmidt referred to the tripping thief as a 'Karikatur des aufgehängten Marsyas' 191 . It is of no consequence that Beazley does, indeed, seem to be correct in saying that the thief's «hands are not shown as actually tied», and in further taking it «that they are not tied: the old man is the victim of a KaxáSe^lÇ, he is spellbound». For that, naturally, is the comical adaptation of the more serious theme, and so is the Tarporley painter's picture as a whole: his Scythian policeman is remarkably close to the representation of the torturer on the much younger Mantinea base (fig. 54). 192 It cannot reasonably be assumed that Praxiteles or some- body from his workshop knew this particular, or even only a similar, Apulian pot. Rather, the Tarporley painter's vase points to the existence of a monument from which both he and the Mantinea master drew (part of) their inspira- tion.193 This monument, however, is likelier to have been created during the Severe than the high Classical period.194 The Thasian trapezo- phora may also reflect it.195 Hugo Meyer Notes 1 The abbreviations used in the notes are normally those sug- gested by the Archäologischer Anzeiger, the Archäologische Bibliographie, and the American Journal of Archaeology.

The present article as well as Levy Bronze and Terme Ruler were originally intended as sections of a book on Hellenistic sculpture. However, during a leave of absence when I had hoped to produce the manuscript, I realized that the project was not feasible as envisaged. In research on Hellenistic sculpture too much of the fundamental work remains yet to be done. Prej- udices and preconceptions sometimes impose severe restrictions on the very possibility of progress, and the formation of commu- nis opinio. It seems to me that we have been hiding behind Krahmer's back for long enough. I also think that there is no shortage of comprehensive treatments of Hellenistic art or sculpture - which tend not to differ much in the selection of images. (In which respect, but most of all in terms of its superb picture quality, R. R. R. Smith's «Hellenistic Sculpture» is a true improve- ment.) Progress in our understanding of Hellenistic sculpture is not likely to be gained by generalizations or wilful exercises in hermeneutics. Hard looking, and the readiness to question our assumptions, surely offer better prospects. I would like to thank L. Franchi dell'Orto and E. La Rocca for accepting the large quantity of illustrations included in my three articles. There is nothing frivolous about their number. Rather, they are there to make the cases argued as explicit as possible. For the opportunity to present and discuss aspects of my work at the universities of Erlangen, Göttingen, Graz, and Princeton (PAW) I am grateful to J. Bergemann, Ch. Boeh- ringer, E-J. Champlin, P. Kranz, E. Pochmarski, and G. Schwarz. To M. Fuchs and Th. Lorenz I am indebted for con- tinuous exchange about questions regarding Hellenistic sculp- ture. M. G. and R. Weir sifted my texts for Germanisms: whichever remain are my own. 2 For the history of the piece cf. Ö. Acar, M. Kaylan, «The Turkish Connection.

WATSON, Phantasia in Classical Thought , Galway 1988. In spite of the agnosticism cherished by M. Hofter, in Gnomon 62, 1990, 449, I believe that a good case can be made for speaking of (paVTOCGÍai in Hel- lenistic art, even if the term had not been taken over from poe- try and rhetoric at an early stage. But the conjecture from Ael., Var. hist. 2. 44, and Quintil., 6. 2. 29; 12. 10. 6 - and we may add DlOG. Laert., 6.38; Marsyas 25, note 73 - is certainly intriguing and does in any case have the advantage of yielding a technical term that is a perfect fit (cf. W. A. P. CHILDS, «Pla- ton, les images et l'art grec du IVe siècle», in RA 1994, 52 f). In Hofter's view, the integrating beholder («der ergänzende Betrachter») belongs to legend. But clearly, narrativally incom- plete figures and groups are a special development within the hitherto understudied phenomenon of the excerpt, cf. in prelim- inary form H. Meyer, in Boreas 12, 1989, 123 ff; Id., in RdA 17, 1993, 51 ff, and of course the literature cited in Marsyas 24 f. If one follows the interpretation of Strabo, 8. 3. 30 by R. L.

Uns beschäftigt hierbei das Problem, ob... diese nur einer allgemeinen Belebung dienen oder ob sie Entscheidendes zur Frage der Ansichtigkeit beisteuern können», I.e., 142. Is it an accident that there is no reference to my assessment while the one to M.

Marsyas 21: «Für die fest und präzise formulierte Musku- latur des Körpers und ihre stofflich überzeugende Verbindung mit dem darunterliegenden Knochengerüst kann auf den weißen Marsyas selbst und die zu diesem beigebrachten Vergleiche zurückverwiesen werden.» There is a reference to note 50: «Eng verwandt ist noch der Faustkämpfer im Thermenmuseum..., dessen Datierung durch den Ansatz von A.

Ibid., note 40, the authors criticize the prevalent view of the Drunken Old Woman (as suggested by me in Marsyas 27, fig. 5 [Capitoline copy]), and explain their preferred view with fig. 8 c (Munich copy). I cannot help but find the latter rather awkward. The flask is overwhelming. The left hip seems displaced with regard to left arm and trunk. The placement of the rolled-up part of the man- tle appears illogical, and so does its relationship to the arm. The right foot is certainly not where one would expect it to be by looking at the right leg: in this case Geominy and Lehmann seem not to have worked consistently. Also, the type's two extant copies differ greatly not only with regard to the quality of workmanship, but also in terms of figurai presentation. Conse- quently, pending a rigorous examination according to the princi- ples of Kopienkritik it cannot be taken for granted that the Munich copy is the more reliable transmission (cf. H. Meyer, «Virgo vestalis inveterata in sacris obsequis», in Mannheimer Berichte 40, 1992, 51 ff [with an appendix by R. Harprath]). - On the Drunken Old Woman see now R.

I am also not ready to follow Geominy and Lehmann in their assessment of the frontal and right-profile views of the Boxer as actually intended views (I.e., 143, figs. 2 and 4). In fig. 2 the limbs of the figure appear stiff, and Geominy and Lehmann themselves mention the asymmetries in shoulders and chest. In fig. 4 the Boxer looks like a somewhat incorrectly assembled bronze statue (not a live being) with an awkwardly gawky neck- and- shoulder section and a clumsy trunk. - Franz, I.e., 74 is certainly mistaken in speaking of a perplexing «Vielfalt ergiebi- ger Ansichten».

Roman Innovations in a Hellenistic Sculptural Tradition, Rome 1992, 135, 148 f, no. 5, dates the piece to the Seveřan period of the 3rd century - because of the «deep strokes of the drill» in the pubic hair, among other reasons. 38 HOFTER, I.e., denies the existence of considerable drill- work in that area, but nevertheless it is there (cf. Weis, I.e.): consequently, the Berlin torso's pudendum, when seen in pro- file, is flatter than in other copies of the type (cf. the plates in Marsyas, passim). Maderna, I.e., 296.

My reconstruction is illustrated ibidem, cat. no. 2, and explained to be «die Gruppe aus dem Blickwinkel Apolls», p. 40.

However, from Wünsche's discussion of my interpretation, the reader may receive the impression that I took it to be the Arro- tino's seat: «Mit einem Wort: Der Skythe hockt nicht, sondern kauert in einer beweglichen Position,» Wünsche, I.e., 38. That statement does not seem to make sense, because hocken and kauern are synonyms (Duden). (Only in Southern German dia- lects does hocken mean to sit, but in the caption to fig. 15 Wün- sche himself calls the figure Hockender Skythe ; cf. also the expression «in der Hocke» on p. 38.) Ibid. 38: «Sein rechter Arm liegt an der Außenseite des rechten Oberschenkels fest auf, der linke Arm ist an das stark gebeugte, linke Bein gepreßt. Die rechte Hand hält das Messer, die Finger der linken drücken die Klinge auf den Wetzstein. Bei dieser Arm- und Handhaltung ist ein Schleifen mittels Beweg- ung der Arme gar nicht möglich, ohne daß nicht eine der Hände den notwendigen Kontakt mit dem Messer verlöre. Und der Skythe braucht auch die Arme nicht zu bewegen: Die Schleifbe- wegung führt der ganze Körper durch, mit dem er leicht hin und her pendelt...» Cf. the following note. 58 In and of itself, it is a nice yarn: «Sicherlich hat der Kün- stler diese Bewegung nicht für die Figur 'erfunden.' Die fahren- den Messerschleifer der Antike werden so gearbeitet haben; die Schleiftechnik erlaubte ihnen auch während der Arbeit ein 'Schwätzchen' mit dem Auftraggeber. Der hellenistische Bild- hauer übernahm nun diese bei den fahrenden Schleifergesellen wohl übliche Bewegung, um damit die Grausamkeit des Vor- gangs auszudrücken. Wie ein versierter Handwerker, der schon bei der Bereitstellung des Werkzeugs über die praktikabelste Lösung der anstehenden Aufgaben grübelt [sie !], fixiert der Skythe kritisch sein 'Arbeitsobjekt'», I.e., 38. As to the notion of the Arrotino possibly chatting with Apollo, G. Schwarz perti- nently remarked" that the god would not even have considered talking to an individual like the Arrotino. The artist of the group knew that, cf. below. 59 Wünsche writes: «Der Körper bleibt in der Schleifbewe- gung geschlossen wie ein Block. Das Pendeln des Körpers hat der Bildhauer in dem umgeschlagenen, wie von einer Bewegung erfaßten Mantel am Rücken und dem seitwärts auf den Obers- chenkel geschwungenen Penis des Skythen anzudeuten ver- sucht», I.e., 38.

In Marsyas 23, note 57, I refer to hilts of knives in the shape of the hanging Marsyas. A modern parallel is the knife by Aegi- dius Sattler (1570-1629), cf. W. Hoffmann, Zauber der Medusa. Europäische Manierismen, Vienna 1987, 297, no. 35. 69 Ibid. 47. On the 'usefulness' of generalizations of this nature cf. I. WEILER, «Von 'Wesen', 'Geist' und 'Eigenart' der Völker der alten Welt.

I missed Hof- ter's publications which qualified him for the review of my book. 73 Ibid. 446: «In der Auswertung der Kopien für die Überlie- ferung des Originals des weißen Typus bescheinigt M. der Istanbuler Replik die größte Treue für die Darstellung des Kör- pers, gefolgt von der Münchner, während er für den Kopf der Pariser Wiederholung den Vorzug gibt. Diesem Ergebnis... ist zuzustimmen.» Maderna (cf. supra) apparently was misled by Hofter's conflicting statement from the same page, where he calls the Berlin torso «die nuancenreichste und qualitätvollste Wiederholung» of the white type. It is further confusing, that Hofter speaks of my underestimation of the Berlin piece («Unterschätzung»). This 'underestimation' he claims to be a function of my «Spätdatierung» (late date). That is as ludicrous as if, conversely, someone were to contend, that Hofter's deter- mination of the correct date for that copy prevented him from coming to terms with it. Just as I myself did, he simply stopped wondering and did not look further. 74 Ibid. 449: «ohne daß wir befugt wären (sic!), eine Entschei- dung zu treffen,» what that Apollo may have looked like. W.

H. -P. Laubscher, in AntK 30, 1987, 131 ff, with an overview of the older literature. 84 R. Kabus-Preibhofen, in AA 1988, 679 ff. 85 In contrast to lesser scholastics, St. Thomas Aquinas knew that, cf. U. Matz, «Thomas von Aquin», in: H. Maier e.a. (eds.), Klassiker des politischen Denkens , I, Munich 1968, 293, note 25. - I see no reason to deny that I derive satisfaction from having predicted the reinstatement of both the boxer and the Giza Gaul as hallmarks of 3rd-century art ( Marsyas 15, note 16; 21, note 50). 86 M. Hofter, in Gnomon 62, 1990, 447. 87 Ibid. 447 f. 88 Is there a non-native speaker of German, who will even begin to understand verbiage like the following: «Jedoch ist das Inkarnat geschwellt und gegen einen zugrundeliegenden Kern differenziert sowie in eine gerichtete Bewegung geraten, die in der Nasenwurzel mündet» (p. 447); «Symptomatisch ist auch der fließende Übergang der Stirn in die gesträubten Haarsträhnen, der diese geradezu als Protuberanz des Schädels erscheinen läßt» (p. 448). Comical relief is provided by wordings like: «das Haar geht direkt in das Inkarnat über, das in einem Feuerwerk von Licht- und Schatteneffekten explodiert», or: «die Schädelkalotte verliert sich unter dem Chiaroscuro der bewegten Haarmasse» (both 448). But doubtless Hofter hits the mark, when he com- petes with Winckelmann by musing, alas!, upon the Dying Gaul's «stille Agonie (und) resignierte(s) Grauen», p. 447. 89 Cf. now the review article by F. Queyrel, in RA 1992, 367 ff. 90 Hofter, I.e. 91 Cf. the discussion of the two heads in Levy Bronze , section VI, figs. 57 and 68. In favour of 'Seleukos' e.g. LlPPOLD, Plastik 321; R. Fleischer, Studien zur seleukidischen Kunst , I, Mainz 1991, 10 ff; not accepted by Queyrel, I.e., 410; cf. W. Geominy, R. ÖZGAN, in AA 1982, 125 f; see also Ch. Boehringer, Zur Chronologie mittelhellenistischer Münzserien.... ; cf. the preceding note. The view of B. Hintzen-Bohlen, in IstMitt 40, 1990, 145 ff, that the facial features of the Herakles in the Pergamene Pro- metheus Group in reality are those of Attalos I {ibid. pl. 22) does not seem compelling. G. DONTAS, in Kanon, Festschrift E. Berger , Basel 1988, 225, pl. 61, 1-3, believes the fragment of a head on the Athenian acropolis to be a copy of the Attalos I type, but there are differences. (The head of Augustus in Pytha- goreion seems to have been recarved from a portrait of Attalos, cf. Levy Bronze , section XI). Dontas gives an overview of the various dates suggested for the Attalos. 93 Hofter, I.e., 448, with reference to J. -P. NlEMElER, Kopien und Umbildungen im Hellenismus, Bonn 1984, 164 f (ca. 190 B.C.); cf. GEOMINY, ÖZGAN, I.e., 125 (220's; against Buschor who suggested ca. 170 B.C. for the Attalos). For a discussion of Niemeier's methodology cf. S. STEINBRUCKNER, in HASB 11, 1986, 19 ff, and my discussion in Levy Bronze, section VI. 94 It would be unfair to pretend that Hofter were the only worshipper of «Schulmeinung.» Neo-scholasticism is definitely on the rise. 95 Hofter, I.e., 446 f. 96 Pollitt, Art in the Hellenistic Age, Cambridge 1986, 268 f. 97 Pollitt, I.e., Ill, and again 265 ff; see also R. R. R. Smith, Hellenistic Sculpture, London 1991, 271: «The baroque is documented chiefly at Pergamon, by the large Gauls in the late third and by the Great Altar in the mid-second century. Pergamon, however, was a latecomer... the baroque had no doubt emerged much earlier in other kingdoms.» To Hofter, the phase of Hellenistic baroque is a neatly defined given. The Arrotino group can be termed baroque. Consequently, it cannot predate the inception of the phase. That is logical if one does not mind starting by begging the question. M. Bieber, who oth- erwise is very Krahmerian, lets the high Hellenistic phase com- mence around 250, The Sculpture of the Hellenistic Age2, New York 1961, 6. 98 H.

FlTTSCHEN, Griechische Porträts, Darmstadt 1988, pl. 149. 1,2 uses the portrait of Diophantos, or rather its hair, to date the pseudo-Vergil to ca. 100 B. C., cf. ibid. IX. 102 Cf. G. M. A. RICHTER, The Portraits of the Greeks, Lon- don 1965, in, figs. 1867, 1868, with Poulsen, I.e., pls. 1, 3. 103 It seems worthwhile to underscore this point because of the little-disguised scorn with which criticism of style as a method of historical inquiry is currently meeting, cf. K. FlTT- SCHEN, in Gnomon 63, 1991, 432, note 14; P. Zanker, Die Maske des Sokrates, Munich 1995, 135; Id., «Individuum und Typus», in AA 1995, 474. The self-shackling basic attitude underlying the typologi- cal method brings to mind a remark by Fritz Mauthner which, however, has as its target the arbitrary practice of imposing on yet undescribed languages the system of Latin grammar: that is «wie ein Versuch, sich mit Hilfe einer Karte von Tirol im Him- alaya zurechtzufinden. Es wird ja manches stimmen. Die Flüsse werden bergab laufen und die Wege werden häufig dem Lauf der Flüsse folgen; wer das aber erraten hat, der bedarf in Asien nicht der Karte von Tirol», Beiträge zu einer Kritik der Sprache I2 (1906/1982) 23. Criticism of style creates its own maps afresh from instance to instance. 105 I am referring to Zeno's (solved) paradoxes on the impos- siblity of movement, cf. W. I.

Barra Bagnaso, in Bollettino della Società Piemontese 30/31, 1976/1977, 12 ff, the main reason being the 'baroque' shape of the god's wings; accepted by MORENO, I.e., 130; more cautious idem, LIMC V 1, 922, no. 4. However, Schwarz, I.e. y 257 with note 65 remarks correctly, that the shape of the wings is antique but not Lysippan; Schwarz' Traja- nic-Hadrianic date accepted by K.

Zanker, Katalog der römischen Por- träts in den Kapitolinischen Museen , Mainz 1983, I, pl. 41, 44 (eyes, mouth, flesh) -, and its hair recarved in the mid-3rd cen- tury - cf. ibid. y pls. 136-138. It is worth noting, that even the recarved head is 'too big' for the body: the Rondanini Alexan- der's head is likewise oversized. 180 School of Lysippos: Bieber, I.e., 30 ff; J.J.

Reinach's assumption, that there was a whole Severe cycle of representations from the Mar- syas myth, must once again be mentioned, Gazette des Beaux- Arts 52, 1910, 78 f; more in Marsyas 19, note 40. It has been said that the absence of depictions of the hanging Marsyas from Classical vase painting shows the theme of the actual punish- ment to be alien to pre-Hellenistic ethics, cf. e.g. WÜNSCHE, I.e., 29. On the other hand, in terms of composition, it is not a theme that lends itself easily to the decoration of pots. At any rate, the Tarporley painter counsels us to be cautious with argu- ments from silence. 194 Cf. Marsyas 19 with note 40 for the possibility of a Severe Marsyas-cycle discussed in the older literature. 195 Within the framework of this interpretation, the youth with the folded cloak in the background, who resembles the Triptolemos of the Eleusianian relief, could be Marsyas' pupil Olympos, but that is a minor point. He may just as well be no more than a supernumerary.</page></plain_text>
