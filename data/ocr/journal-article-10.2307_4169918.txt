<plain_text><page sequence="1">n--I~- lw IW -- - Fig. I Peruvian Textiles T HE name of Peru, or " Biru," first came to the ears of Spanish explorers four hundred and two years ago. Pascual de Andagoya, traveling south- ward in 1522, heard of a rich land whose inhabi- tants were famed for their finely wrought clothing. Andagoya was forced to turn back; but Francisco Pizarro, led by the hope of treasure, formed a new expedition which reached at last a country that, though differing greatly from any of the known civilizations of the world, yet gave evidence of a rich and highly developed culture. Populous towns, fertile fields, and the great temples of the sun, all meant nothing to the Spaniards save as the source of silver and gold to add to the power and glory of Spain. In 1 523, with the death of the last Inca, Atahuallpa, Pizarro crowned his conquest. Thus Spain discovered Peru and conquered and enslaved her people, that by means of their forced labor she might carry away vast treasures of precious metal. The richer treasures of their art and culture she neglected and destroyed. Today Peru is being discovered anew, not for material power to foster our own culture, but to enrich it with greater knowledge of the history of mankind and the art of long-forgotten races. For the Incas, rulers of Peru at the time of the Spanish conquest, were themselves conquerors of an earlier and finer civilization. And that earlier civilization was the successor of a still older and more splendid culture to which has been given the name of Tiahuanaco from the ancient city of Tiahuanaco in the moun- tains southeast of Lake Titicaca, where megalithic ruins have been found. Contemporaneous with this civilization, or possibly earlier, are the remains found under superimposed strata in the burial grounds of the coastal valleys. Between the cold current from the Antarctic, which sweeps northward along the seaboard of Peru, drawing moisture from the winds of the Pacific, and the chill peaks of the Andes which gather rain from the east winds, lies an almost desert region. There, where climatic conditions are very similar to those of Egypt, and where in the past elaborate burial customs were continued over a period of many centuries, fragile weavings and embroideries have been preserved which under other conditions would have disappeared long ago. As yet a definite statement concerning the chronology of old Peru would of necessity be based on insufficient data, but slowly careful excavation and study are revealing to us more and more of the past. Unlike the ancient Egyptians the Peruvians apparently had no organized system of writing or hieroglyphics, and hence have left us no records. The knotted strings, or quipus, which they used for counting, help us little. Only tenta- tively, then, can we say that their earliest culture began sometime prior to 200 A. D. In the Museum collection are some examples of the earliest known type of Peruvian textiles - the richly embroidered cloths found in the Nasca valley. Hitherto, apart from these pieces, which belong to what has been called the Proto-Nasca</page><page sequence="2">XXII, 34 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BULLETIN Fig. 2 period, the Museum has had only a small, though interesting collection of Peruvian weavings. Re- cently there has been added by purchase, a collec- tion of fifty-eight pieces of woven, embroidered, and dyed textiles, illustrating to a remarkable degree the technical skill and high artistic sense of this people. These pieces were all found in the burial grounds of the coastal region -either in the Huaco de los Muertos, a few miles west of Lima, or at Pachacamac, famous in pre-Inca times as the site of the temple of Pachacamac, Creator of the Universe, and in Inca times, though Pachacamac was still honored there, as the site of the great temple of the sun. They are parts of garments wom by the dead, or of their personal belongings buried with them, which in the case of a woman not infrequently included her loom with half- finished cloth, her spindles, and copper needles. The body was embalmed in a position characteristic of the Indian today, a squatting position. The mummy, which with its innumerable wrappings resembled a large jar, was buried in a grave sometimes built like a deep well lined with sun- dried brick. Among the finest pieces in this collection is a shirt of brown cotton (Fig. 1 ) decorated around the bottom with a border of tapestry woven with wool. This is in an almost perfect state of preservation and has evidently never been wom. It was found in a separate bundle buried beside a mummy in the Huaco de los Muertos, near Lima. The inten- tional slits which accent the design and give an almost lace-like quality to the border are charac- teristic of one of the many refinements of the art of weaving developed by the Peruvians. Curiously interesting is the arrangement of color, the balance of delicately neutralized violet and yellow, blue- green and pinkish red. The figure in the design, which may remotely reproduce an animal form, has been so highly conventionalized that for us it is unrecognizable, but further study may reveal in this, as well as in the pumas, condors, fish, and various anthropomorphic figures used repeatedly in Peruvian design, a symbolism which would be a clue to their thought. Tapestry weaving in Peru was a highly devel- oped art. In the coca-leaf bag illustrated (Fig. 2) the photograph brings out interesting methods of conventionalization used in portraying man, and suggests that various objects, such as those on his headdress and in his hands, have a symbolic meaning which we may hope in the future to decipher. But the photograph unfortunately can- not give its greatest beauty, color. On a ground of neutralized pinkish red is a slightly darker reddish violet in very close harmony. In apposition to the violet, but related to it by a greenish blue, is a soft neutral yellow. Browns and grays outline and accent the design. A very unusual variation of tapestry technique is illustrated in a portion of a garment (Fig. 3) found on a mummy in the Huaco de los Muertos, near Lima. The design of fishes' heads surrounding a fret is woven with tapestry superimposed on closely woven cotton cloth. The distinctive technique of this piece is the method employed in superimposing the tapestry on the cotton. Altemate pairs of warp threads are carried above the surface of the cloth to form the warp of the tapestry design, which is woven with neutral pink, yellow, brown, green, and blue wool. At regular intervals weft threads hold down these warp threads, giving a up Fig. 3</page><page sequence="3">MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS BULLETIN XXII, 35 Izi 1t -F -4 Fig. 4 more form to the relief. All the cotton threads reenter the web in the plain cloth, which is both a background and a repetition of the fret and fish design. Embroidery is illustrated in this collection by various types, some resembling tapestry, some being more like brocade. Two examples of em- broidered gauze are closely related in technique to lace of a far-distant country and a later time, the buratto of seventeenth century Italy. Italian buratto, which substituted a woven mesh for the knotted ground of lacis, or filet, was usually made of linen, although sometimes of silk. Silk and linen are never found in early Peruvian textiles, cotton and wool being used almost exclusively. The open mesh ground of these two pieces, woven of pale brown cotton, has, like buratto, a single warp thread bound by two weft threads. The design is worked with colored wool. In one piece the stitches of the embroidery all run parallel to the warp threads, in the other the small disks which form diamonds in the design are made by stitches taken in spirals. Double weaving (Fig. 4), not unlike some of the hand-woven coverlets woven in this country in the early part of the last century, is represented by a piece woven with light and dark brown cotton in a design of altemating rows of steps and spiral frets. Designed in a manner characteristic of the Peruvians, the forms are interlocking; in each case the background of another value repeats the form. There are three interesting examples of tie dyeing, long associated only with the East, but well known to the Peruvians. Every piece in the collection repays careful study. G. T.</page></plain_text>
