<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE. THE attitude of the Moslim Church towards the Bible cannot be better seen than in the following abstract from one of the most renowned Arabic works on Religious Sects and Denorinations. It is an attempt to interpret Deut. xxxiii. 2, and reads thus :- It is said in the Torah, that God arrived from mount Sinai, appeared in Sair, and revealed himself in Faran. Sair stands for the hills in Jerusalem where Jesus preached, whilst Faran signifies the heights of Mecca where the chosen prophet (Mohammed) declared himself. Since the divine secrets and heavenly lights which accompany inspiration, revelation, divine promptings and their interpretation led up to the three stages of commencement, continuation, and com- pletion, and since " arrival" corresponds most closely to the commencement, appearing to continuation, and "revelation " to completion: the Torah expresses the dawn of law-giving, and its proclamation by employing the phrase of coming upon mount Sinai, and the rising of the sun by the appearance (of Jesus) on Sair, whilst the third stage, viz. completion, is reached through the revelation on Faran. By means of this allegory Al Shahrastani wishes to convey that Judaism and Christianity led up to a climax which is Islam. The character of Islamn as the embodiment of the two preceding religions is therefore predicted in the Bible which thus becomes obsolete. Now the Qoran already distinguishes between the Law as revealed on Sinai, and the Bible as it was found in the hands of the Jews, or rather as Mohammed reconstructed it from the religious practices he observed among them. 1 Al Shahrastani, Kitab al mila al walnihal ed. Cureton, I, p. I65 sq. 222</page><page sequence="2">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE Wishing to uphold the divine origin of the Torah without incurring any liability as to its ritual laws, he declared that it had been tampered with by the Rabbis, who by making new laws aspired to divine honours . On this account he sought to prove that a heathen element had crept into the Jewish Church. The inconsistency of in- troducing Rabbinic regulations into the doctrines of Islam is due to his lack of authentic knowledge of the Jewish Scriptures, but does not concern us at this moment. When examining Mohammed's attitude towards the Bible, one cannot help observing that it was almost the same as that of the Karaites. He only acknowledged as genuine what he considered to be the revealed text of the Torah, and this he took in a strictly literal sense. Those whom he held responsible for the alteration of the Law he styled Rabbanites 2, thus being actually the first to employ this term, which was used, in the same deprecatory manner later on, by the Karaites. Now we do not cherish any illusions as to our knowledge of the embryo life and early youth of this sect, and here I should like to call attention to one possible factor which has hitherto remained un- noticed, but which may perhaps shed a dim light on this dark period of Jewish history. The spiritual sphere of the Jewish masses was anything but wide during the time when the Talmud was nearing completion, and their knowledge of Judaism was derived from traditional practice, rather than from the study of Rabbinic writings. On the other hand, we see Islam causiifg a mighty stir among the thousands of its followers. These, in their turn, represented public opinion which was, of necessity, also active among the numerous Jewish communities to be found in their midst. We need not enlarge on the influence of public opinion on people with limited capacities, because there is no difference in this respect between past and present. Among the Jews who saw the rise of Islam were many who had been converted from paganism, and who 1 Qor. iii. 73. 2 Ibid. and v. 48, 68. 223</page><page sequence="3">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW had neither much religious knowledge nor strong con- victions to impart to their children. In view of the strict Rabbinical interpretation of the Mosaic law, the Moham- medan way of looking at the same probably appealed to this class of people, who, without formally abandoning Judaism, endeavoured to shape it exclusively according to what they found written in the Pentateuch. I do not, by any means, assert that Islam was the only factor which helped Karaism into existence, but it was certainly one of its agents. Great historical movements never start from one point only, but are set rolling in various ways which converge into one main road. It is hardly by accident that Karaism was born and lived the best part of its life in Moslim countries, and it is, to say the least, noteworthy that Karaites adopted the Qoranic term Rabbdniyyin to describe, or rather denounce, the adherents of the Rabbinic code. At the time when Karaism was at its height, Arabic was the language of Karaite authors (although it was not so much used at first), and the methods employed in all branches of scientific endeavours were those of the Arabs. There is one point in common between Judaism and Islam, viz. that both their ritual and civil codes are portions of their respective religious laws. The rules for interpreting ordinations developed in the Talmud are in some way paralleled by a few similar ones employed by Moslim theologians. Where the Qoran and the oldest strata of tradition gave 'no clue for the solution of certain ritual or legal questions, they had recourse to the ra'y (speculative deduction of decisions), or to the qiyds (analogy), or taqlid (adoption of another teacher's opinion in case of doubt). This system not being so well worked out as the process of Talmudic discussion, left too much room for individual conceptions on the part of the Mufti. It did not take long, tlerefore, ere a reaction set in. In the third century of the Hijra, a school was founded in the Iraq (Babylon), which rejected all indirect deduction, and returned to the Qoran 224</page><page sequence="4">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE and the oldest tradition. The school bears the name of the Zdhirites1, i.e. those who explained the sacred word accord- ing to its literal meaning, and a full account of its history and doctrines has been given by Professor Goldziher 2. As one can easily perceive, there is a certain resemblance between the Zahirite movement and the endeavours of the Karaites. It is, however, very difficult to say whether Karaite influence on Moslim theology was such as to promote Zahirism, or whether the latter arose spontaneously, both being brought into existence by common impulses. It must be noted that both reached their apogees at about the same period, and spread from their original homes as far as Spain. It was in this country that Zahirism attained its utmost limits by finally including even dogmatic principles in its teachings. It was thus brought into direct conflict with the fundamental axioms of the Bible, which could not be overridden by the simple process of abrogation, as was the case with ritual observances. The man who first applied the Zahirite method to the Bible was Abu a ohammed Ali, better known as Ibn Hazm al-Zdhiri 3 He was a native of Cordova, and born in 994, only one year after Samuel b. Nagrela, who was a native of the same town. Now the name of Samuel b. Nagrela is sufficient to remind us that at this period Cordova was one of the foremost centres of Jewish learning. Famous men were on the increase. HIisdai b. Shafrut, Menahem, and Diinash had just died, but besides these, such men as Moses b. Hanokh, Josef b. Abitur, Jahuda Hayyuj brought renown to the city. In spite of his fanaticism, Ibn Hazm was The main doctrine of the Zahirite is expressed in nuce in the following words by Ibn HIazm (fol. 72vo): "We acknowledge in our religion nothing but what is contained in the Qoran, or what is founded on reliable and trustworthy tradition, as being taught by the messenger of Allah. Everything else we regard as of no account." 2 Die Zahiriten und ihr Lehrsystem, Leipzig, 1884. 8 See Ibn Khallikan, Biographical Dictionary, transl. by de Slarfe, II, p. 267 sqq., cf.

He makes special mention of Josef b. A bdalldh, Kddhi (or Day yan) of Cordova1, whose Hebrew name was probably Josef b. Obadyah. On another occasion he alludes to "a person well read in Hebrew," with whom he conversed on the etymology of the name Israel . A third discussion with a Jewish authority will be noticed later on. Mohammedan biographers record among Ibn Hazm's writings a treatise Exposure of the alterations (in the Bible) made by Jews ard Christians3. This is, however, but a special title given to the first section of his large work entitled Book of Religions and Denominations, of which several MS. copies are in existence. It is from this work that the following observations are taken, but I have only selected such as refer to the Old Testament. Before discussing them we will briefly consider the scope and method of Ibn Hazm. His object in criticizing the Bible was to substantiate the charges brought by Mohammed against Jews (and Christians) of falsifying their holy Writs. His strict way of interpreting the Qoran led him to take this accusation in its literal sense, and he therefore thought he was but fulfilling a religious duty in pointing out those passages in the Bible where the advent of Mohammed had been foretold, or those verses which appear to contradict one another, or seemed to be opposed to absolute mono- theism. Each passage of the Bible to which Ibn Iazm attaches his criticism is preceded by a literal Arabic translation, or by the interpolation of part of a verse in his reasonings. The question now arises whence did he take his translation? In the majority of passages he evidently followed Saadyah's version, but in others he did not do so. To the latter class belong his versions of Exod. xv4 (beginning only) and ' Fol. 36vo. 2 Fol. Igr0, see App., No. IV. 3 Ibn Khall., ibid., HI.aji Khalifah, I, p. 346 (No. 888). 4 See App., No. V. 226</page><page sequence="6">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE Deut. xxxii 1, and it is not unlikely that these were trans- lated for him by one of his Jewish friends in Cordova. But even in many verses taken from Saadyah he did not adopt his translation blindly, but changed many paraphrastic renderings (especially of anthropomorphistic passages) for more literal ones. I here give a small selection of such passages:- Gen. iv. 15. , vi. 2. ,, Vi. 3 ,, xviii. 3. ,, xxv. 23. SAADYAH. Vengeance multiplied. The sons of the great. My self. O friend of God. The fathers of two nations. IBN HAZM. Vengeance sevenfold. The sons of God. My spirit. My Lord. Two nations. ,, xxxii.27. When the day broke he said unto him, let me go. ,, xxxii. 3I. I have seen the angel of the Lord. And he said, let me go, for the day breaketh. I have seen God. As regards proper nouns, Ibn HJ.azm, like Saadyah, retains their Hebrew spelling, excepting those for which Arabic forms were given in the Qoran or in later works. His system of transliteration into Arabic characters is, however, not quite consistent, as in a few cases he attempted phonetic spelling, as in .:i4, where he replaced sere by an inserted yodh. Writing as he did for learned Arab theologians, the language of his translations is, on the whole, purer than Saadyah's, whose chief aim was to provide a Targum for Arabic-speaking Jews. Ibn Hazm was so convinced that the Bible, as he read it, had been tampered with by the Rabbis, that he reviled it continually, and only spoke of it with scorn. On more Published by M. Schreiner, Semitic Studies (in memory of Dr. Kohut), P. 499 sq. 227</page><page sequence="7">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW than one occasion he alluded to it in such terms as "the changed and altered book," or even "the cursed book." The following argument is taken from the introduction to his Book of Religions and Denonminations 1." Says Abu Mohammed: The first point is that in the hands of the Samaritans there is a Torah which is not the same which is in the hands of the other Jews. They (the Samaritans) assert that theirs had been revealed to Moses, and point out that the one in the hands of the other Jews is changed and altered. A Samaritan (Codex of the) Torah does not come into our hands, because they do not allow it to go out of Palestine and (the land of) the Jordan. Yet we know that their Torah teaches that from Adam's dismissal from the Garden of Eden to the time of the Flood there elapsed I367 years, whilst the Torah which is in the hands of the Rabbanites and Ananites gives '650 for the same period, and the Torah which the seventy Elders of the Jewish Rabbis translated for King Ptolemy, which the Christians also use as authority, states that from the dismissal of Adam from the Garden of Eden to the Flood there elapsed 2242 years. Another Torah belonging to one section of the Jews gives 657 years and eight months, less eight days. We cannot place much reliance on the correctness of the figures in our MS., so that it is rather difficult to find out the sources from which Ibn Hazm drew them. The last number 657 is evidently a mistake for I657, the copyist having omitted the word alf (thousand). This number would be nearly identical with the 1650 mentioned above, as taken from the Torah, and the 1656 years given by Josephus and in the Midrash (Ber. R., Gen. xi. I). At all events we see that Ibn Hazm gathered information from various Jewish sources (all of which he includes in the term Torah), and that he knew of the Septuagint and the current story of its origin. Enough discrepancies in the numbers of years given in the different Torahs, however, remained to warrant the assertion that some of them must be false. Gen. ii. I0-14, Ibn Hazm2 translates exactly like Saadyah, viz. that Pishon is "the Nile which encircles the whole 1 Fol. 2r0; see App., No. I. 228 2 Fol. 2vo.</page><page sequence="8">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE country of ZawVla," a country supposed by Arab geographelrs to be situated in the Suidn 1. Now the next verse states that the Jihan surrounds the whole country of IHIabesh, but, says Ibn HIazm, there is no other stream in this whole territory except the Nile. Consequently God cannot have said that the Nile surrounds Zawila, whilst the Jihan en- compasses Habesh, because the latter river has its sources in Rum (probably Asia Minor), and flows into the Mediterranean Sea. Another objection made by Ibn Hazm is that there are no pearls (b'dolah) to be found in Zawila, but only in the Persian and Indian seas, and in the rivers of India and China. Of special interest are those passages in which Moham- medan readers of the Bible, and Ibn Hazm in particular, fancied they had discovered polytheistic leanings. These were solely due to Rabbinic corruptions, and Ibn Hazm criticizes them in most acrimonious terms. I shall only discuss three of these, viz. Gen. iii. 22 ("man is become one of us "), vi. 2 (" the sons of Elohim "), and Exod. iv. 22 (" Israel is my son, even my firstborn"). In his criticism of the first of these verses, Ibn H.azm observes that it has led many of the best Jews to believe in an intermediate deity2. It is unmistakable that in the words "best of the Jews" he alludes to Philo, whose theology he describes as senseless heresy. In his notes on Gen. vi. 2, Ibn IHazm criticizes "one of their sages of the past," who explains the words ' sons of Elohim" by "angels." Such, however, is Saadyah's translation, and there can therefore be no doubt that Ibn Hazm had this in his mind3. Now this touches one of the chief points of contention between Mohammedan and Jewish interpreters of the anthropomorphistic passages of the Bible. The Qoran avoids divine attributes, such as "Father," "Man of war," "Rock," or " Fountain of living waters," and only on one Cf. Yacut, ed. Wiistenfeld, II, p. I70. 2 See App., No. II. 3 Ibid., No. III. 229</page><page sequence="9">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW occasion did Mohammed give way so far as to call Allah '" Light of the heavens and the earth1." He could not, however, dispense with the subordinate anthropomorphism, and described God as speaking, writing, sitting on his throne which is borne by angels, and even as cunning2. MlIohammedan theologians were at first not a little em- barrassed by such expressions, but finally had the good sense to explain them as based on imbued doctrines which were not to be taken literally. The Zahirites, too, were forced to take them in an allegorical sense, although this was inconsistent with their teachings (App., No. V). Before dealing with Ibn Hazm's criticism of Exod. iv. 22, I should here like to draw attention to the remarks attached to the same verse by one of the brightest Arab litterateurs of a much earlier epoch. This was Amr b. Bahr AlJahiz, who lived in Basra, and died in 868. It is exceedingly interesting to observe that not only had this man already studied the Bible in an Arabic version, but to judge from one mistranslated passage 3, seems to have tried to translate frorm the original itself. As he lived one hundred years before Saadyah, the few specimens of his renditions into Arabic of Biblical verses are the oldest we possess, and occur in an epistolar treatise styled Refutation of Christianity. The abstract runs as follows:- They (the Christians) say: In the Torah the words "Israel is my firstborn" are to be found, and all that you mention as emanating from us occurs in the books (of the Bible), as is well known. My answer is: On account of their scant knowledge of the different meanings of speech, and their bad and injudicious translation, the people employed terms which appealed to their minds. Had they possessed the minds of Moslims, and the know]edge of what the Arabic language admits, as well as what terms were permissible to be applied to God, in addition to their mastery of the Hebrew tongue, they would have found a fine explanation and an easy way out [of the difficulties] of this term. If they did not deny the attributes (of Qor. xxiv. 35. 2 e.g. Qor. ii. 256; iii. 47; iv. 69, &amp;c. 3 Probably Ps. xci. 8. 230</page><page sequence="10">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE God) in other passages they translate, one could criticize and attack them. They assert, however, that God said in the decalogue which the fingers of God have written: I am the Almighty, I am the strong God, I am the fire which devours the fires, taking the children for the guilt of the fathers, the first, the second, the third to the seventh generation. And David said in the Psalms: Open thine eyes, O Lord1; stand up, 0 Lord2, do thou for me thy hearing3, O Lord. In another place David says of God: God wakes up as wakes up the drunkard who has drunk wine4. Moses said in the Torah: God created the things through his word, and through the spirit of his soul . God has further said in the Torah to the children of Israel: My strong arm has brought you forth from the people of Egypt. He has also said in the Book of Isaiah 6: I praise God in a new song, I praise him in the remotest corners of the earth, the isles and their inhabitants, and the seas and the deserts and all that is therein; the children of Kedar in their castles, and the inhabitants of the moun- tains-viz. Kedar, the son of Ismael-shout forth and give glory and greatness to God. In the isles they clothe themselves in God's praise. He goes on saying: The Lord lives like a man of war and like a strenuous man who incites to war, pushes on, shouts and makes war, who slays his enemies. Heaven and earth rejoice. God says further in the book of Isaiah: He is silent when I am silent, like a woman in travail about to bring forth I sigh. Behold me, I will plough up the mountains and the tribes, and will take hold of the blind and lead them a way which they know not. No man of learning will tolerate the translation into Arabic of such passages, and more in the same strain. There are many more similar verses which I have omitted because thou art acquainted with them. Thou knowest that had the Jews translated the Qoran into Hebrew, they would have altered its sense and changed its aspect. Dost thou not think that, had they done so, they would have angered us, and we would have resented it ? Treat carefully [phrases like]: "The heavens shall be rolled up in his right hand (Qor. xxxix. 67)," or "He settled on the throne (xx. 4)," or "[Faces on that day] shall be bright, gazing on their Lord (xcv. 22)," or "When his Lord appeared unto the mountain (vii. I39)," or "But Moses did God speak to, speaking (iv. I62)," or "Thy Lord comes with the angels rank on rank (Ixxxix. 1 This is not in the Psalms. 2 Ps. cxxxii. 8. 3 As 3x 1 1 is probably mistranslation of Int? 1o5 snt nwr, Ps. cix. 2i. 4 Ps. lxxviii. 65. 5 Ps. xxxiii. 6 with copyist's mistake, who read aiJ for s.i. 6 Isaiah xlii. 0o sqq. 231</page><page sequence="11">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 23)." Thou knowest that the commentators of our Book and our interpreters are better informed and more learned in matters of language than the Jews and the interpreters of the books [of the Bible]. We find in their exegesis what must not be applied to God when giving him attributes, neither among the analogies of the mutakallimun' , nor in the philological endeavours of the grammarians. What canst thou do with the nonsense of the Jews and their eccentricity, their defective penetration and imitation? In this chapter the Arabs themselves and the learned linguists have erred, since their hearts erred, and their minds went astray. How much more was this the case with others who did not equal them in knowledge! If we consider that these are the words of a man who was a Mutazilite of Mutazilites, we get a fair estimate of the manner in which the Biblical method of expressing divine attributes was regarded even by the most en- lightened Moslims. There is hardly a greater contrast imaginable than between AlJahiz and Ibn Hazm in matters of theology, yet the difference between them in dealing with anthropomorphisms, such as in Exod. iv. 22, is small, and chiefly marked by the more or less strong language employed. Ibn HIazm is shocked at the assumption of ascribing children to God, adding that this stands much below the Christian dogma of the fatherhood of God. The expressions used by him on the occasion are almost too violent for reproduction2. The following quotation illustrates more fully what, according to Hazm3, was the heathenish turn which Rabbinic Judaism had taken:- All Rabbanite Jews, are destined to be united in the wrath of God and his curse. They pray4 on the night of Kippur, which is the tenth of Tishri in October. Then rises Ansatrin 5-which according to their opinion signifies the "minor Lord" (far from God such heresy). He stands up, tears his hair, weeps a little, and says: Woe unto me since I have destroyed my house and made my sons and Theological philosophers. 2 Fol. 27v0. 3 Fol. 72ro. 4 C(iJ , but probably cJL. g 5 Copyist's mistake for Metatron. 232</page><page sequence="12">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE 233 daughters orphans and my people upset'. I cannot raise them up again until a prophet comes to whom I will restore my sons and daughters-and more such language. Know that they have assigned a number of days of October in which they worship a lord who is another than God. In this they arrive at sheer polytheism. You should know that the minor Lord is the one to whom they have assigned those special days to worship him beside God, is the angel Sandalfon, servant of the crown which is on the head of the being they adore. This is worse than Christian heresy. I spoke to one of them on this subject, and he answered me: Metatr6n is one of the angels, &amp;c. It only now remains for us to inquire into the causes which, in Ibn Hazm's opinion, have led the Jews to fall into such grave errors. His concluding words are as follows 2: After several hundred years some people of the house of Aaron came into power. Sacrifices ceased, copies of the Torah were multi- plied and circulated in the form which the Jews now possess. Their Rabbis composed prayers for them which took the place of sacrifices. The Rabbis contrived a new religion for them; they built Synagogues in every place in opposition to the custom upheld during their independence, more than four hundred years. They arranged gather- ings every Sabbath day, as they do now, also in opposition to previous custom. For [in those times] they had in their towns no house of worship or gathering for religious purposes, nor a place for sacrifices at all, except the Temple alone, or, prior to the Temple, the Tent. This is where the difference lies. The proof3 of this is that they admit to be stated in the Book of Joshua b. Nun, that the children of Reuben, Gad, and half a tribe of Manasse built an altar on their return from conquering the country near the Jordan and Palestine to their own country east of the Jordan. Joshua and the rest of Israel wanted to make war against them until they sent them a message, saying: We did not build this [altar] to offer up sacrifices, nor to worship at all; heaven forbid that we should find another place beside that one in which are the tent and the house of God. Thereupon they let them alone 4. But apart from this there is sufficient evidence for one who has understanding that it (the Bible) is altered and full of untruth and apocryphal, as Judaism it is also an apocryphal religion in contrast to the one they confess to have received from Moses. Satan himself does not wish to 1 Talmud Berakhoth, fol. 3r0. 3 App., No. VI. 2 Fol. 56vo. i Joshua xxii. 9 sqq.</page><page sequence="13">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW pursue more than this, and an error graver than this. Heaven protect us from such heresy! Furthermore, the Torah, translated by the Seventy Elders for King Ptolemy after the propagation of the Torah, which they forgot, stands in opposition to the one which Ezra the Scribe wrote down for them. The Christians hold that there are differences in the Septuagint respecting the eras with the exception of the time between Adam and Noah. On account of these differences there is an uncertainty between the era of the Jews and that of the Christians, exceeding a thousand years and more, as we will show later on. For this reason truth comes out, as well as the lie of the Seventy Elders in their endeavour to hand down what is false. These are the men who took their religion in hand. Woe and alas to a religion taken from people whose untruth is thus established. Furthermore, in the fifth Book of the Torah, called Deuteronomy, it is stated that God said to Moses 1: Make two tablets like the first ones, and go up to the mountain, and make an ark of wood that I may write on the tablets the Ten Commandments which the Lord made you hear on the mount out of the midst of the flame, when you were gathered with him. He gave them to me, I went down from the mountain, and placed them in the ark in which they are to this day. Such are the arguments brought forward by Moham- medan theologians and philosophers against the authenticity of the Bible. Their criticism differs considerably from what we understand by this word, because it was not historical, but dictated by a combination of dogma and odiurz theologicum. Considering that the authoritative character of this controversy gave it great weight in the eyes of a nation among which Jews only lived on sufferance, and might even have had an unfavourable influence on many less learned Jews, Jewish theologians saw the necessity of taking precautions against such teachings. Maimonides lays stress on the unaltered character of the Bible not only in the Moreh (ii. 39), but there can be no doubt that the Articles VIII and IX of his Thirteen Articles of Creed were written with the express purpose of refuting Mohammedan charges against Rabbinic altera- tion of the Torah, as well as the Qoranic dogma of the 1 x. i-6. 234</page><page sequence="14">MOHAMMEDAN CRITICISM OF THE BIBLE abrogation of the Jewish law. I quote the opening pas- sages of these two articles in translation from the Arabic original 1. " Art. VIII teaches the heavenly origin of the Torah. This implies the belief that the whole of this Torah, as it is found in our hands to-day, is the same Torah which was revealed to Moses, and originates entirely from God." "Art. IX concerning Abrogation: To wit that the Law of Moses has never been abrogated, nor has there come another Law from God. Nothing was added to the Torah, nor was anything taken away from it, neither in the text nor in its interpretation." The object of these sentences is hardly comprehensible unless taken from the point of view of protest. IIARTWIG HIRSCHFELD. APPENDIX. I. Ibn Hazm. Cod. Brit. Mus. Or. 842.

My Lord is he who has been [our] saviour, whom I will praise, and the Lord whom I will extol; the Lord who killeth, like the strong man of war. In the fifth Book he says: The Lord is a devouring fire. Says Abu Mohammed: It is a grievous turpitude to compare Allah to a mighty man, and to say that he is a devouring fire is most unlucky. One of them (the Jews) asked me concerning this point: "Does not your book (the Qoran) contain the passage, Allah is the light of the heavens and the earth (Qor. xxiv. 35) ?"' I answered: "Yes!" But when Abu Darr2 asked the messenger of God, "Hast thou not seen thy Lord ?" the latter replied, "I see a light." It is, however, clear that the verse in question does not allude to a visible fire, but to an invisible one. The meaning of "The light of the heavens and the earth"-as soon as it is certain that this is not a visible fire which has a colour-is to describe a "light of the heavens and the earth" which guides its inhabitants and nothing else. "Light" is one of God's attributes only, as are the words of (the same verse): "His light is compared to a lamp ... no fire touched it." God compares his guiding light to the " lamps " mentioned by him. He likens one created thing to another, as he points out in the words that follow in the same verse: "Light upon light, Allah guides whomsoever he wishes to his light." VI.
