<plain_text><page sequence="1">SIXTY YEARS OF PHILOSOPHICAL EXPERIENCE* Like other long-lived thinkers of this century, such as Dewey, Whitehead, Croce, Santayana, Etienne Gilson and Jacques Maritain, Dr. Sellars received his philosophical baptism a long time ago. For two generations his interests have been alive and young, and not only his positions but the phrases and sentences in which he declared them have been many times repeated. With Sellars, the main challenge has always been man contem- plating given nature, man interrogating nonhuman nature and inter- rogating man himself. What kind of thing is mind which claims to know itself and to know many diverse things and to put them all together under "knowledge"? What is man? What is his place in the universe? Does he have any given place or is he totally on his own in making a place? In one of his few anthropomorphic lapses, Dr. Sellars once asked whether the universe is "friendly." His good sense and relevance are seen in his designation of philos- ophy a generation ago as "a persistent attempt to understand the universe in which we find ourselves and of which we are a part." The present volume is a compendium of his philosophy, astounding not only for its comprehensiveness, covering at once the history of Western thought and his own positions, but paying attention to scores of thinkers, some big and lasting, some now fading away except in Dr. Sellar's capacious memory. A weakness of the volume is the attempt to do too much and give a pro or con nod to everybody. Schleiermacher gets five or six lines, McTaggart half a line, a procedure showing the author's immense erudition, but doing little to enlighten the reader. Sellars has always been exercized by problems of value and criteria of values. As a realist he has asked whether value is found in nature and whether goals and paths to goals are in any sense preset for man and society. Is man by nature a social animal? Does man naturally want to know? Is knowledge naturally a good or made a good only by our choice and decision? These are old and recurrent Sellars' questions. He has never been able to give a once-for-all reply and get the questions out of his way. However, writing on "The Nature and Status of Value" in his Philosophy of Physical Realism (1932), he offered this incomparable formulation: "I shall treat it as an interpretation of an object as * Roy Wood Sellars: Social Patterns and Political Horizons.

He certainly is justified in seeing this summary of (contributory) value as realistic and pragmatic-though he says not too pragmatic- and as falling within naturalistic humanism. -LEO R.
