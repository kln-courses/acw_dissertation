<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ivar Paulson THE ANIMAL GUARDIAN: A CRITICAL AND SYNTHETIC REVIEW In the course of the following short critical and synthetic review, we shall first of all cite those studies which, within the greater total complex of the ancient hunter religion, have generally had to do with religious beliefs in various kinds of animal guardians. Second, we shall consider those studies within a more regionally restricted area, that is, North Eurasia, which touch upon this complex of questions. Our end is, finally, to sketch a comprehensive synthesis, global in scope, which will be based both upon the works mentioned and upon the results of our research in the area in question. The synthetic part of our presentation will informally follow the critical and historical survey. I More than twenty years ago Hermann Baumann published his meri- torious article on African spirits of game and the bush-an area of research in which Leo Frobenius had already preceded him.l Since that time, such hunter beliefs about animal guardians have been ardently Translated from the German by Nancy E.

In a very stimulating programmatic review of research on the early hunting cultures, Adolph Friedrich, the Ger- man ethnologist who so tragically died a short time ago during his field research in the Hindu Kush region, noted the growth of interest in this area of research that took place among ethnologists during the decade following World War I.2 Two decades of new and rewarding works in this area of research have already passed since the publica- tion of his review. A few years ago, Carl-Martin Edsman, the Swedish historian of religions, published in Swedish a historiographical resume of studies on the religion of the hunter; in it the current situation of the study and its task were again critically scrutinized.3 We are greatly indebted to the worthy presentations of our predecessors, but in this review we are attempting, in contrast to the latter, to define the problem more sharply-and more narrowly-in that we are sepa- rating out from the greater complex of hunter religion its beliefs about the guardian of animals. In the course of the last decade, scholars have been carefully in- vestigating, cataloguing, and describing those supernatural beings (spirits and gods) that appear as animal guardians in many regionally connected areas. Otto Zerries, for example, has studied South and Central America,4 Joseph Haekel, Meso-America,5 Ake Hultkrantz, North America,6 and this writer, North Eurasia.7 Nonetheless, we have complete studies, that is, studies involving a systematic arrange- 2 A.

A. Dirr has a series of short and regionally limited studies on Caucasia;9 Leopold Schmidt has done the same kind of work in a number of European areas.'1 Lutz Rohr- ich recently published a rich and comprehensive study on European wild-animal spirits, based on materials from the legends of various parts of Europe." Shortly afterward, Edmund Mudrak followed with a brief critical article.'2 More recently, the discipline of comparative religions has taken an increasingly greater interest in the figure of the animal guardian, approaching it through the history and morphology of culture and the phenomenology of religions.'3 For North Eurasia, the area of the writer's own research on the problem, in an area which has preserved much of the ancient cultural heritage of the hunter-because it was primarily populated by hunters -there are excellent publications of old and new source materials to facilitate treatment of the problem.14 There are also several smaller and larger studies on the so-called practical religion of the North Eurasian hunter, that is, on the various magical customs and cere- monies of the hunt. But unfortunately they consider the animal guardians only in passing and very briefly, without assessing their role within the total complex of beliefs.

In the great surveys and collections of source materials which Harva later published on the religion of the Finno-Ugric and Altaic peoples, he touched upon this complex in many places and in various contexts; nonetheless he never singled it out for discussion in its entirety.7 The animal guardian is also briefly mentioned in the comparative study of the North American scholar Irving Hallowell on bear ceremonies among the peoples of North Eurasia and North America,'8 as well as in later and more regionally restricted studies on the bear cult conducted by various other schol- ars.19 F. Gahs dealt with the question at greater depth in his histori- cally oriented investigation of head, skull, and bone sacrifices among the reindeer-peoples of the northern part of Eurasia and arctic Amer- ica (the Eskimos). But unfortunately his studies are rendered rather one-sided by their entanglement in the theory of so-called Ur-Mono- theism, that is, the theory of an original and exclusive belief in a high god.20 Next to the Finnish scholar Harva, it is the Russian D. Zelenin who has most exhaustively and impressively studied the hunting cul- ture and the religious beliefs of hunters (including the animal guardian); his exposition of ancient religious beliefs among the peoples of northern Eurasia is based on voluminous research.21 Unfortunately, however, his presentation suffers gravely from the Marxist-materialist theories with which he had to comply. In a comprehensive study of the hunting rites of the Siberian peo- ples, the French scholar Eveline Lot-Falck summarily discussed the 17 U.

As we have said, however, none of them are specialized studies; they allude to the animal guardian only in passing and within other con- texts (hunting rites, the bear cult, etc.). As a rule, they never come to a phenomenological analysis of the structure or an exposition of its religious content. Unfortunately, in so short a presentation, we cannot discuss those often very important and very valuable articles in which various scholars have presented the results of their field research in more circumscribed regions.24 I have approached my own investigation of the complex in question from two directions. On the one hand were my studies on the ritual use of animal bones in hunting ceremonies, or the so-called bone ritual of the hunter;25 other scholars had written on this subject before;26 I reviewed their work and analyzed it from the perspective of the Religionswissenschaft school.27 On the other hand, it was the problem of the concept of the soul, and especially the concept of the animal or wild-animal soul28-as well as the concept of the protective spirit 22 Eveline Lot-Falck, Les Rites de chasse chez les peuples siberiens (Paris, 1953). 23 Das Tier als Gott, Ddmon und Ahne.

From my investigation of the animal-guardian complex in North Asia (Siberia), and in North Eurasia in general,30 I then came to study similar beliefs existing among the Finnish farming peoples who in- habit Northern Europe.3' The folk culture of these people, so rich in interesting and archaic traits, has thus far been overlooked by inter- national scholarship. They belong to the peoples of the greater Finno- Ugrian or Uralic linguistic family, which extends on both sides of the northern Urals, that is, into both northeastern Europe and North- west Siberia.32 Their homeland is a strategically located region of North Europe whose ancient cultural unity, with roots reaching back into the Middle Stone Age, permits it to constitute a bridge between the culturally and ecologically distinct ecotypes of agricultural North Europe and hunting North Asia.33 Because of their close cultural and historical ties with the linguistically related and for the most part primarily hunter tribes of Northwest Siberia (Ostyaks, Voguls, Samo- yedes, etc.) and because of the great role played until very recently by hunting and fishing in their own economy, the Finnish people have potentially a great deal to contribute to the study of ancient religious beliefs and practices among the hunters of Europe.34 On the whole, the chief means of subsistence in the arctic and subarctic lands of the peoples of northern Eurasia-with tundra and taiga being the dominant ecological factors in the environment- have been, to a greater or lesser degree, hunting and fishing.35 There are tribes which depend exclusively upon hunting and fishing, but there also exist tribes in which reindeer-breeding has overlaid and 29 See my "Die Vorstellungen von den Seelen und den Schutzgeistern der Tiere bei einigen nordasiatischen (sibirischen) Volkern," in The Supernatural Owners of Nature, ed.

One of the best recent reviews on this theme. 207</page><page sequence="7">The Animal Guardian partially suppressed the older way of life (e.g., the Tundra Samoyedes and the Reindeer Chukchi and Samoyedes). Again, among some ethnic groups the primary means of subsistence is hunting (e.g., among many Tungusic tribes); among others, who live along the great and little rivers, it is fishing (e.g., the Ostyaks, Voguls, Golds, etc.). There are also some local groups which participate equally in both hunting and fishing (e.g., the Yukaghirs and a few Tungusic tribes). Besides the hunter and fisher groups of the continent, there are maritime tribes living in the extreme northeast of Siberia who fish and hunt sea mammals (Maritime Chukchi and Koryaks, the old Itelmen, and the Asiatic Eskimos). In the southeast (Russian Far East), there is a double economy that is partly continental and partly maritime hunting and fishing (among the Gilyaks and Ainu).36 Among the Finnish folk of northeastern Europe and their neighbors (Russians, Turkic tribes) the economy is agricultural, but hunting and fishing still play a very important role. In the extreme northwest of North Eurasia we again encounter, among the Lapps, an ancient hunting culture on which reindeer-breeding was later superimposed.37 The cattle-raising nomads of Central Asia together with their off- shoots in North Asia (Turkic and Mongolian tribes) fall outside the limits of our investigation. The hunter economy has survived among them only in small enclaves (in the Altai and Sayan mountains) which can be traced ethnogenetically to an alien, autochthonous substratum of population which was Samoyedic and Ketic in origin.38 As among the nomadic horned-cattle breeders of central Asia and Southwest Siberia, so among the reindeer-breeding nomads of the tundra, the role of hunting is subordinate. The religious beliefs of the reindeer-breeders, however, have been clearly stamped by the beliefs of the older hunter religion. The old animal guardians, reinterpreted, have become guardians of the domesticated reindeer; or they have been partially assimilated to the high god-who is the principal pro- tector of the world as well as of men. Together with the latter, they constitute a unity which can hardly have been original as, for ex- ample, Father Wilhelm Schmidt and his followers have claimed.39 36 Cf. M. G. Levin and L. P.

The clarification and systematic consideration of these local differences was the chief task of my monograph Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes . . . ("Guard- ians and Gods of the Game. . .") My investigation moved within the same regional boundaries as a series of earlier publications on other areas of research in the history of religions and ethnology of North Eurasia.40 Although, in this great double continent, we are dealing with peoples of very different cultural and ethnological origins (Finno- Ugric-Uralian [Samoyedic], Ketic, Tungusic, and the so-called Paleo- Asiatic or Paleo-Siberian peoples, etc.) there is still, at the foundation or substratum of their cultural level, a general ecological and, in part, historical unity-a fact which has frequently been pointed out by comparative ethnologists.41 It is precisely this ancient, deep-lying, and common cultural substratum which has given rise to the object of our study, the ancient hunter belief in the animal guardian. Thus a comprehensive synoptical and comparative treatment of this archaic form of belief, as it exists within the given regional area, can readily be justified and carried out. In my studies, oriented to the history of religion, I have considered my primary task to be comprehending the religious content of the ancient hunter belief in the animal guardian; to this end I have used the descriptive method of the ethnology of religion and the compara- tive and hermeneutic method of the phenomenology of religion.42 I have attempted, out of the sources available to me, namely, first-hand primary reports-which I submitted to thorough and critical scrutiny -to give as complete as possible an inventory and exposition of the object of my research. It is almost superfluous to note of my sources -which were for the most part written in Russian, Finnish, and the Scandinavian languages and thus are not readily accessible to Western scholarship-that, although they were rather evenly distributed with 40 See, e.g., G. Rank, Die heilige Hinterecke im Hauskult der Volker Nord- osteuropas und Nordasiens ("Folklore Fellows Communications," Vol. CXXXVII [Helsinki, 1949]); M.

Spatially, some regions of the greater area of North Eurasia are more, and others less, well docu- mented, according as the research in the individual ethnic units was carried out. For example, we have very detailed reports on some of the very widespread and multibranched Tungusic tribes,43 but for others our information is very poor.44 Chronologically, our sources are almost all concerned with the period which extended from the mid- nineteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth; a few, how- ever, as those on the Lapps, permit a deeper backward glance. As competent authorities have often pointed out, archeological materials can only be used in very limited measure for the interpretation of religious beliefs.45 At this point we can only make a few short comments on the termi- nology of the hunter belief in question. In the existing literature of the great world languages the guardians of animals or game have been called by very different names. Thus, for example, in English we have "guardian," "lord," "master," "owner," etc. "of the game," "of the animals," or, respectively, "of the woods, forests," etc. In- deed, nature spirits manifested as the protective spirits of animals often do seem to parallel or to alternate with the genuine animal guardians; and sometimes the two varieties are merged into a single unified structure. In French, such terms have been used as "maitre des animaux, des bois," "genie des bois," "etres guardiens (surnatu- rels) du gibier," etc. In German, there are an enormous number of names, such as: "Besitzer (or Besitzergeist)," "Eigner," "Eigen- tiimer," "Hiiter" ("Tierhiiter, Tierhiitergeist"), "Kontrollgeist," "Patrongeist," "Tiergeist," "Tiergottheit," "Wildgeist," "Wild- hiiter," "Herr" or "Herrin der Tiere," "Vater" and "Mutter der Tiere," etc. Some of the preceding scholarly terms have been taken over from autochthonous terms in the languages of the natives-as, for example, "father" and "mother," transferred from the realm of family life to the animal realm-but some are just academic fabrica- tions. For the sake of consistency I have everywhere used "animal guardian" (both guardian spirit and deity of the animals or the game).46 43 S. M.

The Supernatural Owners of Nature on the terminology of related con- ceptions. 210</page><page sequence="10">Besides the genuine animal guardians, we must take into account the countless local and interlocal or multilocal nature spirits or nature gods of the bush, mountain, forest, and waters and other realms and elements of nature, who function generally as the protectors of the animals within their own realms. Again, it is important that we limit ourselves within this presentation only to those supernatural beings which actually function as protectors of game. The various spirits and deities who probably help the hunter in his hunt or the fisher in his occupation, that is, the personal guardian spirits of man, the sha- man-spirits, etc., but who in no way function as guardians of the game, are therefore excluded from this definition. The genuine animal guardian is distinguished by a double function; on the one hand, he is a protector of the game; on the other, he is the helper of the hunter or fisher. In this connection, a guardian of the game can, of course, take on the role of the guardian spirit of a man-especially of the shaman-and thus come to appear with the latter function.47 II In the context of the world-wide cultural and geographical background which the works at hand, including those of this writer, have sketched for the various continents surrounding North Eurasia-that is, America and Eurasia-let us now venture a brief synthetic prospect attempting to situate the animal guardian within the general cultural- historical framework of the development of religion, as that develop- ment is known to us. We do not wish, however, to bind ourselves in this connection to any rigid historical reconstruction. A cultural- historical exposition of the game-guardian complex can only be effected in the context or against the background of a general cultural history of the continents in question. Until the latter project has been satisfactorily completed-and thus far it has not been-the former task must wait.48 Our statement must therefore be much more of a phenomenological one.49 By ordering, phenomenologically, the results of such work as 47 Holmberg, Finno-Ugric, Siberian, pp. 496 ff., and his Die religibsen Vorstel- lungen der altaischen Volker, pp. 465 ff.; Eliade, Schamanismus und archaische Ekstasetechnik, pp. 96 ff., 103 ff., 157 ff., 430 ff. 48 Cf.

Our phenomenological organization must not be misconstrued as representing a specific historical evolution of the complex; the typology has been determined much more by purely psychogenetic and ecological factors. They themselves emerge from the rich materials with a self-evidence which requires no other justi- fication. 1. The author has found that the most fundamental element within the structure of the game-guardian complex as it exists in North Eurasia is the belief in the animal soul.5' The same conclusion is equally valid for the other two continents-South and North America-in whose cultural profiles hunting is also strongly accented.52 In the high cultural belt of Meso-America, however, the phenomenon has either become weakened or does not appear at all.53 On the borders of the high cultural belt of Eurasia-extending from East Asia to the ancient Near East-the belief in the animal soul can only be found sporadically as, for example, in the mountainous area of Central Asia (the region of Haramosh).54 Thus we may say with some degree of confidence that the belief in the animal soul belongs, in the history of culture, to a deep-lying stratum of hunter culture which has faded or disappeared wherever planting or agriculture have been superim- posed on it. In the transition to the more intensive economic form, there was lost the peculiar focus of interest of the hunter which had 60 Cf. my Vom Wesen und aus der Geschichte der Religion ("Papers of the Estonian Theological Society in Exile," Popular Series 2 [Stockholm, 1963]), pp. 31 ff.

Certainly this is connected with man's changed attitude toward the world of animals; a domesticated animal was to a certain extent under his mastery-a mastery largely determined by purely economic factors. Thus much of the earlier numinous power and holiness experienced by the hunter in his en- counter with the game was lost. Of course, cattle and other domesti- cated animals also retain their religious-ritual significance in cult and myth, as is amply demonstrated in the old high cultures. They are, however, for the most part not themselves the immediate bearers of holiness; much more often they are, less directly, the agents or the forms of manifestation of a higher and often anthropomorphic di- vinity.65 The ecological and psychological background for the rise and disappearance of the phenomenon consequently is at hand. 2. In my research on North Eurasia, I have been able to gather the following evidence in support of the hypothesis that the game- guardian belief originated at least partially in the concept of the animal soul.56 The soul of an individual animal often functions as his guardian (the so-called guardian soul). If, however, the guardian soul of an individual animal becomes the protector of the species of the animal in question-often the souls of the individual animals dis- appear (although not in equal measure) into a great "collective soul" of the species-then we have a belief in the guardian spirit or soul of the species.57 The belief in the spirit of the species is an essential element in the game-guardian complex and in all hunter cultures it plays a considerable role. There are guardian spirits of the several species of animals in South, Central, Meso-, and North America; they are also to be found throughout North Eurasia, in Central Asia, in the Caucasus, in the Alpine region of Central Europe, and in Scandinavia. In the remainder of Eurasia, however, such ideas have been pushed into the background or completely forgotten.58 Along the borders of the high cultures the phenomenon can be found only spo- radically. Among the expressly agricultural cultures of the central and eastern European plains, we have likewise not come across it in the course of our investigation.59 But in the isolated mountain regions of the Old World and in the mountain world of the Scandinavian 65 See, e.g., Eliade, Die Religionen und das Heilige, pp. 71, 91; Goldammer, Die Formenwelt des Religiosen, pp. 55-56, 75 ff. 56 See my Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes, pp. 224 ff.

The higher deities of the game can be distinguished more or less clearly from the genuine guardians of the animal species. First, they possess more or less expressly personal forms, either anthro- pomorphic or theriomorphic, and proper names-the spirits of the species generally take on the collective name of their species. Second, they exercise greater authority over a broader circle of animals, for example, all the land animals, the sea mammals, the birds, the fish. It is these deities of game-the really great "masters" and "mis- tresses" of animals-who have up to now been the primary objects of research.61 In my research on North Eurasia I have been able to show, in a number of instances, that various higher gods of the game have developed out of the guardian spirits of especially important or prominent kinds of animals. In the hunter cultures of the forest, the bear or the guardian spirit of bear rules over the forest and all the animals of the forest (e.g., among the Ostyaks, Voguls, and the Forest Samoyed-Yuraks; among the Lapps, he is called Leibolmai; among the Amur-Tunguses, duonta; among the Gilyaks, he serves as a mes- senger between the mountain and forest gods and man; among the Ainu, he is kamui, the "deity of the mountains and woods"). Among the reindeer breeders of the tundra, the reindeer spirit is venerated over all the game animals as a great god of game (e.g. Corve-Radien, ruler of the reindeer among the Lapps; the game-god Picvu6in of the Chukchi and Koryaks; similarly among the Northern Tunguses, etc.). The maritime coastal cultures of the sea-mammal hunters ven- erate the whale, swordfish, and walrus as "masters of the sea and sea animals" (the Maritime Chukchi and Koryaks, the Eskimos, Gilyaks, and Ainu).62 Similar examples can be found among the American Eskimos (for the whale, seal, caribou, etc.),63 the North American Indians (for the bear, beaver, caribou, etc.),64 and in Central America 60 Ibid., pp. 284 ff. 61 See J. Haekel, "Herr der Tiere," Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, Vol. III (3d ed.; Tiibingen, 1959). 62 See my Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes, pp. 48 ff. 63 Hultkrantz, "Die Religion der amerikanischen Arktis," in Paulson, Hult- krantz, and Jettmar, op. cit., pp. 382 ff. 64 Hultkrantz, "The Owner of Animals ... ," op. cit. 214</page><page sequence="14">(for the wild pig, tapir, and deer)65 and South America (for the tapir, jaguar, wild pig, deer, etc.)66 In the high cultures of Meso-America, however, the situation was different; there the god of the hunt and protector of wild animals (especially the deer-the guardian spirit of deer) was also an earth and a fertility deity, or a universal high god.67 We can cite similar examples from the Old World; in Haramosh, the central mountain region of Asia, the great fertility goddess was also a goddess of wild animals.68 A corresponding figure in the Ancient Near East and in the ancient cultures of the Mediterranean Sea was the "Mistress of Animals" (potnia theron) in her various manifesta- tions.69 In both of the latter areas, however-that is, Central Asia and the Near East-such instances come from elevated cultures pos- sessing agriculture and from old high cultures or areas influenced by them (Haramosh).70 Where the hunting economy is still predominant, as in North Eurasia, in northern North America, and in great segments of South America (in spite of the existence of planting, as Zerries has shown us)71 one can often trace the higher gods of game to their origins in the world of animals or the guardian spirits of the more important species of animals. There are, however, exceptions to this rule. Some of the higher game deities of hunting peoples cannot be incontestably interpreted or understood in this way and may well belong to a type other than that which has been discussed above; an example is the great Eskimo god of sea mammals, which Jensen has pointed to as an example of his so-called Dema-being of the planting peoples.72 In North Eurasia I have also come across a number of such gods who cannot readily be analyzed; I have classified them, according to the evidence on hand, either among the great group of nature beings (the 66 Zerries, "Wildgeister und Jagdritual in Zentralamerika," op. cit. 66 Zerries, Wild- und Buschgeister in Sidamerika, pp. 9 ff., 93 ff. 67 Haekel, "Der 'Herr der Tiere' .. . ," op. cit., pp. 66, 69. 68 Jettmar, Volkerkundliche Forschungen im Haramoschgebiet, pp. 253 f.; idem., "Megalithsystem und Jagdritual bei den Dardvolkern," op. cit., pp. 123 ff. 69 W.

On the one hand are those scholars who claim that the gods of game have been derived from a belief which was originally unified; for them, the plurality of the spirits of game which actually exists in the source materials is something "secondary." For Father Wilhelm Schmidt, who dealt with the problem very comprehensively in connec- tion with the "origin of the belief in God," the "Master of Animals" was not an independent "idea of God"; he was, rather, a "splitting off," a hypostasis, of the Supreme Being, that is, the High God, and he was a "degeneration" of the universal idea of God.75 The writer has not been able to substantiate this thesis in his research on North Eurasia. Conversely, on the basis of his materials, he has shown that the two ideas of god-which are probably so very different in their scope and meaning-are unaffected by one another. The High God is the quintessence and the owner of the world as a whole, but he is especially the highest guardian being of the world and man.76 The spirits of game and the gods of game are the specific guardian beings of their own species and of the entire realm of nature as it is asso- ciated with their respective animal worlds (i.e., the land, the forests, the mountains, the rivers, seas, and ocean). At times the latter are subordinated to one another in a kind of hierarchy (e.g., among the 73 See my Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes, pp. 82 ff., 89 ff., 170 ff., 239 ff. Cf. G. Rank, "The Symbolic Bow in the Birth Rites of North Eurasian Peoples," History of Religions, I, No. 2 (Chicago, 1961), 281-90. 74 So especially in the above listed works of Hultkrantz, Paulson, and Zerries. 76 W.

Both, however, participate equally in the fullness of power of the holy or divine-whether or not such an all-embracing conception has come to any linguistic and conceptual formulation within the ethnic group in question.79 Other scholars have objected to the one-sided monogenetic and ur-monotheistic theories of Father Schmidt and his school. To Adolph E. Jensen, the master of animals seems to be so unique and so specific a figure that he cannot be derivable from the idea of a supreme being; rather, he must have been a unique deity which remained essentially unified among the peoples of the older hunting cultures.80 Jensen, who primarily made use of materials on the African pygmies in his r6sume of the topic-although he also cited examples from other parts of the earth (the Eskimos of North and South America, etc.)-postulated that the master of animals was originally an independent idea of God which existed alongside of the conceptions of the Supreme Being and the Dema-being of the planters. He also emphasized that, phenom- enologically, the divine is revealed through the animal itself.81 For Raffaele Pettazzoni, the Supreme Being of the lower hunter cultures was identical with the master of animals. He finally sum- marized his position as follows: "In more remote times prior to agri- culture and to the breeding of livestock, the Supreme Being was the Lord of Animals. On this Lord depended the success of the hunt."82 The conclusions of Josef Haekel represent a balanced synthesis of all the so-called monogenetic theories on the origin of the gods of game.83 It is interesting that the monogenesis of the gods of game can most strikingly be demonstrated out of source materials from the pygmies 77 W.

Sources from the ancient hunter cultures of North Eurasia and the Americas indicate a different state of affairs; the game-guardian complex seems to be a pluralistic phenomenon, out of which the higher gods of game then emerge as independent and personal figures. Proceeding on the basis of the latter materials, other scholars have advocated a polygenetic development of the game-guardian complex. Probably the first to say that the conception of the animal guardian originated within the animal world itself, that is, with the actual animal, was the Russian scholar, Dmitrij Zelenin, who worked espe- cially with sources from North Asia.84 The nucleus of his theory is undoubtedly correct, although he did not do justice to the roles within the complex either of the idea of the soul or of the conception of the spirit of the species which function as bearers of the holy-powerful- and-divine in the animal. In the footsteps of Zelenin, but without his evolutionistic and materialistic one-sidedness, there followed Adolf Friedrich, whose pioneering preliminary studies have been so important for the study of the hunter religion.85 He very perceptively recognized that the game-guardian complex-including the higher gods of game-must have originated within the actual world of animals, and he acknowledged the role which the conceptions of power and the soul must have played in its development. Unfor- tunately, he never found time for the thorough elaboration of his guiding principles, which exist only in the form of preliminary sketches. But by this time his theories have been strongly supported by an exhaustive inventory and a detailed analysis of the phenomenon as it appears on two continents; that is, through the work of Otto Zerries in South America and of this writer in North Eurasia.86 Thus by today the general structure of the game-guardian complex has come to be well enough known that a polygenetic phenomenology, in the sense of a "development" or genesis, seems to be more probable than a monogenetic one. However, the question of the "origin" of various other higher gods of the game must still remain open, in anticipation of more detailed research in other parts of the earth (especially Africa). It is, indeed, very possible that the latter came into being partially out of the animal world itself-that is, poly- genetically, from the beliefs in the animal soul and the guardian 84 See works cited in n. 21. 85 Friedrich, works cited in nn. 2 and 26. 8 Cf. also the symposium volume "Die Wildbeuter-Kulturen," Paideuma, Vol. VIII, No. 2 (1962). 218</page><page sequence="18">spirits of the species-and partially out of other religious phenomena and realms of belief, for example, in a great and unified god of game (the master or mistress of animals). In North Eurasia, however, such does not seem to be the case, as the research of this writer has indi- cated, and the same is true for those areas of the New World which are primarily inhabited by hunters (South America according to Zerries and North America according to Hultkrantz). Although count- less individual questions still await conclusive answers, those mate- rials from the North Eurasian and American folk-worlds which are known to us and which have been worked through by scholars speak for a polygenesis of the game-guardian belief. The animals themselves -as individual beings possessing power and souls and existing in their collective associations under the protection of the guardian spirits of the species-were probably among the oldest objects of the hunter's veneration; the game spirits and game gods were perhaps the oldest divine figures known to mankind. To man as a hunter the divine became transparent above all in the animal; the animal guard- ians are surely among the oldest theophanies in the religious life of mankind. To be sure, the structure and morphology of the sacred embraces the entire area between heaven and earth which is experi- enced by man.87 But because of a very natural mental outlook which is determined by the particular dominant interest of a specific ecotype, it comes to be experienced in more circumscribed sectors of the natural environment.88 87 Eliade, Die Religionen und das Heilige, pp. 19 ff. 88 A.
