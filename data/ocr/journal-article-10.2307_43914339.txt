However, it places special emphasis on developing future natural resource managers. In this paper, I discuss the process the program undertakes to create well-rounded young professionals in a complicated urban natural areas management setting. Index terms: field experience, mentoring, Milwaukee County Wisconsin, next generation, urban natural areas Our profession has been forever in search of an elusive and enlightening resource known as knowledge. After 14 years as a natural resource manager, I have learned that the acquisition of knowledge attains true value only if it is allied to its allocation. It has taken us generations to get to this point on the natural resource management path and we owe a sizable debt to those who taught us the way. As today's natural areas managers, we now determine the pace and direction of travel. It is, therefore, our responsibility to simultaneously carry the hopes and triumphs of the past while bearing the weight and uncertainties of the future. As natural resource managers, educators, or researchers something in our lives-per- haps a mentor, a natural place, or single experience - called us to this profession. As individuals we have decided to become stewards of a shared resource. Many of us have dedicated our lives to preserving the natural beauty and ecological complexity of our planet to the best of our abilities. We have become exceedingly talented at understanding complex connections, pre- serving natural resources, and nurturing degraded landscapes back from the thresh- old of becoming lesser places. Add up all the field experiences currently possessed by natural resources managers around the world and it would easily be in the millions of years. We have tirelessly searched for and obtained vast amounts of information by standing knee deep in the mud, being eaten alive by legions of hungry insects, or spending long days under an unforgiv- ing sun. These are sacrifices that many have made to advance a science, educate a society, and preserve a planet. Nonetheless, even with all our shared successes, we now stand at a proverbial crossroads. The retirement of large num- bers of natural resource managers of the baby boomer generation has the poten- tial to greatly impact the future of our vocation. The widest breadth of natural resource knowledge that our profession has arguably ever possessed is walking out the office door or the lecture hall one last time. So where do we turn for advice or that always steady hand? Many will turn to new advances in technology to lead the way. Technology though, while always "advancing," has yet to develop a USB port that inserts directly into a human's memory core. Therefore, downloading years of field experience onto a flash drive isn't really an option. We all know that it is the experi- ence of first-hand fieldwork that reveals the subtleties and complexities of natural areas and the species that reside within them, whether permanently or temporarily. It is this process of understanding and acting on these intricate details, learned through direct experiences, which make natural resource managers truly talented in their chosen fields. So the question remains, how do we pre- serve and build on the vast field knowledge that may soon be lost? The great libraries of mankind, whether contained in the humble pages of books or the pulse of a computer chip, may preserve the image of our knowledge but rarely the rich texture that defines a lifetime of experiences. As members of our profession retire and step aside, someone else must take a deep breath and step forward. The next generation of natural areas managers and members of natural resource academia must be much more prepared than we were at their age, because they will have to deal with the clout of climate change. Do we slap them on the backs and say, "Good luck, I did what I could with the time that I had," or do we put our hands on their shoulders and say "Let me teach you what I know, 1 06 Natural Areas Journal Volume 32 (1 ), 201 2</page><page sequence="2">because it just may ease the challenges you will likely face." I think that would be an easy decision for many of us, but where do we start to mold a young conservation mind? Our natural inclination is to send the next generation of natural resource managers and research- ers to institutions of higher learning. My home state of Wisconsin, like most states around the country, has a number of excellent institutions that strive to share lifetimes of knowledge with students studying to become future conservation- ists. This is an important step in opening young minds, but it is only the first step. In many ways, these institutions succeed with a high level of knowledge transfer. However, the majority of a student's time is still spent in the classroom and not in the field, which inevitably leads to students that are knowledge-rich but field-experi- ence poor. It can take years to bring an inexperienced entry-level employee up to speed and even longer to instill that individual with the confidence needed to deal with complex situations. In times of reduced budgets, limited staffing levels, and accelerating anthropomorphic impacts, how do we provide the next generation of natural resource managers with a career's worth of restoration experience in the most efficient way possible? In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as part of a partnership between the Department of Parks, Recreation and Culture (DPRC) and the University of Wisconsin Exten- sion (UWEX), our Natural Areas Program works to accomplish this task through the use of a 4046 hectare natural areas class- room coupled to an aggressive knowledge and experience building program for cur- rent or recent collegiate graduates in the natural resource management fields. Many Wisconsinites would think Mil- waukee County, the state's most urban county(900,000+ residents), an odd place to train future natural resource managers. In my opinion, it is the most logical place because the land base within the DPRC's Natural Areas Program is directly con- nected to the communities that need these natural resources the most to improve and sustain the quality of their lives. If one can learn how to manage natural areas within a complex urban, political, and social setting, he/she can manage them anywhere. Members of our profession would argue that within the concrete and expressways, what ecological diversity could even be left? Actually, like other urban centers across the continent, a great deal of diver- sity, either preserved through foresight or chance, still remains. Milwaukee County, for example, falls within Wisconsin's ecological tension zone (defined by John Curtis [1959, 15] in The Vegetation of Wisconsin ), acts as a major wildlife migra- tion corridor (due to the presence of Lake Michigan), and contains a diversity of plant communities from northern hardwood forest to remnant prairie. It is the perfect outdoor classroom to train young natural resource professionals how to adapt to human-influenced complexities (traditions, politics, perceptions) and human-induced challenges (natural areas fragmentation, invasive species, excessive use). At any one time, 5-10 interns and seasonal staff within our natural areas program are being trained in the principles of restoration ecology. Core field skills revolve around the use of technology (ArcGIS and GPS), species identification, land management equipment, natural resource inventories, wildlife habitat management, and volun- teer coordination. The goal is to create the most flexible and well-rounded natural resource managers possible; therefore, staff members also learn important inter- personal skill sets dealing with program marketing, creating internal and external policies, environmental education, com- munity outreach, supervising other staff, and mentoring. As future natural resource managers, they must be able to recognize and understand the basic interactions that are occurring on a site and be able to comprehend which outside influences pose a threat to the long-term ecological functions of that natural area. As it was with many of us, learning begins with species identification. There are almost 700 documented species of plants within the DPRC natural areas. Staff learns plants seasonally - woody vegetation in winter, woodland forbs in spring, prairie and savanna vegetation in the late spring through fall, and wetland vegetation summer to winter. They are required to learn a minimum of 10 plants per week, take field notes and/or sketch drawings, and research additional informa- tion either online or within field guides to learn lifecycle characteristics. Through this process they begin to understand the plant associations that define plant communities as well as the influences of soils, topog- raphy, and microclimates. We train their minds to focus on the one or two unique characteristics that identify each species, as well as the mental process of elimination. If they can eliminate everything the plant cannot be because of the site characteris- tics, and then refine the remaining choices to a single genus of plants based on noted characteristics, they will in most cases be able to quickly field identify each species. We go through the same process teaching wildlife recognition, specie interactions, and habitat requirements. Repetition is key, and every time we are in the field staff is quizzed. They are asked to name the species list of characteristics that led them to that decision and to de- scribe the plant community in which the species is located. It is all about giving their minds a process to follow to ef- ficiently decipher information when they are in the field, regardless of where their future career paths take them. Staff then use these skills to conduct vegetative sur- veys of plant communities and transects for wildlife inventories within the DPRC natural areas. Once they understand species identifica- tion, they begin to learn the process of scientific data collection. The tools we use to build these skills revolve around ephemeral pond inventories and monitor- ing. New employees are trained through a partnership with the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) and UWEX to properly fill out field data sheets and collect information on basin dimensions, temperature, vegetative cover, aquatic life, and potential site disturbance. As they men- tally process this data, they learn how to ask questions that can lead them to solutions. Why are there blue-spotted salamanders (Ambystoma laterale) in this wetland and Volume 32 (1 ), 201 2 Natural Areas journal 1 07</page><page sequence="3">not that one? How did the historic use of this land impact species composition? How do we restore wildlife populations at this site and is it a feasible goal? The negative connotations of fieldwork can be just as powerful a motivator as positive experiences. The staff are regularly exposed to the impacts of invasive species. As part of our invasives management program, we annually combat 20-30 invasive plants within the park system. The staff learns the growth habits of the invasives, the best control methods, how to determine the most likely introduction points, how to clean equipment to prevent inadvertently spreading invasives, and how to use GPS to map and monitor populations before and after treatment. They quickly develop proficiency using a GPS unit hooked up to a backpack antenna and learn how to download that data into ArcGIS to be devel- oped into management protocol. However, constant invasive species management is also an effective tool to reduce morale and stunt the learning process for a young mind full of ambition. To alleviate this, trainees only work a maximum of three days in a row on invasive species control before they rotate off for a minimum of two days on other natural areas management duties. This is an important rotation because it is not likely that any natural areas manager ever became well rounded by spending days on end removing invasive species. To break up the monotony of invasive spe- cies control, they work on the installation, re-routing, and/or stabilization of the 64 kilometers of natural areas hiking trails within the park system. They learn how to construct water bars and turnpikes, line trails, build natural fencing out of woody invasive species, and layout trails in a way that protects the environmentally sensitive areas while still providing for the public's opportunity to connect to nature. All trails are then GPS-mapped and loaded into ArcGIS to develop trail maps for public use and future management activities. As much as we all love the fieldwork, any seasoned natural areas manager also understands the importance of office work. Inclement weather is something that does not slow our staff down. Instead it opens up other opportunities. Rain days allow them to work on developing and maintain- ing ArcGIS databases for mapped invasive species, hiking trails, ephemeral pond locations, breeding wildlife populations, and vegetative cover overlays. ArcGIS data is then blended with excel databases that staff have created from plant inventories and plant community lists, breeding wild- life habitat requirements, and public use activities. Collectively this data is used to begin the process of understanding how to create natural areas management plans. Office time is also used to develop educa- tional materials such as brochures, power points, outreach literature for kiosks, and reference guides for such things as invasive species control and native pollinator garden management. And who doesn't love policies? Policies can assist us or tie our hands as natural areas managers; but either way, they are needed to develop and put into practice sustain- able natural areas management programs. To date, staff have learned how to create and implement natural areas policies and guidelines for geo-caching, contractor standards and specifications, agricultural leasing, and hiking trail usage. Finally, as natural areas managers we all need to be effective communicators when dealing with the general public. This is an essential skill within dense urban areas in which the community's understanding of its natural resources has to be continu- ously cultivated to preserve our ability to effectively manage natural areas and develop the support network necessary to undertake meaningful activities. With 4046 hectares in the DPRC/UWEX Natural Ar- eas Program and only a handful of staff to maintain it, volunteers are one of the keys to our success. Over the past two years, the DPRC has had nearly 6000 volunteers donate 27,000 hours towards natural areas management activities. Staff work directly with these volunteers training and supervis- ing their activities, which is no small feat for a recently graduated natural resource major. As members of the natural areas program, they have to be safety instructors, motivators, and mentors all rolled into one when dealing with these volunteers. This form of community outreach starts to be- come second nature as staff assists with educational workshops, provides public presentations, and writes articles to local newsletters. In less than a year's time, our program's interns and seasonal employees will have made major strides to becoming well-rounded natural resource managers. Through resilience and personal sacrifice, they will have developed techniques and thought processes that will carry them through their early careers and provide them with the foundations to further en- hance their skills. Can we train world-class natural areas managers in less than two years? No, that takes time and experience, but we can put these young professionals years ahead of where we stood at their age. Ironically, our natural areas program's greatest challenge with training these individuals is that other organizations keep hiring them away. Most interns and seasonal staff have taken positions with state and federal conservation agencies, not-for-profit conservation organizations, and private environmental contractors. Others have gone on to graduate schools where they have/are emphasizing in urban natural resource management. Out of all the truly meaningful work we do as natural areas managers or educators, our greatest responsibility and our most valuable accomplishment is, and should always be, mentoring the next generation. I realize that this is something that takes precious time and unending patience. However, we must all remember that our careers - no matter how deep our passions - are all finite. Someone must replace each one of us, and those individuals will have to be better than we ever hoped to be, not just to nurture natural places and their diversity, but to also press upon humanity the idea that it is the natural world that sustains us all.
