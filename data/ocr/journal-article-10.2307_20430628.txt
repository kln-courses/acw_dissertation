ISBN 90-04-I3577-4. ? i6o.oo. Modern views of the Roman past are, to a large extent, shaped by the practice of damnatio memoriae. A large variety of objects and monuments that survive in archaeological sites and museums attest to the ancient Romans' interest in redefining and recreating their own history through the mutilation or transformation of its remains. Varner's study is an important contribu tion to this subject, not only for the wealth of evidence it presents, but also for the number and</page><page sequence="2">344 REVIEWS variety of questions it raises. Transformation and Mutilation is specifically concerned with the condemnation and manipulation of imperial monuments, especially sculpted portraits, and focuses on the period between the death of Caligula and the reign of Constantine. The book is divided into ten chapters, with no introduction or conclusion. Ch. i is a brief discussion of the numerous implications and conceptual resonances involving the Roman practice of damnatio, as well as its antecedents. The following nine chapters are organized chrono logically, discussing the context and evidence for the condemnation of individual emperors and members of their court. The book is very well illustrated, and contains an extensive and useful catalogue (limited to imperial images), with very clear descriptions of the portraits discussed. The range of issues touched upon here is very impressive. V. considers a large variety of examples, from different parts of the Empire, and his chapters are rich in references and detailed discussion of different types of material. One downside to this opulence is that discussion of the evidence is at times superficial, limited to listing known examples of altered portraits - a practice made redundant by the catalogue itself. Excessive abundance is also the case in the treatment of written sources, constantly taken at face value - a serious problem when discussing texts such as the third-century biographies of the Historia Augusta, for example. Each chapter contains a short biographical note on the emperor or his relative, a discussion of his/her portrait types, and a presentation of the evidence for the fate of his/her images. This at first sight simple structure obscures the complex argument of the book, emphasizing the treatment of individual portraits rather than general questions. The main argument is of a political and art historical nature: during the Julio-Claudian period, the adaptation of images was more common than their mutilation or outright destruction. This pattern was established during the unofficial damnatio of Caligula, and the technical difficulties resulting from this preference had important consequences for the development of imperial iconography. This pattern was reversed in the course of the politically stable second century, and when damnationes became usual again, at the end of Commodus' reign, destruction and removal from sight had become more common than re cut and re-use. This new pattern remained common until the early fourth century, when it was reversed one more time: portraits of Constantine frequently adapted representations of his rivals, most notably Maxentius. It is not easy to follow this argument, however, as the organization of each chapter prevents the development of any coherent narrative. Different questions and themes come and go, without systematic treatment. V. does not offer a clear explanation for the changes in patterns observed, apart from a quick reference to the technical difficulty in adapting portraits of the young Commodus into the bearded images of his successors (I39). The stability of the Antonine period must have played a major part in this transformation (as alluded to by V. in a footnote, I36 n. z), but this is not explored. V. observes that the practice of re-cutting portraits was very common by the time of Constantine, as evidenced by the decoration of his arch in Rome, but overlooks the important distinction between the use of spolia in general and the re-use occasioned by damnatio. The reader will certainly profit from V.'s many suggestions and references, not only in the discussion of individual portraits, but also on more general questions, such as how damnationes were enforced (e.g., on the role of the army and local authorities) and where images removed from public view were stored (in shops and imperial properties, for example). V. presents examples of spontaneous and officially-sanctioned attacks against imperial images, in private and public contexts, and it is regrettable that this complex picture is never explored properly. To understand damnatio memoriae as a historical phenomenon would require greater attention to its mechan isms, agents, and contexts. V. touches on all these issues, but never treats them systematically. It would require a broader definition of damnatio too: although ch. i opens with a broad discussion of the cultural and religious implications of this practice, it is treated elsewhere as a political decision with iconographic implications. This is more clearly seen in the superficial discussion of the relationship between charges of adultery, political conspiracy, and the destruction of images that marked the exile and execution of imperial women during the Julio-Claudian period (ch. 4), and also in the constant reference to ancient authors' anthropomorphic descriptions of damna tiones, without actually considering the wider conceptual implications of the choice of their language. At the end, readers cannot fail to be impressed by V.'s command of the sources and of the subject. In a way, the book does full justice to what seems to be its main (never explicit) objective: to catalogue and present the evidence for imperial damnationes in their context. As the</page><page sequence="3">III. ART AND ARCHAEOLOGY 345 many issues raised by this study show, however, there is still a lot of ground to be covered if one is to form a proper understanding of the phenomenon in question, its significance, and implications.
