<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Word-Faith Movement: A Theological Conflation of the Nation of Islam and Mormonism? Kirk R. MacGregor A relative newcomer to the world of New Religious Movements, the "Word-Faith Movement" is one of the most understudied develop- ments on the margins of the Christian tradition. Typically dismissed by conservative Protestants and others as a "health and wealth gospel," such a characterization fails to account for the movement's theological roots and practical fruits. These roots are located in two historical pre- decessor NRMs-the Nation of Islam and Mormonism. Using both direct evidence from Faith theological architects of doctrinal appropria- tion and strong circumstantial evidence of exegetical borrowing on the part of the movement's leaders, I argue that this identification of the Faith Movement's parent traditions enhances our understanding of its major cultural fruits, including the personal empowerment jointly driven by gn6sis of one's true identity, and by the bestowal of ultimate concern upon socioeconomic movement via direct correlation with one's spiritual progress. I conclude with some reflections on what the Faith Movement's career to date can tell us about New Religious Movements and the state of religion in America today.

Several of these churches would be classified by sociologists of religion as megachurches, and some of their leaders, such as Kenneth Copeland, Benny Hinn, Frederick K. C. Price, Creflo Dollar, and Joel Osteen, have made themselves quite visible to the American culture at large through their widespread use of television, radio, and popular books (Thumma 1982: 482-485). Describing themselves as "Bible-believing," these churches employ Christian vocabulary to express their beliefs, which leads many to assume that these communities are simply conservative representatives of the Christian tradition. But in fact this simple identification fails to use of traditional terms to the strikingly different meanings that these commu- nities ascribe to them (McConnell 1995: xvii). Rather, these churches are part of what is called the "Word-Faith (or Word of Faith) Movement," one of the newest, largest, and least understood New Religious Movements (NRMs) to appear on American soil in the last fifty years.' The size of this movement is surprising. Overall, the movement con- sists of somewhere between 2300-2500 churches in the United States, claiming a total of between 4 600 000-4 800 000 worshipers (Harrison 2005: 18; Lindner 2006: 368-370). Were it counted as a denomination, the Word-Faith Movement would be the sixth largest religious body in the United States, just below the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, and just above the Presbyterian Church-USA, the National Baptist Convention of America, and the Episcopal Church USA.2 Such figures suggest that scholars of religion ought to be very interested in critical inquiry into the thought and practice of the movement. And yet scholarship on this movement is only now beginning to appear.3 1 "New Religious Movements" (NRMs) has become the standard academic term for non- mainstream or marginal religions. By avoiding the derogatory bias associated with earlier terms such as "sect" and especially "cult," the use of NRMs also denotes that the given movements are being studied in a dispassionate and neutral fashion as opposed to being studied for either the sake of refutation or defense. 2 According to Lindner (2006: 365-377), American religious groups with more members than the Word-Faith Movement include the Roman Catholic Church (66 407 105), Southern Baptist Convention (approximately 16 400 000), United Methodist Church (8 251 042), LDS Church (5 599 177), and ELCA (4 984 925). Among prominent groups with fewer members are the Church of God in Christ (approximately 4 500 000), PC-USA (3 595 259), National Baptist Convention of America (approximately 3 500 000), Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (2 512 714), and Episcopal Church (2 333 628). 3 Along with Lindner, see Harrison (2005: viii) who, in his recent monograph on the Word- Faith Movement, laments that while the movement "has received a considerable amount of attention in the popular Christian press ... scholars of religion have left it relatively untouched."</page><page sequence="3">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 89 Although the Word-Faith position on health and wealth is typically taken to be the distinctive trait of the movement, this view actually con- stitutes the tip of an iceberg undergirded by a remarkably sophisticated theological infrastructure with radically different views than mainstream Christian groups on, among other doctrinal points, the nature of God and the nature of humanity (Bowman 2001: 31-33). What, then, are its theology proper and anthropology, and where do the origins of this movement lie? Were any other religious traditions influential in shaping Word-Faith thought? If so, how can this help us to better understand the Word-Faith Movement? Some provisional answers to these questions have been offered by scholars, through the concept of syncretism. D.R. McConnell (1995: 185) contends that the Faith Movement comprises a "syncretism" of NRM "thought with traditional biblical doctrine" while Milmon Harrison (2005: 147) states that: "The Faith Message is characterized by the syn- thesis of elements of a number of previously existing doctrines and philo- sophical systems." But the studies of McConnell and Harrison are monotraditional and sociological in character, and hence left undetected the identity of these influences. I here argue that the two major historical roots of the contem- porary Faith infrastructure lie in the Nation of Islam and Mormonism, with the former largely responsible for its theologically humanistic foun- dation and the latter for its exegetical frame. Furthermore, by putting the Word-Faith movement in conversation with its two predecessor NRMs, deeper insight is gained regarding its coherence and appeal as a cultural system in which spiritual and material progress intersect. This article not only offers answers to questions concerning the history and doctrinal development of the Word-Faith Movement, it also reveals the significance, particularly in the area of religious sociology, of theologically comparing the Word-Faith Movement with other religious traditions from which its ideas were probably derived, in order to com- prehend the interplay between its sacred symbols and the ethos, includ- ing the moods, problems, and motivations, of the people that they synthesize. We will see that the implications of the Word-Faith move- ment's sources for the shape of the movement, in particular, and New Religious Movements in America, in general, are surprising indeed. BACKGROUNDS OF AND PRECURSORS TO THE WORD-FAITH MOVEMENT The Word-Faith Movement is structured by three organizations. First, the International Convention of Faith Ministries (ICFM), founded</page><page sequence="4">90 Journal of the American Academy of Religion by the late Doyle "Buddy" Harrison in 1979, is a voluntary and inter- national organization headquartered in Arlington, Texas, with member- ship encompassing 298 American cities and a sum total of 377 ministries in 41 states (Harrison 2005: 15-16).4 Second, the Rhema Ministerial Alliance International (RMAI), instituted in 1985 by Kenneth Hagin, furnishes support and fellowship for Faith pastors who graduated from, and were licensed or ordained by, Hagin's Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Affiliates of RMAI include 1315 churches pastored by Rhema graduates in 1123 cities throughout the United States (Harrison 2005: 16-17). Third, the Fellowship of Inner- City Word of Faith Ministries (FICWFM), instituted in 1990 by Frederick K. C. Price as part of his Crenshaw Christian Center in south central Los Angeles, provides financial assistance to Word-Faith pastors responsible for inner-city churches. FICWFM includes approximately 300 pastorates in 35 American states and 3 foreign countries (Harrison 2005: 17; Lindner 2006: 367). The founding father of Word-Faith thought is recognized by all inside and outside the movement as the late televangelist Kenneth "Dad" Hagin (1917-2003). Hagin was notable for integrating the dis- tinctive exegesis of Mark 11:22 and Hebrews 11:3 delineated by E. W. Kenyon (1867-1948), the antitrinitarianism of William Branham (1909-1965), and the professed healing gift of Oral Roberts (nee 1918) into a coherent doctrinal system greater than the sum of its parts (McConnell 1995: 65-69). According to Kenyon, Mark 11:22, echete pistin theou, should be translated as a subjective genitive (have God's faith) rather than the typically rendered objective genitive (have faith in God). Following Kenyon, Hagin (1972: 74) paraphrased Mark 11:22 as "Have the kind of faith God has" or "Have the God-kind of faith," in contradistinction to the natural (and ineffective) human kind of faith. Consequently, God not only has faith but also commands humans to possess this same caliber of faith. Regarding Hebrews 11:3, Kenyon's (1942: 20) syntactical alteration of pistei nooumen katertisthai tous ai6nas rhemati theou (lit. by faith we understand [that] the worlds were made by [the] word of God) to read "We understand that the worlds were made by faith by the word of God" was also used by Hagin. Thus Hagin (1972: 75-76) insisted that God created the worlds by conjoining his qualitatively optimal faith to his word. From Branham's (1961) stark declaration that "trinitarianism is of the devil-I say to you, thus saith the Lord," Hagin advanced can be called an "originally unitarian" 4 International members of ICFM total 236 ministries in 23 countries.</page><page sequence="5">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 91 view of God, in which a God comprising one person created the world by speaking words suffused by his faith. Such creative faith, powerful enough to "call things which be not as though they were" (Rom. 4:17 KJV), was identified by Hagin (1979a: 44) as the ingredient necessary for the success of Roberts' method of faith healing. For Hagin (1979b: 13-16), mere human faith was insufficient for healing; only believers holding and wielding the God-kind of faith would be cured. In spite of this, neither Kenyon, Branham, nor Roberts can be called the source of the core theological anthropology of the contemporary Word-Faith system-namely, that humans were literally created in the image of a flesh-and-bones God and, upon receiving divine restoration from the ontological wounds dealt by the Fall, share the same nature as God-or any of the doctrinal corollaries stemming therefrom. For the origins of these Faith distinctives, we must look elsewhere. By 1995 the system of Faith theology had solidified into its present shape, as evidenced by the "Tenets of Faith" drawn up that year by Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, which institution and city now stand as the undisputed center of the movement (Bowman 2001: 93). However, two previous stages in the movement's evolution are pivotal to understanding the widespread appeal of Faith theology today. Before moving to Tulsa, in 1963 Hagin founded an Evangelistic Association in Dallas, Texas, which group quickly attracted Kenneth Copeland (nee 1937), a former student at Oral Roberts University. Since that time, Copeland has emerged as one of the most visible and prolific contem- porary advocates of the Word-Faith movement, and the Dallas-Fort Worth twin cities, in which latter city Copeland established his own ministry center, have figured as an important stronghold of Faith thought. Drawn to the Dallas Evangelistic Association in 1973, the charismatic African American preacher Frederick K. C. Price became Hagin's protege and, according to The Encyclopedia of African American Religions, established the Faith Movement within the African American community (Murphy et al. 1993: 594). Furnishing inter- national exposure for the movement were Faith filmmakers Paul and Jan Crouch, who in 1973 founded the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN) at Santa Ana, California (Farah 1979: 86). TBN, which has hen- ceforth surfaced as a multimillion dollar media conglomerate (with approximate net assets of $444 million), has catapulted the southern California landscape into another bastion of the Word-Faith movement (Perriman 2004: 137). Among televangelists rising to stardom via this network, none have been more illustrious than Benny Hinn (nee' 1952), who ranks alongside Copeland and Price in leadership of the Word- Faith Movement. In 1985, Hinn established his World Media Center in</page><page sequence="6">92 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Aliso Viejo, California and began producing his TBN television series, This Is Your Day (Frame 1992: 52-53). Running throughout every stage in the development of the Word- Faith Movement is one common thread: the prevalence of both the Nation of Islam and Mormonism in the same geographic regions where and at the very time when this growth occurred. Concerning the Nation of Islam, in 1956 Elijah Muhammad (1996: 24-27) persuasively condemned the infamous Tulsa Race Riots of Memorial Day 1921 during a preaching tour through the city and, in turn, quickly instituted a flourishing Nation community in Tulsa. In addition, the 1960s wit- nessed the "Great Acceleration" of Mormon missions work under church president David O. McKay, during which time LDS (Latter-Day Saint) baptisms more than doubled in Tulsa and Dallas (Mullen 1966: 224-226). The steady Mormon growth in the American Southwest over the next two decades eventually led to the construction of Dallas Temple 30 in 1981 (Ostling 1999: 162). The influence of the Nation of Islam in Dallas also swelled after the city experienced the 22 November 1963 assassination of John F. Kennedy, particularly through its interpretation by the then Nation minister Malcolm X as "God's Judgment of White America" (346-347). The immediate upshot of his talks was the estab- lishment of Muhammad Mosque No. 48 in Dallas by a large like-minded black contingent. Finally, Los Angeles proved to be a booming hub for both Nation and Mormon ideology. From the mid-1950s to early 1960s in Los Angeles, Malcolm X organized the pivotal Muhammad Mosque No. 27, which emerged as the Western Regional Headquarters for the Nation of Islam (1965: 272-273). Southern California Mormon gains within the same timeframe were no less impressive. Due to a steady growth in evangelism stretching back to 1923, in 1951 President McKay decreed that the largest of all Mormon temples would be constructed in Los Angeles; thousands more were drawn into the church when McKay personally dedicated the resplendent Temple 10 in 1956 (Mullen 1966: 197, 218). In 1980, a year removed from the creation of ICFM, the soph- isticated Mormon apologetics think-tank, the Miller-Eccles Study Group, was founded in southern California (Ostling 1999: 380). Because of this we may say with real confidence that both Nation of Islam and Mormon teachings were circulating when and where the 5 The suggestion that the Nation of Islam and Mormonism could be conceptually similar enough for Faith theology to appropriate ideas from both NRMs should come as no surprise, since the Nation of Islam is an American adaptation of Islamic themes and, as Jan Shipps (1987: 148) has persuasively argued, Mormonism exhibits such striking parallels with the thought and development of Islam that it may plausibly be regarded as "America's version of Islam."</page><page sequence="7">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 93 Word-Faith movement developed. But while geographical proximity between the three movements makes it plausible that Faith thinkers were familiar with Nation of Islam and Mormon ideas, it does not show a causal link between Faith theology and its two predecessor NRMs. However, textual evidence exists which makes it highly probable that key architects of Faith theology appropriated several doctrinal con- cepts from the Nation of Islam and Mormonism. In contrast, direct evi- dence proves not only the thorough familiarity of Frederick K. C. Price with Nation of Islam theology via the major Nation primary sources but also that Price, through his nationally televized sermons, tapes, and books, is single-handedly responsible for introducing Nation theology to the Faith community. The direct evidence further indicates that Price and others in the Faith theological leadership, most notably Kenneth Copeland and Benny Hinn, have modified several Nation teachings to fit a Faith theological framework. Furthermore, strong circumstantial evidence, acknowledged by LDS scholars, suggests that key Mormon doctrines have been assimilated by Copeland and Hinn into the Faith infrastructure. These two streams of thought have coalesced to make Word-Faith theology a synthesis of the Nation of Islam and Mormonism. We shall now turn to an examination of the aforemen- tioned evidence. PRICE AND THE NATION OF ISLAM CONNECTION A long-time admirer of the Nation of Islam for bettering the social plight of African Americans, Frederick K. C. Price (2002: 65, 243) called the Faith community's collective attention to Nation of Islam doctrine in his 1991 nationally televized sermon series "Race, Religion, and Racism: Jesus, Christianity, and Islam." This series attracted such widespread attention in Faith circles that it was disseminated in sets of audio and video tapes the same year. Due to the increasing interest in Islamic matters following the 11 September 2001 World Trade Center attacks, the entire series was transcribed and released under the 1991 title as a trilogy of books in 2002. Price's extensive research into Nation doctrines is revealed in the first half of the series, as he delineates the Nation "message to the Black Man and Woman" and concept of "the Devil" and then provides a detailed synopsis of key Nation teachings, directly citing virtually all the major primary texts from Elijah Muhammad to Malcolm X. [Apparently to reinforce the dissimilarity between the Nation of Islam and Islamic terrorist groups, the book pro- vides the current Nation official compendium "What Muslims Believe" (2002: 349-351) and "Comments of the Honorable Louis Farakkhan"</page><page sequence="8">94 Journal of the American Academy of Religion (2002: 352-356)]. Such an examination of Nation beliefs is important, Price (1991a) insists, because "it is clear that Islam is growing in America, and especially among blacks ... it also seems that Islam is less racist than Christianity, especially toward people of color .... Therefore, because the Nation of Islam has been the most prominent, and because of its leaders-Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X ... I will be dealing pre- dominantly with the Black Muslim movement as presented in the doc- trines of the Nation of Islam." Moreover, Price (1991a) concedes that the Nation contains partial religious truth but insists upon its salvific impotence: "This Islam sounds like true religion to me .... and appar- ently did have a prophetic vision .... But Jesus never came to bring us religion-he came to bring us salvation! That's an awesome difference." The dichotomy between "religious truth" and "salvation" enables Price to appropriate several Nation doctrines while retaining his Christian allegiance and then adjusting them to fit a more Christian mold. Accordingly, the second half of "Jesus, Christianity, and Islam" illus- trates how "Christian beliefs" improve upon Nation doctrines by preser- ving and cultivating the kernels of truth within while divesting them of their "distorted" husks. While Price (1991b) alleges that "we can go along with 'forceful' or 'charismatic"' Nation teachings, he declares that "we have to separate truth from error." This quasi-triumphalism of Faith over Nation thought is intensified through a liberal peppering of quotes from letters written by members of his Crenshaw Christian Center who personally converted from the Nation of Islam to the Faith movement as a result of Price's (1991b) preaching. Although Price por- trays the latter half of the series to his Faith constituency as apologetic, the impartial observer will quickly recognize it as constructive theology which rearranges pre-existing Nation-building blocks to formulate a new Faith theological anthropology. In order to understand the internal logic of the resultant Faith model, it would be instructive to analyze the interrelated doctrines of theology proper and humanity in the Nation of Islam. Although much more could be said about these doctrines, I will restrict myself only to those elements explicitly presented by Price in the first half of his sermon series since these would prove decisive for future Faith theological development. Anthropomorphism in the Nation of Islam Perceiving no qualitative difference between primal human nature and divine nature, the Nation of Islam holds that God is literally a man; in the words of Elijah Muhammad (2002a: 10), "God is a man and we just cannot make Him other than man, lest we make Him an inferior one." The Nation of Islam proceeds to identify God with a particular</page><page sequence="9">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 95 historical figure, namely, W. D. Fard. Elijah maintained that he was entrusted by God, "whose real name is Allah," with the divine message for the blacks, or "Lost-Found Nation of Islam," in America: "Allah came to us from the Holy City of Mecca, Arabia, in 1930. He used the name Wallace D. Fard, often signing it W. D. Fard" (Muhammad 2002a: 12). Further, the Nation teaches that Allah, a black-skinned physical being, created humanity in order to duplicate himself, such that black human nature and the divine nature are one and the same. These first humans, black gods like their Creator, were denominated by Allah as "Original Man" (Muhammad 2002b: 4). It should be noted that the quality which makes black people gods (including Allah) in Nation anthropology is their unique mental capacity to apprehend the full scope, or 360 degrees, of knowledge. After building great empires, civilizations, and cultures, about 6600 years ago, there arose among Original Man a disgruntled scientist named Mr. Yacub. Through 800 years of eugenic breeding, Yacub plotted "to create upon the earth a devil race-a bleached-out, white race of people" by weakening the divine cognitive faculty to the point of virtual obliteration (Malcolm X 1965: 191). As humans became pro- gressively lighter, their capacity to apprehend knowledge decreased pro- portionally, until white Europeans could only apprehend thirty-three degrees of knowledge. Since Nation thought defines this limited knowl- edge capacity as "the nature of Satan," the entity "Satan" comprises the white race (Muhammad 2002b: 15). After the white race had spent 2000 years living as little more than animals in European caves, Allah displayed his compassion by sending Moses to civilize them. This notion is defended by a distinctive exegesis of Numbers 21:8-9, in which Moses lifted the bronze snake upon a pole. In Elijah Muhammad's interpretation, "when the Bible says 'Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,' that serpent is symbolic of the devil white race Moses lifted up out of the caves of Europe, teaching them civiliza- tion" (Muhammad 2002a: 31). Showing utter disdain for Allah's mercy, the white race reverted to its demonic proclivities by perverting the divine gift of civilization for its own self-seeking ends. Such contempt ultimately spawned the trans- atlantic slave trade, which Nation theology denounces as the greatest crime in human history. To block any exercise of their supreme mental faculty, the Satanic whites cut American blacks off from all knowledge of their past culture, religion, and language, until "the black man in America was the earth's only race of people who had absolutely no knowledge of his true identity" (Malcolm X 1965: 187). So that blacks would no longer expect to enjoy the material prosperity they possessed</page><page sequence="10">96 Journal of the American Academy of Religion in their flourishing African civilizations, white preachers foisted upon them Christian ethics, most notably the lie that poverty and suffering in this world would equal riches and glory in an imaginary afterlife. In the words of Malcolm X (1965: 188), "This white man's Christian reli- gion further deceived and brainwashed this 'Negro' to always turn the other cheek ... and to take whatever was dished out by the devilish white man ... and [to wait] for his heaven in the hereafter, while right here on earth the slavemaster white man enjoyed his heaven." Desirous to save Original Man from his plight, Allah decreed that he would become incarnate on earth to destroy the white race from within; however, he realized this judgment could only be accomplished by sim- ultaneously taking upon himself "the white devil's true nature" while retaining his deity (Muhammad 1997: 69). Hence Allah came to America as half-black and half-white in the person of W. D. Fard. This compromise enabled him to earn the acceptance of blacks in America while concurrently casting judgment upon the whites as he moved undetected in their midst. Such a dual role was accomplished through his preaching of, and entrusting Elijah Muhammad with, "the true knowledge" that all blacks, upon collectively realizing they are already gods, will once again exercise material dominion over the earth and destroy the satanic whites, whose "lease on ruling the world" has now expired (Muhammad 1997: 83-86). Groundwork for the Contemporary Faith Doctrinal Edifice We shall now turn to the Faith theological constructions which originally appeared in the second half of Price's 1991 sermon series and, through the influence of Copeland and Hinn, have become the pillars of a Word-Faith theological infrastructure which previously lacked systematic coherence as well as any underlying metaphysical basis for its exegetically derived doctrine of faith. The sermon series and the new doctrines beginning to emerge therefrom met with wide acclaim from Price's Faith colleagues. Hinn and Copeland expanded and disseminated Price's teachings via their respective multimedia facili- ties. Embracing the Nation teaching that Original Man was created as an exact duplicate of God but without the racist overtones, Price (1991b) maintained that God created the primal ancestors of the human race, Adam and Eve, as exact duplicates of himself, or "little gods." Price explains: "Elijah Muhammad says that 'the Father is also a 6 The intellectual roots of this critique lie in Friedrich Nietzsche, whose Genealogy of Morals deemed Jesus as leader of the "slave revolt in morality" via his value-inverting Sermon on the Mount, which lauded weakness and vilified strength (1:9).</page><page sequence="11">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 97 man.' Look closely at what [Scripture] says .... God himself has sub- stance. Referring to God ... in Revelation 20:11-12 .... [t]he one John saw had to have had substance, or John wouldn't know if he was stand- ing, sitting, or lying down. But he was seated on the throne, and in Revelation 5:1, it says, And I saw in [his] right hand .... Genesis 1:26 gives further illumination on this subject .... I must look like God, because I'm made in his image" (Price 1991b). Two years later, Copeland popularized this humanistic doctrine of God on his television program, The Believer's Voice of Victory, as well as in his audio and video tapes. As Copeland (1993a) explains the first two chapters of Genesis, "[Adam] was not a little like God ... not almost like God ... [and] not subordinate to God, even. And Adam is as much like God as you could get ... [j]ust the same as Jesus .... And I want you to know something-Adam in the Garden of Eden was God manifested in the flesh." For Price, the Faith doctrinal trajectory consisting of the Fall and the Atonement takes on a distinctly Nation shape. Just as the Nation of Islam asserts that Satan in the form of the white race relegated the black gods to slavery (the white race's proper lot in life) and stole their divine "high life" of earthly prosperity through deceit, so Price insists that the hellish serpent of Genesis 3 tricked the primal humans into a "nature exchange" in which he would assume their divine nature and they would assume the nature of Satan (McConnell 1995: 116). Thus Price (1991b) asserts, "That brings us to a part of the teaching in the Black Muslim movement that has utmost relevance to the series topic of 'Race, Religion, and Racism' .... God created everything, then he made man, Adam, and gave him dominion over all of it .... that meant God no longer had dominion; Adam was the god of this world. But Adam, as I said, gave it away to the serpent ... and Satan became the god of this world." Employing identical linguistic handles to those used by Elijah Muhammad when depicting white dominion over blacks in America, Price (1991b) further adduces that Satan possesses a "lease" over "this world": "Now Satan has a right to be here and be the god of this world until Adam's lease runs out." Benny Hinn (1992) amplifies Price's concept of the "nature exchange" by explicitly spelling out the ontological damage suffered by primal humanity: "By sinning ... Adam took upon himself the nature of Satan into his spirit being. Man was actually born again when he sinned. That is, he was born of the Devil." Coupling an extremist form of original sin with traducianism, Price and his collaborators argue that this demonic nature was genetically trans- mitted to all of Adam's posterity, which concept resembles the eugenic generation and reproduction of demonic nature articulated by the</page><page sequence="12">98 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Nation of Islam. Despite that God "was out of the business" and "had no more stock in this earth realm" due to Satan's legal ownership of humanity, Price (1991b) insists that God, like Allah, devised a plan to liberate humanity from their demonic subjugation and reverse the effects of the Fall. Just as Allah could only free the blacks from the satanic whites by physically conquering the race from within as W. D. Fard, Price alleges that God was made incarnate as Christ to abolish the devil's earthly reign. According to Price (1991b), Satan's earthly lease entitled him to rule over all persons who share his nature. Price therefore identifies the mission of Jesus as tricking Satan into violating his lease, which annul- ment would reestablish God's legal ownership of the earth and allow him to restore the divine nature to humanity. Strikingly reminiscent of Fard's acceptance of a half-white and half-black, or simultaneously satanic and divine, body to redeem American blacks from whites is Price's assertion that Jesus needed to become partially satanic while retaining his deity in order to overthrow the devil (MacArthur 1992: 340-341). Thus Jesus had to "die spiritually," which Price (1991b) defines as "taking on the nature of Satan," to accomplish the work of redemption: "Do you think that the punishment for our sin was to die on a cross? If that were the case, the two thieves could have paid your price. No ... [Jesus] died spiritually .... When this happened, spiritual death, the nature of Satan, took possession of his spirit." The reason Satan imparted his nature to Jesus, explains Price (1991b), is that Jesus fooled or "baited" Satan into thinking he had sinned through his alleg- edly blasphemous actions on Holy Week. Hence Jesus could receive the nature of Satan while never abandoning his divine nature. In a parallel too specific to be coincidental, Price employs the very passage- Numbers 21:8-9-and atypical exegesis thereof that he previously ident- ified as proffered by the Nation of Islam, in which the snake lifted on a pole symbolized the lifting up of Satan, and then replaces the demonic white race with the crucified Jesus: "Jesus died spiritually, but not for any of his own sin! He became the serpent on the pole, the snake on the ground, in the Old Testament type .... Satan would become his master. Jesus ... was going to be ... united with the Adversary" (Price 1991b). Allegedly recounting a conversation with God, Copeland (1994b) availed himself of Price's modified Nation interpretation: "[Jesus] accepted within his own spirit the sin nature of Satan .... Why do you think Moses, upon the instruction of God, raised a serpent upon that pole instead of a lamb? .... And the Lord said [to me], 'Because it was the sign of Satan that was hanging on the cross. I accepted within my own spirit spiritual death, and the light was</page><page sequence="13">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 99 turned off."' Drawing upon the Ransom to Satan theory of the atone- ment, Price (1992) claims that Jesus was illegally dragged into hell by Satan, who afflicted him there from Friday night until Easter morning. What Satan failed to realize, however, is that he had unwittingly fallen into Jesus' trap of breaching his lease on the earth; Satan had not only transmitted his nature to an innocent man but also tortured him in the underworld (Bowman 2001: 166-167). As a result, explains Price (1991b), the Word-Faith God now exercised his legal rights to reclaim the earth from Satan's grip and enable Jesus to be born again in hell, whereupon the latter resurrected his physical body. The manner in which God dispenses the liberating effects of Christ's victory over Satan to the faithful is conceived by Price as a fusion of Nation soteriology with a traditional Christian theological cat- egory. In the first half of his series, Price (1991a) related that salvation in the Nation of Islam occurs when the "black man" embraces "accurate knowledge" concerning his true identity: "The black people, God's chil- dren, were gods themselves, Master Fard taught." This knowledge enables blacks to cultivate the seeds of divinity within that previously lay dormant. Recalling the Nation view of deification during the second half of his series, Price redistricts the notion of "being born again" out of its traditional theological domain, including various relations between regeneration, justification, and sanctification, and into the realm of Nation soteriology. Once believers accept the Faith gospel of "knowing who you are in Christ," Price (1991b) proclaims, they will experience rebirth by actualizing the divine nature with which humanity was originally created, the realization of which had been prevented by Satanic domination. While expounding Psalm 82:6a, "I have said, you are gods," Price (1991b) emphasizes this point in the strongest possible terms: "Notice that the verse didn't say, you were gods, past tense, but rather, you are gods, present tense. Mr. Muhammad said, 'We all know that there was a God in the beginning who created all these'... Every man who believes and has been born again is an incarnation .... as much an incarnation as was Jesus of Nazareth." Both of the scholarly monographs published to date on the Word- Faith Movement-D. R. McConnell's A Different Gospel (Hendrickson 1995), an expansion of his master's thesis at Oral Roberts University, and Milmon F. Harrison's Righteous Riches: The Word of Faith Movement in Contemporary African American Religion (Oxford University Press 2005)-have observed that the paramount emphasis placed upon right knowledge as the key to deification resembles the Gnosticism of late antiquity. While careful not to imply "a direct historical connection between the Faith theology and ancient</page><page sequence="14">100 Journal of the American Academy of Religion gnosticism," McConnell (1995: 107-108) appeals to Rudolf Bultmann's history of the latter movement to classify Faith deification as Gnostic: "The gnostic concept of the knowledge classifies believers into classes or categories, the highest of which is divine. Knowledge invests the gnostic with the divine nature through which he is transformed from a man into God ... [which is] the most obvious gnostic idea taught by the Faith theology." Expanding upon the assessment of McConnell, Harrison (2005: 8, 10) concurs: "Knowing 'who you are in Christ' is ... the key to living the higher Christian life that being born again will provide for all who will just accept it .... It is in this respect that the doctrine appears to move in the direction of Gnosticism, the belief that salvation comes through knowledge." Price (1995) underscores this point in his account of why some people are damned: "God does not and will not send anybody to hell except the devil and his angels. God said, 'My people perish for a lack of knowledge,' and God will let you go to hell if that is your choice .... [so] I recommend you study what the Scriptures say." Although Price was responsible for formulating the efficient cause and final result of Faith soteriology, the deifying process whereby God reunites believers with their original natures would be thoroughly fleshed out by Copeland and Hinn. Copeland (1992a: 4-6) alleges that when Jesus was reborn in hell, God released his "emaciated, poured-out, little wormy spirit" from demonic captivity and restored it to unadulterated deity: "Suddenly his twisted, death-racked spirit began to fill out and come back to life .... Jesus was born again-the firstborn from the dead the Word calls him-and he whipped the devil in his own backyard." Likewise, all who believe in the Faith gospel are literally "born again" by God, which rebirth of the divine nature Copeland compares to two parents trans- mitting a human nature to their offspring: "[God] imparted in you when you were born again ... the divine nature .... [Y]ou have that imparted into you by God just the same as you imparted into your child the nature of humanity. That child wasn't born a whale-born a human. Isn't that true? Now you don't have a human, do you? No, you are one. You don't have a god in you-you are one." Hinn (1993) draws together the threads of the doctrinal cloth weaved by Price and Copeland while adding his own thread of ranking new believers as equal to Jesus, going so far as to assign them the personal divine name of "I AM" (eg6 eimi; Jn. 8:58 and Ex. 3:14 LXX): "Are you ready for some real revelation knowledge? .... When you were born again, the Word was made flesh in you.... Don't tell me you have Jesus. You are everything he was and everything he is and ever shall be. And the new man ... says, 'I AM, as he is'.... May I say it like this: You are a little god</page><page sequence="15">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 101 on earth running around." Agreeing with and emboldened by Hinn's for- mulation of Faith soteriology, Copeland (1994a) proclaimed his personal equality with Christ on his daily television show, the Believer's Voice of Victory, shortly thereafter: "When I read in the Bible where [Jesus] says, 'I AM,' I just smile and say, 'Yes, I AM too'." One may wonder if any difference exists, then, between God and the Word-Faith devotee. Smacking of influence from the Nation of Islam, Faith theology asserts that the only difference between God and the Word-Faith believer, or "little god," is knowledge of the Word of God. As in the Nation of Islam, Price (1991b) maintains that this deficiency not only is remediable but also should be remedied by the individual believer: "Elijah Muhammad claims he knew how to cure the black man's mental sickness ... but we know that when any believer, which includes all humanity ... cultivates his knowledge, he is ... made to fully realize his own deific nature and supremacy of being." Price reasons that Scripture is a written record of the words of faith God spoke to exercise authority over the universe; thus the more biblical knowledge one acquires, the more one grows up in one's deity. Copeland (1994b) pushes this teaching to its logical limit by alleging that he himself could have redeemed fallen humanity if he had only possessed the same working knowledge of Scripture as Jesus: "The Spirit of God spoke to me, and he said ... ' Think this way: a twice-born man whipped Satan in his own domain ... [and] you are the very image and the very copy of that one ... if you'd have only had the knowledge of the Word of God that [Jesus] did, you could have done the same thing. 'Cause you're a reborn man too'." The most significant practical result of the Nation-influenced Faith concept of deification was to furnish a theolo- gical rationale for E. W. Kenyon's earlier exegetical mandate that all believers must brandish the God-kind of faith. Copeland postulates that believers can keep this command precisely because they are gods and, as such, intrinsically possess the God-kind of faith within their natures: "God is a faith being. You are born of God. You are a faith being. God does not do anything outside of faith ... you are to operate the same way." With words as the containers of their faith, believers are empow- ered to create their own reality. Since the vast majority of creations which Faith teachers instruct their followers to speak into existence via faith-filled words fall into the categories of physical healing and material prosperity, the Faith movement has been dubbed by its critics a "health-wealth gospel" which tells people to "name it and claim it" (MacArthur 1992: 322-325). Evident from the foregoing discussion is the necessity of an anthro- pology of deification for the coherence of Faith praxis. The Word-Faith</page><page sequence="16">102 Journal of the American Academy of Religion hallmark of employing the God-kind of faith to create prosperity and immediate healing depends theologically upon the presupposition that its practitioners are, in fact, gods. Since only a god, by definition, can have the God-kind of faith as opposed to the creatively impotent human kind of faith, the sine qua non of the Word-Faith movement proves to be its anthropology that born-again believers have the very nature of God and, apart from a knowledge disparity which can be overcome through Bible study, are equal in rank to God. When deli- neating the Faith understanding of Mark 11:22 to his congregation, Price (1994: 93, 101) remarks, "Why distinguish the God kind of faith? Because there are two kinds of faith .... 1. Natural human faith. 2. Spiritual faith, or the God kind of faith .... God believed in his heart that what he said with his mouth would come to pass, and he dared to say it .... If our Father is a faith God, then we must be faith children of a faith God)." Copeland (1995) relates even more clearly the metaphysical foundation of Faith theology to its primary application: "As a born-again believer, you have residing within your spirit the faith of God .... [The believer] has a uniqueness about him that even angels do not have-and that is the God-given right to choose his own words, and speak them, thereby setting his own divine destiny, his own desti- nation.... Hey, poor! You don't have to be poor any more." Not only does such an adulation of material wealth parallel the Nation of Islam concept that all members of the black God-race are entitled to unlim- ited prosperity, but both the Faith Movement and the Nation identify the dissonance between this emphasis and conventional Christian ethics and ascribe this dissonance to "tradition" and "religious brainwashing" (Malcolm X 1995: 231; Price 1998: 52-53). Before spelling out some central sociological implications of the message the Faith movement presents to its constituency, we must examine a second pivotal influence upon contemporary Faith thought. Just as the Faith Movement's connection with the Nation of Islam is crucial for understanding the origin of Faith theology, we will see that its connection with Mormonism is equally crucial for providing the exegetical handles to substantiate this theology. MORMONISM, COPELAND, AND HINN Although Mormonism and the Word-Faith Movement apparently have little in common, one trait that both movements share is a concept of the6sis which perceives no qualitative difference between human nature and divine nature but regards humanity and divinity as two poles on a common ontological spectrum (McConkie 1966: 669-</page><page sequence="17">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 103 670; McConnell 1995: 115-116). Due to the LDS acceptance of the King James Bible as one of four "Standard Works" of Scripture7 and the subsequent hermeneutical tradition of interpreting controversial texts in a manner consistent with their version of theosis, Faith leaders such as Copeland and Hinn found this tradition custom-made and thus drew upon it for explaining the same texts to their audiences and defending Faith interpretations thereof against the attacks of critics. Among the hallmarks of Mormon biblical exegesis is its insistence that statements traditionally understood in Christian theology as anthropo- morphisms be interpreted literally, the consequences of which demand are integral to the Mormon plan of salvation (Robinson 1998: 86-87). According to this plan, God the Father was once a mortal man like us who progressively obeyed the precepts of Mormonism in order to attain godhood. Following the Father's example, all humans may be exalted to godhood by faithfully adhering to the eternal gospel, restored by God through Joseph Smith, both in the earthly life (the "Second Estate") and the post-mortem spirit realm prior to the general resurrection (Hunter 1958: 104). Thus God's rationale for creating humans is explicitly ident- ified by Brigham Young (1954: 93) as divine reproduction: "The Lord created you and me for the purpose of becoming Gods like himself .... We are created ... to become Gods like unto our Father in heaven." Today, God the Father is said to be an exalted, immortal man of flesh and bones; thus physicality is not lost in exaltation but is transformed from mortality to immortality. The LDS Journal of Discourses (1854- 1856: 1.123) explains, "God the Eternal Father, our Father in Heaven, is an exalted, perfected, and glorified Personage having a tangible body of flesh and bones." Appealing to the fact that a "span" is an English unit of measurement equaling nine inches, Joseph Smith exegeted Isaiah 40:12 (KJV), which claims that God "measured out the heavens with the span of his hand," as meaning that God is literally of human pro- portions. Since God, Smith (1973: 6.305-6.306) deduces, "is an exalted man, and sits enthroned on yonder heavens," if "you were to see him today, you would see him like a man in form." Such a theology proper is forever enshrined in Mormon Scripture: "The Father has a body of flesh and bones as tangible as man's" (D&amp;C 130:22). Foundational to the Word-Faith doctrine of deification is its huma- nistic concept of God. While expounding the doctrine of God's creating the universe by speaking faith-filled words, Kenneth Copeland (1992b) 7 These Mormon Scriptures include the King James Bible, the Book of Mormon, the Pearl of Great Price, and Doctrine and Covenants (D&amp;C).</page><page sequence="18">104 Journal of the American Academy of Religion offered the following description of God: "A being that is very- uncanny-the way he's very much like you and me ... having a body, complete with eyes, and eyelids, ears, nostrils, a mouth, hands and fingers, and feet." Resembling the Mormon motivation for God's cre- ation of the world, Copeland (1993a) asserts: "God's reason for creating Adam was his desire to reproduce himself-I mean, a reproduction of himself." Further, in a parallel whose exactitude practically rules out coincidence, Copeland (1993b) interprets Isaiah 40:12 in precisely the same manner as Mormon hermeneutics: "The Bible says [God] measured out the heavens with a nine-inch span. Well ... my span is eight and three-quarter inches long. So God's span is a quarter of an inch longer than mine. So you see ... God ... stands somewhere around 6'2", 6'3", weighs somewhere in the neighborhood of a couple hundred pounds, little better." The clear similarity between Copeland's theology proper and that of Mormonism has led LDS scholars to accuse Copeland of lifting his doc- trine of God from their theological repertoire. Stephen E. Robinson (1998: 62-63), professor of ancient scripture at Brigham Young University, charges that "the Latter-day Saint doctrine of God is used ... by Kenneth Copeland, of Texas," and Mormon exegete Daniel C. Peterson (1998: 71) alleges that Copeland's exegetical remarks could have been drawn from the wellsprings of "only the Latter-day Saints, to whom a doctrine ... of human beings and of their literal kinship with God has been revealed." Ironically, the result of these criticisms by Robinson and Peterson has been to draw Copeland's attention to their writings, since which time Copeland seems to have borrowed distinctive terminology from both of these scholars regarding other Faith doctrinal prooftexts. In his popular book How Wide the Divide? (Robinson et al. 1997), a groundbreaking attempt to foster improved relations between Mormons and evangelical Christians, Robinson (1997: 18) encapsulates LDS anthropology with the following conviction: "We believe that God and humans are the same species of being." He proceeds to affirm that 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature," means "in the LDS view we receive the full divine inheritance only through the atonement of Christ" (Robinson et al. 1997: 82). Copeland (1999: 1, 5) appears to paraphrase Robinson's exegesis of 2 Corinthians 5:17, a key Faith textual support for the equation of regen- eration and deification, citing verbatim the phrase "species of being" without revealing the source and virtually quoting the sentence that identified God and humans as "the same species of being": The Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:17 that you became a new creature .... One translation says that any man who is in Christ Jesus is a new</page><page sequence="19">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 105 species of being that never existed before .... The literal Greek text says a new species of being which never existed before .... [So] God and human beings belong to the same species of being. You need to realize that you are not a spiritual schizophrenic--half-God and half-Satan- you are all-God .... Why? Because Jesus went to the cross, bore the curse of the law, and broke the power of sickness and disease. Contra Copeland, however, no standard English Bible translation renders the latter half of this verse "a new species of being that never existed before," and the Greek kaine ktisis literally means "new cre- ation" (Louw 1998-1989: 1.1, 477, 514-515; 2.148; Bauer et al. 1979: 455-456). However, due to Copeland's admission that he is using a source for "species of being," his connection of this phrase with the same verse as Robinson, and the high resemblance between the content of Copeland's exegesis and Robinson's, it is highly likely that Copeland drew this material from Robinson. More recently, Copeland appears to have appropriated the language that spiritually reborn humans comprise a "class" of gods from Daniel Peterson's 2000 piece "'Ye Are Gods': Psalm 82 and John 10 as Witnesses to the Divine Nature of Humankind." Peterson (2000: 555) thus expounds the two pertinent scriptural passages: "The Latter-day Saint claim that God and humankind are akin seems a promising basis upon which to resolve the apparent disagreement between the reference of Psalm 82:6 to heavenly gods and the reference of John 10:34 to mortal human beings .... [We] recognize that gods and men form a single class, differentiated along a spectrum of holiness, wisdom, and power." Conveying analogous reasoning in a colloquial manner to eluci- date these two interrelated texts and linking their interpretation with "class" terminology previously unknown in Faith circles is Copeland's 2003 15-16 book Walking in the Realm of the Miraculous: [C]oncerning the subject of our equality with God. Ps. 82:6-You are gods and children of the Most High God. John 10:34-36-Jesus quoted Ps. 82:6 and the Jews wanted to stone him for blasphemy. Man was created in the god class .... Do you realize that I have the same faith in me that God used to create this planet? ... The reason I can't function on that level yet is because I don't have the wisdom about it that God has. But yet that wisdom is here. "Well, you think you really got that?" Yeah, and I'm not done either yet, praise the Lord. I'm still developing; I'm still building .... My son has the same capacity for strength that I have ... but at his present age he is not as strong as I am. Why? Because his muscles are not fully developed .... All right-are we gods? We are a class of gods!</page><page sequence="20">106 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Again, Copeland's commentary on Psalm 82 and John 10 betrays ear- marks of dependence upon Peterson, including not only the divine "class" idea but even the italicized observations regarding growth in "wisdom" and "strength" presented in the same sequence as Peterson's human-divine progression in "wisdom and power." There are two significant exegetical issues where it seems Benny Hinn is also indebted to Mormon hermeneutics. First is Hinn's tritheis- tic concept of the Trinity, which mirrors its LDS predecessor doctrine even in its fine points. According to LDS theologian Bruce McConkie's authoritative Mormon Doctrine, the "Godhead" or "Trinity" is defined not as three persons in one being but as three separate personal beings. These three beings are united in a common purpose, not a common substance (Mc Conkie 1966: 319, 576). Moreover, all three of these beings have bodies, but the body of the Holy Ghost differs from that of the Father and the Son: "From latter-day revelation we learn that the Father and the Son have tangible bodies of flesh and bone and that the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit, without flesh and bone .... [He] has his being separate and apart from his fellow Gods. His spirit body is in all respects comparable to the kind of a body that [Jesus] possessed before ... the process of mortal birth" (McConkie 1966: 253-254). At this juncture two distinctives deserve emphasis. We shall note that the bodies of the Father and the Son are physical in nature while the body of the Holy Ghost is a "spirit body" (however, the Son also possessed a spirit body before his Incarnation). In addition, Mormon thought differentiates between the terms "Holy Ghost" and "Holy Spirit," using only "Holy Ghost" to describe the third person of the Godhead, while "Holy Spirit" is the impersonal force of divine intelligence (McConkie 1966: 752-753). Since these two points are unique to Mormonism and not what one would expect from Faith theology, even given its Nation of Islam influences, their coincidence in the writings of a Word-Faith leader alongside tritheism render it highly probable that the leader is borrowing them from Mormon theology. Precisely such a coincidence occurs in Benny Hinn's (1997: 140, 144, italics his) conception of the Trinity, which is admittedly tritheistic and unites the persons in purpose instead of substance: "The Trinity, as we see, is comprised of three distinct and unique entities. But you need to understand Their Oneness-Their unity. It is essential that you recognize that the all-embracing Oneness we are talking about is con- nected to the work of the Godhead .... They are a team working together in complete accord and eternal harmony." As for the differing bodies of the Trinitarian persons, Hinn (1997: 82) contends that the Father has "the appearance ... of a man," depicted by the Hebrew</page><page sequence="21">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 107 Biblical prophets as possessing such "features" as "lips, tongue, breath, eyesight, and a back ... fingers ... hands and a face." Similarly, Jesus possesses a separate human body: "And His glorified human body is distinct from the divine form of God the Father" (Hinn 1997: 84). However, Hinn (1997: 84-85) insists, employing precisely the same ter- minology as Mormonism, that the body of the "Holy Ghost" is a "spirit body" and refrains in this context from employing the title "Holy Spirit": "I believe the Holy Ghost is spirit body, not with actual flesh and blood but a spirit being with form." Carefully utilizing the past and present tenses in the same fashion as Mormonism, Hinn (1997: 87) goes on to assert "that as Jesus looked ... so the Holy Ghost looks," namely, that there was a time that Jesus possessed a spirit body as does the Holy Ghost. On the issue of the Godhead, therefore, the hypothesis of Hinn's dependence on LDS theology exhibits great plausibility and explanatory power. A second exegetical issue surrounds Hinn's concept of "eternal life" as "the life of God" or "the God-kind of life." Unlike the traditional understanding of eternal life (Greek zoe ai6nia) in either the quantitat- ive or timeless sense of unending life, Hinn claims that the noun zod denotes a qualitatively different life than experienced by unregenerate humanity-namely, living on the level of a god rather than the level of an ordinary human. For Hinn (1999), zoe refers to the very nature of existence possessed by God himself, namely, "the substance-the source, the power-the unseen force that makes God, God ... [and] places Him above everything else that exists." Thus in his exegesis of John 10:10, "I have come that you may have life (lexical form zod), and that you may have it more abundantly," Hinn defines zoe as "eternal life ... the God-kind of life, the absolute life of God" (Hinn 2001). As expected from Faith anthropology, Hinn (2001) alleges that the pre-Fall Adam possessed the "God-kind of life": "Adam had that life force in him before he committed high treason." Hinn (2001) declares that this life force is restored at the moment of spiritual rebirth: "There was imparted into you zoe, the life of God." Here it should be noted that zod is simply the normal Koine term for "life" (Louw 1988-1989: 1.261-7.262; 2.113; Bauer et al. 1979: 340-341); moreover, the standard lexicons consistently define zoe aionia in terms of everlasting or time- less existence rather than God's existence (Louw: 1.642, 2.7; Bauer: 28, 336-337). Hence any precedent for this belief must come from sources other than linguistic. Such sources are readily available in LDS literature on the doctrine of "eternal life," which claimed uniqueness, prior to the advent of Faith theology, in teaching the same qualitative understanding of this</page><page sequence="22">108 Journal of the American Academy of Religion expression as Hinn now holds. Although it is impossible, as in the case of the Trinity, to point precisely to which LDS sources Hinn employed due to the widespread nature of this teaching, the circumstantial evi- dence points strongly to Hinn's appropriation of this concept from Mormon theology, which we shall demonstrate by citing representative sources past and present. According to Joseph Fielding Smith (1960: 327), "Eternal life is the name of the kind of life possessed by the Father and the Son; it is exaltation in the eternal realm." The official Gospel Principles echoes the past Mormon Apostle's qualitative por- trayal of eternal life: "Exaltation is eternal life, the kind of life that God lives .... We can become Gods like our heavenly Father" (290). Just as Mormon thought defines "eternal life" in a non-durational way, so LDS exegetes have associated this life exclusively with zoe. Stephen Robinson (1998: 63-64), for example, argues that zo? specifically means "the God-kind of life" by distinguishing between this term and bios, which he takes to mean "biological life": "[T]he great promise of Christianity is that humans can share Christ's type of life (Greek zoe rather than bios) and thus can become sons and daughters of God .... [Christ] came ... in order to spread to other men the kind of life He has." It is difficult to avoid the conclusion, then, that Hinn has derived his model of eternal life and its exegetical underpinnings from Mormon theology. Employing our architectural metaphor, the evidence indicates that the current Word-Faith Movement represents the practical outworking of a conceptual edifice grounded upon a theological foundation derived from the Nation of Islam and upheld by a Mormon-based exegetical frame. The direct evidence decisively showed both Frederick K. C. Price's thorough cognizance of primary Nation of Islam theologi- cal texts and his reshaping of Nation doctrines along Christian lines, which resultant doctrines were augmented and propagated by Kenneth Copeland and Benny Hinn. Such doctrines played an important etiolo- gical role in furnishing the metaphysical rationale for preexisting Faith exegetical suppositions, especially the command to wield the God-kind of faith in creating new realities of health and prosperity. In addition, the indirect evidence provided strong circumstantial verification for the acquisition by Copeland and Hinn of several expositions from LDS hermeneutics for scriptural passages, such as those depicting God anthropomorphically and concerning matters of deification, which function as common prooftexts for Mormonism and the Word-Faith Movement. Consequently, it appears that the constant geographical proximity of both the Nation of Islam and Mormonism to the Word- Faith Movement gradually drew the attention of Faith leaders, which in turn attracted them to concepts in these NRMs which could play</page><page sequence="23">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 109 needed constructive or apologetic roles, thus facilitating the trans- mission and integration of Nation and Mormon thought into the Word-Faith Movement. Since, as Clifford Geertz (1973: 89-95) observes, a symbiotic relationship exists between the religious beliefs and the Sitz im Leben of any community, it is important for maximal understanding of these three NRMs to examine the sociological factors for which their beliefs compose frameworks giving meaningful form to the daily experiences of their adherents. WORD-FAITH, NATION OF ISLAM, AND MORMONISM AS SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION PARTNERS We shall now examine the broader sociological issues which have led the Word-Faith Movement, the Nation of Islam, and the LDS Church to conceive of God and humanity as sharing the same nature and to define the goal for their adherents as being gods themselves. All of these NRMs seem to be governed by four interdependent trajectories: gndsis concerning the true identity of the faithful; etiology and comfort for the hardships suffered by underprivileged or marginalized groups; the bestowal of ultimate significance upon movement and change; and a form of personal empowerment that enables each individual believer to seize control of the circumstances which she or he views as proble- matic. Although it is impossible to detect motives for theological depen- dence with the same degree of certainty as the dependence itself, it is plausible that Faith theologians, such as Price, Copeland, and Hinn, implicitly recognized the power of these social trajectories to enhance the character and quality of life of their constituents, many of whom either fall economically within the lower to middle classes or are min- orities or both, and thus appropriated from the predecessor NRMs the theological ideas which generated these trajectories (Harrison 2005: 148-149). In fact, we might go farther, and suggest that, along with self-conscious borrowing, the social-structural conditions in which the movements all arose, encouraged strikingly similar doctrinal trajectories from each. The notion that the salvific process begins with gn6sis of one's true nature-a gnosis which is said to be suppressed by institutional Christianity--serves to exalt in the sight of God the followers of Mormonism, the Nation of Islam, and the Faith movement over their mainstream counterparts, who are said to be enslaved by their ignor- ance to the kingdom of Satan. Since the founders of Mormonism and the Nation of Islam had no formal theological training and thus no cre- dentials recognized by the preexisting establishments, both movements</page><page sequence="24">110 Journal of the American Academy of Religion claimed that gnosis furnished their leadership with the "inner light" necessary to accurately understand the sacred text. Turning the tables, moreover, the founders of these NRMs combined two key principles- that "God is no respecter of persons" and the pridefulness of relying on human reason to discern religious truths (Smith 1973: 1.368; Muhammad 1997: 221-222)-to argue that God designed Scripture to be a snare for any who apply historical and philosophical principles to the text.8 By opposing hubris to the inner light, these NRMs were quickly able to conveniently explain both why outsiders, especially scho- lars and theologians, interpret key texts differently and why they are wrong in doing so. Therefore Mormons hold that the Bible is only authoritative "insofar as it is translated correctly," i.e. as it is expounded by modern prophets and apostles (Talmage 1982: 236), and the Nation of Islam derisively regards African American academic dissenters as "Ph.D. 'house' and 'yard' Negroes," each of whom Elijah Muhammad branded an "Uncle Thomas ... speak[ing] with a Yale or Harvard accent and ... known as Professor, Doctor ... even Right Reverend Doctor" (Malcolm X 1965: 279-280). Owing to their skepticism of the secular academy, both NRMs have established their own educational programs, such as LDS Missionary Training Centers and the Fruit of Islam, as well as faith-based institutions of higher learning like Brigham Young University (established in 1875) and the University of Islam at Detroit (established in 1931). Such skepticism is extended by the Word-Faith Movement to insti- tutions supported by denominational bodies. According to Harrison (2005: 9, 149), [K]nowledge is to be gained through direct revelation from God to the individual believer .... It is not necessarily gained through the sort of intellectual training one would receive in a seminary, college, or uni- versity. People who have degrees-especially if they disagree with the movement's teaching-are frequently depicted in its literature and by its ministers as having allowed their education to hinder their ability to read the Bible and to understand what God 'really' means to say. As Price (2002: 40) puts it: "The Bible clearly delineates who can and who cannot understand it. It is a coded book, with a coded message ... because the Bible is not for everyone. It's only for God's people. And you have to be connected to God to have the spiritual insight to be able 8 We must stress that this observation only applies to early Mormonism, the anti-religiocritical tide of which has decisively turned in the contemporary LDS academy.</page><page sequence="25">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 111 to understand what you are reading." Accordingly, the doctrinal views of those who have been trained for ministerial service in Hagin's Rhema Bible Training Center or similar Faith institutions are held up as superior to those of clergy educated in graduate theological seminaries. Various forms of dualistic theodicy featuring human protagonists play a key role for Mormonism, the Nation of Islam, and the Word- Faith Movement in providing a coherent explanation for the suffering of their followers, especially during times of persecution or social injus- tice. Each of these NRMs affirms that all forms of suffering, including sin, sickness, natural evil, moral evil, and death, are caused exclusively by the demonic without the permission, much less ordination, of the divine. As Clifford Geertz (1973: 104) points out, these twin func- tions are vitally important because the problem of suffering in the religious sphere is not how to avoid suffering but how to make sense of and endure it. For this reason, the theodicies furnished by these NRMs are, to employ the classification system of Peter L. Berger (1967: 58), "plausible," since they enable individuals to account for painful experiences in socially and subjectively convincing terms and since, for sufferers of injustice, the need for meaning is greater than the need for happiness. Accordingly, when the Mormons were forced along their westward trek from Fayette, New York to Kirtland, Ohio by Catholic and Protestant persecution, Joseph Smith purportedly received via divine revelation that the collective religion of Christians apart from his restored church was satanic: "There are save two churches only: the one is the church of the Lamb of God, and the other is the church of the devil .... that great and abominable church, which is the mother of abominations" (1 Nephi 14:3, 9-10; see Ostling 1999: 30). Similarly, the Nation of Islam asserts that, in order to further oppress African Americans, the white dominated Christian church insisted that earthly suffering was the divinely ordained gateway to riches and glory in a fic- tional afterlife (Malcolm X 1965: 253). Likewise, by identifying all suf- fering as satanic oppression, the Word-Faith Movement denounces what they call the "traditional Christian" belief that God may sover- eignly afflict people with sickness to cause them to grow in faith or to punish them for sin (Price 2002: 135). Copeland (1993b) even goes so far as to allege that adherence to this false belief utterly corrupted the church from the time of Constantine until the birth of Pentecostalism: "The religious idea that God chastises His own with sickness and disease and poverty is the very thing that has caused the church to go 1500 years without the knowledge of the Holy Spirit."</page><page sequence="26">112 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Since the faithful share in the divine nature and are either potential or actual gods, each of the pertinent NRMs demands that individuals must engage in spiritual combat against the forces of evil, such that believers are directly responsible for their own successes or failures. It is fascinating that the Mormon doctrine of deification is entirely absent from the Book of Mormon and did not emerge until around 1831, when Smith's beleaguered followers were both physically persecuted and intellectually attacked by mainline Christian leaders (Quinn 1994: 91; Arrington 1979: 57-58). In response, Smith pronounced the doc- trine of deification to his followers, which he victoriously reiterated in 1843 upon the community's arrival at Nauvoo (D&amp;C 132: 19-20). Such a doctrine of progression to godhood not only served as a source of otherworldly comfort for the downtrodden community but also furn- ished a spiritual analogue to their physical pilgrimage. In both of these pilgrimages, individual believers themselves, through "wise use of their agency" or free will (Smith 1977: 372), were responsible for striving against various manifestations of Satan in drawing increasingly closer to the destination appropriate to each domain-in the spiritual domain, exaltation to deity, and in the earthly domain, to the New Jerusalem where the community would be safe from their oppressors and where God would physically return (D&amp;C 57:6; Smith 1973: 3.175). In a similar fashion, the Nation of Islam couples the spiritual pilgrimage of deification with the earthly pilgrimage of African Americans physically separating from the whites to form their own territory marked by social justice and eradication of poverty (Tsoukalas 2001: 78). Such separation, Elijah Muhammad insisted, was the responsibility of deified blacks and not Allah; although Nation members were "divinely taught and sent by God Himself ... the only way the black people caught up in this society can be saved is not to integrate into this corrupt society, but to separate from it, to a land of our own, where we can reform ourselves" (Muhammad 2002a: 168). Here it should be noted that both early Mormonism and the Nation of Islam generated "spiritual warfare" theodicies, where believers themselves serve as the divine forces strug- gling against the powers of Satan and where ultimate significance is placed upon self-directed movement and concurrent change in the material and spiritual realms. Empowering believers with the knowledge of their ontological equality with God to work for both material and spiritual blessings, this same kind of spiritual warfare theodicy is palpable in the Word-Faith Movement. In their theodicy, the spiritual pilgrimage of deification is directly correlated with the earthly pilgrimage of socioeconomic advancement and physical vitality, such that a lack of material</page><page sequence="27">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 113 prosperity or bodily health can only result from poor spiritual behavior and vice versa (Harrison 2005: 56, 59-61). God will not materially provide for or heal anyone today, as he has already furnished complete prosperity and healing for everyone who is born again through Christ; rather, "little gods" must instantiate their own blessings and health by speaking words of faith. This form of personal empowerment enables each individual believer to take authority over and defeat all satanically induced circumstances in her or his life. As Price (1995) baldly asserted concerning the physical and financial challenges of the faithful, "Whether you win or lose is not up to God. Whether you are a success or a failure is not up to God. It is up to you .... God is on vacation ... the work [he] did for our benefit is already done on [his] part." Moreover, the Faith relationship between sin and suffering, both monetary and physical, functions as a verification mechanism as well as a religious "safety-net" furnishing believers tangible evidence of their spiritual status in the sight of God. Thus earthly prosperity comprises direct proof that believers are living spiritually righteous lives before God, while earthly lack furnishes equally direct evidence that believers have sinned and thus separated themselves from God's will. Much like the Roman Catholic sevenfold sacramental system, the Faith theodicy attempts to remove any subjectivity concerning the status of individuals in the sight of God, for which lack of clear spiritual guidance Faith tea- chers frequently chide "traditional Christianity," by which they mean conservative Protestantism (Hinn 1993; Price 1993; Copeland 1995). A glaring deficiency of conservative Protestantism, from the perspective of Faith leaders, is its inability to show people, beyond the simple assur- ance of salvation, precisely "how they are doing" in their relationship with God, thus spawning uncertainty as to the quality of their friend- ship with God and confusion as to what the will of God is for their lives (Price 1998: 34-35). By contrast, the Faith theodicy, through its interlocking social and spiritual pilgrimages, enables believers to "take dominion over" their circumstances as little gods and to gauge their level of spirituality based on their success or failure in doing so (Copeland 2005: 119). In this way the Faith Movement facilitates, what Clifford Geertz called "movement back and forth between the religious perspective and the common-sense perspective," thereby integrating life here and now with spiritual verities. Our evaluation of the sociological import of the Word-Faith Movement, including its progressive charac- ter and its similarities to theodicies engendered by geographic move- ment (such as found in Mormonism and the Nation of Islam), finds confirmation in the research of Milmon Harrison (2005: 156-157; emphasis this), whose observations are worth quoting in full.</page><page sequence="28">114 Journal of the American Academy of Religion [A]t its very essence, the Faith Message operates in the lives of its fol- lowers as an ideology of socioeconomic transition .... [I]ts power and resonance are ... dependent upon ... the process by which one yearns for and then works toward achieving, throug4h faith, self-improvement and self-actualization with tangible results to follow .... It might seem obvious to consider the need for a doctrine that would help those who had moved from one geographical location to another to provide some sense of ultimate meaning and transcendent continuity as they sought to reestablish themselves in a new and foreign place. But it is just as important for people who have moved from one socioeconomic level to another to be able to draw upon some form of ideology that helps makes sense of their experiences and issues their new status presents to them or that they now have access to. CONCLUSION Anchoring the practical benefits of personal empowerment to indi- viduals often outside the socioeconomic mainstream upon a foundation of theological anthropocentrism, the Word-Faith Movement represents a distinctive attempt within (or at least on the edge of) the Christian tradition, broadly defined, to bridge the gap between the sacred and profane dimensions of human experience. Although this endeavor is distinctive, it should not be perceived as an altogether unique religious modality; as we have seen, its conceptual infrastructure blends diverse doctrinal ingredients. But since the earlier studies of the movement, by McConnell and Harrison, were monotraditional and sociological in character, the identity of these influences has until the present histori- cal-comparative study gone undetected. We have here argued that the two major historical roots of the contemporary Faith infrastructure lie in the Nation of Islam and Mormonism, with the former largely responsible for its theologically humanistic foundation and the latter for its exegetical frame. Furthermore, in conversation with its two predeces- sor NRMs, deeper insight is gained regarding the coherence and appeal of the Faith Movement as a cultural system in which spiritual and material progress intersect. We may justifiably expect, therefore, that as the Faith Movement grows in popularity and influence, as it is currently poised to do, the present identification of the Nation of Islam and Mormonism as its parent traditions will enable scholars to better anticipate and compre- hend its upcoming successes and challenges. We round out this investigation by considering the impact of our findings upon the academic study of NRMs in general and upon the</page><page sequence="29">MacGregor: The Word-Faith Movement 115 overall condition of American religion in late modernity. Our compara- tive look at the Nation of Islam, Mormonism, and the Word-Faith Movement has suggested that a cluster of distinguishing marks of NRMs may surround their rejection of the typical religious division between the sacred and secular in their quest for a theocracy of sorts. In an observation once disparagingly (i.e. by early social scientists) rele- gated to "magic," the practitioners of NRMs insist on playing a direct role in divine governance of the earthly realm. By postulating that humanity and deity comprise the same species of being, the NRMs under examination offer their adherents the ability, utilizable either in the present age (Word-Faith Movement and Nation of Islam) or the one to come (Mormonism), to manipulate the spiritual forces thought to underlie economic and social phenomena. However, unlike so-called "magic," where humans typically coerce the gods to do their bidding, the adherents of these NRMs are personally responsible for their suc- cesses or failures. Ironically, then, while NRMs have often been seen as weapons of the weak, or consolation devices for the marginalized and those who feel besieged by the mainstream culture or the forces of modernity, these NRMs suggest that not consolation for impotence, but radical empowerment, is attractive to their adherents. It remains for future research to explore whether any or all of these observations do in fact hold as general indicators of NRMs. If so, they would prove exceed- ingly helpful in providing the somewhat loose and amorphous category of "new religious movements" with clear boundaries, thereby enabling scholars to differentiate between NRMs and sects in the current "gray area" of groups consigned to non-mainstream status by the dominant religions that disapprove of them. Our analysis of the current shape of the Word-Faith Movement carries several important implications for the character of contemporary religion in America. The Faith Movement appears to be part of a wider trend of religious accommodation toward American culture that tries to avail itself of supernatural power in order to achieve distinctly American goals. This trend may be characterized as an early twenty- first century inverse of the early twentieth-century Social Gospel move- ment: while the Social Gospel transferred traditional theological cat- egories, such as sin, redemption, and the Kingdom of God, from the supernatural realm to the temporal order, the contemporary trend transfers ostensibly mundane socioeconomic realities out of the natural realm into the domain of the supernatural. Such a trend begins with the "American dream" of physical and material prosperity and closely associates it with the "gospel message" even to the point of identifi- cation. Moreover, the distinctly American emphasis on individualism is</page><page sequence="30">116 Journal of the American Academy of Religion reflected in the trend's "do-it-yourself' character, manifested in the admonition to supernaturally create one's own temporal advantages. Since this trend is largely taking place within Christian circles, our investigation raises afresh the overarching question of H. Richard Niebuhr as to the contemporary relationship between Christianity and culture. To what degrees does current American Christianity interpret Christ as "of culture" and as "the transformer of culture," and are these constructs manifesting themselves as complementary or contradictory? It is our hope that this study of the diverse influences which have coalesced into the Word-Faith theological system will both stimulate and help facilitate future research into these pivotal issues affecting powerfully the broader shape of contemporary American religiosity.
