<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is a "Christian Naturalism" Possible?: Exploring the Boundaries of a Tradition Jerome A. Stone / Meadville Lombard Theological School I. What is Christian Naturalism? a Christian naturalism possible? It sounds like a contradiction in terms. However, depending on the meaning of the terms, it is not only possible but highly desirable. The purpose of this article is to sketch the possibility of a Christian naturalism, drawing on a number of twentieth- and twenty-first- century theologians. Naturalism is a contrast term, like "left" or "up," which gets its meaning partly from opposition to another term, in this case "supernaturalism" or some- times "supranaturalism." It is a set of beliefs which focuses on this world. (Of course, there is no other world, according to naturalism, but since Christians and others have often spoken of God, soul, and/or heaven as distinct from this world, naturalism is a denial of that strand of the Christian tradition.) As Bernard Loomer wrote, it is a shift from living as a pilgrim between this world and the other world to an earth-creature resident in this.1 What would a Christian naturalism be? My suggestion is that, first, a Chris- tian naturalist would be willing to use the term "God" as the focus of the reli- gious attitude. This will be a naturalistic theism. Typically such a naturalistic theism will either refer to God as the entire universe in its creative or other aspect (George B. Foster, Edward S. Ames, Bernard M. Loomer) or else God as the creative or transformative process or forces within the universe (Henry Nelson Wieman, Karl Peters). In the second place, if a writer has a discussion of the positive significance of Christ, this would further validate the use of the term "Christian naturalism." Briefly put, my proposal is that a Christian naturalism definitely needs: (a) some notion of God, and (b) probably needs something like a Christology, both within the framework of a naturalist world view. This article explores some examples of both of these. Why bother? Well, since naturalism is a major world view today, it would be well for the future of Christianity if it could be stated in naturalistic terms without losing too much of its heart. 1. Bernard M.

Affirming a naturalistic theism with a naturalistic Christology would continue much of the distinctive thrust of the way of life of the Christian communities without an imperialistic attitude toward other religions. Such a Christian naturalistic theism would involve some change from the traditional Christian outlook, even when informed by most liberal theologies. While such change might be seen by some as a loss to be challenged or to be accepted with some mourning, it might be greeted by others as a way to be Christian with intellectual integrity. A problem arises since many theologians do not use the term "supernatu- ralism" to describe their own view. At that point there is no useful contrast term to "naturalism," and the term expands to be nearly meaningless. For this reason, my technical definition of naturalism involves the denial (in however tentative or hypothetical fashion) of "an ontologically distinct and superior entity, realm, or ground (such as God, soul, or heaven) to ground, explain, or give meaning to this world"2 To be sure, any religion, like Christianity, that affirms the creation, incarnation, and redemption has a naturalistic dimension. But naturalists affirm that (as far as we can tell) nature, including humans and their cultures, is all there is. Many process theologians and panentheists speak of God as immanent within the world and hence of themselves as naturalists. However, God, as generally understood by process thought, is so ontologically unique (e.g., is an entity surpassable by none except itself) as to fall outside of our definition of naturalism. David Griffin, for example, in Religion and Scientific Natural- ism, uses the term "naturalism" to describe his own view because it rejects any supernatural interruption of the natural order. However, this God, who is a supreme power, the only entity involved in the origination of every other event and who gives to each its ideal aim, is ontologically distinct and superior, and thus falls outside our definition. One can concede the validity of Griffin's use of the term "naturalism" within his framework, which is part of a philosophical tradition going back several decades. However, my use of the term is also part of a well-recognized philosophical movement which is at least as venerable.3 Wesley Wildman has argued for a type of naturalism that rejects what he calls "supranaturalism." This type of naturalism "resists treating ultimate re- ality as an ontological object with determinate features that make sense apart 2. See Jerome A.

He refers to Friedrich Schleiermacher, Paul Tillich, Robert Neville, Gordon Kaufman, as well as the apophatic mystics of all religions. While there is an affinity between this "ground of being naturalism" and the naturalism of this article, most naturalists utilized in this article would not use the term in Wildman's sense. Further explorations in this area are called for. Wildman's approach merits serious consideration. It should be noted that there have been several Jewish naturalists, including Samuel Alexander, Mordecai Kaplan, Jack Cohen, Henry S. Levinson, and Da- vid Oler.5 In my judgment as an outsider, Kaplan and his follower Cohen pres- ent the fullest elaboration of a Jewish naturalism. Sometimes Kaplan speaks of God as the power that makes for human flourishing with justice, sometimes as the sum of the organizing forces and relationships which are making a cosmos out of chaos. He includes an account of Torah and the people of Israel, which are functional analogues to Christ for a Christian naturalism. II. Naturalistic Theism There are a number of possible ways to conceive of a naturalistic theism. But we do not have to imagine them. A number of ways have already been developed. Many people do not realize this, and thus these options are not live options for them. Rather than having been tried and found wanting, they have been wanted and not tried. To support the claim that naturalistic theism is a live option, I will briefly consider a number of twentieth- and twenty-first-century writers who developed what could be called a naturalistic theism (or a theistic naturalism if that be preferred). Now we are dealing with powerful topics. "God" is a term which fulfills many psychological and sociological functions (and dysfunctions). It is a dangerous word, to be used with caution, if at all. Indeed, it is a fighting word. This may seem obvious, but it needs to be emphasized because we shall be delving into some very abstract territory. We shall be employing some terse formulations which are shorthand for some potent material. Thus I remind the reader that the theoretical language we shall be using needs to be supplemented by the richer language of poetry, metaphor, and (dare I say) myth, by the visual arts, dance, and silence. Language abstracts and tends to distort. That does not mean that we can dispense with it. 4.

In short, I shall be radically condensing into a few short phrases beliefs by which people live and sometimes live abundantly. a. God as the Universe in One of its Aspects We could begin with Spinoza. However, we shall start with a number of theolo- gians and scholars of religion at the University of Chicago whose publications stretch from 1909 to 1987 and who developed a notion of God as the universe considered religiously. These writers started a tradition of naturalistic theism (or, as some called it, religious naturalism) which continues to this day. Although some of them were known chiefly for their sociohistorical and functional stud- ies, they also engaged in theological experimentation in a naturalistic direction.6 George Burman Foster spoke of God in two ways in The Function of Religion in Mans Struggle for Existence.1 First, God is the world in its ideal-achieving capacity. Second, just as the modern idea is that the mind is the body in one of its aspects or ways of behaving, so God is the universe in one its aspects or ways of behaving.8 Edward Scribner Ames combined, at various times, teaching in the philosophy department at Chicago, being Dean of Disciples House and pastor of the lo- cal Disciples of Christ church. Ames thought that the idea of God should be revised. God is the reality of the world in certain aspects, namely, the orderli- ness, love, and intelligence, or the order, beauty, and expansion in the world.9 For Ames, God also functioned as the practical absolute, something like a Kantian moral regulative concept. "God is used as the standard of reference for the adequacy of specific ideals. When a line of conduct is considered, the question arises for the religious man as to whether such conduct is consistent with loyalty with God."10 6. For a fuller treatment of these figures as well as how some of them used the terms natural- ism and religious naturalism, see Ibid. 7.

Stone, The Chicago School of Theology - Pioneers in Religious Inquiry, (Lewiston, NY: The Edwin Mellen Press, 1996), 1:52, 45^6. 8. In his later years, Foster seems to have flirted with a humanism which rejected any use for the term "God." Thus Foster, Wieman, and the present writer might possibly be read as pointing to the slippery slope of Christian naturalism. 9.

"Is Theism Essential to Religion?" is a sustained attack on a theism which conceives of God as creator and gover- nor of the world, in which God provides a theological explanation of nature, a theological anchor for political authority, and an interpretation of religious and moral experience.11 For Smith, the truth lies somewhere between theism, as he defines it, and antitheism. We must be related to the nonhuman environment. Humans by themselves are not enough. We bring our highest values and ideals in religion into the presence of the vast cosmic mystery that has produced us and that holds us in its power, and we seek to gain a blessing from this power on our ideals and values. Belief in God means that there may be found within the nonhuman environment on which we depend a quality of the cosmic process akin to our own spiritual life. Just what new idea of God will emerge is not clear. God will be interpreted in terms of social reciprocity with an as yet inadequately defined cosmic support of human values. The religious orientation will take the form of comradeship with that aspect of our nonhuman environment which enriches our life. Anthropomorphic symbols will be used to promote that experi- ence, but they will not be pressed into exact theological description. Bernard Loomer developed a naturalistic theology late in life. He identified God with the totality of the world, "with the concrete interconnected totality of this struggling, imperfect, unfinished, and evolving societal web."12 This totality, the concretely actual God, is morally ambiguous.13 Only an abstract God could be unambiguous. Why use the word "God?" Why not call this interconnected web of existence "the universe?" "In our traditions the term 'God' is the symbol of ultimate values and meanings. . . . The world is God because it is the source and preserver of meaning; because the creative advance of the world in its adventure is the supreme cause to be served; because ... the world is holy ground; and because it contains and yet enshrouds the ultimate mystery inherent within existence itself."14 Issues of space prevent me from discussing other writers such as William Bernhardt of the Iliff School of Theology; the Unitarian preacher and Presi- 11.

God as a Collection A few authors have dared to speak of God as a collective term for a set of forces or experiences which, taken together, are an appropriate object of reli- gious attitudes. Shailer Mathews, sometime Dean of the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, was primarily an advocate of a sociohistorical approach to Christian theology, especially of the Biblical period. Three times in his later writings, he gives us a naturalistic definition of God. For example, "God is our conception, born of social experience, of the personality-evolving and personally responsive elements of our cosmic environment with which we are organically related."16 In his early writings, Bernard Meland developed a conception of God in terms of an alternation between two approaches to reality. The contemplative approach, or worship, involves deep emotional enjoyment of our relation to the total cosmic environment and commitment to its demands and opportunities. The analytic approach is a theoretical and experimental investigation of the world and practical adjustment to it. "God" is a term we use in the contempla- tive mood when we respond appreciatively. It is a collective term referring to the most important conditions on which human life depends.17 c. God as a Process within the World Besides God conceived as the entire universe religiously apprehended or as a set of elements in our experience of the universe, a number of writers speak of God as a process within the universe. 15.

Although he constantly refined the definition of the object of religious inquiry or God, a typical version went like this: "What transforms man as he cannot transform himself to save him from evil and lead him to the best human life can ever attain, provided that he give himself over to it in religious faith and meet other required conditions."18 Within Wieman's naturalistic worldview, that which can transform us as we cannot transform ourselves is a single process, the process of integration in the world or what he later called "the creative event" (perhaps "creative process" would have been better) or "creative interchange." Wieman's thought went through several stages. Early in his writings, the process of integration extended beyond human interactions and included the history of the cosmos and biological evolution. 19 In The Source of Human Good, his focus was almost entirely on creative interaction in human individuals, groups, and history.20 In Mans Ultimate Commitment, reference to God has virtually dropped and he referred to human interchange on the human level as that which is worthy of our dedication.21 In his later writings, Meland seems to depart from his earlier notion of God as a collective term. Sometimes he speaks of God as "a sensitive nature within nature" that seeks to bring meaning out of brute force. He also speaks of God as a sensitive matrix of relations that nurtures and sustains us. Family love, the web of friendship, and community are part of this matrix, but there may be a "More" of nurturing forces that is not disclosed by empirical analysis.22 Karl Peters, coeditor of Zygon, refers to serendipitous creativity as a two- part process: first, the presence of variations in cosmic, biological, and human history, and second, the continuation of some of these variations.23 God is this 18.

Briefly, God is the twofold process of innovation and selection in cosmic, biological, personal, and cultural evolution. The Biblical terms for this pattern are Spirit (variation) and Logos (the law that selects). More recently I find Peters being more explicit in distinguishing between God as the mysterious source of being and the twofold creative process of variation and selection.24 God now is the ultimate source of all being and becoming. Although Peters is willing to use the metaphorical language of "Mother-Father God," he is emphatic that we know nothing about this ultimate source, that it is a creative mystery. The creative process within physical, biological, and cultural evolution is the two-fold process of variation and selection which can be spoken of using the traditional religious terms "Spirit" and "Word." Thus the ancient symbol of the Trinity still has current significance, referring to the transcendent source working through variation and selection. Recently Gordon Kaufman has been moving into naturalism.25 Although he does not usually use the term "naturalism," he does accept the term "biohis- torical naturalism."26 "God" refers to that which produces and leads us to a fuller human existence and at the same time relativizes our accomplishments, values, and projects. Briefly, "God" is that which humanizes and relativizes.27 Although this symbol is a human construct, it refers to a reality which is "nei- ther a simple fantasy of ours nor something that we can manipulate or control; God is a reality genuinely distinct from us and all our imaginings."28 In place of the notion of God as a personal agent, he develops a model based on the serendipitous, the surprising, unforeseen, and unexpected results of the long cosmic, biological, and historical process, results which are not always happy or fortunate from our viewpoint.29 This cosmic serendipity has "trajectories," series of events which, building on each other, seem in retrospect to take a particular direction. These trajectories move in many "directions," 24. Karl E. Peters, "Toward an Evolutionary Christian Theology," Zygon: Journal of Religion and Science 42 (March 2007): 61. 25.

Thus creativity in the abstract is not appropriate to take as normative for us humans. The creativity that is normative is the productive creativity on planet Earth and its environment that produced us. In this trajectory, loving attitude and behavior becomes significant, although it is not proper to say with- out qualification that "God is love," without using this term in a configuration of other terms including "power" and "eternity." This complex notion of trajectories of serendipitous creativity gives an over- all vision which provides a significant, but not dominant place, to human life. This orientation can encourage people to take responsible roles and provide a ground of hope (not certainty), which can motivate people to devote their lives to bringing about a more humane world. The word "God" is used, not simply to designate the collection of disparate cosmic powers that have produced us, but to focus our attention and commitment to this process. Why continue to use this ancient term? Why not just speak of forces working toward humanization and ecological health? By using this symbol to focus our attention and devotion, we make clear that we do not think of ourselves as disconnected from our forbears but as participants in an ongoing history and community. The idea of forces working toward humanization and ecological sanity is much too abstract to generate support. However, to commit ourselves to God is to use language that can draw together persons from all walks of life. Furthermore, the term focuses our attention on the gradually increasing unity of the specific cosmic trajectory toward humaneness. The word focuses our minds so that we grasp as significantly unified and of existential importance what we might otherwise take to be simply diverse processes and powers. "God" is the principal word available in our language for focusing our minds on this growing unity and direction of forces producing humanity. To speak of "God" does not commit us to the existence of some additional being in or beyond the world any more than "self" commits us to an individual "something" alongside the body (shades of G. B. Foster). Involved in Kaufman's notion is a transcendent point of criticism which relativizes all our dreams and values. This principle of prophetic protest is important for Christian naturalism. "What is needed is a nonreified version of the normative, a version according to which it is never expected that life 'on earth' will perfectly conform to the ideal - there will always be room for criticism and further transformation . . . but at the same time it is not held that the perfect or ideal 'exists' somehow or somewhere 'outside' or 'beyond' the world."30 30.

Godas Semi-independent Social Convention Concerning what is Ultimately Important For William Dean, God, or the sacred, is a social convention composed of im- ages of what is ultimately important. Although such a convention is continually subject to revision, it has a feedback effect in that it continually affects a people's interpretations of itself. It is partially independent of social interpretations. It has a life of its own. This semi-independence can be seen when the effects of a sacred convention go beyond what is predictable from the images that make up the convention. God, like any social construct such as the American Con- stitution, can turn back on the society and act in ways that were not intended. God is a living tradition about what is ultimately significant, is continually revised, and is partially independent of its society.31 Such a convention is not a mere projection. The sacredness of such a convention depends on its partial independence and also on the fact that it involves what is ultimately important, responding to the deepest questions of a people and suggesting ultimately important answers. God is such a convention within the life of the American public. Our images of ultimacy are morally ambiguous and so is God. Language about God is primarily an attempt to respond to the whole of reality rather than a call for what ought to be. Dean gives a richness to this notion of the morally ambiguous God by an analysis of Biblical material and the ritualized violence of American sports.32 Recently Dean has been critical of liberal theologies that remain within the limits of a naturalistic view and is developing the idea of "the irony of athe- ism."33 When a secular culture is pursued all of the way, a religious ground is found. This is not traditional theism, but a vision interfused with mystery. e. The Theistic Valuational Stance Charley Hardwick expounds a Christian theology within a naturalism that as- serts that only physical entities exist.34 His physicalism asserts that while noth- ing exists except mathematical-physical entities, nonphysical things, emergent properties such as consciousness and intention, are real, though there are cor- 31.

There is thus explanatory and semantic autonomy among disciplines other than physics, including theology. He urges theologians to accept four basic features of naturalism: (1) only the world of nature is real, (2) this world requires no sufficient reason beyond itself to account for its origin, (3) nature as a whole is understandable without appeal to any kind of intelligence or purposive agent, and (4) every natural event is itself a product of other natural events.35 Corollaries of these theses are the denials: (1) that God is personal, (2) that some form of cosmic teleology is true, and (3) that there is a cosmic conservation of value. God cannot be an entity. Yet we can affirm "God exists." This is a nonrefer- ential assertion that expresses the theistic valuational stance. The heart of the Christian life is God's gift of faith as openness to the future. This gift is what is expressed in the nonreferential assertion that "God exists." This assertion articulates a "seeing-as," specifically, it expresses the gift of openness to the future. The Christian valuational stance is openness to the future, the move from bondage to liberation, transformation from inauthentic to authentic existence. "God" means the giftedness of this move, the fact that this transformation is not of ourselves but comes to us. God language is not required for this trans- formation, but does provide the best account of it. III. Naturalistic Christology For Shailer Mathews, the death of Christ is no longer a matter of satisfying the divine honor, punitive justice, vicarious suffering, or expiation36 The significance of Christ is primarily illustrative. "The personality-evolving forces to which we apply the term deity," help us move toward freer personality, toward "the triumph over the physical order and the development of proper morality." For Christians, "such experience is illustrated and epitomized in Jesus."37 The death of Jesus shows how the spirit of coercion and acquisitiveness brings suffering. In his humiliation and death he was crushed by impersonal forces, but even as he was crushed he was shown to be superior to those forces. The willingness of Jesus to hold tenaciously to the supremacy of good will showed that the value of the individual is more than biological. Wieman sees the creative process at work in the world as operative to trans- form the shattered community of disciples after the death of Jesus. The resur- 35.

Wieman also uses the term "Christ" or "the living Christ" to refer to the transformative power operative in history which grew out of this event.38 For Meland, the pictures presented in the Gospels witness to a New Creation of freedom and power in individuals-in-community. This creation was a genuine novelty, which emerged out of its antecedent structures. Grace transformed both the canons of justice to partake of love and forgiveness and also the orders of reason toward creativity in this new matrix of sensitivity. This was a transformation from a security-driven life to a freedom for relationships, to love, forgive, and accept the role of the Suffering Servant. This power with a tender regard for relationships is not simply coercive, but is the power of sensitivity. This power is not nonresistance but is an active dealing with issues with more sensitivity than is possible where self-interest and possessiveness with their attendant fears, fixations, and mistrust prevail. This New Creation has since become a cultural force in human history and, according to Christians, illumines God's participation in the concrete events of history as a redemptive power.39 For Kaufman the orthodox picture of Jesus as Son of God and Savior (Je- sus-trajectory j) is based on the distinction between this world and the other world. Kaufman proposes instead Jesus-trajectory2 as an expression of the extraordinary creativity of the Jesus-movement as it grew. Jesus is a criterion or model for Christians about what human life ought to be. This normativity is not because God or Jesus has commanded it but because of our own judg- ment. It is a basic decision for which we must take responsibility. We must also live out our response to this normativity of Jesus in awareness of the diversity of normative frameworks. Christians "regard such themes as self-giving love (agape), forgiveness, nonviolence, generosity, and the like as of continuing (perhaps universal) significance." Worship should express itself "in loving our neighbors and our enemies as we love ourselves, caring for the hungry and the poor, taking up 'the ministry of reconciliation.'" Thus the story of Jesus points toward "the creation and sustenance of communities of love and freedom, reconciliation and peace."40 We need to develop new patterns of association 38.

We need to develop a spirit of self-sacrifice for the well-being of all humanity and of the whole net- work of life on Earth, a spirit that can subdue the instincts for self-preservation and self-defense. Even such ideals as justice, order, love, peace, and freedom need to be creatively reconceived in the light of the vision of humanity made visible through the images and stories of Jesus and his followers. Perhaps the very radicality of Jesus's vision is capable of inspiring us to break through to the fresh thinking that is required of us to meet today's global problems. While Kaufman makes no claims that the story of Jesus is the only one that can inspire the creativity that we need, he does assert that the radical themes in the image of Jesus, demanding the transvaluation of our values, can inspire new models for the creativity we now need to cultivate. While destructiveness is found from the Big Bang on through the evolution of life (to eat is to kill), the creativity manifest in our universe (God) has "brought us to a point where we can entertain the possibility of living in a moral order that is nonviolent and is loving; and we can deliberately choose to work toward such a order."41 Hardwick asserts that Christology is not about the being of Jesus once upon a time. Rather it is an existential question concerning "the significance of Jesus for us here and now in the present"*2 Thus both the traditional picture of Jesus and the quest for the historical Jesus are beside the point. However, historical research is not irrelevant. We can use it "to reconstruct the self-understanding authorized by the earliest witness's representation of Jesus."43 By faith in God's transformative action, which frees us to be open to the future, to be open to love, one receives the reassurance about the ultimate significance of one's life. For Karl Peters, Jesus is one of the few people who have catalyzed a major transformation in history,44 His teachings and example of undiscriminating love was a cultural mutation, a love that transformed the lives of many people around him. It appeared at his death that he was a mutation that was selected against. However, Jesus started an historical chain of influence that continued this mutation, indicating that the end of this mutation was only apparent, that the total Christ-event (Jesus together with the on-going chain of his influence 41.

Thus the cross of Jesus shows that the death of love can sometimes be transformed into a new, expanding love, and his resurrection is the symbol of the ongoing life of this love. (Peters is quite clear about the influence of Wieman on his thinking at this point and also refers to his reflections on the death of his first wife.) In similar fashion, the role of Herod in the Christmas story shows the mythic conflict between power and love. Note that the power of the influence of Jesus means that he was more than a great teacher who uttered a teaching about love. Peters describes salvation as a transformation "from poorer functioning in a less harmonious manner to more harmonious and mutually enhancing relationships."45 He contrasts this view, for which transformation is a matter of degrees, with what he calls the "linear-dichotomous" view of salvation, for which transformation is like making a U-turn. His notion rests on what he calls a "systems-relational" conception of humans as having both internal parts and relations to other humans, the nonhuman world and God. IV. Conclusion I believe that Kaufman is essentially correct. The concept of God functions in our religious life, personally and culturally, to refer both to what creates the universe or what humanizes us and also to the regulative principle that relativ- izes us. I am convinced that a naturalistic concept of God, particularly when employing both theoretical and devotional language, can provide a naturalistic principle of transcendence in both of these senses. I believe also that a naturalistic conception of Christ can be developed, especially one that focuses on "our new life in Christ," although I think that it must allow other redemptive agencies and paths. This new life will be a cultural emergent, fully embedded within the processes of history and thus of nature. A naturalist conception of grace would also be helpful. I have made an at- tempt at such a conception in my notion of the real aspect (as distinct from the ideal aspect) of situational or relative transcendence.46 A naturalistic theism will probably need to choose between one of the con- ceptions of God I developed in part one of this essay, or else develop a new one. Thus the reality of God within a naturalistic framework will need to be clarified. It may be that differing types of piety or religious orientation will 45.

For example, conceiving of God as the entire universe in one of its aspects may correspond to a piety of awe, while conceiving of God as the creative process(es) within the universe might correspond to a piety of openness to such creativity and/or of dedication to its workings.47 A naturalistic theism will need to recognize the place for both theoretical and devotional language in speaking of God. In other words, the usefulness and the limits of theoretical conceptions of God need to be reflected on, as well as the use and abuse of poetic, metaphorical, dramatic, and mythic language. The place of traditional devotional language about God in common worship and witness also will need scrutiny if naturalistic theism is ever to flourish with intellectual integrity within religious communities.48 Above all, the need for any God-language and related expressions (e.g., "divine," "sacred," "holy") needs to be analyzed, probably along the lines of Loomer and Kaufman referred to above or that of Frederick May Eliot.49 In short, naturalistic theism needs to be clear about the reality of God, of the type of piety it is intended to express, and of the language used in speaking of God both in theoretical reflection and in devotion. I write this essay as a serious proposal, a contribution to liberal Christian- ity in the twenty-first century. Christian naturalism should be considered a significant theological option. It can enhance a robust piety of awe, gratitude, appreciation, connection, and aspiration by providing a language for the object of such piety without the patriarchal and colonial baggage of a supernatural deity. It also encourages participation in the ongoing ever- widening community of unconditional love by witnessing to the pattern and power of the Christ- event without claiming an exclusive route to salvation. I am myself reluctant to use the term "God," which is why I will never be considered a Christian naturalist. Like Tillich, I think we need a moratorium on the word "God." Yet, the issue is not whether we use the word but about 47.

The ques- tion as to whether to use religious terms, such as "God" or "sacred" or even "religious quality of experience," is important but secondary. Whether Christian naturalism of some sort will be acceptable as Christian remains to be seen. It depends on who decides and how. 50.
