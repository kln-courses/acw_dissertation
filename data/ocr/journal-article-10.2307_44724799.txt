Vermissen TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute Delft, The Netherlands ABSTRACT The biofidelity of the latest version of the Euro- pean Side Impact Dummy has been evaluated against the requirements of documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 to 9790-6. Impactor tests, drop tests and sled tests have been conducted to assess the biofidelity of the head, thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis of the produc- tion prototype EUROSID. The test set-ups used were identical to those prescribed in the ISO documents wherever feasible. The test data have been normalized where neces- sary and the results compared with the response re- quirements described in the ISO documents. It ap- pears that the response of EUROSID in padded impact tests is in good agreement with the cadaver responses, while EUROSID appears to be too stiff in rigid impact tests. The proposed ISO requirements should be improved with respect to the definition of the test set-up and with respect to the normalization procedures applied. THE EUROPEAN SIDE IMPACT DUMMY-EUROSID has been designed and constructed by a group of European research laboratories working together under the auspices of the European Experimental Vehicle Committee. The basis for the design of EUROSID was laid down by the three prototype side impact dummies, produced by APR, ONSER (INRETS) and MIRA, as a result of the EEC Biome- chanics Programme 1978-1982. At the end of the Biomechanics Programme these three dummies and the NHTSA/HSRI side impact dummy were evaluated and compared. None was found to be satisfactory in its current design form [1] . Subsequently, under the guidance of the EEVC, a single European dummy was produced during 1983- 1985 based on the best features of the three earlier dummies [2]. The design and performance of the 'new' body parts, i.e. the neck, the thorax, the abdomen and the pelvis, were based on cadaver data. Four prototypes of EUROSID were built and evaluated in 1986 within the framework of an EEC Evaluation Programme [3]. The repeatability, repro- ducibility, sensitivity and durability of the four dum- mies have been evaluated by impactor tests, sled tests and full-scale car crashes. The dummy design was improved following this exercise and production prototypes are now being evaluated in Europe, the United States of America, Canada and Japan. In addition to requirements like sensitivity, re- peatability and durability, a side impact dummy should also load the structural components of a car in a real- istic way. Furthermore it should show a human-like response to this loading. Working Group 5 of ISO/TC 22/SC12 has defined a series of impact tests to assess the performance of these dummies. The impact test set-up and proposed dummy responses are based on cadaver impact tests and are described in documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 to 9790-6. The TNO Road-Vehicles Research Institute has conducted a large number of the proposed tests to study the biofi- delity of EUROSID. Table 1 shows the test matrix.

This production prototype dummy is described in an EEVC publica- tion [4], as well as in the EUROSID User's Manual [5]. A brief summary of the design is presented in this section (see also Figure 1). DESIGN - The EUROSID components are: • HEAD - A standard Hybrid III head compris- ing an aluminium shell covered by a pliable vinyl skin. • NECK - A central section made of rubber that links two interfaces, each con- sisting of two metal disks with rub- ber elements and a special joint inside. The neck-bracket is attached to the shoulder cam block. ♦ CHEST - A rigid thoracic spine box and three identical rib modules, each consist- ing of a hoop of spring steel covered with flesh-simulating plastic (sor- bothane) and attached to a system of piston/cylinder, springs and damper. • SHOULDER - A cam block attached to the top of the spine box and two polypropylene clavicles, rotating forward around the cam block. A shoulder cap made of foam is attached to the top of the cam block. •ARMS - A plastic skeleton covered with flesh-simulating plastic (sorbothane and polyurethane), while the hands are solid PVC. • LUMBAR - A standard FMVSS 208 Part 572 SPINE unit, consisting of a solid rubber cylinder with metal interface plates at each end and a steel cable inside. • ABDOMEN - A metal drum, positioned around the lumbar spine and attached to the spine-thorax interface, a weighted flesh-simulating plastic around the drum and a set of three identical switch units between drum and cov- ering. • PELVIS - Two aluminium iliac wings linked together by a sacrum block and cov- ered by a flesh simulating material (sorbothane and polyurethane). The hip joints are bail joints attached to the iliac wings. • LEGS - The standard FMVSS 208 Part 572 design, consisting of a metal skele- ton covered by a flesh-simulating plastic. INSTRUMENTATION - The EUROSID is designed to accept accelerometers, displacement and force transducers, as well as level detecting switches (see Figure 2).

Design and instrumentation are convertible from left-hand impacts to right-hand impacts. The dummy wears a rubber suit which covers the shoulders, chest, abdomen and pelvis (without thighs). TEST SET-UP INTRODUCTION - A series of impact tests on all relevant body parts of EUROSID has been per- formed. The tests were based on the requirements described in documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 to 9790-6. These documents propose a series of impact tests to assess the biofidelity of a side impact dummy, includ- ing impactor tests, drop tests and sled tests using the head, neck, shoulder, thorax, abdomen and/or pelvis of the dummy. The response of the dummy in these tests should be comprred with cadaver responses in identical tests. The complete range of tests proposed in the ISO documents was performed with the excep- tion of the lateral neck bending tests, which will be carried out at a later date. A brief summary of the test set-ups is presented in this section. GENERAL - The test set-ups described in the ISO documents have been used wherever feasible. The specific part of the body to be tested was instrument- ed according to the requirements laid down in the ISO documents. Additional transducers were used to 'complete' the instrumentation as described in the previous section. The channel filter classes pre- scribed in the ISO documents have been applied as well as the 'standard' filter classes presented in Table 2. High speed films have been made of all the impact tests, except for the head drop tests. HEAD IMPACT TEST NO. 1 - A series of free head drop tests has been performed based on the test set-up described in requirement no. 1 of docu- ment ISO/DTR 9790-1 [6]. The midsagittal plane of the head made an angle of 35 degrees with the flat, rigid impact surface (see Figure 3). The drop height was 200 mm. In addition to the triaxial accelerometer 200 mm ///////A/;/;;;/;/ ~ Fig. 3. Test set-up for head impact test no. 1 (rigid drop test). at the centre of gravity of the head, a second triaxial accelerometer is prescribed for this test [6]. This transducer was glued to the non-impacted, inner side of the head. HEAD IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - A series of head drop tests has been conducted according to re- quirement no. 2 of document ISO/DTR 9790-1 [6]. The midsagittal plane of the head made an angle of 1 0 degrees with the flat, padded impact surface. The impact surface was covered with a 5 mm thick padding of natural rubber (hardness 50 Shore A). The drop height was 1200 mm. To improve the repeatabili- ty of the test set-up the head was supported and guid- ed before the impact by using the test equipment described in ECE Regulation 22 - Protective Helmets -m- THORACIC IMPACT TEST NO. 1 - A series of free dummy drop tests has been performed based on requirement no. 1 of document ISO/DTR 9790-3 [8]. The EUROSID dummy was suspended horizontally at a distance of 1 m above a flat, rigid impact surface or at a distance of 2 m above a padded impact surface. The shoulder of the dummy was rotated forward on the side that was impacted in order to avoid contact of the arm with the thoracic impact surface. The impact surface consisted of two separated, horizontal load surfaces, one for measuring the thoracic contact force and the other for measuring the pelvic contact force. Each impact surface was instrumented with a load cell. The impact force was filtered using SAE Channel Filter Class 1000 (required in ISO-reference [8]), as well as using CFC 1 80 (used in original cadaver tests [9]). In the 2 m padded impacts the load platform was covered by 140 x 140 x 420 mm blocks of open cell urethane foam (APR padding). The rubber suit was omitted from the dummy in order to see the rib responses in the high speed film. Figure 4 shows the test set-up. THORACIC IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - A series of sled tests has been performed based on requirement no. 2 of document ISO/DTR 9790-3 [8]. A seat with an instrumented side panel was mounted onto an impact sled, transverse to the direction of travel. The side panel had two instrumented impact surfaces, one for the thorax and the other for the pelvis (see Figure 5). Each impact surface was attached to two load cells. The response was filtered using SAE CFC 1 000 and a 100Hz FIR filter. The dummy was retained at the end of the seat opposite the side panel while the sled was accelerated until it reached the prescribed impact velocity. The sled was then brought rapidly to a halt and the dummy was allowed to slide towards the side panel, impacting it at almost the same speed as the sled had been travelling at. A low friction coeffi- cient between the seat and the dummy ensured that 4.1161</page><page sequence="5">□ quick release mechanism d£ B HaaJ 1- - _ J f t 2m 1 m I 1 i 1 - i i i H ARR padding 140x140x420 mm 1 1 1 i 1 i 1 I I I pelvic force plate 250x350mm load-cell (2x) : ^thoracic force plate --315 mm- | 200 x350 mm Fig. 4. Test set-up for thoracic impact test no. 1 and pelvic impact test no. 2 (rigid and padded drop test). the dummy was released without rotating. The initial gap between the dummy and the side panel was set such that the sled was stationary and the inertial forces from the force plates had died down before the dummy contacted the plates. Both upper arms of the dummy were positioned along the thorax, rotated approximately 5 degrees forward. The right hand was placed on the lap, while the left hand (impact side) was taped onto the right lower arm. In this position the left lower arm was horizontal and did not contact the pelvic load surface. The position of the arms is not prescribed in ISO-ref. [8] and was therefore based on the original cadaver tests [10]. Rigid surface impact tests were conducted with impact velocities of 24 km/h and 32 km/h. In the 32 km/h padded impacts, the thoracic and pelvic impact surfaces were covered by 140 X 140 X 420 mm blocks of open cell urethane foam (APR padding). APR padding was also used to cover the panel opposite the lower leg in order to cre- ate a flat impact surface for the lower body. A protrud- ing pelvic impact surface would induce rotation of the pelvis around a vertical axis. Fig. 5.

The EUROSID dummy was seated in an upright posi- tion on a flat, rigid horizontal surface with no back support. The seating surface was covered by a sheet of Teflon. The dummy's legs and arms were posi- tioned horizontally in a forward facing direction and the thorax was positioned vertically. A 23.3 kg linearly guided impactor with a 150 mm, flat rigid impact sur- face was used to strike the ribs (left side) of the dummy. The centre line of the impactor was centred on the middle rib, perpendicular to the dummy's mid- sagittal plane. The impact velocity was 4.3 ± 0.1 m/s. SHOULDER IMPACT TEST - A series of lateral shoulder impactor tests has been performed based on document ISO/DTR 9790-4 [11]. Except for the arms, the seating position of the dummy was identical to that used in thoracic impact test no. 3. The upper arms were placed along the thorax and the hands were positioned on the lap. The impactor was identi- cal to that used in thoracic impact test no. 3. The cen- tre line of the impactor was aligned with the axis of the (left) upper arm joint, perpendicular to the dum- my's midsagittal plane. The impactor deceleration measurements were used to calculate the impact force. The impact force responses have been filtered using the required SAE CFC 1000 as well as the (standard EUROSID) SAE CFC 180 (see also [5]). The shoulder deflection was calculated from the high speed films that were recorded during the tests. ABDOMEN IMPACT TEST - A series of free dummy drop tests has been performed based on doc- ument ISO/DTR 9790-5 [12]. The EUROSID dummy was suspended horizontally at a distance of 1 or 2 m above the flat, rigid impact surface (see Figure 6). The dummy was dropped freely from the prescribed distance and impacted the surface below with its abdomen (left side). ISO-ref. [12] specifies that the impact should take place at the 9th rib. However the EUROSID's abdominal section is wider than with cadavers, which prevented the dummy's lower rib from contacting the impact surface. The impact sur- face consisted of a hard wood simulated arm rest, 7 cm in width and 50 cm in length. It protruded 4.1 cm above the surrounding surface, which consisted of two wooden blocks to stop the pelvis and thorax, impact surface was attached to two load cells to monitor the impact force (filtered using CFC 600). The dummy's rubber suit was omitted in order to evaluate the impact location and to calculate the abdominal penetration from the high speed films that were taken.

A 17.3 kg linearly guided rigid impactor was used to strike the (right) greater trochantor region of the dummy. The centre line of the impactor was aligned with the dum- my's H-point, perpendicular to the dummy's midsagit- tal plane. The impactor face consisted of a rigid spherical segment (see Figure 7). A smaller diameter was chosen for the impactor face than that prescribed in ISO-ref. [13], in order to avoid impacting against the pelvic support surface. The impact velocity was between 4 m/s and 6 m/s, which is lower than that specified in the ISO-requirements in ref. [13]. Howev- er, impact velocities between 6 m/s and 10 m/s were not feasible with the impactor propulsion system used. The impactor decelerations were used to calcu- late the impact force (filtered through SAE CFC 1000 as well as through SAE CFC 180). PELVIC IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - A series of dummy drop tests has been conducted according to require- ment no. 2 of document ISO/DTR 9790-6 [13]. The test set-up was identical to that used in thoracic impact test no. 1 . Only the 1 m rigid and 2 m padded drop tests have been performed and not the 0.5 m rigid and 3 m padded drop tests as required in ref .[13]. PELVIC IMPACT TEST NO. 3 - A series of sled tests has been performed based on requirement no. 3 of document ISO/DTR 9790-6 [13]. The test set-up was identical to that used in thoracic impact test no. 2. 4.1163</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 7. Impactor face in pelvic impactor test no. 1 - prescribed (--) and used ( - ). TEST RESULTS INTRODUCTION - To limit the amount of data to be discussed, only the peak values and 3 ms maxi- mum values of all dummy responses are presented. Where the response was filtered through an ISO- required filter as well as through a standard (EUROSID) filter both results are given. Only those responses which have to be compared with ISO-re- quirements have been normalized. The normalized peak values and normalized time responses are also presented in this section. NORMALIZED DATA - The dummy response requirements described in documents ISO/DTR 9790-3 to 9790-6 (thorax, shoulder, abdomen and pelvis) are based on normalized cadaver responses. These cadaver data were normalized to represent the response characteristics of a 50th percentile adult male using the technique described by Mertz [14]. From this procedure a so-called 'effective mass' for the standard subject is selected for each type of impact test (see Appendix 1). ISO references [8, 11, 12, 13] require that the dummy data are also normal- ized in order to adjust for changes in effective mass due to slight differences in the position of the dummy on impact. However some uncertainties arise from the procedures described in the ISO documents: • For normalizing the thoracic response in the drop test the impact velocity (V0) should be used (see also [14]). For the pelvic response in the same drop test the velocity change (AV) of the pelvis should be used. This velocity change was, howev- er, not available for the cadaver data, so another method (using the ratio between a standard body mass of 76 kg and the cadaver body mass) was used by ISO. The same method was used for nor- malizing the pelvic response in the sled tests. It is not clear if V0 or AV was used to normalize the tho- racic response in the sled tests. To normalize the pelvic response in the impactor test AV is required by ISO, however, V0 is used for the cadaver data. It is obvious that V0 is only an estimate of the required AV. Large differences were found in the present study when effective masses based on V0 were compared with effective masses based on AV. This was due to the high rebound velocities in some tests. To fulfil the requirements of the ISO normalization procedure as well to perform the same procedure applied to some cadaver data, most dummy responses have been normalized using V0 as well as AV. • The standard effective mass for normalizing the pelvic response in the drop tests and sled tests prescribed in ISO/DTR 9790-6 is 14.5 kg. This value is based on other tests (impactor tests) using cadavers with other anthropomorphic characteris- tics, since the required data were not available from the cadavers used in the drop and sled tests. This standard effective mass should represent the effective mass of a 76 kg subject in a similar impact test. However, the calculations from the responses in the current dummy tests show that this effective mass is 2 to 3 times higher. This leads to either very large or very small normalizing factors, which are not only based on 'slight differ- ences in impact position'. For the thoracic drop (and sled) tests a standard effective mass of 50% of the body mass (76 kg) has been selected by Mertz [14]. Therefore a standard effective mass of 38 kg was also selected for normalizing the pelvic response in thè current drop and sled tests. HEAD IMPACT TEST NO. 1 - Table 3 summarizes the results of the 200 mm rigid head drop test. The repeatability of the responses is excellent. The response requirement described in ISO-ref. [6] is that the peak resultant head acceleration on the non- impacted side of the head should be between 1 00 G to 150 G. Table 3 and Figure 8 show that the actual response is approximately 18% above the upper response boundary. 4.1164</page><page sequence="8">881716 Table 3.

HEAD IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - Table 4 summarizes the results of the 1200 mm padded head drop test. The repeatability of the responses is good. The response requirement described in ISO-ref. [6] is that the peak resultant head e.g. acceleration should be between 217 G to 265 G. Table 4 and Figure 8 show that the actual response is approximately 56% above the upper response boundary. THORACIC IMPACT TEST NO. 1 - Table 5 sum- marizes the results of the thoracic drop test. In test no. 1413 the dummy did not fall truly horizontally, as, its pelvis was too low in relation to its thorax. Further- more the upper rib in this test did not fully impact the padding. In all other respects, the response repeata- bility can be considered as good. The upper rib de- flections are larger and exist for a longer time, due to tilting of the dummy caused by the high pelvic rebound velocity. The highest TTI values were always found on the lower rib, while the highest V.C value is sometimes found on the upper rib as well. The dummy responses have to be normalized in order to compare them with the requirements described in ISO-ref. [8]; an impact force vs. time cor- ridor for the 1 m rigid drop test (see Figure 9) and a corridor for the 2 m padded drop test (see Figure 10). Fig. 9.

It can be concluded from the deflection responses which did not bottom out during the test, that the performance in the 2 m padded drop test is very close to the required upper boundary. Figure 9 shows the impact force vs. time response of EUROSID in the 1 m rigid drop test. The first peak is caused by the natural frequency of the rib/load plat- form system. The dummy response exceeds the cadaver corridor considerably (see also 'Discussion'). Figure 10 shows the impact force vs. time response of EUROSID in the 2 m padded drop test. The ampli- tude of the response appears to be satisfactory, where the pulse duration is slightly longer than the cadaver response. Fig. 10. Normalized thoracic impact force vs. time obtained from thoracic impact test no. 1 (2 m padded drop test); EUROSID responses compared with ISO requirement corridor. THORACIC IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - Table 7 sum- marizes the results of the thoracic sled tests. The repeatability of the responses appears to be good. No data are available for the lower rib deflection in test no. 1104 due to a broken electrical wire. The peak rib acceleration of the upper and middle rib caused by the bump stop at 50 mm deflection exceeds that caused by the initial impact in the 32 km/h padded tests. This is considered not to be realistic and there- fore the initial impact peak is presented. The differ- ence between a padded and rigid impact at 32 km/h is not clearly seen from the maximum upper spine accelerations or the maximum rib deflections. The maximum V.C and the maximum TTI appear to be lower in the padded tests. On the basis of the TTI val- ues, the severity of the 32 km/h padded test is assessed to be lower than the 24 km/h rigid test. The dummy responses were normalized in order to compare them with the requirements described in ISO-ref. [8]; an impact force vs. time corridor for each test condition (see Figure 11, 12 and 13). Table 8 shows the normalized results of the thoracic sled tests. It appears that the effective mass calculated from A V is virtually constant in all tests and further- more it is much lower than the effective mass calcu- lated from V0. Figures 11, 12 and 13 show the nor- malized impact force vs. time responses of EUROSID in the three different test conditions. It appears that the dummy responses are in good agreement with the cadaver corridors. THORACIC IMPACT TEST NO. 3 - Table 9 sum- marizes the results of the thoracic impactor tests. It appears that in test no. 314 the impactor contacted the lower rib first, probably due to the position of the thorax not being exactly vertical. This resulted in somewhat higher lower rib and J-'2 responses. The maximum V.C and TTI values of the lower rib are also somewhat higher in this test. The dummy responses were normalized using a standard effective mass of 32.7 kg rather than the 32.2 kg prescribed in ISO-ref. [8] (probably a typing error). Table 10 shows the normalized responses of EUROSID. The normalized acceleration vs. time responses of the top spine (lateral T-j) and the impactor should lie within the corridors given in Fig- ures 14 and 15 respectively. It appears that both responses exceed the corridor, especially in the rising part of the curves. 4.1167</page><page sequence="11">Table 7.

ABDOMEN IMPACT TEST - Table 13 shows the results of the abdomen drop tests. The test set-up for these tests appeared to be very difficult to repeat. This is especially true of the 2 m drop height, because the impact area is relatively small. In this respect the repeatability of the results can be considered as acceptable. No abdominal switch contact occurred in the 1 m drop test while switch contact did occur in the 2 m drop test. The corresponding maximum TTI val- ues were 90 to 119 G and 160 to 178 G respectively. The dummy responses have to be normalized in order to compare them with the requirements described in ISO-ref. [12]; an impact force vs. time corridor for each drop height (see Figures 17 and 18), as well as the required maximum lower spine and lower rib accelerations. Furthermore it is required that the abdominal penetration is at least 4.1 cm. The EUROSID abdomen has been designed to bottom out if a deflection of approximately 40 mm has been reached. Analysis of the high speed films showed that this value was exceeded in all tests and bottoming- out of the abdominal foam covering occurred. Table 14 shows the normalized results of the abdomen drop tests. The effective mass in the 2 m tests is lower than that of the 1 m tests, because the impulse of the abdominal force does not change while the velocity change of Tļ2 increases. Figures 17 and 18 show the impact force vs. time responses of the dummy togeth- er with the cadaver corridors. It appears that the dummy response was excessively high. The acceler- ation requirements were also exceeded; 62 to 73 G for the maximum lateral T12 acceleration instead of 29 to 35 G in the 1 m tests, and 128 to 149 G instead of 75 to 92 G in the 2 m tests. The maximum lower rib accelerations appear to be also a factor 2 to 3 higher than the required 100 to 125 G for the 1 m tests and the 160 to 200 G for the 2 m tests (see also Table 14). 4.1171</page><page sequence="15">Table 1 3.

Normalized impact force vs. time obtained from abdomen impact test (1m rigid drop test); EUROSID responses compared with ISO requirement corridor. PELVIC IMPACT TEST NO. 1 - Table 15 summa- rizes the results of the pelvic impactor tests. The CFC 1 80 filtered impact force vs. time response is identical to the CFC 1000 filtered response and therefore only the latter is presented (as required by ISO-ref. [13]). The CFC 1000 filtered pelvic acceleration vs. time response showed high-frequency vibrations, the re- peatability of the peak values of the CFC 180 filtered responses appeared to be much better (compare tests with almost identical impact velocities). The EUROSID responses have been normalized using the impact velocity as well as the pelvic velocity change (see Table 16). As already mentioned in the section headed 'Normalized data', the velocity change is required to be used by ISO-ref. [13], while the impact velocity was used to develop the cadaver cor- ridor shown in Figure 19. The normalized peak impact force vs. impact velocity response of the EUROSID pelvis shows a linear relationship, although it does have a considerable steeper slope than the cadaver corridor (see Figure 19). This results in too high a dummy stiffness at high impact velocities. PELVIC IMPACT TEST NO. 2 - Table 17 summa- rizes the results of the pelvic drop tests. In test no. 1413 the dummy did not fall horizontally, as its pelvis was too low in relation to its thorax. The impact area on the pelvis is located at the H-point, where the pubic symphysis force transducer is installed. The iliac wing was only slightly impacted in the padded tests, so that a slight change in dummy orientation Fig. 18. Normalized impact force vs. time obtained from abdomen impact test (2 m rigid drop test); EUROSID responses compared with ISO requirement corridor. appeared to have a relatively large influence on the ilium force response. In all other respects, the repeatability of the test results appears to have been sufficient. The EUROSID responses have been normalized using the impact velocity as well as the velocity change of the pelvis (see Table 18). For both methods the maximum normalized pelvic acceleration seems to be in good agreement with the requirements described in ISO-ref. [13]; 63 to 77 G for the 1 m rigid drop test and 39 to 47 G for the 2 m padded drop test (see also Figure 20). PELVIC IMPACT TEST NO. 3 - Table 19 summa- rizes the results of the pelvic sled tests. The repeata- bility of the dummy responses appears to be good. The influence of the impact speed and impact surface is clearly seen with all parameters. The severity of the rigid impact tests at 24 km/h is assessed to be higher than that of the padded impact test at 32 km/h. 4.1173</page><page sequence="17">Table 1 5.

The difference in effective mass calculated with these two methods is quite large. ISOref. [13] requires maximum normalized impact forces which appear to be considerably lower than the values obtained from the current rigid impact tests; 6.4 to 7.8 kN for the 24 km/h rigid tests, and 22.4 to 26.4 kN for the 32 km/h rigid tests. Comparison with Table 20 shows that the results obtained from the current tests are 3 to 5 times higher. The results obtained from the 32 km/h padded tests appear to be 1 .5 to 2 times higher than the required 11.6 to 13.6 kN (see also Figure 21). The required maximum normalized pelvic accelerations are 63 to 77 G for the 24 km/h rigid tests, 96 to 116 G for the 32 km/h rigid tests and 61 to 75 G for the 32 km/h padded tests. Comparison with Table 20 shows that the dummy responses in the rigid tests are twice as high as required, while the response in the padded test is just above (V0 method) or within the requirements (AV method). Figure 21 summarizes the requirements and dummy responses; it appears that the EUROSID performance in the padded tests is quite satisfactory. Table 20.

Normalized peak pelvic acceleration and normalized peak impact force obtained from pelvic impact test no. 3 (rigid and padded sled tests); EUROSID responses (based on V0 and AV normalization proce- dure) compared with ISO requirements. DISCUSSION A series of Impact tests has been performed to assess the blofldellty of the European Side Impact Dummy. The test set-up was based on ISO propos- als. The dummy responses have been normalized as required by documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 to 9790-6, but certain modifications were introduced. A standard effective mass of 38 kg rather than 14.5 kg has been used to normalize the pelvic responses in the drop tests and sled tests. This was done to obtain more re- alistic normalization factors. Furthermore most dummy responses have been normalized using the impact velocity as well as the velocity change, since ISO sometimes prescribes one parameter but uses the other one. The peak acceleration response of the EUROSID head in both drop tests appears to be too high com- pared with the cadaver responses. Hodgson and Thomas [15] mentioned the influence of skin thick- ness and hair on the results of rigid surface tests using embalmed cadavers. The specification of the skin on the sides of the EUROSID head appears to be important. ISO-ref. [6] prescribes an impact angle of 10 degrees, while the two cadavers in the tests performed by APR impacted the padded surface at angles of 5 degrees and 1 degree respectively [16]. The response of the EUROSID head appears to be closer to that of APR cadaver test no. 5, impacted at 10 degrees, which resulted in a peak acceleration of 326 G (see also Figure 8). This cadaver obtained a skull fracture and the test was therefore omitted from the ISO response requirements. In both cadaver test series (Hodgson and Thomas; APR) cadavers were dropped, while the ISO test set-up requires that only the dummy's head be used. Since the responses were not normalized this could have influenced the results. The thorax of EUROSID appears to be too stiff in rigid impactor tests and in rigid drop tests, while the impact force vs. time responses in padded drop tests appear to be good. However the ISO response re- quirements are based on 9 cadaver tests with arm involvement and only 2 cadaver tests without arm involvement [17], while the test set-up prescribes a direct impact on the thorax. It is expected that the response of EUROSID in the rigid drop test will improve compared to the cadaver responses, if the arm is positioned between the thorax and impact sur- face. This is also shown in the sled tests; the impact force vs. time responses in the rigid as well as padded impacts appear to be in good agreement with the cadaver responses. The impact force vs. time response of EUROSID in the shoulder impact tests appears to be in good agreement with the cadaver response corridor, while the shoulder deflection is twice as high as the required value. It is thought that the deflection in the cadaver tests was limited due to interference of the impactor face with the scapula (see e.g. test MS 201 in ISO-ref. [11], which was omitted from the force-time response requirement due to the 'sudden' increase of force after 20 ms). In the dummy impacts only the clavicle was impacted. The deflection response of EUROSID appeared to be close to that of cadaver test no. 204, which was omitted from the ISO deflec- tion response requirements because the impact angle was 15 degrees forward of the lateral position. The cadaver shoulder deflection in this test was approxi- mately 100 mm [18]. The responses of EUROSID in the abdomen drop tests exceed the ISO requirements by a considerable margin. The abdomen has been designed to show a dynamic response within an impact force vs. deflec- tion corridor based on cadaver drop tests. However if the proposed tolerance limits of 39 mm deflection and 4500 N force are exceeded, the flexible flesh-simulat- ing material bottoms out and the impact force increas- es rapidly [19]. In fact the abdomen was designed to show a human-like response up to the injury toler- ance limits. Since the ISO response corridors are based on the same cadaver tests, this means a human-like response up to approximately 10 ms in Figure 17 and up to approximately 7 ms in Figure 18. 4.1178</page><page sequence="22">881716 It appears that the abdomen is stiffer than necessary in the initial phase of the responses. The peak lower spine accelerations also occurred after these time 'limits', the rigid abdominal penetration stop being attached to the (lower) thoracic spine. The lower rib of EUROSID did not impact the arm rest, because the body-part segmentation of dummies differs from that of cadavers. The peak impact force vs. impact velocity response of EUROSID in the pelvic (rigid) impactor tests appears to be quite reasonable in low velocity (4 m/s) impacts. However in high velocity impacts the pelvis appears to be too stiff. This can be also con- cluded from the results of the 1 m rigid drop test (4.4 m/s) which had a satisfactory response and the rigid sled tests (6.7 to 8.9 m/s) in which the impact force and pelvic acceleration were much too high. However, in the high velocity padded tests (6.3 m/s drop test and 8.9 m/s sled test) the dummy responses appear to be in good agreement with the cadaver responses. It should be noted that a padded impact will be more typical of the occupant-to-door impacts experienced in side crashes than rigid impacts. More results have been presented than required by ISO in order to compare different proposed injury performance criteria. The maximum rib deflections obtained from the 2 m padded drop tests appear to be 25% higher than those obtained from the 1 m rigid drop tests. While the maximum V.C in these tests is identical, the maximum TTI is much lower in the 2 m padded drop tests. The influence of impact speed and surface conditions in the sled tests are not clearly dis- cernible from the maximum rib deflections. Assess- ments made on the basis of V.C max. values suggest the following order of increasing impact severity: 24 km/h rigid: 32 km/h padded and finally 32 km/h rigid. In contrast, examination of the TTI max. values accords padded impacts at 32 km/h the lowest severi- ty. The proposed injury performance criteria could be compared with cadaver injuries obtained from identi- cal impacts to define suitable limits (see also ref. [20]). The proposed ISO requirements should be improved by a better definition of the test set-up, including: • the dimensions of the impact surfaces (drop and sled tests); • the position of padding on these surfaces; • the position of the dummy's arms (sled tests); • the impact position (abdomen drop test); • the stiffness of the surrounding surface (abdomen drop test). Furthermore it is recommended that the test set-up should be based on the original cadaver test set-up, because differences could have a considerable influ- ence on the results obtained i.e.: • impact angle (head drop test); • body part vs. complete body (head drop tests); • arm involvement (thoracic drop test); • characteristics of the seating surface (pelvic impactor test). Since the body mass of a 50th percentile dummy is equal to 76 kg, the normalization procedure only appears to be necessary to compensate for slight dif- ferences in impact location. This complex procedure could be omitted by prescribing a minimum number of tests to be conducted. The mean dummy response could be compared with the response requirement. It is planned that the Naval Biodynamics Laborato- ry in New Orleans will perform the lateral neck bend- ing tests proposed in ISO/DTR 9790-2 [21]. The results of these tests will be incorporated in a future paper. CONCLUSIONS 1. A series of impactor tests, drop tests and sled tests have been conducted to assess the biofideli- ty of the European Side Impact Dummy (version 1987; production prototype). 2. The test set-up and dummy response require- ments are based on documents ISO/DTR 9790-1 to 9790-6. 3. The response of EUROSID in padded impact tests appears to be in good agreement with the cadaver responses, while EUROSID appears to be too stiff in rigid impact tests. 4. Alternative injury performance criteria appear to give a different assessment of the severity of a specific range of tests. More detailed analysis of this point is needed in future. 5. The proposed ISO requirements to assess the biofidelity of side impact dummies should be improved by a better definition of the test set-up and by a review of the normalization procedures*.

A mass, known as the "effec- tive mass" Me, can be determined that produces the same interaction impulse and velocity change as that experienced by the cadaver. Reference to impulse- momentum consideration gives, We K^&gt; t F T J Fdt = WeV0/g + WeT T -» We/g = [ / Fdt ] / (V0 + Tg) = Me o where F - load on subject due to interaction with impact surface T - impact duration g - acceleration of gravity V0 - initial velocity K - stiffness of subject We - effective weight of subject Me - effective mass Mertz selected an effective mass for a stan- dard subject Ms. The average percentage body weight involved in the cadaver tests has been calcu- lated and this percentage applied to the 50th per- centile adult male's body mass (76 kg). The result is known as the standard effective mass Ms. The mass ratio used to normalize the cadaver data is, Rm = ^s / The stiffness ratio is defined as: Rk = Ks/K¡ where Ks is the stiffness of a standard subject and K¡ of the i-th cadaver. Mertz [14] calculated normalizing factors based on this procedure for force, acceleration, displace- ment and time: Rf - (Rm)1'2 &lt;Rk)1/2 Ra - (Rk)1'2 (Rm)"1'2 Rx = (Rm)1/2(Rk)"1'2 Rt=(Rm)1'2(Rk)"1'2 Documents ISO/DTR 9790-3 to 9790-6 require that the dummy data be normalized in order to adjust for changes in effective mass due to slight differences in dummy position at impact. The velocity change AV for the calculation of Me should be obtained from inte- gration of the dummy acceleration-time curve: T Me = [J Fdt ] / (Tg + AV) o T where AV = J a dt (if the acceleration time res- 0 ponse is not available, ISO uses V0 as an estimate of AV). For non-drop tests, e.g. impactor and sled tests, the equation reduces to: T Me - [ J Fdt ] / (AV) o It is assumed that the stiffness ratio Rk for dummies is equal to 1 , so the normalizing factors are based on Rm only. 4.1181</page></plain_text>
