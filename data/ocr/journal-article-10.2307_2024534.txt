<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY VOLUME LXIV, NO. I9, OCTOBER 5, I967 THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES * T HE present paper continues and develops a symposium con- tribution on "Alternative Absolutes" given at the Chicago meeting of the Western Division of the A"A last May: it was ably if somewhat destructively criticized by Professors William Alston and David Rynin. Neither of these commentators had much taste for my enterprise of "Absolute-hunting," though they went some distance in trying to make sense of it: they admitted that much of the past his- tory of philosophy could fitly be described as the setting up and knocking down of one Absolute after another, but this did not make them think more kindly of the enterprise nor wish to recommend its continuance. And my attempts to hunt down Absolutes in a logical rather than a metaphysical or inspirational manner, were taken by them to be attempts to argue rigorously and cogently according to the rules of some pre-existent logic. Whereas what I was doing was pre- cisely not to operate on some pre-existent logical system, but to con- sider with great tentativeness what sort of logical system we should adopt if we were to find lodgment in it for that ancient, odd, nebulous, unfashionable, but not genuinely discredited, and highly interesting logical object called an "Absolute," how we were to fix and fill in its logical shape more precisely, and to put it to work in various contexts of our discourse. And although a few of my arguments intended rigor, most of them were meant only to be highly persuasive, like the argu- ments written in English in the interstices of Principia Mathematica. I of course rejected in my paper all notion of a presuppositionless, uncommitted, unmodifiable, topic-neutral set of forms and principles which is the logical mold of discourse on all matters whatsoever: I took it that we should require all our insight and all our reflection, constantly revising and deepening previous stances and positions, and constantly immersing ourselves in the particular matters on hand, to * To be presented in an APA Symposium on the Logic of Finalities, December 28, 1967. 571</page><page sequence="2">572 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY decide how we might legitimately and intelligibly talk about the world. The assumption, e.g., of a boundless logical independence of elementary facts and existences, such as is made, rather than asserted, in many logical systems, and which Wittgenstein's Tractatus tried to state clearly, might yield an acceptable background for descriptive discourse about the objects lying at random on a table or the images coursing confusedly through a mind, but from the standpoint of a more deep-cutting, explanation-seeking discourse, it may count as the very paradigm of the self-contradictory and absurd, bringing to- gether what has no conceivable business to be brought together and affirming a reality and a truth that has no meaning except in a more profoundly integrated system. Logic, on my view, required to be devel- oped in levels or stages, and at each level new types of logical object and connective might make their appearance; things previously un- sayable, but implicit, might become sayable; necessities might emerge where previously all had been matters of truth and falsehood; matters of fact might be transformed into necessities and even seeming impos- sibilities become necessities and so on. What is self-contradictory must indeed always be avoided, but our notion of what is self-contradictory may profoundly alter its face as we adventure further. In such deepen- ing of discourse there is never a line of ordinary proof leading from lower and poorer to higher and richer patterns of discourse. Only our deep sense that there is something we burningly want to say, which yet cannot be said in a certain mold of discourse, can force us on to adopt a new pattern. The notion of an Absolute or self-explanatory existent may be a notion unneeded and of doubtful construction at the descriptive, causal-generic, and intentional levels of discourse, but it may precisely be our deep feeling that we cannot say all we want to say at those levels that pushes us on to talk in terms of such an Absolute. That it is difficult to talk clearly and consistently at this level does not prove that it is impossible to do so, nor that we may not find, in the development of such talk, not the destruction, but the culmination of all logic. The justification of attempts to work out a logic of Absolutes lies further in the fact that there is such a logic in the thought of most persons and that this logic has been further refined and extended by many major philosophers. The ordinary notion of space, as I pointed out in my previous paper, affords us a good example of an Absolute, of something we feel could not be "imagined away" (whether or not we are right in this feeling) and which seems the irremovable, underly- ing basis of all bodies and all motions. And philosophers have had as their Absolutes Water, Fire, Air, Matter, the Conscious Mind, the</page><page sequence="3">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 573 Cosmos, God, the For-ms, Logical Space, Moral Standards, and so on, making these things unalterable and not dependent on the transient things of this world, which in their turn depend (at least in part) on them. The game of Absolutes is not merely played; it has been played by practically everyone except (in intention) by a very few philoso- phers, and even these have in fact sometimes played it sub rosa (e.g., Russell in PM 22.351). Logicians have introduced special branches of logic, e.g., the logics of tenses, of modality etc., to formalize well- established branches of discourse; the same justification would apply to a well worked-out logic of Absolutes, many of whose initial gambits are to be found in Spinoza, Aquinas, and others. It will, however, be best at this point not to talk generally but to resume some of the "theorems," or theoretical stances, arrived at in my former paper. Here the first was the extremely interesting theorem that Absolutes permit of a valid inference from mere conceivability- if we are sure of such conceivability-to certain reality, a property first discovered by Anselm which certainly gives Absolutes a unique place among logical notions. An Absolute being something that exists, if indeed it does exist, self-explanatorily or "of necessity," we cannot treat the question of its existence as an ordinary sort of open question, decided by "finding," in some ordinary or unusual sense of 'finding', that the thing in question is there or is not there. The sort of thing whose existence or nonexistence can be established by this sort of "finding" is certainly not an Absolute, and, if all things are of this sort, then there certainly are no Absolutes. If we can even conceive of an Absolute as absent, not of course in a superficial and abstract, but in some sufficiently deep sense of 'conceiving', then that Absolute cer- tainly fails of reality, must in fact fail of reality, since something that can, on the fullest consideration, be conceived absent is certainly not an Absolute. This is the basis of my disproof of the Divine Existence, which was put forward in 1948 and had much acclaim in certain quarters. What I did not, however, clearly see when I put forward that proof is that it can be made to work both ways and that if, in the case of an Absolute, a sufficiently deep doubtfulness or possible false- hood entails a falsehood that coincides with impossibility, then also, per contra, a sufficiently deep conceivability or possibility entails a certain truth which coincides with necessity. An Absolute plainly and obviously will not admit of the ambiguity of status characteristic of contingent things; it is nonsense to suppose that it may either be or not be: either there is no coherent conceivability of there being any such thing, or, if there is, it covers the whole range of conceivability and amounts, therefore, to certain and necessary truth. Research in</page><page sequence="4">574 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the region of Absolutes involves, therefore, only the initial charity of assuming that it is not absurd to suppose that there is some such thing, and then keeping on the watch for incoherences, logical flaws in the conceptions that we form. At no point would it be relevant to submit our assertions to an empirical or other external test. But we of course always face a possibility of falsification, since our insight into modality never can be guaranteed perfect: though what it is incoher- ent to conceive can certainly not coherently be conceived coherent, this may not be true epistemically or "for us," and we may genuinely be in doubt about, and in a sense able to conceive, both the logically flawed and the logically flawless character of some conception. The existence of an Absolute will, of course, be highly peculiar, since it involves no contrast with possible nonexistence, but contrasts rather with those things to which the latter contrast applies. But Absolutes, if there are any, are precisely those residual, fundamental, categorial elements which resist all our conceptual attempts to shift them from the scene, which resistance, combined with and correcting our defec- tive insight into modality, can at times give rise to the most poignant and most positive experience. The next important theorem in absolutist logic is that an Absolute can have no ultimately conceivable alternatives: if there were two ultimately conceivable Absolutes, there would, per impossibile, be none at all. For otherwise something would exist of necessity which also might not have existed and whose place might have been taken by something else. But of course this does not mean, as said before, that there may not be alternative Absolutes for us, and also the alternative of there being no Absolute at all. I then went on to assert, as a more or less obvious theorem, that being an Absolute must be consequent upon being something else as well: an Absolute could not be merely necessarily existent and no more, nor could one be necessarily existent if it were not so in virtue of some other feature or features; and the phrase 'in virtue of which' means that these other features must be such that showing them forth entails being a necessary existent and vice versa. So much may be saved out of the wreck of the Ontological Proof. Whatever is said to be must in each case exemplify, or perhaps in some cases simply be, a certain nature, in default of which its existence could not be meaning- fully propounded; and whatever necessarily exists must likewise have or be a specifiable nature, which its being, however, must entail and which must entail its being, and which must be such, moreover, as to differ in kind from the sort of variable thing one must be in order to exist nonnecessarily. One cannot in particular exist necessarily in</page><page sequence="5">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 575 virtue of exemplifying one side of an empirical opposition or contrast and not the other: one could not, e.g., be an Absolute in virtue of being red and here and a cushion but not in virtue of being blue and there and a tablecloth. And since the really specific content of our notions consists mainly of features belonging to one side of an empiri- cal contrast, it is plain that what makes an Absolute an Absolute can- not be any such specific content. Absolutes, we may say, cannot be Absolutes in virtue of being some highly special sort of thing (though they are, of course, in a higher sense, a very special sort of thing): there is something necessarily unspecific in their essential features; which explains why, when people have constructed them, they have done so in terms of quantifiers of unlimited generality, such as 'all' or 'none' or for some purposes 'some'. Thus Absolute Space is the sub- strate of all possible types of occupancy, or is what would remain if no bodies existed, or is what must have some scheme of occupancy but no definite one, etc. The puzzling character of Absolutes, for many persons, particularly in accounts of mystical experience, is precisely their lack, apart from metaphor, of all essential empirical content: they seem the merest constructs of pure logic. (The one without a second, the all-container, the unsurpassably real, etc., etc.) But though an Absolute cannot be an Absolute in virtue of some specific content, we must not infer from this that an Absolute can be without specific one-sided content. It must have contingent, non- essential as well as essential, Absolute-making features, though it could always have had other contingent features than those which it actually has. An Absolute of any category must be thought to be an accomplished, fully worked-out entity, and its characterization in terms of 'all' or 'none' or 'some' would be totally unmeaning were there no concrete, in some cases empirical values, over which its defining generalities could play. Thus Absolute Space, while involv- ing the possibility of all types of occupancy or nonoccupancy, is also contingently characterized by the pattern of occupancies that obtains; a Creator-God, though able to create or not create any possible state of things, is contingently characterized in terms of what he does create (the God of Israel, etc.); a Platonic Form, though timeless and irremovable, is contingently characterized by the things that partici- pate in it. Even empty Space or an uncreative God or a Form-world without instances would not evade contingency: its negations would be as contingent as the contrary affirmations. Contingency is in fact the necessary foil and the raw material for the necessary, and even an Absolute must involve contingencies, not merely extrinsically but in and for itself. Spinoza's attempt to remove contingency by pushing</page><page sequence="6">576 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY it back indefinitely niot only failed of its purpose; had it been a success, it would have robbed necessity of its meaning and of its place in discourse. Several important theorems remain over from my former treat- ment. The first is that an Absolute must be unitary at least to the extent that, if it involved a number of distinct elements, each of which existed necessarily, it would at least be necessary that they all should exist together and that no quasi-scientific technique should be able to pry any of them apart from the others. We should have in fact a corporate Absolute, of which the Trinity or the Communion of Saints or the spiritual society of McTaggart are perhaps plausible examples. But, once embarked on this line of thought, we seem to see that there could be differences of the close-knit and the loose-knit even among such Absolutes: in some the description of each member would entail, and in a manner include, the description of all the others, they would be essentially of one another; whereas in others they would be neces- sarily related only in so far as they were all necessarily existent. There would in fact be something like a higher-order accident in their all being "thrown together," like passengers on a voyage, in the same plight of necessary existence. A series of Absolutes, from the most close-knit to the most loosely knit, is, however, impossible, since there can be no alternative Absolutes. And we have the further absurdity that a close-knit Absolute would be more explanatory of its elements, and so more of an Absolute, than a loosely knit one. We can eliminate this competition among Absolutes only by ruling, and ruling with insight, that a conception that thus introduces accident into the very citadel of the self-explanatory, destroys itself rather than the latter notion. There can, on this insight, be only effort after explanation in anything short of total explanation, and this yields us an Absolute having something like the mutual interpenetration of elements, compatible with a deep simplicity, which is described in certain mysti- cal treatises and which is also expressed in Hegel's notion of "totality." It is indeed hard to say whether the mystics have here been inspired by logic or the logicians by mysticism. But we may re-emphasize that such a degree of close-knitness among the basic differentiations of an Absolute need not eliminate contingencies of existence on its fringes or in its interstices, nor yet contingencies and externalities in the mutual relations of such existences. We next held with some reason that an Absolute must be placed in the supreme category of an ontology and not in somne confessedly parasitic or subordinate position. Thus, in ontologies in which indi- viduals count as the supreme category, all else being merely qualifica-</page><page sequence="7">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 577 tions of,v or otherwise dependent upon, individuals, such dependencies could not be counted as true Absolutes, even if in some contexts they were rightly denominated as "absolute" e.g., absolute unselfishness, impartiality, etc. Only if Characters or Relations or Processes or Ends were promoted to our supreme category, and individuals and other entities correspondingly demoted, could we seek for our Absolute among the former. Entities placed in supreme categories are of course generally made to function as logical and linguistic subjects of assertions, and, although it would be possible, it would be unnatural not to put a confessed Absolute in this position. We then stated the important theorem, by no means straightfor- wardly justifiable, that an Absolute not only excludes the existence of other Absolutes external to itself, but also excludes the existence of contingencies external to itself. All contingencies must be its contin- gencies, ways in which our Absolute has manifested itself, not inde- pendent existences or circumstances clustering about it or peopling its interstices. We have held it necessary for an Absolute to have con- tingent specifications: what we now add its that it is necessary for all contingent circumstances and existences to be involved in some manner in these specifications, so that there is nothing in high heaven or the nether depths that does not depend for its existence and charac- ter on that of the Absolute. There are difficulties involved in this omniresponsibility of an Absolute, especially for those who take an unnecessarily simple and direct view of its relation to finite contin- gents, but plainly the difficulties involved in denying this could be much more ruinous. There is something absurd in having an Abso- lute and then placing certain contingencies quite outside of it, so that as far as it is concerned they might not have existed at all; and this absurdity has led to the supersession of some sorts of Absolute by others more adequate. Thus an Absolute Space that merely hap- pens to be occupied in certain ways, without in some sense determin- ing its occupation, gets transformed into a Space whose deformations simply are its occupants and which is credited, further, with a tendency to "generate" such deformations. The same holds of those Eastern Absolutes whose blank unity is surrounded by an unexplained cloud of delusion: they call for concepts, e.g., that of Shakti, which use and regularize such delusion. Obscurely we desire an Absolute to be an explanatory notion, one that reduces contingencies and internal loosenesses or at least gives them a rational place within it- self, and we do not feel that the notion is being properly used if it is not used maximally, so that no contingency, and no possible contin- gency, eludes its explaining grasp. Otherwise we feel, using an</page><page sequence="8">578 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Anselmian gambit, that it would then have fallen short in respect of Absoluteness and that another more embracing Absolute might have surpassed it. These comparative, alternative notions are, as we saw, in- admissible, and we must hold that partially explanatory notions (such as that of a natural law or persistent background of facts) do not even properly explain part of what requires to be explained, but only rep. resent an approach to explanation. Only a complete explanation, we must say, really explains anything. Not only is it useless to push an explanatory regress back indefinitely, but the slightest injection of the inexplicable into an explanatory fabric must be held absolutely to rend and destroy the whole. Great care and lucidity must, however, be taken here if we are not to confuse all-explanation with all-necessitation, the error character- istic of Spinozism. Some contingencies there are, and must be, which cannot be rendered noncontingent by any injection or addition. But these contingencies can still be explained by something rather like an Aristotelian faculty of opposites, something that can educe a cate- gorical outcome out of a radically disjunctive situation, without, be it noted, the addition of some further "deciding" factor. It is usual, and Aristotelian, to connect such a faculty with conscious, rational choice, but it is not necessary, for our present purposes, to limit it in this way; we need not even confine it to matters that have a begin- ning in time. What must be involved in the explanation of ultimate contingencies must be the use of notions and modes of inference that yield logical appeasement and raise no further questions, whichever of a set of alternatives comes to be realized. We must be able to say "Since we have an agent or situation of the sort X, we could have had an outcome either of the sort A or of the sort B or of the sort C, etc., and the fact that we have an outcome of the sort C is, therefore, com- pletely explained by the fact that we have an agent or situation of the sort X, and requires no further explanation." There is a temptation at this point to introduce the concept of chance and to say that, since there are no uniquely determining conditions, what is the case must be the outcome of chance. But chance is a case of an inexplicable con- junction of factors, not a case of a single factor logically capable of al- ternative, branching consequences. Logical systems of this branching sort have not been normally developed: premises are not generally thought of as issuing in alternative consequences, either but not both of which, could be the case. But there is no reason why such logical systems should not be developed, or why an issue of a certain branch- ing should not be further branchings etc., and in a logic of Absolutes such a branching system is not only admissible but necessary. An Abso-</page><page sequence="9">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 579 lute must, in some not necessarily anthropomorphic manner, be in a position to decide among alternative contingencies and to decide for there being further decisions or powers of decision, for no other reason than that it is an Absolute, capable of giving itself a contingent content. We must of course work toward notions that make such sys- tems more than mere marks on paper, and the notion of conscious arbitrariness, one that chooses among alternatives without needing, though it may of course have, further motivation, is here of use, whether or not it is ever empirically exemplified. But it may be only by analogy with such pure arbitrariness, if it exists, that the self-deter- mination of an Absolute will have to be considered. It is, of course, open to us to work out a scheme of necessary goals or values, intrinsic to our Absolute, within which such quasi-arbitrariness will be exer- cised. I shall now devote what little time remains to me to considering the claims of four candidates for absolute status, all of which seem to me to harbor deep logical defects. By criticizing them and making my own recommendations on their basis, I shall try to give flesh and blood to a discussion where one elaborates words without being sure what, if anything, one may be saying by them. I shall select for exami- nation: (a) a cosmic or naturalistic Absolute; (b) a theistic Absolute; (c) a subsistential or Platonic Absolute; (d) an Absolute that is mental- istic or geistig. In each case I shall try to put the best face on the Ab- solute in question in terms of the requirements already sketched. By a cosmic A bsolute I mean an Absolute that develops to the limit of absoluteness that extremely nebulous, yet universally present and certainly unlearned notion that we call that of "the world," a notion whose horizonlike, all-encompassing, a priori character has been well brought out both by Husserl and by Heidegger. Everything there is normally comes before us as being somewhere in the world, even though we may not know quite where it fits in, and our whole per- sonal being is also in the world, even if more by engagement and in- tention than by mere position. To exclude some entertained content from the world is, in ordinary parlance, to declare it nothing at all, and it is never a wholly serious gambit in ordinary speech to suppose that there ever was or ever will be or ever could have been no world. Even if we try to be very serious in the elimination of all piebald con- tents, we still seem left with the gaunt skeletons of empty space and time, the limiting case, if one likes, of a world. The world, in short, or its space-time specter has all the features of a full-fledged Absolute, going infinitely beyond what experience gives us or ever can give us;</page><page sequence="10">580 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY and one can only ponder in dumb amazement at all those naive natur- alists and materialists who quite fail to see the nonempirical im- mensity of what they so lightly assume, sometimes, like Russell, pretending to have a world which is the mere class of all there is, when the world plainly involves the immense, embracing continuity of space and time, which puts all things together and renders their inter- action possible and also makes it possible and meaningful for us to talk of their reality or unreality. The world is to all intents and purposes a continuous background which could not be eliminated, which can be held to include the possibility and the actuality of all contingencies, which has arguably the highest degree of continuity and connection consistent with the necessary separateness of the in- stances of empirical contraries, and which belongs, in virtue of this connectedness, to the supreme category, that of the exhaustively determined thing, that a respectable ontology permits. World-absolut- ism is, in fact, a very defensible type of absolutism, to which we all adhere in unthinking moments and which can be made even more defensible by a few added nuances of the "emergent" or the "dialecti- cal." Make the world creative in respect of some of its contents, make it capable of focusing itself in organisms and mirroring itself in that focus, make it capable of organizing itself into societies or feeling the stress of "values" or logical relations, and we are well on the way, as in Marxism, to making it do all an explanatory Absolute can do. The abiding defect of such a naturalistic Absolute lies, however, in the forced, empty, largely verbal glosses that must be put upon its immense disunities if it is to function as a satisfactory Absolute. For the world, considered by itself as an inclusive space-time system, and deeply pondered upon, shows itself, despite the shock of the revela- tion, as the most self-contradictory of beings. It has far too much unity, continuity, mutual accommodation, repetitive regularity, acces- sibility to knowledge and purpose and so forth, to achieve anything like the diremptive nullity of a Russellian class; yet it has also far too much looseness, uncoordinated collocation, undisciplined variety, and harsh unamenability to knowledge and purpose to constitute anything like a self-explanatory, all-explanatory Absolute. It may be a shocking thing to say in modern America, but the world points in- eluctably beyond itself: it not only is not, but also cannot be, all that there is. Turning from the world to a transcendent Creator-God, we have an Absolute linked by free creativity (or by the abstention from such creativity) with all possible contingencies of existence, including the contingency of there being no world at all. We need not saddle the</page><page sequence="11">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 58I Creator with the actual properties of his creations, with their neces- sary one-sidedness, incompatibility, and lack of an upper limit: he may include them all in some higher fashion, in being capable of creat- ing them all. The imperfect unity of the creation, evinced in the interconnections and cosmic continuities mentioned above, will re- flect, in a necessarily imperfect, externalized fashion, the profound simplicity of its source. This absolute unity must not be conceived on the lines of a divisible, changeable natural thing, nor yet on the lines of the changeable, developing, externally provoked intelligence that we share; it must surpass them all in some manner which itself sur- passes expression and which at certain points dictates excursions into a new, unique, and not wholly understandable grammar. On the more orthodox view, which has both Greek and Jewish originals, the Creator's creativity is conceived as in some manner gratuitous, as making no difference to him, a view intended to heighten the dignity of the Absolute but in effect lowering it, since it tends toward the dis- engagement, or half-disengagement, of the Absolute from such crea- turely characters as brokenness, one-sidedness, and mutability, with all their pathos and their unique contributions to being and value. The faults of this orthodoxy are remedied by a more essentially Christian unorthodoxy, which sees in world-creation an activity essen- tial to its Absolute, which can only be the surpassing, all-explanatory essence that it is, by continually putting itself forth in, alienating itself in, a world of imperfect creatures which it then leads back to and redeems in itself. These mystical Christian ideas, we may note, are the basis of Hegelianism. We may note further, however, as in the case of the cosmos, that when the Creator is thus forced into the role of an all-resuming Absolute, he loses his distinctive demiurgic, theistic features, and that he keeps these only by surrendering his claims to all-explanatory absoluteness. Christian experience always threatens to become nontheistic and mystical unless held in check by strong-minded, narrow-minded Popes, such as John xxii or Pius x. But these religious antinomies are much too fully documented to require further comment here. From theistic Absolutes we turn to subsistential Absolutes, like the Form of the Good or of Unity in certain phases of Platonism. A supreme Form or Nature cannot in an individualist ontology be a true Absolute, since it is only as predicated of individuals or as other- wise dependent on them, that entities of other categories can be said to be. But in a Platonic ontology this state of affairs is inverted: there are not so much instances as instantiations of Forms and their whole being is parasitic upon the Form or Nature of which they are the</page><page sequence="12">582 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY instantiations. Subordinate Forms or Natures are merely how the supreme Eidos is specified, rather than anything independently subsis- tent: only the supreme Form, we may say, holds in itself the whole range of what is and half-is. On a developed Platonic ontology, the language of generation and causation is not wanton; it expresses the parasitic dependence of subordinate species and individuals on the one supreme Pattern. They are its specifications and individualiza- tions and no more, much as, in an individualist ontology, qualities, relationships etc, are merely ways in which individuals are qualified, related etc. It is, however, easy to point to the great weakness of such Platonic absolutism: it fails completely to bring the realm of changing instantial shadows into the explanatory embrace of the Forms and of their supreme source. It is not stated as a necessity that the timeless, perfect Form-realm should multiply itself in such shadows, or it is a necessity only in relation to some external, perturbing factor. The absoluteness, and complete explanatoriness of the Form-realm is thereby done away with, for, as we have seen, an incompletely explana- tory Absolute is really no Absolute at all. Plato in later life seems to have given some attention to these difficulties, inasmuch as he gave Motion as well as Rest an indefeasible place in True Being and inasmuch as he admitted a restless, indefinite principle of quan- tity and multitude into the very citadel of the Forms and made it help in their generation. But if one thus embodies specification and in- stantiation in the very core of one's Absolute, as Hegel did in his doctrine of the self-specifying, self-individuating Notion, one's Ab- solute, though becoming more nearly adequate, certainly no longer wears a Platonic face. I turn lastly to a form of spiritual absolutism such as some have attributed to Hegel, though not rightly in my opinion. Husserl in his phenomenology exemplifies it much more closely. On this absolutism the Absolute is categorized as mental, all that is not mental having being only in the sense that there are intentions, referential acts, di- rected upon it, such "intentional inexistence" not involving that non- mental things are anything in their own right, or can walk out of their conscious frames and become independent subjects of true reference. They are "transcendent" only in the sense that they are made or thought to transcend the thoughts in which they are constituted. But this mentalistic Absolute is also such as to individuate itself in a plu- rality of Egos or centers of intentions, to each of which the same round of natural appearances is presented and to each of which the inner existence and workings of other centers are "appresented" in connec- tion with the responses of living organisms. Nature enjoys intentional,</page><page sequence="13">THE LOGIC OF ULTIMATES 583 noematic being in and for the minds of the system, but these minds are part of its absolute structure. This type of ever-recurrent absolut- ism has the merit of substituting for the maimed unity of the world, and for the splintered dust of Platonic subsistence, a sort of unity in which the most diverse content, even such as is imaginary and impossi- ble, can be harmoniously assembled. But a spiritual unity that has gone beyond solipsism to a whole spiritual society, has also gone beyond intentionalism into realism, and might well bring matter into its purview. Conscious aliveness, further, when phenomenologically examined, seems of its essence to be "angled" and developing: we can be aware of anything only in so far as we can see it in ever-changing "lights," which then contribute to a developing picture. There seems no room here for an all-embracing Absolute. What emerges from these hasty sketches is that some of the most thoughtfully constituted Absolutes have fallen far short of the re- quirements of Absolute-theory. And their internal flaws, if not remedi- able, bid fair to ruin the whole absolutist enterprise. The difficulty lies in the basic disparateness of the factors involved in absolutist con- struction-necessity and contingency, unity and dispersion, actuality and power, the good and the bad, the self, the others, the world, etc., etc.-and the need to integrate them all. It is arguable that no concept will do the logical work here involved but one that is inclusively teleological-a point all understand who feel that the world's absurdi- ties and untowardnesses would be fully explained if a single, all- informing, self-justifying purpose could be found to lie behind them all. Only teleology, it seems, can blend necessity and unity of direc- tion with variety and contingency of route and means, requires the ideal as much as the actual, and can, above all, display itself only on a soil involving the most immense untowardnesses and possibility of abuses as well as whatever we think of as well-rounded and well-fitting. Such teleology can, however, be successfully absolute only if it is "in- finite" in the Hegelian manner, if, like life, it aims at nothing beyond itself, and if it also incorporates situations, means, routes, procedures and deviant possibilities in itself. What I would suggest is that some sort of such "infinite" teleology, arguably passing at points into other- worldly, mystical dimensions which lend it a complete meaning, rep- resents the one viable form of absolutism, if any form of absolutism is viable at all.
