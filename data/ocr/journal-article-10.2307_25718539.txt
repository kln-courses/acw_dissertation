I wish to say that the Journal has been an inspiration to me. Naturally, some articles appeal to me more than others. What I wish to emphasize is that articles in support of our constitutional tradi tions have made the Journal the outstanding publication of our coun try. These articles have been inspir ing. I think everyone should know that Frank Holman's essays have had a great influence among members of Congress as well as lawyers. Your June issue carried the keenest and most effective essay about the Sixteenth Amendment that I have found anywhere. I refer of course to Samuel Pettengill's article entitled "Class War and the Income Tax". If we do not take adequate protective measures, the Sixteenth Amendment will be the only part of the Constitu tion to survive. The administration of the law has been worse than the law itself, and put every traditional principle into reverse. I hope that this subject is kept alive in your pages. The kind of articles I have men tioned have genuinely reflected the "objects" of the Association, includ ing the avowed honoring of the Constitution. No other association of lawyers has equalled the record of the American Bar Association. I know that no class of citizens is more acutely and intelligently ab sorbed in patriotic issues than the lawyers. I secured three new mem bers for the American Bar Associa tion by merely persuading them to take the Journal home and read it. They have thanked me repeatedly since. ... Carroll N. Whitman Rochester, New York More on Mr. Pettengill Mr. Samuel Pettengill opens his article on "Class War and the In come Tax" in your June issue by quoting the prophecy of Mr. Justice Field in Pollock v. Farmers Loan hr Trust Co., 157 U. S. 429, to the effect that the adoption of a federal in come tax would create "a war of the poor against the rich, a war constant ly growing in intensity and bitter ness". To the astonishment of many of Mr. Pettengill's readers he contends that this prophecy has come to pass! Any study of the currents of public opinion would seem to demonstrate that if ever in this country there was a "war of the poor against the rich", it has disappeared. In our last na tional election there was less of bit terness, less evidence of the class struggle than in any election within the memory of living man. How contrary Mr. Pettengill's view is to that of impartial observers who stand above the political battle as Mr. Pettengill does not is illus trated in John Kenneth Galbraith's American Capitalism (1952), gen erally acclaimed as the ablest an alysis and defense of capitalism that has been written in many years. In considering the use of our income tax to stabilize our economy, Mr. Galbraith writes: It is doubtful, incidentally, if any single device has done so much to secure the future of capitalism as this tax. . . . The income tax is the great buttress of inequality. The rich man no longer has the embarrassing task of justifying his higher income on grounds of ability, diligence or higher natural right. He needs only to point to the tax he has to pay. . .. Conserva tives should build a statue to it and its inspired progenitor, President Taft. True it is that World War II plus the prolonged cold war have laid ex traordinary burdens on ouf country and that the income tax is steeply graduated to distribute the burden according to ability to pay. If this is objectionable, what is the alterna tive? France and Italy manage their taxes quite differently. There, the rich do escape much of the burden of taxation. And it is there that the class war can be studied at its bitter est, its most threatening. It is there that communism comes closest to control in spite of the stupidities of the Kremlin. Let Mr. Pettengill lay aside the trappings of the apostle of gloom long enough to travel exten sively in these countries. He will dif fer widely from most of our travellers abroad if he fails to come back better satisfied with our management of the painful burdens of taxation. Benjamin H. Kizer Spokane, Washington Karl Marx and the Income Tax The syllabus to Mr. Pettengill's article, "The History of a Prophecy: Class War and the Income Tax" (in the June issue of the Journal 473) is, I regret to say, in the Goebbels Ehrenberg-Das Reich-Pravda dialec tic which far too many are offering and accepting in place of reasoned discourse in this country today. The implication is that because Karl Marx believed in high income taxes, all who support income taxes (including a Republican Adminis tration in 1909) are in some way tainted with Marxism. One might as (Continued on page 776) September, 1953 Vol. 39 771</page><page sequence="2">Views of Our Readers (Continued from page 771) well argue that because Mahomet believed in an anthropomorphic god, all who do are crypto-Moslems, even though they claim to be Jews or Christians! This sort of reasoning is nonsense. At least in their profes sional communications with one an other lawyers might set an example of elemental intellectual discipline in an era of anti-intellectuality. It might be well for us to remember that we are supposed to be a learned profession. The first two or three principles of logic, it is suggested, may still have a certain utility in contributing to the suggested ob jective. Since reacting as I have above to the article cited, I have seen Miss Howorth's protest to an earlier as sociation in the June issue of the Journal (page 514) of Marxism with favor for the income tax. Is there, in the good old Marxist-Hitlerian tra dition, a "line" on this point? If so my reference to an un-American and detestable dialectic is more exact than ever I had suspected. I protest its presence in the Journal as un worthy of a learned profession's book. Let inflamers of passions, arousers of false fears and other pros tituters of words take themselves to the soap-boxes or to the filthy little sheets the world has no reason to be expected to respect. Covey T. Oliver Berkeley, California Karl Marx and Tax Reduction In the June, 1953, issue of the Journal, at page 514, there appears a statement signed "Lucy Somerville Howorth, Washington, D. C", in which she takes exception to a state ment in my article on the Reed-Dirk sen Amendment, published in the March, 1953, issue of the Journal. The statement to which she objects is this: "Opposition to the revised amendment can be explained only by an adherence to the taxation philosophy of Karl Marx." She states that, "It is time to call a halt to the practice of insinuating that any [one] who differ [s] with a stated viewpoint is a subversive or communist traitor." I regret that Miss Howorth has placed such a construction upon my statement. I can assure her that no such meaning was intended. The matter that I was discussing was the new Reed-Dirksen Amend ment which does not prescribe the top rate of tax that Congress may impose, either in peace or war, but merely limits the degree of tax rate progression to 15 percentage points, thereby disposing of an objection made to the other forms of amend ment that they might impair the government's power to raise needed revenue in time of peace. The statement which has been criticized was intended merely to point out that objection to the re vised amendment must be based upon a belief that "a heavy progres sive or graduated income tax" should be permitted and that this was an acceptance of the income tax plank in the Marx platform. This plank, of course, has been accepted by our own Congress in the enact ment of the existing income tax law where the individual rates run from 22.2 per cent to 92 per cent. I certain ly do not regard the members of Congress as "subversive or commu nist traitors". Incidentally, I would call Miss Howorth's attention to the fact that it is a common practice in discussing the matter of tax limitation to refer to the platform of Karl Marx, and the virtual acceptance of its taxation planks by our Congress. Robert B. Dresser Providence, Rhode Island Agrees with Mr. Dresser Have just read the letters in your May issue on Mr. Dresser's article in the January issue and hasten to write you one member's complete agree ment with Mr. Dresser. The tax limitation amendment must be adopted if this nation is to survive as the nation created by the founding fathers. Experience proves politicians will spend all they can raise. "Tax and tax and spend and spend" and "after me the deluge" are the slogans of too many mentally dishonest dema gogues, insane for power. Those who put their shoulders to the wheel of Marx's theory (everyone knows who they are) and strive mightily to advance his graduated income tax will not be forgotten by those who want to preserve incentive to individ ual initiative. All, except the blind or dumb, can see the issue is Marxism or individ ualism. The voters, who recently threw the bosses of these men out, revolted against a situation whereby the ad vancers of Marx's theory had cut the government in for 52 per cent plus of all corporate profits, then for 25 per cent plus of what remained when paid out in dividends and then, under the name of death tax, im posed a substantial further cut on what little still remained in private business. It is essential not to overlook the fact that the 25 per cent limitation does not affect the taxing power of the states and that its adoption will restore government at home. John E. Hughes Chicago, Illinois The Draft Covenant on Human Rights With this I am referring to the letter dated April 3, 1953, from Secre tary John Foster Dulles to Mrs. Os wald B. Lord, U.S. Representative on the U.N. Commission on Human Rights. In this letter which was made public in The Department of State Bulletin, April 20, 1953, page 580, the Secretary informed Mrs. Lord that in the opinion of the Adminis tration a change in approaching the problem of Human Rights was neces sary. The U.S. Representative was advised that the promotion of Human Rights, as far as the U.S. was concerned, ought to be achieved, among other things, by example and education and such health, welfare (Continued on page 778) 776 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="3">Views of Our Readers (Continued from page 776) and other technical assistance pro grams as would raise the standard of living throughout the world. At the same time, the Secretary of State informed Mrs. Lord of the con clusion reached by the U.S. Govern ment that we should not at this time become a party to any multilateral treaty such as that contemplated in the Draft Covenant on Human Rights. The importance of the decision of the Administration not to sign the Covenant and similar documents cannot possibly be overestimated. At least for the time being the danger has passed that U.N. treaties, al though they might be incompatible with basic American concepts and infringe upon American interests, become the supreme law of the land by virtue of the automatism of Arti cle VI of the Constitution. Readers of this Journal have, of course, been aware of the opposition of the American Bar Association to the Draft Covenant. It will be re called that back in 1948 President Holman was first to emphasize all the far-reaching implications of treaty law. The American people are greatly indebted to Mr. Holman. Special credit, however, must be given to one committee of the Amer ican Bar Association, i.e., the Stand ing Committee on Peace and Lawr Through United Nations, It is this Committee which has been doing an outstanding job in alerting the pub lic to the dangers stemming from these U.N. activities. In the face of much opposition, not always pleasant to endure, the Committee on Peace and Law has never relaxed its efforts to criticize most effectively U.N. draft covenants on Freedom of Infor mation, Freedom of Speech and Press, Newsgathering and the Inter national Right of Correction, as be ing much too restrictive and out of harmony with American ideas, as well as the Genocide Convention, "as submitted", and the Draft Inter national Covenant on Human Rights. Several members of the Com mittee wrote articles which were pub lished in the Journal. In addition to these important contributions, the Committee would sum up its analy sis of the problem in its reports dated September 1, 1949; September 1, 1950; September 1, 1951; February 1, 1952; September 1, 1952, respec tively. Inspired by the patriotic de sire to defend the national interest of the United States, these reports represent the very best of legal scholarship to the effect that they would invariably be adopted by the House of Delegates. The Administration's refusal to sign the Covenant is a fitting reward for the unselfish devotion which the Standing Committee on Peace and Law Through United Nations through the years has so consistently shown to the principles of the Amer ican Constitution. Whenever the de finitive history of the proposed United Nations treaties dealing with Human Rights is written, the Stand ing Committee on Peace and Law Through United Nations of the American Bar Association may rest assured that in this account it will undoubtedly be accorded a most con spicuous and honorable place. William Fleming Department of Political Science Ripon College Ripon, Wisconsin Disagrees with Mr. Marryott Franklin J. Marryott's letter in the May issue is amusing, but it should not be overlooked. It is symptomatic of the type of thinking that today is resulting in attacks on all of our cherished freedoms?press, speech and thought. It is relatively unimportant whether or not Mr. Conard em ployed valid statistics and drew prop er conclusions in comparing Work men's Compensation with the F. E. L. A. The majority of the readers of this publication are probably aware of the weaknesses of statistics. Before I, for one, accept the conclu sions of any statistician, I analyze his selection of statistics and his basic premises. What does concern me and cause me for the first time in more than twenty years of professional practice to write a letter to an editor is Mr. Marryott's not-very-well veiled threat. This insurance executive, who has been compelling his staff lawyers to read the Journal because he thought it contained propaganda favorable to his business, wants the editors to keep out "false propa ganda". I am interested in seeing neither the status quo of the insurance busi ness protected nor attacked. I do want to see the Journal continue to be a forum where both sides of any controversial subject can be pre sen ted. When an article cannot be published because the editors or any number of readers disagree with the author, we have totalitarianism at its worst. It is just too bad that Mr. Marryott will have to continue to be on his guard to counteract what the Journal may have to say. I am conn dent that the members of this Asso ciation will support the Board of Editors in the policy stated on the editorial page under the heading "Signed Articles" even if we lose a few subscriptions from Marryott and his ilk. Raymond I. Suekoff Chicago, Illinois More on Workmen's Compensation I read and enjoyed the article by Professor Alfred F. Conard entitled "Workmen's Compensation: Is It More Efficient than Employers' Lia bility?" I also enjoyed reading the letters in the May, 1953, issue on pages 431 and 432 disagreeing with and supporting the article. I note that Franklin J. Marryott. Vice President of the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, thought that your Journal should never have printed the article as it would be "a very good way to make insurance lawyers angry and very unenthusias tic about the American Bar Associa tion". On the other hand, Lois G. Forer, of Philadelphia, thought Mr. Conard not only right, but added additional considerations reinforcing his conclusions. I have been a member of the (Continued on page 780) 778 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="4">Views of Our Readers (Continued from page 778) American Bar Association for many years and it is part of my job as Editor-in-Chief of the NACCA Law Journal to review the American Bar Association Journal, among other journals, and comment on its articles in the NACCA Law Journal. I have always believed and still believe that the American Bar Asso ciation represents all lawyers, both plaintiff and defendant; and that it cannot maintain a healthy Journal unless its pages are open to all sides of any legal controversy. The three thousand lawyers in the National Association of Claimants' Compensation Attorneys (NACCA for short) are interested in all types of personal injuries under the work men's compensation acts as well as under railroad, admiralty and tort law, and were naturally interested in Professor Conard's view. We do not take the position, feared by Mr. Marryott, that the workmen's com pensation acts ought to be over thrown and the F.E.L.A. substituted. We prefer improvement of the work men's compensation laws so that widows in the majority of states will receive hereafter more than the national average of about $5000 for the death of their husbands, and men who lose two eyes or two legs will receive more than the $10,000 na tional average; but we do not believe that the compensation system at this time should be wiped out completely and the F.E.L.A. substituted. However, we do not believe at this time that the F.E.L.A. and the Jones Act should be put out of exist ence and replaced by the present deficient workmen's compensation acts of the forty-eight states or of the federal acts. We disagree with the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association who have recom mended that the state workmen's compensation acts should replace the present F.E.L.A. which, in our opin ion, is far more efficient than the present state workmen's compensa tion laws. We hope that your excellent Jour nal will continue to print both sides of the controversy even if insurance lawyers become "angry and very unenthusiastic about the American Bar Association". However, I want to commend both Mr. Marryott and Mrs. Forer for their courage in expressing their opinions on controversial subjects. Incidentally, I have been urging all NACCA members, not already members of the American Bar Asso ciation, to join the ABA, as I believe we should all work to advance the science of jurisprudence and pro mote the administration of justice for all injured persons. These people have the right to have their view point presented certainly on an equal par with the viewpoint of insurance companies who collect the premiums for such injuries. Samuel B. Horovitz Boston, Massachusetts Workmen's Compensation in Michigan Mr. Franklin J. Marryott's pro test against the article by Alfred F. Conard, which appeared in the December, 1952, issue of the Jour nal, prompts me to set forth some information about the inefficiency with which the Workmen's Compen sation Act operates in Michigan. In 1911 the Statutory Committee, which was created to study the feasi bility of a Workmen's Compensation Act for Michigan, ascertained that out of every premium dollar paid by employers to insurance carriers for protection against liability suits ap proximately 38 per cent was paid to the injured employee. A study of the statistics of the Department of Insur ance for the State of Michigan, for a period covering seven years, shows that out of every premium dollar re ceived by the insurance carrier for workmen's compensation insurance approximately 41 per cent was paid in benefits. These benefits include medical benefits, which approximate one third of the total. It would there fore appear at the present time that out of every premium dollar the workers are receiving benefits total ing a bit more than they were receiv ing back in 1911, but they are only receiving about 27 per cent of the premium dollar in direct benefits. Any system of insurance that oper ates at a 55 per cent to 60 per cent retention figure must be deemed in efficient. The Workmen's Compen sation Act of Michigan was intended to be simply administered, in a fashion so that the worker could easily understand it and maintain his rights thereunder. At the present time the law is so complicated that the overwhelming majority of law yers do not understand it, refuse to handle it, and the entire practice of workmen's compensation is in the hands of a few specialists. A glance at the index of Michigan Reports will show that our Supreme Court, which reviews compensation cases on leave granted, considers a great many workmen's compensation cases, and its decisions often contain minority dissenting opinons. In Michigan, one must therefore conclude that the Workmen's Com pensation Act is costly to the employ er, inadequately indemnifies the em ployee, and is of substantial benefit only to the insurance carriers and to the lawyers, both for claimants and insurers, who practice in the field. Benjamin Marcus Muskegon, Michigan Likes Article by Mr. Crotty The splendid paper entitled "Character and the Law Schools" by Homer D. Crotty appearing in your May, 1953, issue deserves the highest praise. My belief in the matters dis cussed therein is in accord, and goes back even to pre-law-school days. It is noteworthy that our accredit ing bodies, both professional and legislative, in setting up entrance re quirements for the study of law% have failed to provide against the "evil" complained of. My own short obser vation convinces me that the poor moral and ethical "risks" are created by the type of prelaw courses ac cepted. How can accounting, spell ing, economics, management, sales manship and the like properly condi (Continned on page 782) 780 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="5">Views of Our Readers (Continued from page 780) tion and train the minds of prelaw students either in good morals or in ethics? What is needed is a solid foundation in the classics, with some mathematics, history and science, all of which will ruggedly train the in tellect and the will of the prospective lawyer. Of course, these suggested subjects are difficult and the road is rocky. But, if the goal is prized highly enough, the sacrifice entailed is not significant. There is no apparent shortage of lawyers, and I know of no suggestion to seek numbers in preference to quality. Eugene J. Chesney Cleveland, Ohio Amplification and a Correction I would refer to the very interest ing article by Mr. Morse Erskine [39 A.B.A.J. 279, April, 1953] on the se lection of judges in England and venture to make two comments, the one by way of amplification and the other as a correction. It seems to me that Mr. Erskine did not place sufficient stress upon the fact that practically all the judges appointed to the High Court and above are selected from those bar risters who already hold the office of Queen's Counsel. Almost the same procedure is followed by the Lord Chancellor in his selection of Queen's Counsel from "junior" bar risters as in his selection of judges. Accordingly, a person appointed a judge has been at least once before in his life screened by those in authority and his fellow barristers, and presum ably has not been found wanting. Mr. Erskine in a footnote states "The principal defect of the admin istration of the law in England seems to be a system of costs under which the losing party must pay all the expenses of the other side including his attorneys' fees." I venture to sug gest that this is not in fact the prac tice in England. Without going into any great detail there are three usual types of orders as to costs made by the judge and incorporated in his judgment. The first awards no costs to either party, the result of which is that each party pays his own fees and expenses. The other two orders known, technically, as "Solicitor and Client" and "Party and Party" or ders, offer to the winning party a sum which does not exceed generally 60 per cent of his actual fees and ex penses. The officer of the court, known as the "Taxing Master" has exclusive jurisdiction to determine the amounts so payable. It is true that a committee is considering amendments to this system, but I believe that the principle is to re main inviolable. By etiquette of the English Bar, I must withhold my name and merely sign myself An English Barrister London A New Plan for Choosing Judges It will be immediately apparent that the subject herein discussed will be by way of material departure from the mine run of comments ap pearing in this publication. The import of its delicacy is not under estimated. We must assume, however, that it was never intended that consider ation should not be frequently given to the general working order of our three departments of the Federal Government under the Constitution. In the light of experience it has been found advisable to make many changes in the functioning processes, both as to the executive and legisla tive departments. When we consider the judicial branch of our Government it would be to our advantage to give consider ation to the customs and usages that prevailed at the time of the adoption of the Federal Constitution. Re course to available information will disclose that the great document by its provisions is patterned after the systems generally in force in the colo nies. In other words, the judges were named by the chief executive and as sumed their duties upon approval by the General Assembly. It seems that this plan for naming judges prevails generally in the following states: Connecticut, Dela ware, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, South Caro lina, Vermont, Virginia and Massa chusetts. It is of notable interest that the states of New York and Pennsylvania originally adopted similar provisions in their constitutions. However, in both instances, the state constitutions have been amended and provision made for the election of the judges by the vote of the people. It so happens that all of the re maining states with slight modifica tions have provided in their consti tutions that judges shall be elected by popular vote. It would perhaps serve no useful purpose to attempt an analysis of this overwhelming change during the past century and a half. It would be comparable to an effort to explain why people ride in automobiles rather than on horses. It must be plainly apparent that the individ ual voter regards his right to name the judges as one of paramount im portance. It can be safely said that a very substantial segment of the population would consider this privi lege as sacred as the right to vote its choice for President and members of Congress. It has been very adequately re vealed to the general practitioners by reason of contact with judges of the highest court of the respective states that the opportunity to serve on the Federal Bench, even in the trial court, is regarded as a promotion. Under the present system it is a rare occasion when the ablest judges of the highest state tribunals are ever called to serve in the United States courts. It would seem that the limita tions thus imposed have been too long ignored. It is quite obvious that with perti nent amendments to the Constitution the Congress by appropriate enact ments could very well set up a system for the naming of the Federal Judici ary that will give the people the opportunity to exercise a voting (Continued on page 784) 782 American Bar Association Journal</page><page sequence="6">Views of Our Readers (Continued from page 782) privilege that has been too long de . 1 erred. A plan that might meet with favor and merely by way of suggestion might provide: First: Elect a sufficient number of federal judges to provide for all positions in the trial and appellate courts. Second: Allow the judges elected in each of the nine [sic] circuits to name from their number the mem bers of the Court of Appeals. Third: Allow the judges elect of each circuit of the nine [sic] circuits to name from their number one of the judges of the Supreme Court of the United States. Fourth: Provide a suitable system of ration and tenure. Henry W. Parrott Seattle, Washington Democracy in Labor Unions I have just read the article by Louis Waldman of the New York City Bar, entitled "Labor and the Nation", in the May issue of your Journal. The brief note at the be ginning of the article states that Mr. Waldman analyzes the controversy "as a struggle for power between business and labor and he holds both labor and management responsible to the American people". My experi ence as a trial judge has convinced me that the struggle is primarily be tween management and the labor leaders. Workingmen, as such, have little more to do with the situation than have the stockholders of our corporations. I am convinced, by the cases that have come before me, and by my discussions with men in many lines of work, that the workingman today suffers more at the hands of ambitious, sometimes unscrupulous and sometimes racketeering, labor leaders than he does at the hands of management. Any sensible and effective labor relation legislation must therefore include provision that all votes, which involve any of the following matters, must be by secret ballot at elections conducted by government representatives, with due police pro tection afforded all union members, especially those who are in oppo sition to the wishes of their leaders: 1. Election of officers. 2. Adoption or amendment of by laws. 3. Approval or disapproval of contracts and contract extensions or terminations. 4. Decisions to strike or to termi nate strikes. I have found that union members are frequently quite definitely co erced when voting on matters such as those above set forth, and that in telligent and aggressive young lead ers who oppose the officers in power have charges brought against them, and are suspended or otherwise de prived of their ability to earn their livelihood. To put management at one end of the scale, and the great bulk of labor at the other, is obviously unrealistic and far out of line with conditions as they actually exist. The struggle is between management and labor bosses and should be recognized as such. L. Stauffer Oliver Court of Common Pleas No. 7 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Opposes the Model Antigambling Act Although I am aggressively oppos ing the so-called "Model Anti-Gam bling Act" on the grounds that as written it departs from the inten tions of the Kefauver Committee and the Crime Commission and that in its present form it is neither a model act nor a proper antigambling meas ure, I regard the most of the act as very good. I am not an obstructionist. My only object is to add something con structive to a highly commendable effort on the part of the members of the Crime Commission. Upon receipt of a request from any judge or at torney accompanied by a stamped and self-addressed 6i/2 x 9y2 envelope I will send a copy of my 10-leaf pamphlet entitled The "Model Anti Gambling Act3' of the American Bar Association, and How To Amend It. F. E. Williams St. Louis, Missouri Initiative and Referendum In reading the article "The Third American Revolution: A Reform Movement Gone Wrong", by Rene* A. Wormser of the New York City Bar, in the May, 1953, issue of your Journal, I note on page 390 a state ment to the effect that North Dakota adopted the initiative and refer endum in 1896. The impression is further given that North Dakota was the first state to adopt such pro visions. In the interest of accuracy I would like to point out that the ini tiative and referendum were not adopted so as to become a part of the North Dakota Constitution until ratified by the people in 1914. The proposals had first been adopted by the two preceding legislative sessions in 1911 and 1913. See Ch. 93 Laws of 1911 and Ch. 101, Laws of 1913. See also State ex rel. Linde v. Hall, 35 N.D. 34, 150 N.W. 281, which traces the history of the provisions in great detail, and points to the State of Oregon as the place where these "ideas" originated. In this 1916 decision North Dakota is described as having adopted the provisions from the constitution of Oregon. As stated, these facts are submitted in the interests of accuracy and not with any desire to comment on Mr. Wormser's many controversial state ments. However, if I were to add that the people of North Dakota have been using the initiative and referen dum with increasing caution and re straint, it could also be regarded as a statement made in the interests of accuracy.
