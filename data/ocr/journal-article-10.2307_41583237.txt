<plain_text><page sequence="1">Belinda McKeon 'one more folded sunset': mapping the poem The following is an edited version of a talk delivered at the 2010 Poetry Now Festival by festival curator Belinda McKeon, in Dún Laoghaire, Co Dublin. A selection of the poems referred to are included at the end of this essay. I want to start today by talking about the poem from which this talk takes its title. Elizabeth Bishop's 'Questions of Travel' is a sharply beautiful meditation on experience, on belonging, on responsibility and on place itself. Iťs a poem which engages with place and which concerns itself deeply with the ways in which we interact with place. But still more urgently, and more affectingly, 'Questions of Travel' is a poem about the struggle of the poet and the poem to do all of these things. Through its journey, I'll be making my way in this talk into the question of place and the meaning it holds in poems by some of the poets who'll read at Poetry Now this year. Where is the place from which 'Questions of Travel' comes? It is, of course, somewhere in the poet, but it's also somewhere between the poet and the poet's world of experience. But when the origin of the poem is also rooted in a certain geography, in a specific landscape, I think that we as readers can see the poem not just as it is on the page, but also as it comes from the poet, as the poet strives within the poem to express to explore, to evoke - perhaps even to use - place. 'Questions of Travel' emerged out of Bishop's 1951 trip to Brazil. It was a trip intended to last a few weeks; she stayed for almost 20 years. This poem jangles with the nervous energy, the anxiety, of Bishop's first encounters with this new location: there are too many things, presenting themselves all at once, all to excess. I'm interested, in this first stanza of Bishop's, in what she is doing with language - and in what she is consciously not doing. In the face of the spectacular tumult of this new locale, the language of the poem comes under immense pressure, just like those clouds spilling over the mountaintops - except the language appears not to cope nearly as well as the clouds. And I'm not saying here that Bishop's language - or rather, the speaker's language - doesn't cope, rather that, in this first stanza in particular, it appears not to cope. It appears, rather, to flail, to falter; but it can do little else, presented as it is with a place in which ages pass so quickly that tearstains become waterfalls. The speaker is dwarfed by this overwhelming landscape, and in response she grabs at words, she strains towards expression. And the speaker's vocabulary seems to dry up when faced with the challenge of depicting those streams in their onward rush. 26 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI</page><page sequence="2">There is no filmic evocation of slow-motion, no emotive metaphor of the tearstain, but a verb quite bland in its straightness: 'the streams and clouds keep travelling', and the same word repeated - 'travelling' - as if nothing else will do. It's interesting to note that the language given by Bishop to her speaker for the task of making sense of this new and overwhelming situation is itself the language of travel, even though by now she has arrived. The mountains, she says, 'look like the hulls of capsized ships'. The language belongs to the experience of the journey, the speaker has not yet made the shift to a language in which to fully engage with the destination. Meaning is lost in transition, and while she finds what seem like words, in truth all the speaker can do in this first stanza is to stare. The second stanza steps back, frowns, and rattles off questions about travel like a hail of bullets to rival the waterfall: Should we have stayed at home and thought of here? Where should we be today? Is it right to be watching strangers in a play in this strangest of theatres? What childishness is it that while there's a breath of life in our bodies, we are determined to rush to see the sun the other way around? Guilt and anxiety reverberate very strongly through these lines, but they are not merely the guilt and anxiety of the traveller. The language of this stanza, very different to that of the first, points beyond the anxiety of travel and towards the anxiety of poetry itself, particularly of poetry which seeks to engage with place and to make meaning from it. I'm thinking here of the language of theatricality or performativity with which Bishop describes the scenery and the life of Brazil as 'strangers in a play / in this strangest of theatres', while in the next stanza she'll describe the trees of the place as 'noble pantomimists'. This is not just the anxiety of someone who is far from home; this is an anxiety relating to questions of artistry and authenticity. Bishop is not writing a play, not making theatre. She is making a poem out of a place. And if she cannot engage with this place beyond the level of mere indulgence, mere play, can a true poem be produced? Of course, there's no reason why a true poem cannot be produced out of play, out of a type of indulgence. But genuinely for Bishop, I think, there is reason to be anxious, and this poem reflects that anxiety and becomes, in turn, a meditation on the anxieties of the poetry of place itself. I think a useful way of looking at this is to consider the central anxiety of the traveller in 'Questions of Travel'. It's not so much that the traveller feels far from home. The problem is that the traveller worries POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI | 2 7</page><page sequence="3">that she is only, after all, a tourist. And I think that translates easily into the anxiety of the poet faced with the place from which she wishes to make a poem - the anxiety that she can only write a postcard, only perform a pantomime. Because the pitfalls of travel - never seeing the real sights, the authentic destinations, thinking everything 'instantly seen... always delightful' - are also, potentially, the pitfalls of poetry Bishop's poem offers no relief of resolution in its long third stanza which sweeps towards the final, italicised excerpts from the traveller's notebook. If there's a turnaround, it's not a dramatic one. It's an assertion that, after all, these things are worth seeing, these places are worth knowing, but it goes no further than to maintain that it would be a pity not to see these sights, not to hear these sounds, not to have tried to make sense of them. That said, Bishop's speaker does move from the deliberately stunted image-making of the first stanza to images which are more fully delineated - the clacking wooden clogs, the singing fat bird in the mini bamboo church - but which also seem somehow random, somehow snatched from the relentless flow of the strange and the new, and guarded jealously, as though to act as some kind of buffer against the knowledge that the traveller - and the poet - can only ponder 'blurr'dly and inconclusively' on connections. Yet, as though to topple this buffer, the images here suggest once again that anxiety of artistry and authenticity seen in the second stanza - where, I've suggested, Bishop's metaphors of theatricality point to a guilt on the poet's behalf in forcing the place to act a role, to perform. That the resounding tune in this stanza is a 'wooden' one is hardly a vote of confidence in that performance - a performance which will ultimately find expression as a poem. Nor do the other sounds of this stanza - 'the weak calligraphy of songbirds' cages', the 'politicians' speeches' - point to confidence in the poetry of place. Even that 'sudden golden silence' in which the traveller takes a notebook and finally writes seems like something of which we would do well to be suspicious; the description makes the experience suggest - as with that inexplicable old stonework, 'instantly seen and always, always delightful' - a nostalgia, a pair of rose- tinted sunglasses for the traveller and for the poet. But then, what can they do? Because the beauty of those trees along the road, to go back to the start of stanza three, is not exaggerated by the traveller or the poet - those trees really are exaggerated in their beauty. So how to allow them into language, without bloating language itself with exaggeration, making it untrue? What can we do? 'Should we have stayed at home and thought of here?' And speaking of thought: Even now there are places where a thought might grow... That first line of Derek Mahon's poem 'A Disused Shed in Co. Wexford' seems to signal an opening-up to place on the part of the poet, a looking 28 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI</page><page sequence="4">towards place with an optimism which seems in stark contrast to the shrugging resignation of Bishop's poem. Plant the thought in the place, this poem seems to suggest. Give it time. Let it gestate. Do not seek to tear it from its ground early, to fold it neatly away in a notebook. There are many places for such a thought, Mahon s poem seems to say: Peruvian mines, worked out and abandoned To a slow clock of condensation, An echo trapped for ever, and a flutter Of wild flowers in the lift-shaft, Indian compounds where the wind dances And a door bangs with diminished confidence, Lime crevices behind rippling rain-barrels, Dog corners for bone burials; And in a disused shed in Co. Wexford, Deep in the grounds of a burnt-out hotel... What immediately strikes the reader about these thought-nurturing places is that they are mostly sites which were once alive with some sign of humanity, some sort of domesticity, and which have now been abandoned. Like Bishop's capsized ship, these places imagined by the poets were once inhabited by people. And it's as if the echo and the trace of that humanity is what gives these places meaning. But this is, too, a poem which imagines stark inhumanity. Mahon compares the crowd of mushrooms in the disused shed to victims of the concentration-camp. They are alone, left behind by people, and they are begging the speaker - and us - 'to do something, to speak on their behalf'. Mahon's poem, which imagines both a harmless place - the shed - and a place of absolute harm, constitutes a meditation on place, not just on how a poet should know and express a place, but on the question of the poet's responsibility to place. Bishop's 'crowded streams' were indifferent to the human gaze; this crowd lives in hope that it will return. I do think though that, on another level, Ä Disused Shed in Co. Wexford' points - without sympathy - to the challenge faced by the poet in trying to evoke a place. It's obviously a very different poem to 'Questions of Travel' but in the moment when human presence returns to this godfor- saken place, there is I think a warning in Mahon's portrait of that return, that for the engagement with place to be ethical (remember Bishop's plaintive, 'Where should we be today?'), the first visitors after a long period of abandonment must be more than what his poem describes. They must be more than 'the flash-bulb firing-squad we wake them with'. It's arguable that what's at work here is a warning also to the poet. These feverish ghosts, described so grimly by Mahon in language which recalls POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI | 29</page><page sequence="5">those stark images of the liberated camps, evoke or are compared to the 'Lost people of Treblinka and Pompeii'. These are people who can only be known through remains taken from a ruined place. Is Mahon sounding a warning to the poet and to the noble aims a poem might have when con- templating a place, real or imagined? Can a mere visitor with a camera presume to excavate, recover, speak for, give meaning to, whole lost civil- isations, to nature - not even to nature, but to something 'Grown beyond nature now, soft food for worms'? I think that ultimately this poem suggests that there is more than one way to abandon a place, more than one way to serve it ill, and that this is a danger to which the poet must be attuned. The struggle to relate to place in the aftermath of a personal loss pre- occupies Rosanna Warren s elegy The Cormorant', a deeply poignant poem. But it's also a dark poem, one that, like Mahon's 'Disused Shed', cautions the poet. And this poem, I think, also enacts that process of the poet cautioning herself on the matter of place - the poet warning herself not to be under any illusions about the reciprocal nature of her relationship to the beautiful landscape to which she has journeyed, in which she thought she was at home, but in which, she is discovering, she is only a tourist - and possibly a tourist with the wrong currency In The Cormorant', the speaker inhabits a rented house by the sea while struggling to come to terms with the death of someone who has always been in her life; what seemed solid and permanent has vanished, and only temporary moorings remain. Warren sets up a sharp contrast in this poem, where the relationship to place is concerned, between the speaker and her young children. The children are almost the epitome of Bishop's racing tourists - and since they are children, there is nothing questionable about their 'rushing to see the sun the other way around', or, in this case, the sea. The speaker, on the other hand, firstly sits indoors in the house she does not own, and later walks on a beach, watching a cormorant disappear into the 'shuddering darkness' of the water. But what is most interesting about the contrast between the adult and the children, between the bereaved and those who are (within this poem at least) innocent of grief, is the language of exchange and of economy with which the poet evokes the children's engagement with the place around them. They are not just splashing in the ocean, they are studying the economy of the sea. They have trudged to earn sand dollars, crab claws, whelk shells, the huge debt repaid in smithereens along the shore: ocean, old blowhard, wheezing in the give and take, gulls grieving the shattered store. 30 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI</page><page sequence="6">In grief, a cynicism seems to have hardened the mother's view of her children's playful interaction with the sea and its offerings; excited though they may be by their acquisitions, by what this place has given to them, really they have nothing, it seems; there is nothing of worth to be earned or taken. Their childish currency is made of useless, broken things. Meanwhile, the mother, in her grief, thinks of her loved one's death: last night, inland, away from us, beyond these drawling compensations of the moon. If there's an exchange for you, some kind of bond, It's past negotiation. You died alone. A landscape, presumably chosen and travelled to for its beauty, has lost its value for the speaker; later, when the cormorant disappears under the water, it accentuates the woman's feeling of disconnection: It dove down into that shuddering darkness where we can't breathe. Impossibly long. Nothing to see. Nothing but troughs and swells over and over hollowing out the sea. And, beyond the cove, the channel bells. A kind of weary disgust, a surrender to the impossibility, the unseeable nature of this place, which is not the self and is not the lost one, takes over. The children may spill out their sea-treasures, but in this formerly treasured place for the mother no solace is forthcoming; grief renders impossible the capacity to see beyond the depths of the self - and the landscape comes to take on those limitations. A very different kind of caution operates in John F Deane's poetry of place, which often invokes much larger mysteries in its grappling with the ultimate unknowability of an island, of a kind of light, of a ruined village, of an ocean breaking against rocks. What is striking about these poems is how rarely they call on the known as a means to understanding the unknown; how rarely they map a place out in terms of markings of emotion, or intellect, in terms of tendencies of the human body or biases of the human eye. What I mean by this is that a poem like 'Harbour: Achill Island' (a poem dealing with the poet's birthplace) has about it a striking specificity in its evocation of place. It is not entirely stripped of metaphor, but it strains hardly at all to describe place in terms of anything other than place, other than what this specific place looks like. Here is the first half of the poem; see how its gaze seems only to set down that which it encounters as it surveys this place caught up in a storm: POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI | 3I</page><page sequence="7">The winds come rushing down the narrow sound between islands; from the north the whole ocean pours through, exploding against boulders, against landfalls, and courses into quiet when the tide brims. A seal lifts its grey-wise head out of the current, a mackerel shoal sets the surface sparkling... Gifting the seal with 'gray- wise' status is as far as the poem ventures here from specificity, and yet the transition from bombast to stillness in these lines is visible, audible, alive. When metaphor surges into the poem - as it does with a description of the downpour as 'a chariot drawn by six roan horses' - the poem maintains its footing in the particular by openly attributing what's seen to the speaker's gaze alone: To the eye the water's stilled now in the bay; stones on the sea-bed shimmer like opals, cantankerous crustaceans side-legging across the sand. This reserve - this determination not just to evoke place as it is, but to name poetic license as it is, too, adding the proviso that this is only 'to the eye' - is rooted, in this poem, in a reluctance on the part of Deane, a deeply religious poet, to take credit for the place out of which he has made a poem. He says, of this vista: 'yet how we amble through it / as if it were our portion, and our endeavour.' For Deane, the poet is rightly humbled by the encounter with place, and for him, the difficulty of that encounter is a mark of the divine. Philip Gross, whose most recent collection The Water Table has at its source the stretch of water from the Bristol Channel to the Severn Sea, has an altogether different relationship to that very difficulty. Through their immersion in this fluctuating version of place, Gross's poems inevitably confiront questions of change and of identity - questions, too, of what can truly be known of a place, and what that capacity for knowl- edge, or its lack, tells us about the self that is the poet. 'Betweenland', a sequence of ten poems which flow through the book, is frank about the ways in which place shuts the poet out - in a number of these poems, the very act of naming land and water is undercut as soon it occurs, as here in 'Betweenland IV': A mouth, we say - as if it spoke the hills' native language in the lowlands' slow translation. It's all hearsay: 32 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI</page><page sequence="8">a mountain hands down utterance on all sides: no water belongs. Here, the stability afforded by naming a river is held up as an illusion - worse, as a kind of gossip. Iťs a revelation which we might imagine would throw the poet into the kind of anxiety so much to the fore in Bishop's poem; if the language by which place can be rendered in the poem is little more than hearsay, what chance authenticity? The next stanza throws a sort of consolation prize to the poet, proclaiming that 'Only catchment, maybe, is a sort / of selfi a notional line../ So those anthropomorphic metaphors, those readings-of-self-into-place, might come close to precision. But only close. Yet Gross does not stop to worry. The river flows on. The water does not wait - it does not need to be caught and named. As for the poet, as becomes clear in Gross's last stanza, the poet can work just as well with the uncatchable. Instead of fretting over the notion that the poetry of place is a kind of hearsay or chatter, never getting it right, Gross takes that imperfection and makes of it a rich metaphor for the shifting nature of this 'Betweenland': And the mouth debouches - all our secrets, for our old twice daily, her who comes in and does, to mop up. (Some of the juicer morsels do the rounds like gossip, day by day.) To debouch is to march from a narrow or confined area out into free space. The mouth here is not just place as it is named by the poet; it is, of course, the poet himself, seeing limitation and nevertheless breaking free onto the open waters of the poem. The very title of Kevin Young's poem, 'Driving Independence Day', suggests a very interesting spin on the poetry of place. Driving from where? To where? Driving through what territory? Driving past what markers, what solid places which might determine what this poem will be? No. 'Driving Independence Day', that's the title. The poem is set in a car in which the speaker travels through Pennsylvania - Amish boys are mentioned, tombstones in Boalsburg, flags in Woodward and Lewisburg - but the title could just as much be about the process of driving, of powering or urging on, or about the day of independence, or the experience of independence for this speaker. And that includes the speaker's - and the poet's - right to claim independence from place, and from the identities it tries to impose. In this poem, landscape, as it comes and goes past the windows of the moving car, is scarred and shadowed by history. And it is scarred and shadowed by the present, too: these are not just roads built by slavery, these are roads trav- elled upon by boys who are dying at war: POETRY IRELAND REVIEW IOI | 33</page><page sequence="9">Hotels keep out VACANCY the way the Sunday best of a lost soldier dangles in mother s closet. Iťs interesting that there's a presence in this poem of a disrespect or appropriation of place that we Ve seen other poems worry over; the car speeds past an Amish boy, noticing 'Flowered tourists' who 'pull over to steal pictures / because they can/ Pictures, presumably, of the inhabitants of Amish country, who ask not to be photographed, but the tourists 'can and so they do. There's an inkling of judgment at work here, of course, but what makes this poem remarkable is how it bears witness to place and what it means, even as it refuses to be drawn into place - even as place quite literally speeds by. To this speaker, the stone in front of his eyes is not 'inexplicable and impenetrable.' It is all too explicable: War built the roads you cross. Men with bad hearts or flat feet broke rocks, backs, laying this pave like stateside wives. The detachment may be the consequence of a lack of rootedness to the ground on which this poem travels: 'Where', the speaker wonders, looking at cemeteries, 'do all the black folks / get buried in this country?' And yet this detachment does not preclude a frank gaze at this landscape, a gaze made with the speed of a snapshot. Perhaps this is because the surveying eye is accustomed to having to read a place with intense care: alert to warnings, it takes in not just the sign for the icy bridge but the Confederate flag outside Lewisburg. Accustomed to having to make sense of a place, to situating himself and his identity within that place - as a matter not just of self-knowledge but of survival - the speaker can cast that place off, or at least he can try 'Don't stop to take / it in, just pass by...' But the simile immediately suggests that the immense effort required on the part of the speaker to maintain his independence - what he is telling himself to 'just pass by' are 'those buildings with flags hung / like black men, those post offices where / the slowest, the most words are kept.' This place is shadowed, scarred, and though the desire of the speaker is not to see these things, yet that is a luxury that the poem cannot afford. Anne Stevenson's 1971 poem 'Coming Back to Cambridge' is a fascinating and I think quite provocative reflection on the poem and the place. If 'Questions of Travel' grapples with place as it is visited, and 'A Disused Shed' with place as it is imagined, this work by Stevenson is a poetry of a place which is already over-poeticised, which is crowded or burdened with a sense of its own finery. This is Cambridge with its landmarks 'beautiful to the excluded', with its river 'full of the young', its 34 I POETRY IRELAND REVIEW 101</page><page sequence="10">'conceited' sense of itself. Stevenson echoes the exaggerated beauty of Bishop's trees with the Cambridge roses 'too perfect to look alive', and she echoes Bishop's 'theatre of strangers' and Mahon s camera-touting doorbusters with her cast of actors, whose eyes 'glide sideways / apprehensive of martyrdom to which they might not be central. / They can never be sure. / Great elations could be happening without them.' I think it's interesting how often atmospheres of egocentricity and domination surface in poems which engage with place - of course, it must point to an unease on the part of the poet, a guilt at forcing a place to fit a poem, a guilt at looking at a place so avidly that its 'mild facades harden before and / behind you like stereographs.' Stevenson's response in this poem is to praise as a kind of poetry the act of barely seeing, of barely noticing a place: despite the hardening of those facades, she says, 'there is much to be taken for granted. / Meals and quarrels, passions and inequalities. / A city like any other, were it not for the / order at the centre and the high / invisible bridge it is built upon.' Where does this leave the poetry of place? After all, when it comes to a poetic engagement with place, isn't the poem itself - its form, its language - that 'order at the centre', that 'high invisible bridge' on which the engagement is built? Strip these away and you take place for granted, but out of such a stance it's difficult to imagine a poem being made. Unless you're Paul Muldoon, and you can leave order and the high bridge in place, and at the same time take something for granted and grant it an entirely new take. I'm thinking in particular of Muldoon's poem 'The Old Country', thirteen sonnets in the key of Irish cliché. Muldoon's long poem riffs on and rattles off an apparently endless string theory of commonplace phrases, of half-talk, of small-talk, of traits and tendencies so deeply-rooted that some of them are barely even visible any more to the usual eye. But Muldoon's is not the usual eye. 'Where every town was a tidy town / and every garden a hanging garden' , 'The Old Country' begins. 'A half could be had for half a crown. / Every major artery would harden / / since every meal was a square meal. / Every clothesline showed a line of undies / yet no house was in dishabille. / Every Sunday took a month of Sundays / / till everyone got it off by heart / every start was a bad start / since all conclusions were foregone.' We're back to where we started, in a way: to the bad start and the foregone conclusions faced by the speaker of Elizabeth Bishop's poem. There was too much of everything, so much that the speaker could only think of home, and of how much more simple that would be. What Muldoon's 'The Old Country' shows us is what Bishop's speaker, taking out her notebook at the end of the poem, seems really to have known: that the poem is at home with the fullness, the strangeness, the irreplaceabilty of place, and that the poet can trust in that much.
