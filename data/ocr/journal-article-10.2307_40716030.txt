<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Collections Recent Acquisitions: Three African Masks Among the tribes of Upper Volta, human and animal masks are the major artistic expression. The museum has been fortunate during the past year in receiving three important masks from this area, all gifts from Dr. and Mrs. Donald Suggs. Although from three separate tribes, these masks show stylistic similarities and serve to illustrate the influences and connections between various groups. The first mask is Marka, depicting a human face crowned with sweeping antelope horns which are visually balanced by a beard-like projection under the chin. The face is abstract, with two rectangular protrusions serving as ears. The nose is formed by a narrow piece jutting out from the face and in profile has three triangular indentations. The mouth also protrudes, with a double row of teeth indicated by the carving. The entire surface of the mask is carved in geometric patterns. Rows of interlocking triangles cover the brow and are repeated on the cheeks and nose. There are three concentric circles around each eye, and along the side of the face there are vertical grooves which show up again on the chin extension. The horns are decorated with interlocking triangles separated by parallel grooves. The raised surfaces on the mask were originally painted red, black and white. However the colors have been dimmed by age and wear. Around the edge is a series of holes laced with a twisted fiber rope. The loops formed would have served as attachment points for the rest of the costume covering the dancer. This mask represents a bush genie and was above: Dance Mask, West Africa, Upper Volta, Marka Tribe. Wood and paint. Height: 62.0 cm. Gift of Dr. and Mrs. Donald M.

Its size gives it formidable presence, and the various elements are well balanced to create a harmonious mixture of human and animal traits. This type of mask was previously considered to be Bobo and does have features similar to Bobo anthropomorphic masks. However, according to Henri Kamer of the National Museum of Upper Volta, this specific style is only made by the Marka living in the Dedougou region of Upper Volta. The wooden masks covered with embossed brass, which are more familiar to the collector, are made by the Marka living in Mali. A very similar geometric pattern appears on the plank-topped Bwa mask. Also known as Bobo-Ule, this group occupies the southwest corner of Upper Volta between the Marka and the Bobo-Fing and make the largest single piece masks in the country. This Bwa mask is a good example of the type used by the Do Society. The slightly elongated face has a projecting rectangular mouth, concentric circle eyes, and an extension from the chin. The two horns are placed at the same width as the flat projection rising above the face. The central ridge of the plank is in profile a series of connected triangles ending in a downward curving beak form. The carving may represent birds diving, but the forms have been highly abstracted. The red, black and white paint has been well preserved on this mask. There is a series of attachment holes around the edge. The Do masks are thought to personify guardian spirits of the village. They are mostly used at funerals, the termination of mourning periods and at the beginning of the agricultural cycle. The third mask is Mossi. The art of these people is mostly limited to masks, which show a strong influence from the Dogon who live just to the north. The headpiece as a whole is semi-cylindrical; the face is a concave oval 157</page><page sequence="3">painted white, with a verticle comb-like ridge down the center. From the back rises a tall plank carved with geometric patterns, and symmetrical slits. Traces of red and white paint remain. The finial is now a separate piece laced onto the top. Judging from the pattern, about an inch is missing from the original height. The jagged edges of the break must have been smoothed down to effect the repair. A female figure, independently carved, has been attached to the headpiece. The feet are set into two roughly shaped holes in the top of the mask and appear to be wedged with a bit of cloth and mud. This figure is secured by a twisted piece of iron which makes a loop underneath and sticks up out of each foot. There is another short piece of iron set into the top of the face ridge. The figure has slightly flexed legs and arms, a long neck and a crest on the head. Tattoo marks are indicated by rows of small indented squares filled with white pigment. The style is very like the Dogon and is typical of Mossi ancestor figures. It is possible that this mask was modified at some time during its use. There are several indications that this might be the case. The style of the headpiece and plank conform closely to that of a Karanga mask, except for the lack of antelope horns. Another type, the Karaneda mask, consists of a face (either with or without horns) surmounted by a female ancestor figure. This type, however, usually has a differently shaped plank or none at all, and the figure is carved as a single piece with the rest of the mask. Therefore, the Museum's mask may have been originally a Karanga. One or both horns might have been broken off at the same time that the top was damaged. At that point perhaps the horn bases were hollowed out and an ancestor figure attached in order to keep the mask in use but now as a Karaneda. Certainly it seems to have had long and hard usage. Both types of masks are made by the Wango Society. Young men wear them when dancing at the funerals of tribal chiefs or respected elders. At other times they are worn while the men keep guard over the ripening fruit. It is important to keep in mind that African Art is functional and mobile. The masks are just one element in a complex of music, ceremony, dance and costume. The wearer ceases to be human and becomes a supernatural being incarnating the spirit of the mask. In this way he can manipulate the forces of nature for the good of the community and protect the village from danger. In Upper Volta the head of the Mask Society is one of the governing authorities of the village, along with the religious headman and the official chief. It is his responsibility to organize dances and ceremonies in the public interest. In contrast to the many secret societies, members of the Mask Society are known. The masks are commonly used during funerals, at agricultural fests and initiation rites, and for exorcising evil spirits. They are respected as sacred objects. These additions to the Museum's collection are now on display in the African galleries. RJG 158</page></plain_text>
