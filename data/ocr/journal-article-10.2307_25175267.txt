Design: Incidence data of hip fracture from the general population were combined with the bone density distribution in a sample from the same population and with a risk estimate of low bone density known from literature. Setting: The Netherlands. Subjects: All people with a hospital admission for a hip fracture in 1993, and bone density measured in a sample of 5814 men and women aged 55 years and over in a district of Rotterdam. Main outcome measure: One year cumulative risk of hip fracture by age, sex, and bone density measured at the femoral neck. Results: A quarter of all hip fractures occurred in men. Men reached the same incidence as women at five years older. Controlled for age, the risk of hip fracture by bone density was similar in men and women. The risk of hip fracture increased 13-fold from age 60 to 80; decrease in bone density associated with age contributed 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.5 to 2.4) in women and 1.6 (1.3 to 1.8) in men. Conclusions: The risk of hip fracture by age and bone density is similar in men and women. The decrease in bone density associated with age makes a limited contribution to the exponential increase of the risk of hip fracture with age. Introduction The number of people with fracture of the hip is increasing rapidly and by the year 2050 may exceed 6 million a year worldwide, up from 1.6 million in 1990.1 The aging of the population is the most important rea son for this increase. In addition, the age specific incidence of hip fractures has also increased in several countries, including the Netherlands.12 Hip fractures are a major cause of mortality and disability in elderly people and an important burden for the health services in many countries.3 As most hip fractures occur in women, most atten tion has focused on bone loss in women, predomi nantly around the menopause. Less is known about the relation of hip fractures with bone loss later in life, and the high incidence of hip fracture in older men is largely neglected.4 Detailed quantitive knowledge about the effect of age and bone density on the absolute risk of hip fracture is necessary to evaluate the potential benefit of interventions aimed exclusively at bone density. The association of low bone mass with an increased risk of hip fracture is well documented.5 The strong increase of risk with age and the bone loss associated with age are also evident,6 but the effect of both determinants together is poorly understood. This information could be obtained directly from follow up studies, but the numbers and time required make those studies difficult to accomplish. Combination of data can, how ever, lead to indirect estimates of the absolute risk comparable with the approach used previously to esti mate the lifetime risk of hip fracture.7 In the present study we combined cross sectional data on bone mineral density from a population based sample of elderly men and women living independ entiy with incidence data on hip fracture from a national registry in the Netherlands. In combination with data from the literature, this allowed us to estimate the effect of age and bone density on the risk of hip fracture in men and women. Methods Distribution of bone mineral density The Rotterdam study, started in 1991, is a prospective follow up study of the occurrence and determinants of disease and disability in elderly people. The design of this study has been described.8 The study focuses on four primary topics of research: neurogeriatric diseases, cardiovascular diseases, locomotor diseases, and ophthalmological diseases. All 10 275 men and women aged 55 and over living in a district of Rotter dam were invited to participate. The study was approved by the appropriate medical ethics committee, and participants provided written informed consent. From those eligible, 7983 partici pated, bringing the overall response rate of this study to 78%. The baseline survey included an initial home inter view followed by two visits to the research centre for a series of clinical examinations and laboratory assess ments. Those baseline assessments included dual energy x ray absorptiometry scans of the femoral neck. Methods of measuring bone mineral density and data on bone density in a subsample of 1762 subjects have been reported.9 The present study used the data on femoral neck bone density from the total study population. This site was chosen because of the grow ing consensus that prediction of fractures is best done with site specific measurements.3 People in nursing homes (11%) did not visit the research centre and thus were not eligible for bone density measurements. We present the results for men and women separately, using the age on the day of the bone density measurement. The bone density distribution by age and sex is presented in 5 year age classes; additionally it was analysed continuously by linear regression. This regression model was extended with quadi~atic and cubic terms to detect a possible non-linear association between age and bone density. As obesity is well known to affect bone density,910 and as in this study body mass index seemed to be related to age, it was added to the regression model as a potential confounder. The results are presented with 95% confidence intervals.

In the Netherlands virtually all patients with a hip fracture are treated clinically. Therefore, hospital data give accurate information about the incidence of hip fractures. Data for hip fractures in 1993 (International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9) code 820xx) were collected from the detailed SIG hospital registration data. They were combined with Dutch demographic data for 1993 from the Dutch Central Bureau for Statistics.12 The data were aggregated in one year age classes and a best fitting function estimated with the SPSS curve fitting facility.13 Probability of hip fracture The relative risk for hip fractures, expressed as relative risk per SD decrease in bone density measured at the femoral neck, was estimated by Cummings et al to be 2.6 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 3.6) in women.14 Combining this relative risk with data on incidence and bone density made it possible to estimate the probabilities of hip fracture by age, sex, and bone den sity. The mathematical details are given in the appendix. We used the same relative risk estimate for men. We also estimated the isolated effects of aging and decline in bone density related to age and calculated confidence intervals for these separate effects by using the 95% confidence intervals of the relative risk per SD decrease in bone density. Results Distribution of bone mineral density Table 1 shows the overall characteristics of the study population. From the 7086 people eligible, bone density data were obtained for 5814 (82%). This response rate remained above 70% up to the age of 85 years; in people aged over 85 the response dropped to 54%. Men were slightly younger than women (mean 67.6 (SD 7.6) years v 68.5 (8.3) years). The age at menopause was the same in all age groups (48.9 (5.2) years). The bone density values, stratified by age and sex, were normally distributed, and the SD was almost con stant over the age categories. Bone denisty declined linearly, and introducing quadratic and cubic terms did not improve the model. The apparent decrease in bone density at the femoral neck was 0.0046 (95% confidence interval 0.0040 to 0.0051) g/cm2/year for women and 0.0031 (0.0024 to 0.0038) g/cmVyear for men. Correction for body mass index changed those values only slighdy (0.0050 g/cm2/year for women and 0.0028 g/cmVyear for men). Distribution of hip fractures In the Netherlands in 1993 there were 15107 registered hospital admissions for hip fractures in a population of 15 million, a quarter of which occurred in men. The one year incidence of hip fracture (per 100 000) increased from around 40 at age 55-59 to about 3150 over age 95 in men and from around 40 to about 4450 in women. In each age group, the incidence of hip fracture in men was equivalent to that in women approximately five years younger. Figure 1 shows the one year cumulative incidence of hip fractures by age and sex with the fitted curves; details of these functions are given in appendix B. Probability of hip fracture From the preceding results we estimated the probabil ity of hip fracture by age, sex, and bone density (appen dix B). Figure 2 represents the association of the incidence of hip fracture with bone density at the femoral neck for different ages in men and women. Comparing an 80 year old woman with average bone density with a 60 year old woman, we found a relative risk for hip fracture of 13.6. When we separated the effects, age contributed 7.1 (5.7 to 8.8) to this relative risk, and age related decline in bone density contributed 1.9 (1.5 to 2.4). For men the relative risk was 12.7; the contribution of age was 8.2 (7.1 to 9.5) and of age related decline in bone density was 1.6 (1.3 to 1.8). The magnitude of the relative risk per SD change in bone density affected the slope of the risk function (fig 3), which shows the curves for the central estimate | 45oo ^^^m^^^^^^mm^^^^^mmmm ? 3500 B|j^ 3 300Q -j^gggS | 2500 ^ss^ff^fm^^^mmmmsi^^^^^SBk ? pnnn IBB '? 1500 ^B^^^BB^^K^^^jKK^BK^^ 5 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 Age (years) Fig 1 One year cumulative incidence of hip fracture per 100 000 population, Netherlands, 1993 222 BMJ VOLUME 315 26JULY 1997</page><page sequence="3">Papers ? 4000 ihiiiifn~i~niiwiMiiB?|?TiiitrirrrnTrTTnffiMiiTi?Ti?rriiini^wirfnriiTniiinMitf ^ 3000 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^S^^^^^^S^^^^^S ? 2500 ^^^^^^BS^^^^^^^^S^S^^m^^^^^S^^^^^m s 1500 a^gfeBg I 10Q0 ^^ j. 0?1??^ * 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 f emo/a/ neck bone density Fig 2 One year cumulative incidence of hip fracture by femoral neck bone density at ages 60, 70, and 80 in women and men 8 8000 IS ^ 7000 SB^^ | 6000 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ii^^S 1 5000 ^ ? 4000 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^S^^^^m 13000 IIm % 2000 llji^^ * 100? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 1.1 1.2 Femoral neck bone density Fig 3 One year cumulative incidence of hip fracture in men and women aged 80 with a relative risk (per SD decrease of femoral neck bone density) of 2.6 and 95% confidence limits 1.9 and 3.6. For central estimate (2.6) solid and dotted lines overlap (2.6) together with the curves at the lower and upper limits of the 95% confidence interval (1.9 to 3.6). As the incidence of hip fracture specific for age remains con stant the risk of low bone density becomes higher, and the risk of high bone density becomes smaller when we assume a higher relative risk. The opposite happens at the lower confidence limit Discussion After the age of 60 the incidence of hip fracture is con sistendy lower in men than in women of the same age. Men have about the same risk of hip fracture five years later than women. Though the age related decline in bone density is larger in women, the risk of hip fracture when age and bone density are considered together is remarkably similar in men and women. The five year difference in the age specific incidence of hip fracture between men and women can, in this study, be explained by the different bone density distributions at those ages. Though the risk for hip fracture increased 13-fold from age 60 to age 80 in both men and women, the age related decline in bone density explained merely a doubling of this risk. The rest of the increased risk is explained by other determinants of risk that have been accounted for by using age as a surrogate and that are approximately equal in men and women. Previous research identified several skeletal and extraskeletal determinants.15 Though bone density is not the main component of the increased risk of hip fracture in old age, risk would be substantially reduced if the age asso ciated decline in bone density between the ages 60 and 80 could be excluded: a 36% reduction in men and 48% in women. Recent clinical trials indicate that part of this risk reduction might be achievable.1617 Assumptions The stronger effect of age on risk of fracture in general and of hip fracture in particular has been observed in women,18 but previous studies were based on relatively small numbers of fractures. Our design allowed us to use the information from more than 15 000 hip fractures in the analysis. The data presented here, how ever, were derived from several sources, which involves some assumptions that need to be examined. We assumed that the distribution of femoral neck bone density in the Netherlands corresponds to the distribu tion in this study. Even though our sample was popula tion based, it could have been influenced by selection bias: healthy people could have been overrepresented. The high response rates indicate that this effect was probably small. More importandy, the sample included only people who were living independendy. The more frail patients in nursing homes, presumably with lower average bone density, were excluded, resulting in an underestimation of the age associated decline of bone density. Fewer than 9% of elderly people aged under 80 were in nurs ing homes, but this proportion rose gready at higher ages. This means that the validity of the data seems assured up to the age of 80, but that the effect of the age associated decline in bone density will probably be somewhat higher than estimated in the older age categories. The age associated decline in bone density that we found was of the same magnitude as in other cross sectional, population based studies, although the absolute levels are slighdy higher.19 21 Finally, cohort effects cannot be excluded as the bone density data used in this study are cross sectional. If present, these cohort effects would affect the estimated rate of bone loss but not the risk function. Other risk indicators In the analysis, age was used as a surrogate marker for several risk indicators, including propensity to fall, types of fall, muscle strength, and bone quality. We used the distribution of bone density and the age related decline in bone density without correction for height, weight, or for the age at menopause as we were interested in the combined effect of these determi nants. Moreover, the confounding effect of body mass index was small, and in women the age at menopause was unrelated to age at fracture. Choice of relative risks We assumed the relative risk of 2.6 per SD to be the same at all ages, and we also assumed this relative risk applies to the Netherlands. This relative risk estimate influences the slope of the association between incidence of hip fracture and bone density but it does not alter the level of those curves, as is clear from figure 3. It could, however, influence the contribution of the age related decline in bone density to the risk of hip fracture. But, even at the upper confidence limit, this merely doubles the risk over 20 years of aging. It was previously shown in women that bone mineral density predicted fractures equally well at different ages up to the age of 80.22 Additionally, in a recent meta-analysis the relative risk estimate remained at 2.6 while the con fidence interval narrowed slighdy (2.0 to 3.5).5 This same study also indicated that the estimates of relative BMJ VOLUME 315 26JULY 1997 223</page><page sequence="4">Papers Key messages The risk of hip fracture increases exponentially with age in both men and women Men have about the same risk of hip fracture five years later than women The risk of hip fracture by age and bone density is similar in men and women The difference in age specific incidence is explained completely by the different bone density in men and women The contribution of decline in bone density to [ the exponential increase in risk of hip fracture with age is relatively small risk for different measurement and fracture sites seem to be comparable in different parts of the world. As no relative risk based on large samples was available for men we assumed the same relative risk in men and women, as others have suggested2324 and as was confirmed in a recent follow up study of bone den sity measurements in 752 men in Australia.25 That study estimated the relative risk for hip fractures per SD lower bone density at the femoral neck at 2.9 (1.7 to 5.0). This seems compatible with our a priori assump tion of no difference. When we applied this point esti mate of 2.9 the results changed only slighdy; the contribution of aging (age 60 to age 80) became 7.8 (6.1 to 10) and that of bone density decline 1.6 (1.3 to 2.1), supporting our conclusions. Conclusions The risk of hip fracture, when expressed as a function of bone density and age, is remarkably similar in men and women, and the difference in age specific incidence of hip fracture can be explained completely by the different distribution of bone density in men and women. Our results also show that the contribu tion of age associated decrease in bone density to the exponential increase of the risk of hip fracture with age is limited.

Appendix A To obtain the incidence of hip fracture specific for age, sex, and bone mineral density (BMD) we combined the BMD distribution in this population based sample, the observed incidence of hip fracture specific for age and sex in the Netherlands, and the relative risk for hip fractures per SD decrease in the femoral neck bone density as described by Cummings et al.14 When we assume a constant relative risk per SD decrease of BMD, the age, sex and BMD specific incidence for hip fractures is given by: Page,sex,BMD Page,sex ' a \-V where page,sex denotes the incidence for people with mean BMD for that age and sex, where a is the relative risk per SD decrease in BMD, and where z is the BMD difference from the age and sex specific mean BMD expressed in SDs. The distribution of hip fractures by BMD in people of the same age and sex will then be given by the product of the risk of hip fracture specific for BMD given above and the BMD dis tribution in this same population, which we know is normal. The distribution of cases is therefore given by: f (z) = _J_.

In all other cases C is larger than 1. When a = 2.6, as is the central estimate in this article, the correction factor C equals 1.578541. (At the lower confi dence limit (1.9) the correction factor is 1.228739 and at the upper limit (3.6) it is 2.271399.)

(Accepted 25 April 1997) When I use a word... Oe no! ^s chairman of examiners in last year's preclinical examinations I was responsible for drafting the examiners' report. I circulated the first draft to my coexaminers. One of them asked me to change "fetus" to "foetus." Fetus derives from the Latin word feto, I breed, but the spelling "foetus" has been around since at least the beginning of the seventh century. St Isidore, Archbishop of Seville, in a section entitled "De homine et partibus eius" in his Originum sive etymologiarum libri (Books of Origins or Etymologies), commonly known as the Etymologiae (published in about 620 AD), incorrectiy wrote that it was derived fromfoveo, I keep warm: "Foetus autem nominatus, quod adhuc in utero foveatur" (XI, 1, 144). The earliest English language citation in the Oxford English Dictionary (from 1398) uses the spelling "fetus," and it is not until 1594 that "foetus" is first recorded: "the Foetus of the Latines, and Embryon of the Greekes" (T B la Primaud). All this confused Samuel Johnson. In his dictionary he defined fetus as "Any animal in embryo" and foetus as "The child in the womb after it is perfectly formed; but before, it is called embryo." Spelling does not, however, always accord with etymology, and it is wrong to be prescriptive. I prefer "fetus," but was prepared to capitulate if "foetus" was more commonly used. I therefore searched my computerised database of world bioscience literature since 1966. The results are shown in the table as percentage occurrences of the spelling "fetus" in the titles and abstracts of nearly 25 000 publications containing the word fetus or foetus. Currently world wide "fetus" is used in 92% of publications, but there are regional variations. Not surprisingly, the figure is close to 100% in United States publications. In contrast, in English language titles and abstracts of non-English language publications the overall current figure is considerably lower (81%) and has been falling since 1966. In Britain, however, and in English language publications elsewhere it is currently as high as 90%, having in both cases increased significantly since 1966-82. The striking increase in the use of "fetus" in Britain since 1966 is masked by the summary data. From about 1974 the frequency increased linearly to its current level, which it reached in 1985. But before that it was 67% in 1972-4, 42% in 1969-71, and only 17% in 1966-8. On the other hand, perhaps this rapid rise since the late 1960s is not so surprising?in October 1969 the BMJ first started to use "fetus" as its preferred spelling. Jeff Aronson, clinical pharmacologist, Oxford We welcome filler articles of up to 600 words such as A memorable patient, A paper that changed my practice, My most unfortunate mistake, or any other piece conveying instruction, pathos, or humour. If possible the article should be supplied on a disk.
