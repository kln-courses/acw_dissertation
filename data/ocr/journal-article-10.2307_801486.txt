<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ENGLISH JOURNAL VOLUME III MARCH 1914 NUMBER 3 ON THE PARTS OF SPEECH: THE NOUN' JACOB ZEITLIN University of Illinois The attempt to distinguish definitely between the parts of speech has been emphatically declared impracticable. The variety of considerations which determine our notion of any part of speech, and their complication, make it apparently impossible to mark the boundaries between one category and another. There are notions of meaning, notions of function, and notions of form which enter into our understanding of any given word, and which seem to baffle all efforts at description by means of a single convenient tag-word. The difficulty is obviously increased by the tendency to use the same terms for languages which differ in their formal type. In the process of assimilating the facts of one language to a rigid scheme which has been elaborated for the conditions of a quite different one, 1 This article was written some time before the publication of the Report of the Joint Committee on Grammatical Nomenclature. I find myself in almost entire accord with the views of the committee, and it is to be hoped that their recommenda- tions will receive the support of all teachers of grammar. The recommendations, wherever they are connected with the subject of the present paper, are either gratify- ingly in harmony or, at the least, not in conflict with the views which are here advanced. Such is the fundamental recommendation " that words be never dealt with as isolated units, but always in sentences. .... In accordance with sound modern tendencies in teaching, the first process in grammatical analysis should be to deal with sentences as a whole" (p. 13), or their recommendation that "attention be directed to the function of a given noun in the sentence rather than to its case-classification" (p. 14). To define any of the parts of speech, either loosely or systematically, no attempt is made in the Report, and therefore the following paper may claim in a manner to supplement for the scientific student of grammar, if not for the practical use of the classroom, the excellent suggestions offered by the Joint Committee. 137</page><page sequence="2">138 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL the rough resemblances are the only ones which are regarded; the very important, if not always obvious, distinctions are slurred over. English grammars, for example, write about the gerund and supine exactly as if the English language had forms corresponding to those of Latin bearing the same names. Or they set down rules for participial concord in strict conformity to the rules of Latin gram- mar, disregarding the differences which are felt in the syntactical relationships of the English forms in -ing owing to their lack of inflection. Into the detailed illustration of these matters the writer cannot enter at the present, but he hopes on another occasion to define his meaning more fully. Another important obstacle in the way of a clearer terminology is our attachment to dictionary descriptions of words. If a word is marked noun or adjective in the dictionary, its class name remains forever stamped upon it, and its use in every concrete sentence must be interpreted to conform to this preordained designation. But modern linguistic study has come to understand that reality in speech is represented by the sentence, and that the separate words as arranged in the dictionary are only arbitrary, even if convenient, abstractions. The perception of the fallacy which lurks in the older standpoint has from time to time encouraged persons to examine the validity of the old definitions and to attempt a restate- ment. In his recent book called Grammar and Thinking, Mr. Sheffield has confronted the problem boldly. "No scheme for parsing," he says, "will escape confusion, that does not take one ground of distinction at a time, and classify the word, not as some- thing detached and absolute, but as it stands in the context."' The fundamental ground for distinguishing the parts of speech in the modern languages is, according to Mr. Sheffield, their function in the sentence. But in the course of his discussion he finds it necessary to depart from any such consistent application of the familiar terms. Of the noun, for example, he says that its typical use is that of subject, but that it may also be used predicatively, attributively, and adverbially. Furthermore, he repeatedly makes use of the expressions "noun-meaning," "noun-form," and "noun- function." The inference from all this is quite clear, and Mr. Sheffield himself does not hesitate to draw it. "It is evident," he P. go90.</page><page sequence="3">ON THE PARTS OF SPEECH: THE NOUN 139 writes, " that no term really makes out what part of speech a word is without telling us what categories under each of these three headings it answers to. The term, that is, should show three elements, each designating a category respectively of content, of function, and of form."' The result then of Mr. Sheffield's attempt at simplification is an admission of the inadequacy of our present resources to describe the parts of speech at all. And Mr. Sheffield's attempt was not the first to meet with failure. Many years ago, the late Professor Sweet made the declaration that the only satisfactory definition of a part of speech must be a purely formal one: "snow," for instance, is not a noun because it stands for a thing, but because it can stand as the subject of a proposition, because it can form its plural by adding s, because it has a definite prefix, etc., and "whiteness" is a noun for precisely the same reason. By using the technical terms "noun," etc., in a purely formal sense, and distinguishing words according to their meaning as thing-words, attribute-words, etc., we shall be able to escape the hopeless confusion into which grammarians fall, who appeal alternately to the meaning and the form of the parts of speech in grammatical discussions.2 In the very act of explaining himself, Sweet fell into the same con- fusion which he criticized. Asserting that form is to be the only criterion, he nevertheless defines a noun as something that "can stand as the subject of a proposition," and thereby admits the implication of function in a noun. This, furthermore, leads him necessarily to limit the application of the term "noun" to the nominative case, the oblique cases becoming, according to this view, either adjectival or adverbial. But this would scarcely make a satisfactory classification for languages in which there remains only the slightest vestige, or none at all, of a formal oblique case. What Sweet's description really implies for the modern languages is that the noun, when it is not the subject, may be used as adjective or adverb, and so he has completely failed in the application of the moral which he stated so sharply. To some persons the failures which we have recorded may be convincing proof of the impossibility of establishing a simple criterion for the parts of speech. But if we do nothing more than x See Gertrude Buck, "Some Preliminary Considerations in Planning the Revision of Grammatical Terminology," English Journal, January, 1913.

If, for example, we consider the descrip- tion of the noun, the point that first strikes us is that it is possible to make legitimate use of such expressions as "adjectival noun" or "adverbial noun" to mean a word which at the same time is both noun and adjective or noun and adverb. If "noun," "adjective," "adverb" were the result of a systematic classification of speech into homogeneous elements, such a term as "adverbial noun," would be absurd and would on its very face carry a denial of the classification. Apparently the ideas implied in these names are not exclusive of one another, that is, they belong to different orders of classification. To divide all words into nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs is like dividing the human race into men, women, and Chinese. A casual reference to the history of the names will dis- close the ambiguity that lies concealed in our use of them. The Greek grammarians from whom we inherit our terminology distin- guished the noun by its form, and as its form did not in any wise differ from that of the adjective, it did not even occur to them to recognize the latter as a part of speech. It was the Roman gram- marian who invented the name adjectivum, which, however, he first employed to limit the term nomen. A nomen adjectivum was there- fore regarded only as a noun employed in a definite function-at- tributively or predicatively. To the Roman the adjective would, as far as its form was concerned, still remain a noun, but it would suggest the additional criterion of function; it would in fact not be strictly recognizable outside of a sentence. It is easy to see why in modern English, where the adjective has lost all its external dis- tinction of form, its significance should be limited to the designation of function. We may now pursue this hint and endeavor to ascertain whether the criterion of form which in the classical languages marked the difference between noun-adjective and other parts of speech, may not in modern English be strictly applied to distinguish the noun from all the other categories. But before we try to establish the criterion of form for identifying a noun, it will be proper to point out why meaning, or content, and function are unsatisfactory</page><page sequence="5">ON THE PARTS OF SPEECH: THE NOUN 141 notions to import into the definition. The meaning enters so per- sistently into our conception of the noun that we commonly use the term "substantive"' as its equivalent. Names are primarily attached to manifestations felt as having a substantive existence, but as speech is helplessly anthropomorphic, qualities and occur- rences may be treated as having the same kind of outward existence and manifestation as do the objects that are present to the five senses. When we say, "Vice produces misery," we use the same grammatical form as in saying, "The bee produces honey." A name for a quality when it is thus personified or objectified natu- rally tends to assume the form which is, or originally was, appro- priate to words of substantive content; and this is what makes it a noun. And not only its form, but its psychological value also undergoes a change. If this quality has an independent active existence ascribed to it, it becomes inevitably associated in our minds with words which have the value of reality, and it is conceived of as having similar power. It is this inevitable psychological process that affords the basis for Van Ginneken's discrimination between noun and adjective as words having a real and potential value respectively.' But whatever may be the psychological value of this distinction, logically a word of quality remains a word of quality and is not changed into a substantive. The point strikes us much more forcibly when we observe certain remote languages which habitually express qualities by means of nouns. A typical sentence of a certain North American dialect is literally translated, "The woman's smallness puts the eggs into the emptiness of the basket,"3 a mode of expression which finds a close parallel in such familiar constructions of our own as "he sailed the expanse of the sea," "the height of the mountain was insurmountable." The difference between our usage and that of the Indian dialect is that with us the expression is a variant employed toward a specific stylistic end, in Chinook it is the normal construction. But both ' It should be noted that "substantive" is employed in the Report of the Joint Committee to denote function rather than form or meaning: "When any part of speech other than a noun or pronoun has a case-construction in the sentence, it is to be called a substantive" (p. 7). 2 Principes de linguistique psyckologique, pp. 85-88. 3 Boas, Handbook of American Indian Languages, pp. 657-58.</page><page sequence="6">142 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL languages retain a clear distinction between "thing-words" and " quality words," to use Sweet's terms, though they may use the same part of speech to denote both. If these examples indicate that noun embraces other than substantive words, it is on the other hand even more obvious that other words than nouns may have substantive meaning. The statement made by Hermann Paul in this connection does not hold strictly. "The change of noun to adjective," says Paul, "involves the abstraction of some element from the complex which constitutes the noun, completely elimi- nating the idea of substance and leaving behind only the notion of some quality belonging to the substance."' But this cannot apply to adjectives of material like "wooden," "woolen," which clearly retain all of their substantive value. If it is easy to see that noun does not correspond in meaning to substantive, it is even easier to see that the noun cannot be limited to any one syntactical function. We have been told that its typical use is that of subject, that its use as object, for example, is only a kind of inversion of the subject use. But even if we should consent to this juggle, we should still leave unaccounted for the attributive use of the noun in the possessive case and its use in prepositional phrases, not to speak of such constructions as "to go one's way," "to travel an hour," and even freer adverbial uses. There is prac- tically no syntactical function which a noun cannot serve-subject, predicate, attribute, and adverb. Obviously, therefore, we cannot enlist the criterion of function to aid us in a definition of the noun. This should be enough to show why it is desirable to seek in the form a test by which to distinguish the noun from other parts of speech. And in English the noun does still possess certain formal characteristics which attach to no other class of words. These are the prefixing of an article or demonstrative, the use of an inflec- tional sign to denote possession and plurality, and union with prepositions to mark relations originally indicated by inflectional endings. The presence of any of these features is sufficient to fix the class to which a word belongs. In this view there will be no doubt as to the interpretation of the italicized words in "the evil that men do," and "have their palates both for sweet and sour." ' Prinzipien der Sprachgeschichte, ? 250.</page><page sequence="7">ON THE PARTS OF SPEECH: THE NOUN 143 Inflectional endings are obviously enough formal features of a word, but it may seem arbitrary to designate articles and prepositions in the same way on account of their detachable character. In includ- ing the article, indeed, we hesitatingly follow the practice of other writers, hesitatingly because the article has a detachable meaning as well as a detachable form and cannot be distinguished with strict logic from other demonstratives or adjectives in general. Preposi- tions, on the other hand, are much more clearly a part of the word with which they are used. The fact that the same words have absolute meanings when they are used adverbially misleads us into the belief that they preserve an absolute meaning under all circum- stances. In their combination with nouns the prepositions tend to vagueness, to borrow their meaning from the context, or to have no significance at all apart from that of joining two words. The multiplicity of meanings and uses listed under the prepositions in our dictionaries and grammars is sufficient proof of this vagueness. In a much stricter sense than we usually think, these words con- stitute case-prefixes, which are often as nakedly stripped of their primary force as were the old inflectional endings whose places they have taken. But though our test be accepted on its positive side, we are not in a position to maintain that the absence of all the features which we enumerated excludes a word from the class of nouns. Abstract words, for example, and words referring to qualities, do not in English take possessive or plural inflection, nor do they require an article unless their meaning is specialized and made concrete. "Justice," "virtue," "mercy," "faith" are nouns, though they have no formal mark. But each of these words is, in any of its gram- matical uses, susceptible of some one of the formal modifications referred to, as "the peace of the world," "the mercies of heaven." It is by analogy to such unlimited uses as "love virtue," "perform justice," that English developed the expressions "do good," "shun evil," in which "good" and "evil" are susceptible of exactly the same treatment as are all other nouns: e.g., "do the good that is in you," "avoid the evils of corruption." In formulating our definition of the noun we should therefore have to describe it as a word which has, or in any given usage may have, certain formal signs already</page><page sequence="8">144 THE ENGLISH JOURNAL mentioned. The modifying clause, "or in any given usage may have," is of course of the greatest importance. Although it might seem to compromise the definition, in reality it endows it with its chief value. It calls attention to the fact that a word is to be classified in accordance with its use in a specific sentence. All that the phrase suggests is that when none of the external characteristics of the noun is in evidence, the test may be applied by an expansion of the construction which shall not disturb the relation of its parts. But there are words which ordinarily pass as nouns and which are quite incapable of such expansion, viz., "steel mill," "violet bed," "cannon ball," "stone house," "brick pavement." What are we to do with the first in each of these combinations of nouns ? We cannot attach any inflection to them nor construe them with the article or preposition. The difficulty which they present is, however, more apparent than real. These combinations of nouns may be divided into two classes. (a) To the first belong examples like "steel mill," "violet bed," "cannon ball," which, despite our method of writing them, are single words. To prove this we need only to apply the very simple test of stress. An attributive word in English receives subordinate stress (compare "gold sp6on" with "g61d mine"), so that whenever we have a combination of nouns with the principal stress on the first, we are dealing not with an attributive plus a head-word, but with a single noun composed of two elements. (b) There remains then the other class of combina- tions, exemplified by "stone houise," "brick pavement," "linen dr6ss," in which the first word receives a subordinate stress and therefore does not differ from other attributives. These are all words of material, and originally they all had the adjective termina- tion -en. Provincial usage still preserves the old adjective forms in words like "bricken," "tinnen," "stonen," etc., but in the literary language only "wooden" and "woolen" have been retained.' The change in literary English from forms like "bricken" to "brick" began in the sixteenth century and is described in the New English Dictionary as a tendency to discard the adjective for the attributive TIn "linen" (from lin+en), the preservation of the old adjective form has not prevented its becoming associated with words whose phonetic form was leveled to that of the noun.</page><page sequence="9">ON THE PARTS OF SPEECH: THE NOUN 145 use of the substantive. But may not the change be explained on purely phonetic grounds as a manifestation of the same tendency which is responsible for the loss of -en in verbs and for the change of "even" to "eve," of "maiden" to "maid"? This seems less arbitrary than to assume the substitution of one class of words for another, and at the same time it enables us to understand the only apparent exception to our rule. It should of course be noted that the distinctive adjective suffix is still preserved in many words, but with a specialized sense. The forms "golden," "brazen," "flaxen" are not used now to denote the material, but some one quality characteristic of the material, or an idea metaphorically derived from it. But after all, "gold" in "gold spoon" is no less an adjective than "golden" in "golden hair." There has merely taken place a differentiation of meaning corresponding to the differentiation of phonetic form. Grammatically, there has been no change at all. We cannot be so rash as to assume that every possible objection has occurred to our notice. Those that have presented themselves we have tried to grapple with honestly, and they merely confirmed us in our view that the noun, though it has certain associations of meaning and of psychological value, must be and can be absolutely recognized only by means of specific formal characteristics which can be associated with no other part of speech.</page></plain_text>
