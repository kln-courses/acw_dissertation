<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Puzzling Scene from Val Camonica. By Emmanuel Anati, M.A., D.Lit., Institut de Pale'ontologie Humaine, J4 Paris. With a textfigure During the fourth campaign at Val Camonica in the summer of I958 we came across the rock carving repro- duced here. It shows a phallic figure, carrying in his arms a child or an anthropomorphic figure, and standing in front of a sign which has the form of an oval face or idol. The scene is completed by a couple of animals whose precise identification cannot be defined. One of them is obviously of the male sex and seems to approach the other for the sexual act. Stylistically this scene belongs to the transitional phase between styles III and IV. If our dating is correct, this phase should belong to the very end of the second and the beginning of the first millennium B.C. The present scene should therefore be con- temporary with the Urnfield culture of Central Europe or with an early phase of Hallstatt. The interpretation of this scene has caused some discussion among the members of the Camonica expedition, but we still remain without a definite solution. Some of our members are in favour of a fertility-cult significance, others prefer to see in it the representation of a phase of an initiation rite. However, the details FIG. I. THE PROBLEM PICTURE AT VAL CAMONICA of the scene and their raison d'etre have not yet found a valid explanation. The subject matter of this scene is unique, as far as I know, not only in Val Camonica, but in the prehistoric and proto-historic figurative art ofEurope as a whole. I should be grateful to archaeologists and anthropologists who have constructive suggestions for the solution to this riddle.</page></plain_text>
