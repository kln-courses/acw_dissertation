<plain_text><page sequence="1">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer The Power Of Myth And Rabbit Survival In Richard Adams' Watership Down Charles A. Meyer ^LNY serious exploration of meaning in Watership Down must take into account both the power of myth to revitalize and Richard Adams' use of Ronald Lockley's The Private Life of the Rabbit as a source for rabbit realism. Recent criticism on the novel has acknowledged this power in myth. In Watership Down, Edgar Chapman has argued, myth shows the power to guarantee "the survival of intuitive and imaginative man in his conflict with modern technology and industrial civilization." Such a polished dichotomy hints that while some humans are lost because they hear no inner voice, others, because they are intuitive, are delivered from the power of the machine and are thereby elect. Myth both rewards and saves. Now a society top-heavy with technology can make "intui- tive man" feel lonely in his solitary quest for security, but loneli- ness is not the badge solely of the intuitive. Neither are all who are imprisoned by technology incapable of intuitive response or of even hearing the inner voice. The primary rabbit enemy in Watership Down is not "modern technology and industrial civilization" but the rabbit himself. Chapman's assertion, that "rabbit society [is] a metaphor for problems of human survival," also raises serious questions regarding Adams' conception and use of characterization. Ex- clusive of their level of realism, are Adams' rabbits principally figurative devices for representing the concept of humanity, or are they simultaneously full-blooded creatures? This question of metaphor versus realism is not merely casuis- tic. Initially, it makes us wonder why Adams chose rabbits as his literary device for revealing human truths. The popularity and 139</page><page sequence="2">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic obvious appeal of rabbits notwithstanding, other seemingly in- nocent, docile wild creatures, for example, deer, could have served equally well. If, however, Adams learned from Lockley's wild rabbit research that we humans do not have to "go it alone" in this "intuition-for-salvation" business, he could, through fic- tional rabbits, provide us believable, external confirmation that myths can help us survive. If wild rabbits, very much our be- havioral twin, also use their unconscious as a survival strategy, perhaps we should get to know the same power within ourselves. Lockley has taught Adams that humans are not alone in using the "collective unconscious" for species survival. Via fictional rab- bits, Adams has acknowledged a relationship between real-world humans and wild creatures more complex and compelling in the ways of survival than any metaphor could supply. How Adams characterizes his rabbits determines their mean- ing. In A Preface to the Faerie Queene, Graham Hough depicts "naive allegory" and "realism" as opposite narrative techniques. As story nears "naive allegory," the intrinsic value of the image decreases while its role as conveyor of concept increases. In absolute "realism," conversely, image is all, while idea is non- existent. At each pole, we drift out of literature entirely, into moralities or reporting. Midway between the two, Hough sees "Incarnation," narrative technique "in which theme and image are completely fused and the relation between them is only implicit." Via "Incarnation" "'abstract' content is completely absorbed in character and action and completely expressed by them" (107). Adams' rabbits appear to represent this stage of narrative technique. In his fictional rabbits, Adams fuses Lockley's complex wild rabbit animality with the concept of humanity so that neither realism nor concept predominates. Watching Adams' rabbits, therefore, means simultaneously watching a dignified wild animal and ourselves, through much of our psychological, behavioral range. Hazel and company also show that the unintuitive Philis- tines "somewhere out there" are not our major threat. Because we are unwilling to acknowledge our rational and intuitive sides and depend on each as needed, we become our own worst enemy. In Watership Down, Richard Adams announces his indebted- 140</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer ness "to R.M. Lockley's remarkable book The Private Life of the Rabbit." "Anyone," Adams says, "who wishes to know more about the migrations of yearlings, about pressing chin glands, chewing pellets, the effects of overcrowding in warrens, the phenomenon of re-absorption of fertilized embryos, the capacity of buck rabbits to fight stoats, or any other features of Lapine life, should refer to that definitive work." A casual reading of the novel hints that Lockley has anthropomorphized his rabbits by tagging them with human char- acteristics a la Chuck Jones and Beatrix Potter. In Private Life, a dominant buck is a "king" or a "dictator" (61); a run-of-the-mill is a "husband" (41); the doe is a "woman" or a "young wife" ( 61); a burrow becomes a "palace" (61); kittens are "children" (67); a warren is a "society" (100). Adams has used Private Life as a source to make the Water- ship Downers biologically realistic though not anthropomorphic (Late spring to late summer, the novel's time frame and the time of dormant buck libidoes, allows close cooperation among Bigwig et al without fights over does or territory.) Private Life confirms the behavioral realism of General Woundwort's "wide patrols," of the Owsla's superiority in the Sandleford and Efrafan warrens and its easy access to good food and attractive does, and even the wanderlust of adolescent rabbits who, in the wild, feel the "urge to emigrate which assails almost all adolescent animals " {Life, 92). Lockley confirms that wild bucks will battle to the death over territory and will even attack a severely wounded, helpless op- ponent trying to escape his foe. General Woundwort's attack on the Watership Down warren and details of his relentless assault on Bigwig in the burrow become convincing when we see the savagery over does and territory practiced by Daredevil and Diehard, real wild rabbits in Lockley's research: Daredevil hamstrings Diehard with his sharp, powerful incisors, continues to attack him as he tries to crawl off, and lurks to ambush him outside the burrow where he has fled (Life, 75). Yet even this wide-ranging realism does not reveal how deep- ly Lockley's insights have enriched Adams' fiction. In his intro- duction to the revised edition of Private Life, Adams proclaims what Lockley has taught him: "Far from being childlishly cute, 141</page><page sequence="4">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic [wild rabbits] possess ... by nature great courage and resource- fulness within, as it were, the ambit of the limits, strength, and qualities given them by the Creator." They possess "dignity and 'animality' - the quality corresponding to 'humanity' in men and women" (Life, 5). "An animal is an animal and not a sort of human being dressed up" (Life, 5, italics mine). Counter to Chapman's claim that Adams' rabbits satirize the human penchant for aggression (7), Adams perceives rabbits and humans as representing autonomous threads within a weave of animal- ness understandable as much through sociological and psychological similarity as through anatomical and physiological difference. The Private Life of the Rabbit is laced with references to the close connection between wild lapine and human behavior. One is struck by the intimate correspondence Lockley finds between rabbit and person, despite his orthodox scientific approach to research and his distaste for anthropomorphics or sentimentality. He has named rabbits in his research enclosure, "imparting] something of that delightful feeling of intimacy with these char- acters which we enjoyed in the many hours of watching a wild animal endowed with much charm and not a few of those emo- tions and actions common to man himself' (Life, 38). Private Life is filled with illustrations of such emotions and actions. Like many human husbands, Big Boss "behaved . . . loyal[ly] and courteously], even as if he were a little afraid of offending her [his doe]" (Life, 41). Like a human wife, "the [doe] likes to and readily does sleep with her mate throughout the year" (Life, 48). Bertha "exhibited the conservatism and love of established home which proved characteristic in these studies of the mature female rabbit, as it is of many other animals, including man ..." (Life, 49). The range of lapine-human similarity is startling: like humans, wild rabbits can identify individual faces in a crowd, knowing immediately if its owner is male, female friend, enemy, or neutral acquaintance (Life, 68). They are curious about the playing and fighting of others (Life, 69), and sexual voyeurism excites them to indulge their own erotic urges. (Life, 80). Like ourselves, they are gregarious yet not consistently sociable (Life, 142</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer 57). They like their personal "space" (Life, 57) and like much human family life, much of theirs occurs "indoors," for example, underground (Life, 99). Like us, they are occasionally heroic, though they spend much of their lives in mundane eating, sleep- ing, and socializing. Like homo sapiens , the physically weak rabbit is an adept, tenacious survivor in a hostile world. Its fecundity is notorious. In 1974, for example, in a commercial effort on Skokholm Island, Lockley attempted to exterminate wild rabbits so he could raise chinchilla rabbits for profit. He killed off two-thirds of the wild rabbits in year one. In year two, he was able to kill 493 more rabbits that the two-thirds of the population he had killed initially. In a later year, with cyanide gas he killed all but a few hundred of 10,000 rabbits on the island. Today the rabbits are as numerous as ever on Skokholm. A leitmotif in Private Life is the wild rabbit's vulnerability and its capacity for frustrating its enemies. Though it lives in a "world where life is cheap and expendable" (PL, 20) it carefully evaluates its immediate environment for potential danger and opportunis- tically avoids under-or-over-reaction. Tenacity for survival trans- lates into a powerful urge, when danger appears, "to become rigid, ready to escape, to flee, hair raising on the nape of the neck, while [its] shocked, numbed senses presently inform [it] - if [it is] not too terrified to think - of the true nature of the disturbance " (Life, 20). Though these lines seem - and are - credible descriptions of wild rabbit behavior, I have misled you by imply- ing that they are written primarily to characterize wild rabbits. In fact, through them, Lockley characterizes typical human respon- ses that he sees as closely parallel to dangers in the wild rabbit's world. This pervasive identification of rabbits and their behavior with humans and theirs is what Adams has found so meaningful in Private Life. Like us, especially we denizens of inner cities, the rabbits of Lockley's experiment live in a closed environment they cannot control. Like us, they are highly adaptable to the shifting demands of their surroundings. The strong exert their strength to dominate the weak so that life for the strong can become even more satisfactory in times of want or trouble. "To the rich [in the 143</page><page sequence="6">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic rabbit world and our own], shall be given riches, but the poor shall be made poorer" (Life, 79). The male reacts with great hostility to any other male's attempt to usurp his female and will fight to the death for doe or ground. Daredevil's and Diehard's two-day struggle over sex and turf smacks strongly of urban gang-fighting or a barroom brawl. Instead of laying an appliqué of human characteristics onto his rabbits, Lockley has uncovered rich parallel veins of human and rabbit social conduct. Our behaviors are not veneered to their animal nature; they and we behave similarly in a wide range of similar conditions. As Lockley says, in a neat anthropomorphic reversal, "Humans are so rabbit" (PL, 22). If the reader of T he Private Life of the Rabbit wants to draw out the full richness of Lockley's perceptions about rabbits, he must be willing to turn Private Life back upon himself so he can look outward into a mirror, at an image of self, anatomically different but recog- nizable as a distillation of himself psychologically and socially. Lockley's rabbits show us mankind in his "primitive" social state (Life, 57). As we watch Bertha, Diehard, Born Tired, Big Boss, Bold Benjamin, and all the other "characters" in Lockley's communal drama of life, we witness wild rabbit activities and behaviors to which we spontaneously apply values because those values are also our own. We climb inside rabbit brains and perceive the rabbit world through rabbit feelings. This self-examination is essential if Lockley's larger message is to be received: our risks in this world are much like those of the rabbit. We must see rabbit solutions to our mutual difficulties if we are to survive. Wild rabbits, like humans, breed explosively and destroy environment (Life, 112-3). Like Lockley's rabbits on Skokholm Island and in his experiments, "man is rapidly approaching a state of overcrowding in his small world" (Life, 1 13). But wild rabbits possess genetic and instinctual means to regulate their fecundity for species preservation. By resorption - embryo shrivelling and absorption into the mother's system - rabbits practice natural birth control (Life, 112). The process can be triggered by over- crowding, psychological stress, poor food supply, or even adverse weather conditions, and its onset physiologically is probably 144</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer caused by the pituitary or other endocrine glands. Wild bucks respond to sexual instinct, making their warren a Byzantine hierarchic society (Life, 57). In the breeding season, a buck will patrol his turf night, morning and afternoon (Life, 47) attempting to enlarge it by testing the competition (Life, 46) and seeking out challengers to his power. As the dominant male "stalk[s] through his subjects ... all move . . . out of his way, some swiftly and submissively, others slowly and with a hostile raising of the hindquarters. These hostile subjects [are] the older bucks and does . . . second or third or otherwise high in the hierarchy of the royal court. They in turn dominate ... the younger and weaker rabbits around them." In human terms, this instinctive behavior becomes a ritual drama of challenge-deference, suzerainty-obeisance, that keeps the warren strong. On this point, some would argue the rabbit-human parallel breaks down. Supposedly rabbits don't reason, and humans lack instinct. Ways to preserve our species must be rational, for we do not have the luxury of the wild rabbit's instincts. Seemingly, Lockley's animals end up teaching us what we must do and then the ways in which we can't do it. Yet Lockley's research suggests that wild rabbits frequently obey urges which, if not prompted by "reason," are prompted by some incentive suspiciously like it. Like us, they are opportunists, but with a human twist: "they . . . thought with a rabbit's intel- ligence of what they would do next, in any situation .... This 'intelligence' advised them to do pleasant things, to avoid doing unpleasant things" (Life, 67). Bucks do not burrow, apparently because they do not enjoy digging (Life, 52). Bucks enjoy socializ- ing with acquaintances from whom they have been separated (Life, 68). Rabbits "rabbit-watch" apparently from curiosity (Life, 69). A doe disinterested in sex will snap at, strike, or dodge her buck, as though saying "Not now" (Life, 41). For Lockley, the "difference [between human and rabbit brains] is rather in degree than in kind " (Life, 24, italics mine). The allegedly clean line between human reason and animal instinct that supposedly separates us unconditionally from other mammals blurs in the light of such evidence. In Watership Down, Adams questions the rigid claim that 145</page><page sequence="8">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic humans always act by rational choice, that we do not sometimes respond spontaneously to unlearned internal stimulus. In an instructional set-piece he pauses to make the point: [Rabbits] are much the same as primitive people . . . Before such people can act together, a kind of telepathic feeling has to flow through them and ripen to the point when they all know that they are ready to begin. . . [This feeling] . . . fusfes] them together and impelfs] them into action without conscious thought or will . . . [like] the angel which drove the First Crusade into Antioch and drives the lemmings into the sea. (Adams, 15) The same power for collective action is found in wild bucks' ritual to establish a sexual hierarchy, in the urge among primitive humans to create ritual and myth to guarantee their society's continued health, and in fulfillment of religious quest prompted by theophany. Perhaps nature has cheated us by denying us instincts, but it has offered us a satisfactory substitute. Animal instinct and human myth both arise in the collective unconscious of the species. Hazel and company show us that, as real rabbits do, we can sometimes steer toward a safe haven by allowing the breath of our unconscious to touch us and then tacking as it directs. Seeing Dandelion reach into the wild rabbit's collective myth for emotional sustenance means seeing a "primal" us do the same, not some long-departed human ancestor, but our contemporary selves willing to put some of the rationalism that has increasingly dominated western culture since the eighteenth century into its proper place, alongside the unconscious as a part of man's tools for success, not as his tyrant. In Watership Down, our brother the wild rabbit shows us to what degree overly emphasized rationalism has separated us from an important component of our human identity. The risk we face is not primarily from technology or industry. These are mere accidents of rationalism. If we remain convinced that reason equals all that is important in human identity and that only reason can guarantee the welfare of the species, the danger will come from our rational self as detached from our intuitive self. The struggle in Watership Down is not, as Chapman suggests, between "those ruled by the right side of the brain as opposed to those 146</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer ruled by the left . . (7). It is between those who acknowledge the finite usefulness of both the rational and the intuitive ap- proaches to problem-solving and those who do not. Watership Down's opening chapters show that rabbit safety in the novel depends on flexibility of rabbit response. Twice in its history, Sandleford Warren has been in mortal danger: from the earlier myxomatosis epidemic and now, from the threat un- earthed by Fiver's insight. Contradicting the "impulsive behavior of most rabbits," The Threarah acted deliberately and rationally "coolly," "even . . . coldly" during the epidemic, "ruthlessly driv- ing out every rabbit who seemed to be sickening. He had resisted all ideas of mass emigration and enforced complete isolation on the warren, thereby almost certainly saving it from extinction." The Threarah is an atypical rabbit, possessing "level-headedness and a certain self-contained detachment" manifested in "never let[ting] himself become excited by rumor or danger" (10). Yet now his earlier rationality will be lethal. To Fiver's frantic demand that all the rabbits evacuate the warren, The Threarah responds as he did to the earlier danger: "But I should have to consider it carefully indeed" (11). The myxomatosis epidemic occurred incrementally rather than in one sudden blow, allowing time for rational reaction. But Fiver's hysteria foreshadows sud- den peril: "'But there's no time, Threarah, sir ... I can feel the danger like a wire round my neck - like a wire - Hazel, help ! ' He squealed and rolled over in the sand kicking frantically, as a rabbit does in a snare" (11). The Threarah dooms his warren by not admitting the rabbit's two-edged safety mechanism. The great danger to Sandleford Warren from "industrial civilization" is not Adams' principal point. Danger to rabbits real and fictional is endemic and comes from various sources in Watership Down: myxomatosis, a cat, snares, a river, the housing industry, rain, rabbit militarism, darkness, rabbit denial of danger, a dog, a man with a rifle, a wounded sea-bird - the point is that the future housing project is one among many dangers in the rabbit world, many of which are natural, not technological. The real risk to Sandleford is the aged Threarah's inflexible response to current peril. Neither is Fiver a guaranteed savior. Like The Threarah, 147</page><page sequence="10">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic Fiver also is lop-sided in his method of avoiding danger. Like The Threarah, he proposes a correct method once. Had Fiver urged flight during the myxomatosis epidemic, he would have destroyed the warren, just as now The Threarah denies the power of insight and dooms his community. Which response is appropriate under what conditions and at what time? There is no single correct way to respond to danger. The eventual salvation of his flock depends on Hazel's learn- ing to trust reason and intuition when his followers use them in response to danger. At the beginning of Watership Down, he is a brave, earnest rabbit whose personal leadership others will fol- low, yet dimly aware with much to learn. He trusts in Fiver's intuitive power, though Hazel himself has never had a vision. Because he has spent his entire life in a protected warren, he has had no need to explore his inner resources and slowly learns the power of myth and reason to protect. Other rabbits are more attuned to the rational for protection than Hazel is. On the dark forest path just beyond Sandleford, Hazel tries to control near panic in his band via a sensual explora- tion of the unknown, with ambiguous results: "Beyond, the path was the same - empty in the darkening moonlight and leading gently downhill into the deep shadow of a grove of ilex trees." Rational exploration does not allay his "fear and strain"; instead, Dandelion's "Well done . . . Running our risks for us, are you - like El-Ahrairah?" "[is] warm praise and cheer[s] him" (21). The next morning however, when Hazel founders at the seemingly impossible obstacle of the River Enborne, Blackberry rationally perceives the floating piece of wood as a tool, a raft to save Fiver and Pipkin and thus the community intact. Though Dandelion revives the frightened, exhausted little band in the dark woods with myth, getting to the point of telling "The Story of the Blessing of El-Ahrairah" requires that insight and reason collaborate. Without Hazel's flash of insight ("He had an idea") [23]), the myth would not have been told. His insight in turn hangs on Dandelion's earlier reminding him that he embodies El-Ahrairah. Conversely, against all Dandelion's instinct to bolt, Hazel asks him to choose to tell a story, to "[choke] back his own fear of the desolate grassless woodland" (23). If 148</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts Charles A. Meyer Dandelion had not exercised rational discipline against the in- stinct to scatter, he couldn't have told the tale. Intuition and reason together produce the story these rabbits desperately need to support their quest for a meaningful life when the hostile world says they are fundamentally expendable. El-Ahrairah's reason and instinct ally to make him the ar- chetypically indestructable rabbit. Because El-Ahrairah thinks the fox and weasel are coming with Frith to eat him, he instinc- tively burrows. When Frith arrives alone and asks him to come out of the hole to receive Frith's "gift," El-Ahrairah, head-down in the hole, answers, not from instinct but with impudent chutzpah : "If you want to bless me, you can bless my bottom, for it is sticking out of the hole" (25). He does not accept his cosmic victimage, and he fights against it with the only tool now left him: verbal irony. His instinct and intellectual self-discipline together gain him Frith's blessing: "Very well, [says Frith] I will bless your bottom as it sticks out of the hole. Bottom, be strength and warning and speed forever and save the life of your master. . . . Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed" (26). Frith becomes El-Ahrairah's friend "because of his resourcefulness" (26) that is his courage and his flexible use of instinct and wit. The eventual success of the warren on Watership Down depends on the fulfillment of just this promise through one heroic rabbit's emulation of El-Ahrairah's balanced reason and instinct. Bleeding from wounds inflicted by his enemy in a battle fought largely through the instinct to survive, crouched now in a dark run staring at death's shadowy silhouette, Bigwig faces the rabbit enemy of all free rabbits, General Woundwort. Upon the out- come of their Armageddon hangs the fate of rabbit civilization. At the moment when death for Bigwig seems inevitable, Woundwort, like Frith, offers an apparent "gift": "Thlayli, . . . why do you want to throw your life away? I can send one fresh rabbit after another into this run if I choose. You're too good to be killed. Come back to Efrafa. I promise I'll give you the command of any mark you like. I give you my word." Such a "gift" mocks Bigwig's deeply-felt sense of the rabbit's inalienable right to freedom and demands that he accept his 149</page><page sequence="12">The Power of Myth and Rabbit Survival Journal of the Fantastic victimage in the name of safety. His chutzpah is archetypal: "Silflay hraka, u embleer rah" (402). The curse sends Woundwort pushing into Bigwig's chest mightily, inexorably shoving Bigwig backward into the burrow, all the while gaining time so that Woundwort's cuts can bleed enough to smother his breathing, causing him to back off and signalling the beginning of the end of Woundwort's assault. Without El- Ahrairah's instinct and cool rationality as mythic exemplar, Bigwig's submission would lead to the victory of tyranny and darkness across the rabbit world. On the alliance of reason and insight hangs Bigwig's life, the warren's future, and humanity's triumph over forces that would deny us the full use of our selves - rational and insightful - in the struggle to be significant. They leave Sandleford because of Fiver's intuition. They deal with fear in the dark wood through the power of myth realized in a flash of insight. They deal with the lendri (badger) through a conscious strategy of careful retreat. They get across the River Enborne via innate ability to swim and by invention: they use a piece of floating wood creatively as a took, a raft, to save their weaker brethren. Take away any one of these responses, and you have chaos and probable loss of life: returning to Sandleford, going tharn and being eaten by the badger, waiting helplessly for the dog to attack them at the river. Each response is either intuitive or rational, the correct one at the correct time. Works Cited Adams, Richard. Watership Down. NY: Macmillan, 1972. Chapman, Edgar.
