BRIEF NOTICES EVOLUTION THE NEW SYSTEMATICS. Edited by Julian Huxley. Oxford Uni- versity Press, New York; The Clarendon Press, Oxford. $6.oo. 8' x 52; viii + 583; I940. This is a book that systematic biology has been waiting for ever since the doc- trine of evolution received general accept- ance. Previous to that time taxonomic systems were not based on real relation- ships, for no one believed that any real relationship existed. But with the com- ing of evolution the need for a phylo- genetic classification has become obvious. Yet the old time taxonomic systems have been strangely little disturbed by the new light that has been shed on phylogenetic relationships by modern research. One reason for this is the natural reticence of any investigator to set up a system of taxonomy that may have to be discarded next week because another observer has demonstrated a new truth of nature inconsistent with it. In the old days when all systems were equally logical, and the only criterion for value was convenience there was no objection to every systematist having his own peculiar systematics, as the differences among the taxonomies of Linnaeus, Du- vier, and Lamarck testify. Another rea- son is that most modern biologists are specialists in a limited taxonomic field, in which those modifications relied upon for classificatory discrimination appear (to them) much larger than equivalent modifications in other fields. The present work is a symposium by twenty-two European biologists and one American, all of whom endeavor to record their beliefs as to what shall be the guid- ing principles of the new taxonomy. That they consulted each other is clear from the numerous references in each essay to the other essays in the volume, but they have not arrived at any agree- ment among themselves as to what consti- tutes a taxonomic group, or how taxo- nomic groups arrive. For instance, one of the collaborators, Lancelot Hogben, has contributed a very thought-provoking chapter in which, with characteristic iconoclasm, he reproves Darwin for not having named his work "The Origins of Species." The process of speciation comes about as the result of the interaction of numerous factors, and if the combination of factors occurs more than once a species may have a multiple origin. This point is brought up by W. J. Arkell and J. A. Moy-TNhomas who refer to the genus Gryphaea which occurs in the Cretaceous and the Tertiary, in three different horizons which alternate with others in which it is absent. But these authors make it clear that while the genus has thus originated several times it has only had one origin-it is a modified Ostrea, and this latter genus has retained 466</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 467 as a generic characteristic the ability to produce forms resembling Gryphaea even to the present day, for there is a recent Ostrea in the collection of Stanford Uni- versity that no paleontologist would hesitate to assign to Gryphaea if it had been recovered from a Tertiary horizon. The laboratory worker who is privileged to see how variation takes place under controlled conditions is likely to have ideas of his own, and the present reviewer finds it difficult to refrain from interspers- ing his own thoughts into this review. Perhaps that has been one object of the collaborators who have produced the book-to stimulate thought. It is unbe- lievable that any one could read such a work and not emerge from the experience with his mind clarified and stimulated for further research. The ample bibliog- raphies at the end of each chapter are most helpful, as is also the index which covers seventeen pages of fine print. The reviewer finds it impossible to compare the essays in this work on the basis of relative merit. They are all good. About all he feels justified in saying is that he found those by C. Diver and J. R. De Beer the most interesting, that by H. J. Muller the most informative, and that by J. S. L. Gilmour likely to have the widest appeal. But they are all good and well worthy of inclusion in such a symposium. THE MATERIAL BASIS OF EVOLUTION. By Richard Goldschmidt. Yale Univer- sity Press, New Haven; Oxford University Press, London. $5.oo. 9 x 6; xi + 436; I940. The Silliman Foundation at Yale Univer- sity was established for the purpose of organizing an annual course of lectures designed "to illustrate the presence and providence, the wisdom and goodness of God, as manifested in the natural and moral world." It was further directed that each annual course should be made the basis of a volume to form part of the series constituting a memorial to Mrs. Silliman. The present volume is the published form of the I939 Silliman lectures. The first point in the author's discussion of the problem of evolution is an attack on the neo-Darwinian thesis; a thesis which holds to the idea that abrupt changes, or mutations of the hereditary determiners (the genes) are the starting point for evolution; and that the accumu- lation of mutations, their isolation and selection in the new variants-which are themselves capable of transmitting the new characters, as well as of producing new ones by the same process-account for all evolutionary divergencies. Gold- schmidt's criticism of this theory is that it must accept the fact that somehow new genes are formed, since it is unlikely that man and amoeba are connected by mutations of the same original genes. He believes that a sounder thesis of evolu- tion can be based on the combined work- ings of what he has termed micro- and macro-evolution. Micro-evolution within the species is the process of the accumulation, selection, and adaptation of minute (micro) mutations. Micro- evolution produces changes which never transcend the confines of the species, hence the typical products of micro-evolution- the geographic races-can never be con- sidered incipient species. On the other hand, species, genera, families, and the higher categories of classification origi- nate in single macro-evolutionary steps as completely new, genetic systems. The mass of 'well-organized, analyzed and synthesized research work presented in this volume should be an inspiration to any college student, who, by the way, will find here a new and stimulating thesis upon which to build his knowledge of evolution, and one which should be studied carefully in the light of the neo- Darwinian theory, as well as the theory of the gene. The text is beautifully illustrated, com- pletely indexed, and has a bibliography of some 400 titles. MANKIND IN THE MAKING. By M. Cathcart Borer. Frederick Warne and Co., London and New York. $I.50. 74X 5; [6] + I52 + 8 plates; I939. This most interesting volume is an accu-</page><page sequence="3">468 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY rate and fascinating chronicle of the past history of Homo sapiens, written by one who has a knack, not only of being informative, but also of encouraging a desire for further information among his readers. The book starts out with the beginning of things and discusses in order: the ancestors of man, the great ice age and the men of that era, the men who came after the ice age, the old stone age, the middle stone age, and concludes with an exhilarating report on the neolithic period. There is neither an index nor a bibliography, but the book is well illus- trated with beautiful color plates and line drawings. GENETICS MAMMALIAN GENETICS. By William E. Castle. Harvard Univer- sity Press, Cambridge; Oxford University Press, London. $z.oo. 9 x 6. viii + I69 + 40 plates; I940. Mammalian Genetics is intended for use in introductory courses in genetics-prefer- ably the Senior High School or Junior College level. The material of the text is organized in conformity with the more recent and so-called better pedagogical trend of leading from the familiar to the unfamiliar; from the known to the un- known; and from the general to the specific. The idea of inducting college freshmen into genetics via Mammalia (since the freshman himself is a mammal, and pre- sumably will want to know something of his own inheritance as well as that of our domestic animals) is a noble one, but in view of the considerations of time, expense, and simplicity of form, this reviewer still believes that Drosophila provides the best route for elementary work in genetics. Even though a stu- dent has seen more, and is more familiar with rabbits, cows, and mice than Dro- sophila, it is almost a certainty that he will know little or no more of the genetics of the mammals than of Drosophila; and it is equally a certainty that he can learn, by experimentation, the genetics of the latter much more quickly than that of the former. The early chapters of the book present a very elementary treatment of the laws of Mendelian inheritance, linkage, and crossing-over, as demonstrated by the guinea pig, rabbit, rat, and mouse. Drosophila is used to demonstrate sex- linked inheritance. The later chapters deal with the inheritance of blood groups in rabbits and man, and the more common mutations among our domestic animals. A short bibliography is appended to each chapter of the text, an there is a short table of contents and an index. BREEDING AND MANAGEMENT OF LIVE STOCK (Cattle, Horses and Pigs). Together with a Section on Pig Farming. Second Revised Edition. By A. W. G. Lipscomb. Section on Pig Farming written in association with F. Discombe. Whitcombe and Tombs, Well- ington, London, Melbourne and Sydney. 7s. 6d. net. 74 x 5; 362.; I940. The scientific breeding and care of live stock is one answer to the growing de- mand for domestic animal products by the ever-increasing world population. To meet the need for a text which would outline the most recent advances in this phase of agriculture, Lipscomb compiled this volume. It contains a wealth of information for farmers, students of agri- culture, and anyone else who is interested in the status and welfare of the domestic animals. The subject of sheep farming, which has been adequately treated in other volumes, is not included. The statistics and records, which in this edition have been completely brought up to date, are drawn largely from Australian and New Zealand sources, but there is much material that is applicable to animal husbandry in any corner of the globe. The text is supplied with a useful gesta- tion table for mares, cows, ewes, and sows; a complete index; and numerous well-chosen illustrations. GENERAL BIOLOGY WHERE IS THE - COLLECTION? An account of the various Natural History Collections which have come under the notice of the compiler between x88o and I99.</page><page sequence="4">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 469 Compiled by Charles Davies Sherborn. The University Press, Cambridge; The Macmillan Co., New York. 9o cents. 82 x 52; I49; I940 (paper). Very few natural history collections survive the original collector. Either they are purchased by dealers who break them up for sale in small lots or they lose their identity by being absorbed by larger collections in museums. The difficulty of tracing types is manifest. The author of the present work has compiled all the available data concerning those collections that have so disappeared during the past sixty years. One would think that a catalog of such nature would be extremely dry reading, yet those who read between the lines will find elements of both pathos and humor. For instance in it we can read of John Phillips who took his fossils to London, where they were stolen the first night by burglars, who mistook them for plate, and who, on learning of their error, threw the whole collection into the Thames from Black- friar's Bridge: also of Charles Ottley Groom, Duke of Mantua and Monteferrat, Prince of Mantua and of the House of David, who was a notorious rogue and thief and who tried to kill Thomas Davies by dropping a boulder upon him from a high ladder in Tennant's shop in the Strand. The work is not infallible-it puts Isaac Lea's collection of Unionidae in the American Museum in New York instead of the National Museum in Washington. And of course it makes no pretension of completeness-the magnitude of such a task would preclude its achievement. LABORATORY MANUAL OF GENERAL Bi- OLOGY. I. Botany. II. Invertebrate Zo- ology. III.

Third Edition. By Arthur W. Haupt. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $i.oo. 9 x 6; ix + 65; I940. The first of these manuals, on loose sheets, is based on work covered in a general biology course at Loyola University of the South, New Orleans. The second covers the general biology course at the University of California, Los Angeles. Both are designed to supplement lectures and are arranged in the rorm of exercises. The first guide, which covers a more ex- tensive course than the second, is intended to acquaint the student with the external and internal structure of a large number of plant and animal types; the second, which is arranged for a class meeting twice a week in one semester, tends to emphasize, in a general way, the under- lying principles of the subject. DOWN TO EARTH. A Naturalist Looks About. By Alan Devoe. Illustrated by Gertrude M. Bradley and D. F. L. Bradley. Coward- McCann,Inc.,New York- $,*.5o. 8x52; x + : 28; I940. A collection of brief essays such as most newspaper columnists affect, but from which they differ, chiefly in being more meritorious. They are excellent propa- ganda for sanity in living. Unfortunately, only a comparatively small proportion of the population is likely to read this book at all, and of these the reviewer fears that but few will undergo a change of conviction as a result. For every citizen like Mr. Devoe there may be several thousand "brave men of Brielle" and it is the latter who get into politics, who mold public opinion and who direct na- tional policy. Is it surprising that the times seem out of joint? The reviewer would like to see this book used as course reading in the sec- ondary schools of the nation. It would be a great improvement over the anaemic imitations of natural history that served his generation. VERITA BIOLOGICHE NEL PENSIERO DI SCHOPENHAUER. By Mario F. Canella. Nicola Zanichelli Editore, Bologna. L. 5. 92 x 62; i6; I938 (paper). In this pamphlet the author argues that</page><page sequence="5">470 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY there is much in the philosophical works of Schopenhauer-much more than in Plato's idealism and Kant's criticism- of fundamental interest to biologists, particularly in his concepts concerning the "will to live." In fact he concludes that the "philosophic system of Schopenhauer is the only one which can lead him [the biologist] 'as far as the solid ground of reality.

BIOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE CONNECTICUT WATERSHED. Survey Report No. 4. By Herbert E. Warfel. State of New Hampshire, Department of Fish and Game, Concord. $i.oo. i2 x 9; 256 + 3 maps; 1939 (paper). This fine report of the New Hampshire Biological Survey is a compilation of the data collected during the summer of I939 and is dedicated to the memory of Earl E. Hoover (1911-1939). It is the fourth and final report of a series, the first three of which were contributed by Hoover. The report includes stocking records and policies for the streams and lakes (data arranged on master sheets, so pages for streams, 25 pages for lakes), geology, physical and chemical data, description of fishes, plankton, amphibians and rep- tiles, amphibian larvae, and freshwater shells, with locality charts, etc. Also included are many illustrations, plates, and charts, and three large contour maps in a folder attached to the back cover. THE AIR AND ITS MYSTERIES. By C. M. Botley. American Edition Ar- ranged by Hanor A. Webb. With a Fore- word by Sir Richard Gregory. D. Apple- ton-Century Co., New York and London. $30oo. 8 x 54; xv + 302.; 1940. To the amateur weather forecaster and others with a casual curiosity about the atmosphere this book will prove instruc- tive. Much of the material, however, is written in an overly simple style, and the facts and principles given are well known to anyone with a moderate understanding of physics. The early pages deal with the composition and pressure of the air and the tricks of the wind. Additional facts are given concerning clouds, precipitation, climate, and weather forecasting. Sound and light are likewise discussed, while the final chapters are devoted to the impor- tance of weather conditions and the strato- sphere in aviation and radio transmission. Numerous diagrams accompany the text and there is an adequate index. BIOLOGICAL SYMPOSIA. Edited by Jaques Cattell. With a Fore- word by Albert F. Blakeslee. The Jaques Cattell Press, Lancaster, Pa. $X.50. 98 x 64; vii + 238; I940. Containing papers by many of the leading American men of science, the material embodied herein is divided into three parts: the cell theory, mating types and their interactions in the ciliate infusoria, the chromosome structure. The various papers were originally presented at the I938 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, in Rich- mond, Va., and are here brought together in permanent form. They comprise a related series of observations on an im- portant theme. Each paper has its in- dividual bibliography but there is no index. FUNDAMENTALS OF BIOLOGY. Third Edi- tion. By Arthur W. Haupt. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.00. 9 x 6; xii + 443; 1940. The third edition of this book follows the same conservative presentation as is found in the second edition (Q.R.B., Vol. 8, No. 2., I932-). Much new material relating to the human body and to the subject of immunity to disease has been added. Chapters on vitamins and hor- mones have been greatly expanded. There are also 8o new cuts.</page><page sequence="6">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 47I HUMAN BIOLOGY THE3 NATIVE RACES OF ASIA AND EUROPE. Anthologia Anthropologica.

Percy Lund Humphries and Co., London. 35S5 net. ii x 82; ix + 35I; I939. These two volumes complete the publica- tion of the material which Sir James Frazer has collected in his notebooks over a long period of research in social an- thropology (for the two earlier volumes, cf. Q.R.B., Vol. I4, P. 353; Vol. i5, p. 85). The four volumes represent, in general, left-over material; that is, material that did not exactly fit in with the author's writings, yet was far too valuable to be discarded since frequently it was from sources that are not now easily -available to the student. To Mr. Robert A. Downie fell the task of putting these miscellaneous notes into usable form. This he has done in a most competent and satisfactory manner. All four volumes follow the same plan. A hasty glance through the table of con- tents will inform the reader whether a particular group is mentioned; or, in the index will be found a careful array of the subjects noted. The first of the present volumes, Native Races of Asia and Europe has the following main divisions: Indo- China, Tibet and China, Korea and Japan, Northern Asia, India, South-Western Asia, and Europe-each of these being sub- divided. Native Races of America is divided into Greenland and North America, Mex- ico and Central America, and South America, with sub-divisions. The- ex- tracts, in English, German, French, or Spanish, are largely from nineteenth century writings, especially for the Ameri- can volume, but there is also a goodly sprinkling of material from earlier periods. Among these we note Martini Cromeri, Lithuania, I5 68; Thevenot's Relations des Divers Voyages curieux, Paris, i672; Thomas Hyde, Historia religionis veterum Persarum eorumque Magorum, 1700; Petri de Dusburg, Chronicon Prussiae, I679; Antoine Biet, l'Isle de Cayenne, I664; Pablo Joseph de Arriaga, Extirpacion de la Idolatria del Piru, i62.i, etc. Catholic priests, officers of foreign expeditions, anthropologists, missionaries and travelers have all con- tributed in their writings to these inter- esting notes. An excellent outline map for each continent shows the localities of the races mentioned. HISTORICAL TABLES. By S. H. Steinberg. With a Foreword by G. P. Gooch. The Macmillan Co., New York and London. $3.50. 94 X 72; x + 256; I939- A thorough and scholarly chronology covering a span of approximately 2-ooo years from 58 B.C., three years before Caesar first invaded Britain, down to the end of I938, just 8 months short of the beginning of World War II and Hitler's attempt to repeat Caesar's performance. The arrangement is in six columns to the double page (except for the period of World War I). In general the three columns on each left-hand page deal chiefly with the relations of the Powers. The right-hand pages are, in the author's words, "given to what may be described as home affairs and the history of civili- zation; i.e. constitutional, economic, spiritual, and intellectual activities." Relative to scientific matters the chro- nology gives a considerably larger pro- portion of details for applied than for pure science, which is perhaps natural considering the purpose of the whole work. But few events in the history of pure science of really major importance appear to have been omitted. The com- pactness of the book, coupled with the easy secular comparability afforded by the columnar arrangement make it one of the most useful books of its kind that has appeared. Every scholar, regardless of his field, will welcome it as a desk companion. This volume, in common with most</page><page sequence="7">472. THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY tabular chronologies, is not indexed. This is a mistaken policy. The value and usefulness of the book would be increased many times over if it contained detailed author and subject indexes. This would be true even if the thickness of the volume were doubled, which it would not be. Suppose, for example, one has forgotten the year when Newton's Optics appeared, and wants to look it up. This, and other unindexed chronologies, leave one no resource except to run down the appro- priate column, beginning say in the middle of the i7th century, until the desired entry is reached. But even with this defect Historical Tables is a work of great value. THE SWAZI: An Ethnographic Account of the Natives of the Swaziland Protectorate. By Brian A. Marwick. The Macmillan Co., New York; The University Press, Cambridge. $4.5. 8 x 5 ; xvii + 32.0 + 8 plates; I940. This, the first comprehensive work on the Swazi, includes descriptions of their social organization, social and economic life, religion and magic, political organi- zation and legal system, and effects of European contact. The information in- corporated in this valuable and very readable treatise was obtained from the author's nine years' experience in Swazi- land as a government official, his visits to the native villages, and from the scanty literature on the subject. That the Swazi culture remains a work- ing whole in spite of the influence of European civilization is evident from the fact that "sanctions and institutions which existed prior to European influence still operate even where attempts have been made to uproot certain elements of culture," and frequent examples occur where Christian converts hurry to consult witch doctors as soon as trouble comes their way. In fact attempts by mission- aries and officials to eradicate certain elements of native culture have often not brought the results desired. Missionaries have insisted upon monogamy with the result that polygamy is becoming discoun- tenanced. The woman who would have been con- tent to become the wife of a polygamist now occa- sionally refuses to do so, but not infrequently becomes a prostitute or a concubine instead, since there are few occupations by which a native woman can earn her own living. The net result is that a woman who would have been accepted in society as a useful and respected social and economic unit is despised by the conservative natives and by the missionaries if she falls into loose ways as a result of the modifica- tion of the outlook upon polygamy. Appendix I presents the results of stud- ies by other authors which were published after the present book was written; Ap- pendix II is a glossary of Swazi terms used in the text. Annotations and an index have been provided, and the illustrations consist of photographs and diagrams. WESTWARD FROM VINLAND. An Account of Norse Discoveries and Explorations in America 982-I362. By Hja/mar R. Ho/and. Due/i, Sloan and Pearce, New York. $3.oo. 8- x 5 3; x + 354 + 3I plates; I940. When Holand published The Kensington Stone some years ago, it became inevitable that some day a larger volume would be undertaken, to which wider circulation should be given. The objectives of the present work are threefold-to write briefly the history of the Norse settlements on Greenland as far as it has a bearing on the possible colonization of America; to prove the authenticity of the Kensington Stone; and to speculate as to the origin of the Mandans-that peculiar tribe of blond Indians who lived in frame houses and engaged in agriculture. The first two of these involved extensive traveling not only in Scandinavia, but throughout Europe, to examine artifacts in museums and documents in libraries. Unfortunately, the urge that drove him to add the chapter about the Mandans appears all through the remainder of the book. The entirely unnecessary and ir- relevant speculations in which the author enjoys indulging do not impair the validity of the conclusions he reaches, but neither do they add anything, and they are likely to exhaust the reader's patience. If the reader can manage to forget these specula- tions and concentrate his attention entirely</page><page sequence="8">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 473 on the facts, he is likely to conclude, as the present reviewer has done, that Holand has proved his point; but it is a mystery that, after devoting over a quarter of a century to the search for facts in support of his theory, he is unwilling to let those facts speak for themselves. The book is thoroughly documented with footnotes, but the lengthy bibli- ography in the earlier work has been omitted. The book is excellently il- lustrated with photographs, drawings, diagrams, and maps. There is an index of nineteen pages. ETUDE SOCIALE COMPAREE DES REGIMES DE LIBERTE ET DES REGIMES AUTORITAIRES. (Essai d'Economie Sociale Comparee.) By Jean Lescure. Les Editions Domat- Montchrestien, Paris. 8ofrancs. 9 x5; 479 + i folding chart; I940 (paper). The author discusses in detail the phi- losophy and theoretical principles under- lying the political economy of Russia, Germany, and Italy, and examines the results of the attempts made to develop the economic life of these countries accord- ing to the political and social ideologies. As is known, in the totalitarian states mentioned the government exercises either directly or indirectly a preponderant con- trol over both capital and labor. The degree and manner of this control differ in the three countries, being most compre- hensive in Russia and the least in Italy. The major and more important portion of this book is dedicated to a delineation of these differences. The clearness with which the distinctive and differentiating elements of these doctrines are outlined is remarkable and makes this book a first class contribution to economic and social literature and one especially to be read by those who speak glibly about political ideologies. The author notes and emphasizes with much satisfaction that in practice the totalitarian systems cannot escape the fundamental laws of economics. Prices are still determined by supply and demand, capital is formed by savings, private initiative is necessary for the development of enterprises. No matter what the ideology the economic laws still triumph, says the author with verbal transports of joy. Since this volume embodies lectures given to stud- ents, the author's naive tone may be forgiven but it must not be forgotten that long ago the mathematical economists adequately demonstrated the consequences relative to price, production, and con- sumption of alterations in the postulates that characterize a liberal economy. The results observed in the totalitarian states, in Japan, and in this country only furnish further proof of the validity of the deduc- tions. ONCE IN SINAI. The Record of a Solitary Venture. By Joan M. C. Plowden. With a Fore- word by Major C. S. Jarvis. Methuen and Co., London. i2zs. 6d. net. 8 x 52; xv + 302. + 8 plates + i folding map; I940. This is a delightful story of travel and exploration. The author denies that she had any adventures but those who read the account of the man-eating shark will disagree with her. Although one of the world's bleakest deserts, the peninsula of Sinai is full of romance. Tradition makes it the land of Midian. In ancient history it was the scene of the Exodus and it was here that Elijah survived the wind, the fire, and the earthquake, and heard the still small voice. The mediaeval period saw the erection here of the convent of Saint Catherine of Alexandria (not to be con- fused with St. Catherine of Siena) and in modern years it acquired associations with Tischendorf and the Codex Sinaiaticus. Being so largely a record of personal experience the book contains little in the way of original contributions to science, but one incident may be mentioned. On a mural in the convent of Saint Cather- ine, which was built in the reign of Justinian, is the figure of a dodo. Now this bird was not known to science until the sixteenth century. Is it possible that there were dodos on the peninsula of Sinai at an early period that have since become extinct?

JAPAN s EMERGENCE AS A MODERN STATE. Political and Economic Problems of the Meiji Period. I.P.R. Inquiry Series. By E. Herbert Norman. Institute of Pa- cific Relations, New York. $2..oo. 9 x 6; Xiii + 254; 1940. The year i868, the year of the so-called Meiji Restoration, marks the beginning of the transformation of Japan from a feudal agrarian state to a modern industrial na- tion that can compete with the United States and Great Britain. In that year one group of aristocrats wrested the power from the controlling group and aided by the financial support of the leading bank- ing houses was able to alter the economy of the country according to its will. Thus, as the author well emphasizes, what took place was not a revolution by the people but merely a change of author- ity from one to another set of persons among the ruling castes. The latter, being composed of able and far-sighted men, recognized the significance of the economic evolution of the leading Western countries and decided to follow suit while at the same time they attempted and at times succeeded in avoiding some of the errors that accompanied the industrial and commercial development in Europe and this country. Furthermore, Japan was fortunate because being small and with limited natural resources it did not excite the cupidity of the Western powers and was saved from the fate of China. These seem to be the principal factors affecting the progress of Japan as de- scribed in this account which covers the commercial, agricultural, and industrial, as well as political changes in Japan from i868 to the Russ-Japanese conflict. Within the limits of the subject discussed this scholarly monograph is interesting not only for its timeliness but also because of the style in which it is written. WHITE WATER AND BLACK MAGIC. By Richard C. Gill. Henry Holt and Co., New York. $3.00. 82 x 52; xiv + 369; I940. This is the story of the Rio Pastaza whose turbulent, rock-torn white waters flow with eager haste through the land of the Ecuadorian Oriente to the Mother Ama- zon; it is the story of the Ecuador Indians and their "flying death," curare, in the preparation and use of which the black magic of the jungle pharmacologists play a paramount role; it is the story of the conversion of curare from the lethal poison of witchmen to the therapeutic drug of "'men in white''-a drug beneficial in cases of spastic paralysis, as a shock-absorber in convulsive shock therapy in psychiatric treatment, and possibly in other thera- peutic fields. The author, an ethno- botanist, and his wife live on the hacienda, Rio Negro, a plantation ranch molded out of "wild living forest," on the Pastaza in the Ecuadorian hinterland. It was to this ranch that all wanderers on the Pastaza Trail came-solitary Indian hunters and messengers, jungle chieftains with their tribal retinues, "miscellane- ous" scientists, old-timers, new-timers, school teachers, petty adventurers, pros- pectors, missionaries, journalists, colo- nists-to-be, colonists-who-had-been, etc., and it was from this ranch that the author traveled into the jungle to live in Indian villages, to learn more about the pharma- copoeia of the forest, and to become an accredited medicine man among the In- dians. From this "'jungle drugstore" the Gill-Merrill Ecuadorian Expedition brought back enough botanical specimens of curare for large scale medical research, as well as other important herbs. The volume includes duplicate maps on the inside front and back covers, numerous photographs, and an index. THE DISCOVERY OF MAN. The Story of the Inquiry Into Human Origins. By Stanley Casson. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $3.00. 82 X 54; 339 + i6 plates; I939. This is an outline of the more important developments and personalities in the history of cultural anthropology and</page><page sequence="10">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 475 archaeology. Although with Aristotle, Herodotus, and Tacitus, the ancient world contributed greatly to our knowledge of these aspects of human biology, it is really only from the I7th and i8th cen- turies that systematic progress began, and the author justly dedicates the major portion of the book to the pioneers of that epoch. The author opens this his- tory with an account of the "pilot books" of the Carthaginian Hanno. He mentions in passing Anaximander and Archelaus, to discuss more leisurely Herodotus, Hip- pocrates, Aristotle, Pliny the elder, and Tacitus. He is little impressed by the writings of the Romans and singles out Pliny, particularly, with ironic and sar- castic comments. Following the Renais- sance and the discovery of America the first systematic observations on cultural anthropology are reported, notably that of John Scheffer (I674); and with the work of Stukeley (i687-I765) some be- ginning is made in archaeological field investigations. The progress thereafter becomes accelerated, leading to our present knowledge on the subject. In discussing the modern contributions the author is interested primarily in the theorists, especially the English theorists. The book suffers from this change of method and accompanying style. While the first part is interesting and easy to read, the latter sections have the scholarly but pedantic qualities of a synoptic his- tory text. ETAT DE LA POPULATION D'APRES LES RECENSEMENTS. MIGRATIONS. Actualit es Scientifiques et Industrielles, 786. Cours de Demographie et de Statistique Sanitaire. III. By Michel Huber. Hermann et Cie, Paris. 30 francs. io x 6.; io8; I939 (paper). NUPTIALITE, NATALITE, FECONDITE. AC- tualit6s Scientifiques et Industrielles, 80i. Cours de D6mographie et de Statistique Sani- taire, IV. By Michel Huber. Hermann et Cie, Paris. 40 francs. io x 62; I3I; I939 (paper). The first two numbers in this series were published in I938 under the titles Intro- duction a I' etude des statistiques demographi- ques et sanitaires (No. 598) and Methodes d' elaboration des statistiques d6emographiques (recensements, etat civil, migrations) (No. 599), respectively. In Number III the author presents data on the total population of the earth and its distribution by geographical areas; methods of census taking used in various countries, and the enumeration of the various kinds of data on the distributions of populations by age, sex, civil status, language, religion, etc. that can be ob- tained from census material; and mi- gration. Number IV illustrates from actual data, the type of information that can be calculated from census material and from birth and death registrations concerning number and rates of marriages, divorces, births (live and still, legitimate and il- legitimate), sex ratios at birth, infant mortality, and fertility. A large part of the illustrative material pertains to France in the last quarter of a century. 0. C. MARSH: Pioneer in Paleontology. By Charles Schuchert and Clara M. LeVene. Yale University Press, New Haven; Oxford University Press, London. $5.oo. 9- x 64; xxi + 54I + 30 plates; I940. Whatever Othniel Charles Marsh's pecu- liarities (to use a milder word than some of his contemporaries would have) of character and personality may have been, he was one of the great figures in the history of vertebrate paleontology. A definitive biography has long been needed. The need is admirably filled by the present volume. The authors had unusual, in- deed almost unparalleled, facilities for the task, in the way of access to Marsh's papers, collections,, and memorabilia of all sorts and kinds. They have made excel- lent use of these resources, and have turned out a book that is readable, as well as accurate and detailed, about a man who was intrinsically somewhat lacking in charm or interest of personality, as those words are usually understood. All the testimony, including that of this book, indicates that Marsh was a pom- pous, selfish, vain, strutting sort of a Tory, who never in his life had the smallest conception that the pleasures of con-</page><page sequence="11">476 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY descension were singularly one-sided, as Stevenson put it. His attitudes and rela- tions towards and with assistants and colleagues present a picture that can scarcely be regarded as either pleasant or normal. None the less he was in- dubitably a great paleontologist, and this volume is a contribution of first rate importance to the history of science. The book is adequately indexed and illustrated. RUTHERFORD: Being the Life and Letters of the Rt. Hon. Lord Rutherford, O.M. By A. S. Eve. Foreword by Earl Baldwin of Bewdley. The Macmillan Co., New York; University Press, Cambridge. $5 .oo. 9x X 62-; xvi + 451 + i8 plates; I939. In this first authorized biography of one of the greatest of modern scientists the author has not only recorded in sequence the salient facts of his subject's life and scientific contributions, but in addition, has devoted a major portion of the book to the correspondence that passed between Rutherford and his wife, his mother, and his colleagues. As a consequence, the reader is enabled to catch a glimpse of a live and very human Rutherforc. It is no more than a glimpse because the author seems to take special care in avoiding comments on the personality of his hero and from the correspondence only a dis- connected and fragmentary view is ob- tained. It would appear that Rutherford was a cocky fellow, well aware of his genius and not too modest about it. Early in life he became interested in the detection of Hertzian waves and began inventing apparatuses for the purpose. From his native New Zealand he went to Cambridge where, underJ. J. Thomson, his career took its shape. Through the latter he obtained the post at McGill and there were initiated the investigations that led to the Nobel prize, fame, glory, and an English peerage. Rutherford lived a full and interesting life and the author has succeeded in describing it so well that this will undoubtedly rank among the best of biographical sketches to appear in recent years. CULTURAL AND NATURAL AREAS OF NATIVE NORTH AMERICA. University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology. Volume 38. By A. L. Kroeber. University of Cali- fornia Press, Berkeley. $; .5o (cloth); $3.oo (paper). io3 x 6i; xi + 2.42. + 9 folding maps + i folding table; '939. This is a comprehensive, extensively docu- mented work on the cultural and natural areas of native North America from the Arctic Circle to the region of Central America. The tribal, cultural, physi- ographic, and vegetational areas of North America are discussed and pictorially pre- sented in many textual and loose maps, the latter of which are enclosed in a pocket at the end of the text. Population densities are given by tribes, areas, lan- guage groups, etc. Environmental and cultural factors are presented in relation to physiography, natural vegetation, cli- mate, water, and drainage. Invaluable to the student is the author's evaluation of literature and discussion of theories expounded in the broad field of cultural anthropology on the native cultures of North America. Bibliography and notes are not separately appended but appear in the textual matter and footnotes. An index and a detailed table of contents are included. The 17 text tables, 2.i text maps, i pocket table, and 8 pocket maps should be of inestimable aid to the student in this field. HUMAN BIOLOGY. By George A. Baitsell. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $3.75. 9 x 6; xv + 62.i; I940. Baitsell's text is a needed contribution to a new field of modern science in which acceptable textbooks are few and far- between. This distinctly new and re- freshing book endeavors to present the pertinent facts of biology from the vantage ground of the most interesting and im- portant organism in the world of life- man himself. Accordingly, the study of human biology involves a great deal more than human anatomy and physiology: it is essentially a humanizing of general</page><page sequence="12">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 477 biology in that attention is centered primarily on human structure and function rather than on the characteristics of types selected from the lower organisms. In an endeavor to widen the scope of the book, so that the interested student may have abundant material to pursue im- portant fields of interest at advanced levels, an appendix has been supplied containing direct quotations from the publications of various authorities. Orig- inal material by the author is also presented. The book is well and appro- priately illustrated and a complete index has been included. PENOBSCOT MAN. The Life History of a Forest Tribe in Maine. By Frank G. Speck. University of Penn- sylvania Press, Philadelphia; Oxford Uni- versity Press, London. $4.00. 9 X 6; xx + 32-5; 1940. Much has been written about the Indians of western North America while com- paratively little ethnological work has been done among the tribes of northern New England and eastern Canada. The present work is a fine contribution to this neglected field. Personal contact with the Penobscot Indians of Maine, beginning in I909 when they were still an independent forest people instead of curiosities for the tour- ist, makes Frank G. Speck an authority on this tribe of the Algonkians. He tells of their history, their folk-lore, their daily round of life, their physical and mental characteristics, and their adjust- ment to the white man's world. As one closes this book one wishes with the author that these interesting inhabitants of the old forests need not have become steel-workers and factory hands. FIJIAN FRONTIER. Studies of the Pacific No. 4. By Laura Thompson. Introduction by B. Malinowski. American Council, Institute of Pacific Relations, San Francisco, New York and Honolulu. $2.oo. 9 x 6; xxiii + I53 + 7 plates; 1940. This study, which Malinowski in his introduction terms "an artistic picture of primitive life in one of the most fascinat- ing parts of the world," gives an analysis of the history of the Fijians, their customs, their religion, their psychology, and their reactions to the presence of civilizing influences. Thompson believes that when the natives of the Fiji groups have been educated to make the fullest use of their native resources, both manual and natural, and when the present pauperizing influ- ences of soliciting and ceremonial giving are banished, the term "famine isles" with all that it implies will be lifted for once and for all from these picturesque British- owned islands in the tropical Pacific. DOCTORS IN SHIRT SLEEVES: Musings on Hobbies, Meals, Patients, Sport and Philos- ophy. Edited by Sir Henry Bashford. Veritas Press, New York. $2.oo. 842 x52; xii + 2.94; 1940. The twenty-five entertaining essays ap- pearing in this volume were selected from a series of articles on diverse subjects contributed by medical men to the Lancet and published therein as a weekly feature under the heading "Grains and Scruples." Hobbies, reflections, reminiscences, per- sonal experiences, and theories-gastro- nomic, literary, biological, educational, spiritual, etc.-form the subject matter of the essays. Each contributor has been given full freedom in choice of subject and style of writing. The fortunate re- sult, the present volume, is a compilation of the "off-duty musings" of medical men who write in a witty and knowing way on a diversity of subjects. THE MAN IN THE MOONLIGHT. By Helen McCloy. William Morrow and Co., New York. $x.oo. 72 X S4; [6] + 3IS; I940. In these Brief Notes comments on novels are rarely included. But the present volume has a distinctive right to be present. It is a biological detective story that is good; both as story and as human</page><page sequence="13">478 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY biology. The master mind, Basil Willing, is a competent and sensible psychiatrist; the action takes place in and about a university in New York City not terribly difficult to identify under its pseudonym; and the professors involved in the story behave more nearly as actual professors do than is the case in most fiction. Fur- thermore the scientific matters, with which the book teems, are handled throughout with considerable real under- standing. Mostly the professional scien- tific man will not gag as he reads the book, which is saying a lot as the bulk of pseudo-scientific fiction goes. Regret- tably we do not have the pleasure of knowing Helen McCloy personally, or anything about her. But on the evidence afforded by this volume she is certainly to be encouraged to go on writing. CANOE TO MANDALAY. By Major R. Raven-Hart. Frederick MAul- ler, London. iOs. 6d. net. 81 x 52-; [4] + :45 + i6 plates; I939. Major Raven-Hart's i6,ooo miles canoeing experience served him well on his Burmese journey of 6oo miles which took him from Myitkyina down the Irrawaddy to Ran- goon. With only the help of a is-year-old lad, and at the risk of contracting malaria or the plague, or of capsizing in the whirlpools of the river, the author made the perilous journey without any major mishap. The places he visited, the people he met, as well as his experiences in learning the Burmese language and cus- toms, are set down in a most fascinating and readable fashion. The author's spicy humor is only one of the many factors which make for thoroughly enjoyable reading. The text is generously supplied with photographs of the people and places visited. The concluding pages of the book contain an appendix of practical details, a table of distances, and an index. A MAN WHO FOUND A COUNTRY. By A. Nakashian. Thomas Y. Crowell Co., New York. . $2.75. 84 x 5 4; viii + 2.79; 1940. The author's experiences in a country so entirely different from our own makes most fascinating reading. An Armenian, living under Turkish rule, Dr. Nakashian was a subject from the outset of prejudice and persecution. Through determination and a blind trust in luck he managed to obtain a medical degree at the American University then newly established at Beyrouth. His subsequent practice led him among beggars, thieves, rich lords, and high officials, while at the same time he and his family were in almost constant flight for their lives. During the World War the author was imprisoned for months but was released and made a captain in the Turkish army because of the ire need for surgeons. When racial and religious persecutions continued after the war, the family moved to this country. The book not only pays tribute to the American doctors and missionaries who worked in the Near East, but it is also an interesting and well-written historical account of the fall of the Ottoman Empire. SCOTT OF THE ANTARCTIC. A Study in Character. By George Seaver. John Murray, London. ios. 6d. net. 82 x 5; vii + I87 + I4 plates; I940. When Captain Scott set out on his expedi- tion to the South Pole, he had two purposes in mind: (i) British priority at the Pole; and (2.) the satisfying of his own quest for exploration and adventure. Although he failed in the former by a mere month, the latter purpose was com- pletely fulfilled, as attested by his diary in which he wrote his experiences right up to the minute of his death. Faced with unsurmountable difficulties, and al- ways working against great odds, Scott was a man who never gave up. His heritage and early training, his physical, moral, and intellectual characteristics, his failures and successes, all of which con- tributed to his indomitable spirit, are interestingly recorded in this little volume by Mr. Seaver. The story of Scott's life will be read and enjoyed, not only by Britishers, but by all throughout the English speaking world who are interested</page><page sequence="14">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 479 in exploration, adventure, and human character. GOVERNMENTS AND BIRTH CONTROL. Pop- ulation Increase Versus The Kingdom of God on Earth. By F. E. Austin. The Austin Workshops, Hanover, N. H. $i.oo. 6 x 43; 130; I940. According to the author's statement thirty-two pages of this book are alone worth at least sixteen dollars. But in the prologue he still expresses some fear lest reviewers should find that it has no meritorious features. Let it be said that Mr. Austin points out some of the funda- mental biological truths regarding war and overpopulation. Numerous figures, some of them valid, others rather comical, are presented to show that the world is fast going to the dogs. Two alternatives remain-wholesale annihilation of popu- lations, or radical limitation of births. Among the pages is considerable discus- sion about the establishment of a Heavenly Kingdom on earth by the United States and Great Britain, with the "isms" doomed to failure because they are not in accord with Divine command, all this being supported by numerous biblical quo- tations. Let us all take precautions against Armageddon! I / THE ATLANTIC MIGRATION I607-I860. A History of the Continuing Settlement of the United States. By Marcus L. Hansen. Edited with a Foreword by Arthur M. Schlesinger. Har- vard University Press, Cambridge. $3.50. 81 x 6; xvii + 39I + 9 plates; I940. The continuing migration of the peoples of the Old World to the Western Hemi- sphere, and particularly to North America, has been one of the most important and significant migratory movements from every point of view, of which there is record in history or evidence in prehistory. The late Professor Hansen has provided in this volume a thorough, scholarly, comprehensive, and readable account of this movement and its consequences and implications. The book is thoroughly documented and indexed, the Bibliography and Notes occupying over 6o pages. The approach and treatment in this volume is analytic throughout. Synthesis would doubtless have followed if Prof. Hansen had lived longer. But as a clear, logical, and sound untangling of an intricate web, of social forces of extreme complexity this book will have permanent value to his- torians, sociologists, and human biologists generally. ARGENTINE TO ANDES. By Hanna Rydh. Translated from the Swedish by Mary Sandbach. Blackie and Son, London and Glasgow. ios. 6d. net. 8x X 52; xi + I7I + 47 plates; I940. This is an exciting and refreshing account of a rather unique journey told in a most readable and friendly manner. Dr. Rydh, a Swedish archaeologist, went to South America on a lecture tour, and while there, took the opportunity of visiting the chief centers of those civilizations which existed before the arrival of the Spanish and Portuguese. Traveling from Buenos Aires to La Paz, the author stopped to study the remains in the northern provinces of Argentina on the eastern slopes of the Andes, and near the borders of Bolivia. She was greatly interested in the Inca ruins around Lake Titicaca and in Cuzco, the very center of the Inca empire. During her stay in Cuzco, the feast of Corpus Christi was celebrated and her description of the ceremony is most graphic. The book concludes with a. charming description of the city of Lima. The volume is exceptionally well illus- trated and an index has been provided. RACE, LANGUAGE AND CULTURE. By Franz, Boas. The Macmillan Co., New York. $s.oo. 94 x 68; xx + 647; I940. This volume, a compilation of sixty-three papers by Franz Boas, represents the basic anthropological views of one of the most dominant figures in the field of anthro- pology. The articles were chosen by</page><page sequence="15">480 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Boas from his numerous publications of the past ffty-odd years, the earliest printed in this volume being The Study of Geography (published I887) and the most recent, Growth (i89z-I939, revised and condensed). Hitherto many of the works of Franz Boas were more or less inaccessible to students, due to the fact that his writings have appeared in numerous journals. Boas's researches extend into all branches of anthropology and this work is a collection of his more important contribu- tions to the fields of physical and cul- tural anthropology. There are numerous graphs, drawings, and photographs. A detailed table of contents takes the place of an index. AN INTRODUCTION TO CULTURAL ANTHRO- POLOGY. A New and Enlarged Edition. By Robert H. Lowie. Farrar and Rinehart, New York. $3.50. 8- x 5; xX + 584 + i6 plates; I940. Part I of this edition has remained essen- tially unchanged from the I934 publica- tion reviewed in this journal (cf. Vol. IO, p. 347). Entirely new chapters discuss language and the theory of culture. The author upholds the view that cultural variations between peoples are separate and distinct from racial differences. The second part of the volume, almost entirely new and supplementary to the first edition, treats typical cultures, including our Western civilization as well as several primitive tribes. A number of maps and drawings accompany the text and the volume is made complete by an index and enlarged bibliography of i6 pages. ADVENTURES OF A BIOLOGIST. By J. B. S. Haldane. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $z.75. 8 4xs5; vii + z8i; I940. This volume consists of a series of essays- already published through some medium or other-which are, as Haldane says, "by-products of my other activities, namely scientific teaching and research, and, since I936, political work." In essence they describe intellectual explora- tions into human biology and are written in a smooth snmart style that will probably appeal more to the so-called intelligentsia than to the general public. A multitude of topics is covered, all to some degree cosmic: climate, origin of life, the geo- physical universe, etc. About one half of the essays deal with problems of sociology: of course included is also a note on Marxism. The reader, even though not particularly interested in Professor Haldane's feelings and thoughts about such matters, will undoubtedly enjoy the book. EMIGRANT COMMUNITIES IN SOUTH CHINA. A Study of Overseas Migration and Its In/uence on Standards of Living and Social By Ta Chen. English Version Edited by Bruno Lasker. Institute of Pacific Rela- tions, New York. $X.5o. 9 x 6; xvi + 287; I940. The field study on the emigrant com- munities of East Kwangtung and South Fukien in South China was undertaken as an inquiry into the "nature and con- sequences of cultural change in the Pacific" and "into the part played by Chinese emigration to the near-by countries of the South in changing the standards of living in the home communities. This research on the causes and cultural effects of emigration should be of great interest to the student of migration, culture diffusion, and sociology. There are numerous tables, three appendices, and an index. INGALIK MATERIAL CULTURE. Yale Uni- versity Publications in Anthropology. Num- ber 22. By Cornelius Osgood.

The present work is the first of an intended series of papers. It deals primarily with descriptive data from the analytical point of view.

The book is illustrated with numerous line drawings, maps, and photographs. The appendices furnish additional Ingalik in- formation of diverse character. There is a bibliography and an index. ADVENTURES IN GOOD EATING. Good Eat- ing Places Along the Highways of America. Seventh Edition. By Duncan Hines. Adventures in Good Eating, Bowling Green, Ky. $I.50. 72 x 5; 2.96; I940 (paper). The automobile traveler unconsciously has had no small part in the production of this guide that now appears in its seventh edition (tenth printing-the first edition appeared in I936). It seems to be thoroughly dependable. Naturally it is not possible for one person to check up on all the places listed but apparently there are many competent and willing helpers. Occasionally there are omissions and doubtful inclusions. Some of these errors, however, will undoubtedly be ironed out with the continuation of the present standard of checking. Besides the United States the survey includes Canada, Alaska, Mexico, and Hawaii. LABORATORY OF ANTHROPOLOGY. Techni- cal Series, Bulletin No. Io. Archaeological Survey. Containing the following articles: A Variation of Southwestern Pueblo Culture, by J. D. Jennings; Analysis of the Skeletal Material, by Georg Neumann. Laboratory of Anthropology, Santa Fe, N. M. $I.i5. IO4 x 88; 2.0 + 8 plates; I940 (paper). The slow and arduous task of excavation in the attempt to learn more about the life and activities of pre-historic man of North America has taken many scientific groups into the rich fields of Indian culture of the southwestern United States. The present bulletin describes the indus- trial and skeletal finds of three excava- tions in the Peinasco River Valley of New Mexico. Everything found was indica- tive of a southwestern Pueblo culture dating somewhere around II50-I300. A short bibliography, and several maps and photographs conclude the paper.

ZOOLOGY THE LoUSE: An Account of the Lice Whicb Infest Man, Their Medical Importance and Control. By Patrick A. Buxton. Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $3.oo. 8' x 52;ix + II5; I940. It is apparent that our generation is the first in the history of mankind to think the human louse sufficiently important to warrant any particular activity from man other than that of scratching. In this important treatise Buxton has recorded much of the recently gathered knowledge of the human louse, with special reference to its life and activities, its importance as a vector for infectious diseases, its control, as well as the methods used in rearing it in the laboratory for experi- mental purposes. From the medical point of view, the treatment of the subject is complete. Much space is devoted to the relations of the louse to the Rickettsias and Spirochaetes responsible for typhus and relapsing fever respectively. The belief that each of these diseases is spread by rubbing either the feces or the fluids from the broken bodies of the lice into</page><page sequence="17">482 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY abrasians of the skin, rather than by the bite and blood sucking process of the louse, is thoroughly documented, and appears to be universally accepted. From a biological point of view, there are many gaps in our knowledge concerning the human louse. The author states, "There is no evidence that it [the louse] can establish itself and breed on other hosts. The only possible exception is of certain monkeys, from which lice hardly distinguishable from P. humanus have been recovered in zoological gardens; the simple experi- ment of infecting clean monkeys with human lice and observing the result has not yet been performed." 'Several records appear to suggest that the blood of some animals (especially of rodents) is poisonous to Pediculas; no one has performed the simple experi- ment of comparing the length of life after sucking guinea-pig or rat with that of controls on man, or even of unfed controls." "With regard to digestion [in the louse] nothing is known." In the admission of these gaps in our knowledge, Buxton suggests possibil- ities for research, though we wonder why these simple experiments were not performed by the author himself long ago-particularly the ones concerning the rearing of human lice on other hosts. If the human louse could be found to live, or could be induced to live and reproduce normally on a monkey, the present annoy- ing method of rearing them on human subjects for laboratory work would be eliminated. The text is well illustrated, completely indexed, and boasts a bibliography of io8 titles. THE RATTLESNAKES, GENERA SISTRURUS AND CROTALUS. A Study in Zoogeography and Evolution. Special Publication Number Four. By Howard K. Gloyd. The Chicago Acad- emy of Sciences, Chicago. $2-5o. 94 x 7; vii + 266 + [14 + 3I plates; 1940 (paper). The origin, evolution, and dispersion of the rattlesnake make up the content of this authoritative and scholarly dissertation. The fact that snakes make poor fossils has been responsible for the meager paleontological material concerning the origin of the rattlesnake. However, it is almost a certainty that the rattler had his origin in southwestern North America, and more particularly, the north central portion of the Mexican plateau. In general, the further the rattlesnake has migrated from this region, the greater have been the variations and specializa- tions in its evolutionary process. Ac- cording to the best evidence Gloyd has been able to gather, there was a wide- spread distribution of the genus Crotalus in the United States during Pleiocene times. Some 45 species of rattlesnakes are described in detail, particular note being made of the variations in size and color, the distribution, range, and the affinities for other species. A key to the species and sub-species of rattlesnakes, a bibli- ography of 303 titles, a complete index, as well as numerous tables, graphs, and photographic plates of many of the species listed, indicate the completeness of the work. FORAMINIFERA: Their Classification and Eco- nomic Use. Third Edition, Revised and Enlarged, with an Illustrated Key to the Genera. By Joseph A. Cushman. Harvard Uni- versity Press, Cambridge; Oxford University Press, London. $6.oo. 9 x 6; ix + 42.6 + 48 plates; I940. Biologists and palaeontologists are be- coming increasingly aware of the impor- tance of this great group of single-celled animals, of which nearly 500 genera are now recognized. In the oceans they occur in untold numbers, their tests (secreted material which hardens into shapes characteristic for each form) largely making up the thick ooze of the ocean floor. As fossils, in the Paleozoic and even younger formations, they formed thick limestone-the pyramids of Egypt are largely of such limestone. Since t e species have definite geologic and geo- graphic ranges, they are important in determining the age of sediments and the conditions under which they were de- posited. Commercially, their importance is indicated by the fact that many petro- leum companies now have in their labora- tories workers who have a special knowl-</page><page sequence="18">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 483 edge of fossil Foraminifera. In spite of the fact that several thousand papers have been written about the Foraminifera, practically nothing is yet known about the habits and physiologic character of the animal:-a new field for biological investigation is unfolding. In the present edition of this fine authoritative work the plates and key to the families and genera, which were published as a second volume in the second edition, have been added to the text under a single cover. The bibliography (58 pages) is extremely useful. An im- portant reference book for all biological laboratories. A STATISTICAL STUDY OF THE RATTLE- SNAKES. VII. The Rattle, Part I. Occa- sional Papers of the San Diego Society of Natural History. Number 6, May i8, I940. By Laurence M. Klauber. San Diego Society of Natural History, San Diego, Calif. 8' X 5 3; 6z; I940 (paper). This contribution maintains the high standard set by the author in his previous work on various aspects of the physiology and somatology of the rattlesnake. There are first discussed the many erroneous ideas concerning the use of the rattle: namely, as a mating call, as a call for help from other rattlers, to warn other rattlers from danger, to paralyze, decoy, charm, lure, and warn prey or other intruders, to prevent an attack on the tail, as a substitute for hissing, as a religious warning, and as a venom carrier. The author dismisses, with excellent reasons based on field observations, all the above suggested uses for the rattle except that of a warning to intruders. This he believes to be its sole function, and that it is put to this use only after procrypsis has been unsuccessful in pre- venting discovery. The discussion con- tains detailed analyses of the number and measurements of rattles from various species, together with the method of vibration, the process of growth and shedding, as well as a chemical analysis of the horny material which constitutes the rattle. Features which add to the usefulness of the paper are the table of contents and the list of I45 bibliographic references. A FIELD GUIDE TO THE BIRDS: Giving Field Marks of all Species Found East of the Rockies. Revised and Enlarged. By Rioger T. Peterson. Houghton Miffin Co., Boston. $z.75. 74 x 42; xx + i8o + 40 plates; I939. The need for a field guide based on the field markings of birds was the prompting circumstance for the writing of this book. The author expects it to be used to supple- ment the standard ornithological works in identifying live birds on the wing, or on trees, or thickets at a distance, by impressions, patterns, and distinctive markings, rather than by the minute anatomical measurements and markings used by collectors. In this edition, completely revised and enlarged, some 78 families of birds are described, including many genera and species native to that section of the North American continent east of the Rocky Mountains. The text is generously sup- plied with illustrations in color, and black and white. A list of home reference suggestions and an extensive index com- plete the volume. ZOOLOGICA.

Illustrated by Louis AgassiZ Fuertes, Allan Brooks and Roger T. Peterson. Houghton Miffin Co., Boston. $4.95. II4X 72; xxv + 554 + 97 plates; 1940. This volume is a revision and abridgement of Forbush's very fine work Birds of Massachusetts and other New England States. The junior author's task, by no means an easy one in following Forbush, has been extremely well done. The work, origi- nally in three volumes, has been abridged into one, and at the same time the field extended to include all the birds east of the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas, as far south as Florida, and north through eastern Canada. Something over ioo species have been added. The life history and detailed descriptions of all species and sub-species which are commonly found in this area, whether breeding birds, winter visitors, or migrants, are given; and in order to make the list quite com- plete the "stragglers" or "accidentals" of the region are given in an appendix- but without descriptions. Indexes are included for both scientific and common names and at the end of the volume are the fine colored illustra- tions by Fuertes, Allan Brooks, and Roger Peterson-97 plates altogether. The price of the book seems to us most moderate. WONDER CREATURES OF THE SEA. By A. Hyatt Verrill. D. Appleton-Cen- tury Company, New York and London. $3.oo. 8 X 5; xvi + 27Z + io plates; I940. Rapidly swelling book lists are science books written or popular consuniption with much of the superabundant esoteric terminology of the scientific world de- leted. Wonder Creatures of the Sea, a successful addition to the above-mentioned lists, describes the habits and dwelling places of invertebrates found on sea shores, in streams, tidepools, bays, and in the ocean's depths. There are splendid color and action descriptions of such denizens of the seas as sand-dollars, sea-urchins, king-crabs, starfishes, lob- sters, sea-cucumbers, sponges, spider-crabs, corals, sea-squirts, and innumerable others. The scientific status (families, genera, etc.) of the wonder creatures is omitted whenever possible as is also a minutely detailed description of their anatomy. There are many excellent line drawings by the author. Photographs and index are included. THE COD FISHERIES. The History of an International Economy. By Harold A. Innis. Yale University Press, New Haven; The Ryerson Press, Toronto; Oxford University Press, London. $3.50 94 x 64 ; xviii + 2-0; I940. Cod fishing was very important to the economics of the early inhabitants of the American sea coast. This harvest ob- tained from the sea for a long time rivalled the produce of the opening wilderness. Even today, although its importance has been relatively lessened by the rise of industry, it remains a world of its own in international economy, one in which the interplay of American, Canadian, and European interests has created a situation unique in history. The narrative begins with a chapter on European history. This is followed by a description of more recent times, when cod fisheries passed almost completely into the hands of the seamen of New England and Nova Scotia. The work contains many footnotes and is well indexed.</page><page sequence="20">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 485 STUDIES IN THE MECOPTERA. Containing: Biology and Morphology of Some North American Bittacidae (Order Mecoptera), by L. R. Setty; The Genital Anatomy and Mating Behavior of Boreus brumalis Fitch (Mecoptera), by Kenneth W. Cooper. The American Midland Naturalist, Uni- versity of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, Indiana. $i.oo. 9 X 54; III; I940 (paper).. The detailed report (including I78 line drawings, 68 references) on the biology and morphology of some of the hanging- flies of North America adds appreciably to the hitherto meager knowledge of these insects that are beneficial to man. Adult bittacids (the adaptation of their hind legs for food-getting is unique) feed on flying mosquitoes: the larvae are scaven- gers. In addition, the bittacids, in all stages, are excellent material for biology teaching. Much new material is included in the second of these papers (9 figures, 30 references). In spite of marked internal differences, the mating behavior of Boreus brumalis is identical with that of B. hymalis. Correspondingly, the external genitalia are remarkably similar. BRAIN AND BODY OF FISH. A Study of Brain Pattern in Relation to Hunting and Feeding in Fish. By H. Muir Evans. The Blakiston Co., Philadelphia. $3.50. 91 X 6; I64; 1940. The author has chosen Brain and Body of Fish for his title because this condenses in a phrase the remarkable fact that the external conformation of the brain of a bony fish indicates its habits and mode of feeding. In other words, the study of the external condition of the brain in bony fish is an index of the development of those organs belonging to the various sensory faculties. The brain patterns, bodily structure, and habits of such teleosts as the Cyprinidae (carps), Clupeidae (herrings), flat-fishes (halibuts, soles, flounders, plaices, tur- bots), Gadidae (cods), and the Anguil- lidae (eels) are described and the relation between form and function discussed. Numerous drawings by the author illus- trate the text material. There is a brief table of contents, but unfortunately no index to either the text or the drawings. THE BRANCHIOBDELLIDAE (OLIGOCHAETA) OF NORTH AMERICAN CRAYFISHES. Con- tribution from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Illinois No. S37. By Clarence J. Goodnight. University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $i.oo. io2 x 7; 75; I940 (paper). This is a monograph of annelid worms symbiotic with crayfish, of which nine genera and twenty-one species are known to inhabit the rivers of North America. Of these, three species and one genus are new and another genus has not hitherto been reported from this continent. There are also a few new terms of subgeneric and subspecific rank introduced. The geo- graphic ranges of these animals are quite extensive, and seem to be independent of the size of the stream in which they occur. Also there is no host specificity, so that any worm may cohabit with any crayfish. There are sixty-four items in the bibli- ography, the oldest of which dates from i8O5. CHECK-LIsT OF BIRDS OF THE WORLD. Volume IV. By James Lee Peters. Harvard University Press, Cambridge; Oxford University Press, London. $4.00. 9 x 6; xii +'29I; I940. Volume 4 of this invaluable check list (for Volume I, cf. Q.R.B., Vol. 7, No. 3: for Volume 3, cf. Q.R.B., Vol. iS, No. 4) deals with the cuckoos (including the African family of plantain-eaters), owls, goatsuckers, and swifts. The treatment of the forms has been brought up to 3I December, I938, although a few forms described in I939 are included. Mostly, these orders have not been completely described since the turn of the last century. It is interesting at this stage in the development of the Check-List to compare the number of genera and species of Sharp's Volume I, issued in I899, with the forms recognized in the first four volumes of Peters (I93I-I940) covering the same orders: Sharp lists 830 genera, 36X6 spe- cies; Peters lists 569 genera, 5 io6 forms.</page><page sequence="21">486 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY ANTILLEAN TERRAPINS.

IS2 X IO; 35 + 9 plates; I940 (paper). The West Indian terrapins of the genus Pseudemys comprise a section of the wide- ranging scripta group, being most closely allied to the Central American P. scripta ornata. The scripta group is distributed, through a series of integrading forms, from North Carolina into South America. Nine forms are listed and described in this monograph-in the terrapen sub-groups, five forms of which two are new sub- species; in the stejnegeri sub-group, four forms of which one is a new species and one a new subspecies. A bibliography of 58 titles accompanies the text-also a group of very fine colored plates (3I fgures). AMOUR DE LA CHASSE. By Jean-E. Benech. Editions Stock, Paris. i8 francs. 72 x 42; I73; I939 (paper). This little book traces the life of the hunter and his joys and sorrows from the time he listens of an evening, as a little tot, to the stories of his elders; learning the habits of animals and to recognize their tracks; the time when he is first allowed to handle a gun; his first hunt and his later experiences up to the time when he is an old man and has to content himself by reciting his "adventures" to a younger generation. Delightfully writ- ten, the book also contains much material on the habits and food of animals and birds, and the aspects of the country-side during the four seasons. ANIMAL BIOLOGY. Second Edition. By Robert H. Wolcott. McGraw-HilI Book Co., New York and London. $3.50. 9 x 6; xxi + 649; I940. This edition differs little in aim and presentation from that of the first edition (Q.R.B., Vol. 9, No. I). It is an ele- mentary textbook in zoology. The vol- ume is not intended as a reference and for this reason technicalities are minimized. All morphology is eliminated as the author holds this portion of zoology is best handled by laboratory work. The book possesses many new illustrations, a, glossary, and an index.

I2 X 3 XXiV + 34I; I940. This facsimile of the first medical book of the Western Hemisphere, preceded by a foreword by Henry Sigerist, a lengthy preface on the construction of the manu- script, early knowledge of materia medica, Aztec folklore of medicine, etc., which prepare the reader for the fare that is to come, is indeed a remarkable book. And as one continues on to the end one becomes more and more grateful not only to Dr. Emmart, whose untiring and persistent efforts have made this such a memorable volume, but to all those individuals and groups whose aid, financially and other- wise, have made it possible for such an important and expensive work to be ac- quired at such a low price. It is a treasure that should be on biological book-shelves and in private libraries, as well as avail- able in public libraries for exhibition purposes. The original, a little book, 6 inches wide, 8* inches high, and 4 of an inch thick, bound in crimson velvet, has lain for perhaps three centuries at least in the Vatican Library, its very existence un- known until comparatively recently. On the first fly-leaf is in Latin the following inscription [we give Emmart's transla- tion]: "A little book of Indian medicinal herbs composed by a certain Indian physician of the College of Santa Cruz, who has no theoretical learning, but is well taught by experience alone. In the year of our Lord Saviour i55z." In the early period following the Mexi- can conquest the Spaniards established schools and colleges in order to acquaint the Aztecs (one of the most intelligent of the American Indian races) with European culture; and shortly the students were able to speak fluently in both Spanish and Latin. To instruct them in the art of medicine a native physician, Martinus de la Cruz, was brought to the College of Santa Cruz in Talaltelolco-the first college of higher education to be estab- lished in the New World. It was Marti- nus who wrote the text of this little treatise on Mexican medicinal plants and native remedies. Another native, one of the early students, and later "Reader in Latin" at the college, Juannes Badianus, translated the text into Latin. A table of contents groups the material into I3 chapters, each dealing with a different group of afflictions which tend to range from the head to the feet. In the treatment and cure of these ailments practically all members of the plant king- dom found in Mexico were used-from small rock plants to large trees; from aquatic to desert forms. Among the most interesting of the native Aztec remedies are the narcotics and analgesics. The 87 pages of plant illustrations have been most skillfully reproduced in the present volume and show the brilliant colors of the original manuscript. It is uncertain whether Martinus or Badianus made the original paintings, but they were beautifully and carefully executed. While they perhaps are inferior in techni- cal detail when compared with the i5th and i6th century herbals of Europe, they compare very favorably with those of the I3th and I4th centuries. As in the Euro- pean herbals the illustrations are of a constant size regardless of the natural size of the plant.

THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO SOILLESS GAR- DENING. By W. F. Gericke. Prentice-Hall, New York. $2.75. 9 x 6; xvi + z85; I940. GARDENING WITHOUT SOIL. By A. H. Phillips. Chemical Publishing Co., New York. $2..oo. 82 x 52; I37; I940. The last word in hydroponics will un- doubtedly not be written until sometime in the far future, but, to date, Gericke's scholarly and authoritatively written vol- ume presents all the worthwhile theories, techniques, hopes, and trends of this relatively new phase of botany. In spite of the fact that the soilless method of rearing plants was known and used in plant physiology laboratories since the middle of the last century, Gericke is recognized as the father of hydroponics, because it was he who first grasped the practical significance of the field and prepared the way for its growing success in com etition with regular agriculture. In a dition to the discussions on the methods and materials of hydroponics, Gericke suggests the way for profitable investigation in the future, and makes a strong plea for soilless gardening as one of the answers to the present world economic dilemma. The text is gen- erously supplied with illustrations, and the work is concluded with a useful glossary and a complete index. The second of these volumes, intended for the British public, includes nothing new or original in the field of soilless gardening. The subject is presented in a brief and exact fashion, by one who has a well-grounded knowledge of the physi- ology of plant growth, and should prove quite helpful to those who have a few minutes each evening to spend on this interesting and worthwhile phase of botany. THE EVOLUTION OF THE LAND PLANTS [EMBRYOPHYTA]. By Douglas H. Campbell. Stanford Uni- versity Press, Stanford University, Calif.; Oxford University Press, London. $6.5o. 9x 6; ix + 73I; I940. For the trained botanist this book makes most interesting reading. "Plants are, on the whole, far more conservative than animals, and most of the existing types can be traced back to a very remote period." Close rela- tionships between any two groups can only be found among the simpler forms. ". . . some of the most successful living plant types retain certain primitive characters." It is the present practice to class all forms below the mosses (bryophytes) in a single sub- kingdom, yet "the inclusion in a single subkingdom, of such a heterogeneous assemblage of evidently divergent types is decidedly unscientific. . ." On the other hand, the three groups of higher plants (mosses, ferns, and seed plants) are treated as inde- pendent subkingdoms ". . . although it is generally recognized that these three groups are essentially similar in their reproduction. here is abundant reason for placing these three groups in a single sub- kingdom, Embryophyta, as is done by Engler." The essential similarity in the reproduc- tion of embryophytes was demonstrated nearly 8o years ago by Hofteister, but the old classification has still been retained. This book is concerned with tracing the relationships among the different members of the embryophytes (the typical green land plants) as well as their rela- tionships with their nearest relatives among the algae. Campbell draws upon an abundance of literature as well as his own researches in reaching his conclusions. The detailed treatment of the subject matter, the documentation of the chap- ters, the 350 figures almost all of which give several views, and the detailed index give testimony to the care with which the volume has been prepared. THE SCIENCE AND PRACTICE OF CONSERVA- TION: Grass and Forage Crops. In Two Volumes. By S. J. Watson. Fertiliser and Feeding Stuffs Journal, London. 30s. net. 94 x 5 ; xi + vii + 8zo; I939 (paper). The main object of these volumes is to give a detailed and conservative account of the studies on the conservation of</page><page sequence="24">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 489 fodder crops at Jealott's Hill (Jealott's Hill Research Station, Bracknell, Berks, England). In addition, all relevant and important findings, which an examination of the extensive literature from all parts of the world has yielded, have been in- corporated. Each of the 23 sections is as complete as it has been possible to make it. In order to give a general idea of the manner in which the subject matter is arranged we have selected Chapter I3, which is on the losses involved in making silage, and have given the topics around which the discussion takes place: Nature of the losses in silage-making; Measure- ment of losses; The losses in grass silage; The losses in silage made from legumes, alone or with an admixture of grass; The losses in the ensilage of silage mixtures; The losses in the ensilage of maize and other carbohydrate-rich crops; Compari- son of losses in the different groups; Losses of mineral constituents; Loss of vitamins; Conclusions. The different sections contain much tabular matter and lengthy reference lists and at the end of Volume II are author and subject indexes. An important work. DESERT WILD FLOWERS. By Edmund C. Jaeger. Stanford University Press, Stanford University; Oxford Uni- versity Press, London. $3.50. 81 X 5x2; xii + 32.24 I940. The name of Edmund C. Jaeger on the title page of any volume is adequate certifica- tion of its excellence, and this one is worthy of its predecessors. It is to be hoped, however, that it will not be too successful in popularizing the desert, as the vandalous raids made upon this region by Philistines of a nearby metropo- lis have got past the stage where they are merely a scandal. There is probably a greater number of species of flowering plants in the Colorado deesert than in any other equal area in the United States, and the need for a reliable textbook containing descriptions and illus- trations is evident. This is not so much a field-book as a laboratory manual and if specimens are brought into the laboratory their identification will be greatly fa- cilitated. The work is amply illustrated by drawings and photographs. The latter are especially worthy of mention. A somewhat unusual but interesting feature is the wealth of biographical material about persons otherwise forgotten, but whose names are perpetuated in those of the plants. These names as well as the names of the plants are included in the six and a half page index. COMPETITION AMONG GRAINS. By N. Jasny. Food Research Institute, Stanford University, Calif. $4.00. 82 x 5 4; xiii + 6o6; I940. A work destined to be of great value for reference to all those in any way concerned with grains. The author's extensive ex- perience in Russia, Germany, and the United States, and his familiarity with the literature have well fitted him to produce an authoritative survey. The purpose of the study is to indicate the major influences rcsponsible for the prcsent distribution of world production and world trade among the individual grains and the major long-run changes in this distribution. To fulfill this task the competitivc position of cach grain must be studied in the spheres of both consumption and production. T-o find spacc for a rather detailcd analysis of both production and marketing phases, the study had to bc Iimited to a few goods only.... The term "grain" as here used refers specifically to only five grains: wheat, rye, barley, oats, and corn; and attention is directed principally to the production of these crops for grain rather than for hay, silage, and pasturc. The study is furthermore primarily concerned with the occidental parts of the world's temperate zones. Even within this territory, countries not participating in world trade could in general be given only passing attention. Charts, tables and diagrams exhibit the data effectively and the work concludes with appendix notes and tables and a useful index. RocKY MOUNTAIN TREES. A Handbook of the Native Species with Plates and Distribu- tion Maps. By Richard J. Preston, Jr. Iowa State</page><page sequence="25">490 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY College Press, Ames. $2..oo. 7 x S; lxxxi + 285; I940. The Rocky Mountain trees for the separate states have been classified in a number of pamphlets but not until the appearance of the present volume have the characteris- tics of the trees for the entire Rocky Mountain region been gathered into one concise key. Hence this authoritative work fills a real need in the field of forestry. The text includes discussions of the topography of the Rocky Mountain region as well as the general characteristics of trees. Numerous plates showing the leaf, twig, flower, fruit, and bark of many species, as well as distribution and zone maps, descriptions of botanical and silvi- cal characters, check lists of species by states, and extensive keys, give an indica- tion of the comprehensiveness of the work. The inclusion of all native and naturalized trees of the Rocky Mountain region num- bering some 2.52 species representing 85 genera and 40 families is also indicative of the vast field covered. A useful glossary, a selected bibliog- raphy, and a complete index conclude the volume. PLANT MICROTECHNIQUE. By Donald A. Johansen. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York and London. $4.50. 9 x 6; xi + 523; I940. The author states that "the main purpose of the book is to acquaint the user with the principles and procedures of all phases of botanical microtechnique." He suc- ceeds admirably in 5oo pages in giving clear, concise directions for the most usable laboratory methods. The first section describes the standard techniques in detail; the second takes up each phylum separately and discusses the special meth- ods that have been developed for handling its members. There is an extensive bibli- ography. The' author has had experience in his own laboratory with the majority of the procedures given, and has much that is pertinent to say on their applica- tions. He also includes a list of sources for living material as well as for apparatus and stains. The botanist of any degree will desire access to this book. RUBBER LATEX. By Henry P. Stevens and W. H. Stevens. Chemical Publishing Co, New York. $2.oo. 82 x S2; 2.2.4; 1940. A study of rubber latex from its source to the various products in which it is utilized. The book contains much in- formation in concise form that should be quite valuable in the laboratories of manufacturers using latex in their prod- ucts, and who seek to further diversify its application. Data are given on the properties of latex and its composition, also methods of stabilization and manipu- lation. A chapter is devoted to the process of vulcanization, and subsequent chapters discuss various methods of using latex, and its application in the produc- tion of numerous articles. The book further records a long list of British pat- ents applying to its utilization and con- tains a bibliography comprising books and journals that may be consulted for amplified investigation.

Manager of Publications, Delhi. Rs. S. iS or 5S. 92 X 64; xiii + I40 + 6 photo- graphs + 32. plates; I937. In order to facilitate the study of the distribution and life history of the para- site-carrying mosquitoes by the officers of the Malaria Survey of India this study of the vegetation and plant associations of tanks, ponds, marshes, etc. has been made. The material is in the form of a handy volume, with a minimum of tech- nical terms, and the keys are so arranged that the principal distinguishing char- acters come first to notice. A glossary, an index, photographic illustrations, and many line drawings (with detailed ex- planations) help to make this an extremely useful book for its intended purpose. MANUAL OF CULTIVATED TREES AND SHRUBS Hardy in North America: Exclusive of the Subtropical and Warmer Temperate Regions. Second Edition Revised and En- larged. By Alfred Rehder. The Macmillan Com- pany, New York. $io.5o. 82 X 5x 2 xxx + 996; I940. Since the first appearance of this useful reference book thirteen years ago (cf. Q.R.B., Vol. z, No. 4) many new species and varieties have been introduced into cultivation, new hybrids have appeared, and changes in nomenclature have been made. The present edition has been thoroughly revised and enlarged. In some instances the whole genus has been re- written. There have been some changes made in the zones of hardiness for plants and a new enlarged map of the zones provided. An invaluable guide to the horticulturalist and all those interested in trees and shrubs. MICROBES BY THE MILLION. By Hugh Nicol.

By Lothar Geitler. Verlag von Gebruder Borntraeger, Berlin. RM i.So. 88 X 5; iv + Z7; 1940 (paper). The writer at the beginning of this monograph points out the difficulties and time consumption attending the older methods of fixation and staining of bio- logical material. The techniques which he treats may be separated into two groups: the aceto-carmine group and the osmicocid group. Carmine dissolved in acetic acid colors intensely the chromatin of the resting nucleus and the chromo- somes. The acetic acid acts as a fixative and for this reason the stain is used simultaneously for fixation and coloring. The stain is prepared by mixing 45 parts of acetic acid (conc.) with 55 parts of water (dist.) and to this is added approxi- mately 5 grains of carmine. The solution is weakly heated for 2 to I hour. After cooling the solution is filtered. The dye may be modified by using 2. to 3 parts of alcohol (abs.) and I part of acetic acid (conc.). In the use of osmic acid as a fixative in connection with the smear procedure a 2. per cent solution of osmic acid is used. T7he addition of one drop of a I per cent chromic acid solution is held to improve the osmic acid solution. Several modifications and procedures for the use of the foregoing preparations are given. The work contains several illustrations. GROWTH: A Journal for Studies of Develop- ment and Disease. Supplement. First Sym- posium on Development and Growth. The Editors of Growth, Dairy Building. Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y. Sub- scription $5.oo per volume annually (outside U. S. and Canada, $5.50). Single numbers $z.oo. 94 x 63; III; I939 (paper). These proceedings of the first symposium of the Society for Development and Growth aim at the integration of knowledge from several branches of biology toward the solution of this problem. The growth of tissues in cultures has shed light on cell division, morphogenesis, and differentia- tion, as described in a contribution by Warren Lewis. Other articles discuss the chemical factors in growth and devel- opment, while several geneticists show the status of genes as evocators of de- velopmental processes. Another method of attack is presented by Oscar Schotte in his lucid account of studies on regenera- tion of tissues. Finally the evidence from differentiation of higher plants is described by Edmund Sinnott. Certainly such synthesis of knowledge in the attack on biological problems cannot fail in the long run to produce valuable results. ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LYM- PHATIC SYSTEM IN THE OPOSSUM (Didelphys marsupialis L. var. virginiana Kerr). By Arnold A. Zimmermann. University of Illinois Press, Urbana. $2..5o (paper); $3 oo (cloth). I021X 7 ';I97; I940. This detailed study on the origin and development of the lymphatic system in the opossum refutes the Sabin theory on lymphatic genesis (direct centrifugal out- growth from the venous endothelium) and confirms the mesenchymal origin of the lymphatic system and its genetic independence of the venous system. In addition, new evidence is offered for the refutation of the theory on the venous origin of the jugular lymph sacs. The author utilized the following material: (i) an extensive Wistar Institute collec- tion of sectioned series of opossum em- bryos ranging from the 8-somite medullary plate stage to birth; (X) sectioned series (Wistar) of two post-natal stages; (3) pouch-young taken directly from a breed- ing colony CWistar); and (4) older pouch- young from biological supply houses. There are many graphic reconstructions, photomicrographs, section drawings, pho- tographs, camera lucida drawings, and anatomical sketches. A bibliography is appended. THE MECHANISM OF THE HUMAN VOICE. By Robert Curry. Foreword by Douglas Guthrie. Longmans, Green and Co., New</page><page sequence="28">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 493 York and Toronto. $3.00. 8x 8;iX+ 105; I940. The studies of speech and hearing possess so many facets that few people have a knowledge sufficiently comprehensive to integrate them. The present book is an attempt to bring together the great body of literature dealing with the anatomy, physiology, and acoustics of voice. It is obvious from the length of the volume that a considerable portion of the avail- able information has been omitted. Rec- ognizing this limitation, the author has made an effort to present the more im- portant aspects and to amplify those which are least adequately treated. In addition to detailed accounts of the struc- ture and action of the vocal mechanism, he reviews the experimental methods and results of speech analysis. Further chap- ters deal with hearing, speech disorders, and the singing voice. he book will be valuable to scientists and teachers whose work concerns the human voice, especially in view of the extensive bibliography which it contains. ELEMENTARY MICROTECHNIQUE. Second Edition. By H. Alan Peacock. Edward Arnold and Co., London; Longmans, Green and Co., New York. $z.40. 74 x 4a; viii + 330; 1940. The value of a book of methods and for- mulae inexpensive enough to be within the reach of students is evident in the publication of the second edition of this volume. (For review of the first edition, see Q.R.B., II, page I07). The material, including concise discussions of cellular and protoplasmic structure, the principles underlying the use of laboratory instru- ments, the preparations and uses of stains and media, and even the collection and preservation of living material for study, has been rearranged into a form which the author feels to be more Iusable. The organization is such that details are easily located. Although the book is intended especially as a text for the be- ginner, the advanced student will find it a handy working reference. THE PINEAL ORGAN: The Comparative Anat- omy of Median and Lateral Eyes, with special reference to the Origin of the Pineal Body; and a description of the Human Pineal Organ considered from the Clinical and Surgical Standpoints. By Reginald J. Gladstone and Cecil P. G. Wakeley. The Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Baltimore. $iO.oO. 9 8 x 62; xvi + 528; I940. This book is the outcome of a desire to study the pineal body from the broad standpoint of comparative anatomy, and to correlate as far as possible the struc- tural appearance and connections of the mammalian epiphysis with the conflicting views which are held with regard to its origin and functions. The authors hope that the book will be of interest to readers outside as well as within the medical profession and that it will stimulate the study of other organs and systems of the human body from the standpoint of comparative anatomy, in addition to the purely practical aspect. Special care has been taken in selecting and making the numerous illustrations, each of which has an independent explanatory legend. A glossary, bibliography, and an unusually complete index are valuable adjuncts to the book. THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE MAM- MARY GLANDS. With special reference to the udder of cattle. By Charles W. Turner. University Co- operative Store, Columbia, Missouri. $3.50. ii x 8; [6] + 377 + 54 plates; I939 (paper). The five sections of this manual (an out- growth of a mimeographed publication in I933) are as follows: The gross anatomy of the mammary glands of cattle (6 chapters); Microscopic anatomy of the udder of cattle (4 chapters); The com- parative anatomy of the mammary gland (5 chapters; Monotremata through the Rodentia); Anatomy of the mammary glands of the hoofed mammals (6 chap- ters; swine, goat, sheep, horse, elephant, certain marine mammals); The anatomy of the mammary iglands of the Primates</page><page sequence="29">494 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY (2. chapters; lemurs, monkeys, apes, and man).

The fact that this work has gone through seven editions sufficiently attests to its acceptance by the teaching profession. It is a clear, concise treatise dealing with the salient points of human anatomy and physiology. Members of the nursing profession will find the book especially helpful. The author has inserted surgical and clinical notes which are correlated with the subject matter of the text. The many tables and illustrations also add much to the text proper. L'ANATOMIA COMPARATA NEL QUADRO DELLA BIOLOGIA MODERNA. By Mario F. Canella. Nicola Zanichelli Editore, Bologna. L. io. 9 X 51; xiii + 57; I937 (paper). The author begins with the statement that since the beginning of the present century the study of descriptive and com- parative anatomy has fallen into discredit, as a biological science, at least in Italy, France, and Germany. The brochure has been prepared in an attempt to rectify this state of affairs, as the author believes that comparative anatomy is, and should be considered, a fundamental part of the biological sciences. His arguments are based on the r6le that a knowledge of comparative anatomy and its techniques play in morphology and physiology. Bibliographical annotations are given. A TEXTBOOK OF HISTOLOGY. Eighth Edi- tion. By Harvey E. Jordan. D. Appleton- Century Co., New York and London. $7.00. 9' x 62; ix + 690; 1940. This excellent text has become well known since its first appearance in I9I6. The present edition (6th edition noticed in Q.R.B., Vol. 6, p. 2.42) has been thor- oughly revised, and the chapter on blood has been completely rewritten. The chap- ters on technique and laboratory work have been omitted, since the author feels that most teachers now prefer to write their own working directions. The bibli- ography has been reassembled to include all of the more important publications of recent years. REPRODUCTION AMONG MAMMALS.

University of Chi- cago Press, Chicago. iS cents. 74 X 54; iv + z6; 1940 (paper). This 26-page pamphlet contains the script of the Erpi instructional sound film of the same title, with a few introductory notes and a bibliography. Several diagrams from the film are included with the text. The language is simple, and the story concise and complete. The film is one of those used in the large freshman survey courses at the University of Chicago. PHYSIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY THE ENGLISHMAN'S FOOD. A History of Five Centuries of English Diet. By J. C. Drummond and Anne Wilbraham. Jonathan Cape, London. its. 6d. net. 814x543; 574 + i6 plates; 1939. An extraordinarily interesting book that both the general reader and the food expert will enjoy. The authors (senior author, Professor of Bio-Chemistry in University College) have quite sensibly allowed the technical treatment of the subject to be overshadowed by the his-</page><page sequence="30">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 495 torical. Yet the historical is made all the more interesting by being interpreted by specialists. From many different angles the changing character of the English diet during the past five centuries is dis- cussed. It is the bearing which the social and economic conditions have had upon these changes-indeed, the interrelation- ships of many different factors-that makes this a fascinating book. Meat, game, and fish formed the main fare in the early days. Since keeping live stock through the winter months was little understood, all but the young and vigorous were slaughtered and dried or pickled for winter consumption. The pigeon-loft furnished fresh meat for the well-to-do; and, of course, game was procurable. As early as the i3th and i4th centuries regulations were formulated prohibiting the cookshops from selling to the poorer classes pies made from tainted meat. Spices were used by all classes either to disguise the strong flavor of meat, or to pep up its insipid taste. Fish, mostly salted and not always when it was exactly fresh, was abundant. Oys- ters in 1491, were sold for 4 d. a bushel. There are few references to vegetables and fruits in the literature. Cabbage was only used in soups; salads of onions and herbs were popular. Vegetables were supposed to engender wind and melancholy. But- ter, by the upper classes was thought only fit to be used in cooking; the poorer classes used it more widely. All classes used a great deal of cheese. The authors quote freely from the litera- ture throughout the five-century period -from Arthur Young, Pepys, Defoe, Parson Woodforde, Smollett, Burton, An- dre Simon, John Grove, and many others. Among the many topics discussed are changes in physical conditions of the different classes, changing medical views, scurvy, food adulteration, hospital, prison and workhouse diets, food distribution, and finally the great changes in dietetics which have been gradually taking place since the turn of the last century. Scat- tered throughout the book are illustra- tions reproduced from different sources. We particularly like the reproduction of the frontispiece from The Family Oracle of Health (opposite page 396) where Dr. Kitchiner is about to be arrested "for eating live oysters and thereby contraven- ing Martin's Bill for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals." ACCEPTED FoODs and Their Nutritional Significance. Containing Descriptions of the Products Which Stand Accepted by the Council on Foods of the American Medical Association on September i, 1939. Council on Foods of the American Medical Association, Chicago. $z.oo. 82 X 5x8; xx + 492; 1939- The question of the nutritional value of foods is deservedly occupying the atten- tion of those qualified to express an opin- ion upon it, and this book is a compila- tion of results attained by the Council on Foods, working under the sponsorship of the American Medical Association. The Council has done excellent work in assembling information on the formulae, vitamin content, chemical analysis, cal- ories, and methods of assembly and treatment of the various food products offered to the public by a goodly number of manufacturers and distributors. It also passes judgment on the nutritional and health claims set forth in the adver- tising matter that is used to further the sale of different foods. Those organiza- tions, whose products and advertising matter have been passed as satisfactory, are allowed to use the "Seal of Accept- ance" as an evidence that their products and advertising matter meet the require- ments of the Council. The book contains the names of numerous manufacturers and business houses who have applied for approval of their wares and have had them accepted, but it is noticeable that there are a large number of well-known high grade articles that have presumably not been presented to the Council for accept- ance, and one wonders whether the use of the Seal of Acceptance on advertising matter might gradually create a condition of public mind that would be unfair to companies or individuals who have not presented their products for approval, and who might determine, for reasons</page><page sequence="31">496 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY satisfactory to themselves, not to ask for this approval. While the immense amount of work done by the Council on Foo.ds is appreciated at its true value, it would seem to have been wiser to have examined and passed on all manufactured and assembled food products, rather than to leave it to individuals to apply to the Council for its approval. As the pro- cedure stands now, in less responsible hands it might conceivably be called a racket. DYNAMICS OF INFLAMMATION. An Inquiry into the Mechanism of Infectious Processes. By Valy Menkin. The Macmnillan Co., New York. $4.50. 81 x 54; Xii + 2.44; I940. The author has recorded and considered in the light of his own experience observa- tions pertaining to "the disturbed physi- ological and bioche-mical equilibria occur- ring in an area of acute injury." The outstanding phases of inflammation, in order of development, are: (a) increased fluid passage through the capillary endo- thelial wall, which seems to have two primary factors, elevation in capillary pressure and increased capillary perme- ability; (b) localization or fixation of the irritant, that is, walling-off of the in- flamed area; and (c) migration of leu- cocytes. The relations between the physical basis of infectious processes and immunity in the organism as a whole have led to the formulation of a dynamic concept of inflammation. Leukotaxine, a crystalline nitrogenous substance released by injured tissue, apparently is concerned with both the migration of leucocytes and the increased capillary permeability. In turn the number and kind of leucocytes which are present influence the rate of metabolism and the hydrogen-ion con- centration of the inflamed area. Thus a highly complex mechanism which tends to localize and dispose of a bacterial or chemical irritant is put into action when inflammation sets in. This concept gives a rational interpretation to the r6le of inflammation in immunity. The author indicates several general lines for further study. Much more work, particularly of a quantitative sort, is certainly needed to clarify the interrela- tionships of the many factors involved in inflammation. LIVING LIGHT. By E. Newton Harvey. Princeton Univer- sity Press, Princeton. $4.00. 9 x 6; xv + 32.8; I940. To the unspecialized devotee of natural science perhaps the most mysterious phenomenon of nature is that of lumi- nescence. The flashing of fire-flies on a summer evening over a cultivated lawn, or the display of Medusae a month later in the ocean, is a familiar sight, yet familiarity in this instance does not breed contempt. When mankind needs artificial light he obtains it from the combustion of material-a wasteful process, but necessary to one who has not learned the secret of luminescence-the production of light without heat. The greater complexity of living light makes essential a certain amount of knowledge of other forms of luminescence and illumination. A great part of the book is devoted to the experiments of the physicists and chemists of earlier days, such as Boyle, Lavoisier, and Newton. The entire animal and plant kingdoms are then reviewed, as well as experiments upon them, the bibliography of which covers twenty-nine pages with about twenty entries on each page. Organic light is then discussed as to its physics, chemistry, physiology, intensity, effi- ciency, and color. An idea of the com- pleteness of this discussion may be gained from the fact that the mysterious N-rays, that caused a furore a generation ago, are included. These mythical radiations have no existence whatever; Harvey generously attributes them to an error in technique of the investigator who announced them prematurely. (But when this announce- ment was made there were many who believed that a deliberate fraud had been perpetrated.) There are seventeen pages of index, and many excellent illustrations, both photo- graphs and drawings.</page><page sequence="32">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 497 PHYSIQUE AND NUTRITION. A Study of European School Children in Pretoria, Union of South Africa. South African Council for Educational and Social Research Series No. x3. By Harding Le Riche. South African Council for Educational and Social Re- search, Pretoria. (Copies Obtainable from J. L. Schaik, Pretoria). 81 x 51; Vi + I58; I940 (paper). This monograph contains, besides a dis- cussion of methods of studying the nutri- tional status of a population, the report of an investigation on the frequency of malnutrition in Pretoria (Transvaal) white school children and of an inquiry into the food consumption of a sample of poor families. The author recognizes that the clinical evaluation of malnutrition by visual inspection can be unreliable and prefers to use the more objective A.C.H. index. On the basis of this he finds that between poor and well-to-do children the differences in frequency of malnutrition are not conclusive, that more boys than girls are malnourished, and that the occur- rence of malnutrition increases with age. The author's implicit faith in the A.C.H. index is rather surprising since the postu- lated relationship of this index to nutri- tional status is not yet accepted. Fur- thermore, from the author's data it appears that, as many others have shown, the well-to-do children are on the average larger than the poorer children. An examination of the food consumption of poor families reveals below average in- take of all the principal food elements. Although the findings reported here are interesting for comparative purposes their evaluation contributes little to the general problem of physique and nutrition. HEALTH IS WEALTH. By Paul de Kruif. Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $2.oo. 8 x 58; ix + 246; 1940. During a conversation on public health problems between the author and a group of physician friends one evening in I934, they arrived at the realization that an ounce of prevention being worth a pound of cure to the community could actually be expressed in monetary terms. With admirable faith and ardor they set about to inform the general public of this fact and consequently to formulate a health program of national scope. The main features of this program which apparently won the approval of conservative mem- bers of the American Medical Association as well as that of the Surgeon General are: (i) that under the supervision of the U. S. Public Health Service federal aid should be granted to the states for the care of the "medically" indigent; and (2.) that once having satisfied certain minimum requirements, the states should be free in the matter of administration of the funds received. Having succeeded in for- mulating this "non-controversial" pro- gram after five years of labor it remained only to receive the presidential blessing and support. In December, I939, the president consented to receive de Kruif, as spokesman for the group, and to listen to his proposal. Strangely enough, it turned out that notwithstanding his apparent solicitousness for national wel- fare Mr. Roosevelt was not interested. So the hopes of the author and his co- workers were shattered. This account of the gradual evolution and crystalliza- tion of the idea and its popularization through the medium of the author's arti- cles is written with the usual verve that characterizes de Kruif's works. BLOOD GROUPS. Reprinted from Tabulae Biologicae, Volumen z7, Pars 2. By William C. Boyd. W. junk, den Haag. 94 X 7; I38 + 2. folding plates; I939 (paper). The basic facts about blood groups are here presented insofar as possible in tabular form with a minimal amount of text. The first half of the material contains data on the determination of blood groups and on the medico-legal and therapeutic significance of such deter- minations. Information concerning the chemical and serological nature of the human blood agglutinogens and their relations to those of other species, as well as data on the problem of inheritance of blood groups in man, is presented. The second or anthropological section consists</page><page sequence="33">498 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY of tables giving the results obtained by many workers from studies on the fre- quency of the blood groups and the blood types in various countries, and ethnic groups throughout the world. Maps showing the geographical variations in the frequencies of the blood-group genes, as calculated according to the Bernstein theory from the available data, are in- cluded. An enormous quantity of perti- nent information has here been condensed into a relatively small space. The bibli- ography is comprehensive. EPIDEMIOLOGY IN COUNTRY PRACTICE. By William N. Pickles. With preface by Major Greenwood. Williams L Wil- kins Co., Baltimore. $-.5o. 81 x 51 viii + IIO; I939. The complexity of urban life makes it almost impossible to trace an epidemic to its source, while the comparative simplicity of life in rural communities increases the likelihood of finding not only the most recent contacts but the original source of infection as well. The opportunity for the study of infectious diseases in rural areas is well presented in this book. The author is an English country doctor who has published a num- ber of papers on epidemiology. What he has one shows what could be gained by encouraging similar efforts among doctors in the less densely populated regions. The author points out that, judging from his own experience, epidemiological records collected from many rural practi- tioners might noticeably modify our ideas on incubation time and duration of in- fectivity. His studies suggest a program of research that requires neither a big hospital nor a laboratory. The usefulness of such collections of records is easily apparent. ANNUAL REVIEW OF PHYSIOLOGY. Vol- ume 11. Edited by James M. Luck and Victor E. Hall. Annual Reviews, Inc., Stanford .University P. O., Calif. $s.oo. 81 x 6; vii + 50I; I940. Those of us who find that the best way of keeping in touch with current litera- ture is to make use of review journals, at least for fields other than our own research specialties, will welcome the Annual Review of Physiology. Continuing the good work done in the first volume (I939), the editorial committee has again brought together a number of authoritative articles on some of the more actively investigated phases . of physiology. Typical articles are those on the Lymphatic system, the Central nervous system, the Pharmacology of barbiturates, and Exercise. All of the articles are fine examples of critical survey. To review each paper separately would be impossible here. It must suffice to say that each is a well-rounded account of the subject which it discusses. The list of references given at the end of each paper is invaluable to anyone who wishes to pur- sue the subject further. There is also an author and a subject index for the volume. MORPHINE ADDICTION IN CHIMPANZEES. Comparative Psychology Monographs. Vol- ume i5, Numher 7. Series No. 7 By S. D. S. Spragg. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. $1.75. 10 x 61; I3.; I940 (paper). In this monograph are published the results of an investigation on the nature of morphine addiction in chimpanzees, a species of the anthropoid apes chosen for their close resemblance in behavioral capacities to man, and high degree of intelligent cooperation in experimental procedures. The results of the experi- ments on morphinism in chimnpanzees were compared to functional changes reported in clinical data on morphinism in man. The experiments were carried out on four young chimpanzees (3 males and i female) with dosage periods differ- ing for each animal-I3 months, 7 months, 4 months, and 6 weeks. During the period of drug administration physi- ological and behavioral functions in pre- dosage, post-dosage, and "withdrawal" periods were studied, and these results compared with the normal functions in</page><page sequence="34">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 499 pre-morphine studies on the same four infrahuman organisms. This type of in- vestigation is of great practical importance in the study of drug addiction in man. Tables, graphs, photographs, and refer- ences are included. THE HEALTH OF THE CHINESE IN AN AMERI- CAN CITY. San Francisco. By J. C. Geiger, Emmett E. Sappington, Roslyn C. Miller, and Hilda F. Welke. Department of Public Health,, San Fran- cisco. 82 X 5; 1 9; I939 (paper). This study of the health of the Chinese population of San Francisco is interesting from both the medical and biological standpoint. The general history shown indicates a decidedly bad housing situ- ation, and this, with a probable inclina- tion to resist medical attention and advice, has in the past resulted in unfavorable differences between the Chinese health records and that of the general population. However, over a ten-year period (I92.9- I938) we find the Chinese death rate sinking below that of the general popu- lation, and a remarkable decrease in infant mortality, due partly no doubt to educa- tion of Chinese mothers in modern meth- ods of caring for infants. The numerous statistical tables presented and the studies of the effect of environment and national characteristics, which furnish data as to Chinese susceptibility or resistance to various diseases, will be of value to biologists engaged in studies along these lines. MODERN DIABETIC CARE: Including Instruc- tions in the Diet and the Use of the Old and New Insulins. By Herbert Pollack. Harcourt, Brace and Co., New York. $2.oo. 8 x 58; Viii + 2-I4 + 4 plates; I940. It is rather obvious that in the care and treatment of diabetes mellitus some accu- mulation of knowledge, by the affected individual, of the causes leading to this disease and a clearer understanding of his physical reactions to its effects, would help considerably in its control, especially when aided by the observations and advice of an intelligent physician. This work is eminently fitted to furnish the diabetic layman with the requisite information, and is couched in language easily under- stood. The book treats of the causes of diabetes and the most advanced methods of its treatment, and also furnishes a very complete study of diabetic dietetics, in which part Marie V. Kraus is co-author. Physicians can undoubtedly use this publi- cation to advantage and biologists will find information which will possibly be useful in some fields of research-probably in the study of heredity, where in many instances the question is as yet an open one. DERMATOLOGIC THERAPY IN GENERAL PRACTICE. By Marion B. SulZberger and Jack Wolf. The Year Book Publishers, Chicago. $4.50. 8 x 2; 68o; I940. This exhaustive text embodies a clearly- written, easily-understood, and precise treatise in which are detailed only those elements of the management of the "com- moner" skin diseases and syphilis which will prove practical and useful to every physician. The objective of the book, therefore, is to describe as fully and com- pletely as possible those procedures and medicaments which every physician can promptly apply. The authors are to be commended especially on their judicious selection of topics. This compact "work- bench" of dermatology puts the necessary tools in the physician's hands and tells him exactly how to use them to best advantage. Points of special value to note are: 266 tried and proved prescrip- tions, group photographs to simplify differential diagnosis, step-by-step direc- tions, immediately- usable techniques, and time-saving tables and summaries. The volume is indexed and plentifully supplied with illustrations and lists of further references. A COLLEGE TEXTBOOK OF HYGIENE. Third Edition. By Dean Franklin Smiley and Adrian G.</page><page sequence="35">500 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY Gould. The Macmillan Co., New York. $2.o5o. 83 x 551; xiii + 539; I940. The earlier editions of this widely-used textbook were reviewed in Vol. 3, p. 590, and in Vol. IO, P. 2.39. Although the student will still find the subject matter classified under thirteen section headings mostly based upon the various systems of the body, he will note that in this edition for the first time many of the community health problems are discussed in direct association with the presentation of the personal hygiene material. Outstanding changes in the personal hygiene subject matter include a discussion of pneumonia, a new chapter on air conditioning and ventilation, a discussion of appendicitis, and a new chapter on the use of medical services. Bibliographies and references are appended to each chapter. In the appendix the prone pressure method of artificial respiration is given in detail. A glossary of technical terms and an index complete the book. ME,DICAMENTS ANTIANPMIQUES ET ANkMIES EXPE'RIMENTALES. By Jean Cheymol. Preface by Rene' HaZ- ard. Masson et Cie, Paris. 50 cents. 8 x 512; [41 + IOI; I940 (paper). Despite the fact that anemias are among the oldest recognized ailments of mankind, it is only within recent years that any progress has been made in their treatment. The multitude of factors which are in- volved make these afflictions particularly difficult to study. In this as in other diseases, one of the most fruitful and promising methods of attack is by experi- mentation on lower animals and applica- tion of the results, as far as possible, to man. The initial section of this book discusses mainly the experiments of Whip- ple, Castle, Minot, and Murphy on the treatment of pernicious anemias by various extracts. The remaining pages describe the experimental introduction of anemias in laboratory animals and the testing of antianemic medication in these diseased forms. This small volume is an excellent compendium of the patient research which thus far has met with only partial success, but holds promise for the future. There is a bibliography of 2.48 titles. THE STORY OF DENTISTRY: from the Dawn of Civilip,zation to the Present. By M. D. K. Bremner. Dental Items of Interest Publishing Co., Brooklyn, N. Y.; Henry Kimpton's Medical House, London. $3.75. 9 x 6j; xix + 2.I1; I939. In presenting this unpretentious volume the author makes no claims of originality, but he has obviously accomplished much in compiling this first "complete-in-one- volume"' history of dentistry from pre- historic times to the present. This is the first time, also, that dental history has been treated in its relationship to the social and cultural environment. The book is written for the rank and file and not for the chosen few. However, al- though the story is told in lighter vein, there has been no deviation from the facts as found in the original sources. The simple, nontechnical style of The Story of Dentistry recommends it to every intelligent reader who will find much of interest and value between its covers. The volume is supplied with a complete index and is illustrated with photographs and brief biographical sketches or out- standing leaders of the dental profession through the years.

The question as to whether the Jews are more susceptible to diabetes than other races is here presented in an interesting discussion of the subject. The numerous statistical references presented would seem to indicate that Jews, especially in the older age groups, do show a greater per- centage of diabetes than other races do, but whether it is a hereditary racial weak- ness or is due to possible environmental factors is not reasoned out to a definite end. It is quite evident that only con- tinued biological study can eventually answer the question. A reading of this book will furnish some facts useful in further research on the subject.

Although a few pages of this book are devoted to dietary deficiencies in South Africa, in the main it discusses malnutri- tion generally. In Africa, as in other parts of the world, the problem is not that the people fail to get a sufficient quantity of food, but the proper chemical and vitamin constituents are lacking. The first section of the book outlines the principal dietary essentials, following which is a comparison of several South African diets to what may be considered a normal allowance. A number of sug- gestions are offered as to the methods by which malnutrition might be remedied. LA S'ENESCENCE ET LE RAJEUNISSEMENT. Traduction libre de l'allemand. By Paul Niehans.

The Macmillan Co., New York. $8.oo. 9x X 68; viii + 684; I940. The increasingly important position of biochemistry in medicine makes this a book of exceptional interest to all who deal with man's ills. In many instances the difference between normal and path- ological conditions in the human body is very slight. Frequently an altered biochemical reaction is one of the earliest indications of disorder, and in almost every disease the biochemist's report is an im- portant part of the case history. In this book the authors have brought together the latest biochemical information on many diseases. The viewpoint is that of the clinician. Laboratory techniques are included only when the cobperation of the physician is necessary to complete the test. Practical applications of recent re- search are given in full. In order to make specific details more readily available to the busy medical man the material is divided into sections on the various organs and organ systems, and on such general topics as disorders of nutrition, and metab- olism, and the biochemical aspects of neurologic and psychiatric disorders.

The Modern Approach to 'the Change' in Womanhood. By Joseph Rety. Greenberg, Publisher, New York. $1.75. 8 x 512; I68; I940. The author, a gynecologist of four decades of experience, has written a straight- forward account of the climacteric, the "change of life" in woman, and the con- comitant alterations in mental and physi- cal makeup. These latter changes, espe- cially mental, need not be at all dis- turbing, but due to faulty knowledge and ignorance this period is looked upon with acute fear by many women. The author points out that fear is one of the most serious problems of the climacteric. "All others can be dealt with by simple means as diet, exercise, self-control and, where necessary, an up-to-date medicament." There is a general outline covering the physical and psychological "troubles" which may accompany the change, the symptoms of such troubles, their relation to the climacteric, and the treatment of these ailments-especially the use of ovarian and thyroid extracts. This ac- count, addressed to all women and written mainly in narrative style, presents an excellent and unalarming survey of the period which so many women face and undergo with unnecessary fear. YOUR MARRIAGE: A Guide to Happiness. By Norman E. Himes. Farrar and Rine- hart, New York and Toronto. $3.75. 8* x 52; xiv + 434; 1940. Most books on sex and marriage within recent years have taken an extremist view- point. The writers have been either zealous reformers or advocates of free love. It is some consolation occasionally to find a book, such as this, which is entirely rational and will serve as a guide to young people. Although the author dis- cusse 'the sexual and reproductive aspects of marriage, large portions of the volume are devoted to social and economic factors. Of particular value are the sections dealing with consumer guidance, budgets, in- surance, credit, and buying or renting a home. The author favors earlier marriages as a solution to several present day problems, particularly to those resulting from pre- marital sexual tension. However, early marriages introduce other problems per- haps equally serious. Many people will disagree with this and other viewpoints expressed throughout this volume, but by and large it should prove to be a most useful gui e. SEXUAL DISORDERS IN THES MALE.

Williams &amp; Wilkins Co., Balti- more. $3.oo. 81 x 5i; xiv + 248; I939. This book is offered as a practical manual for the general practitioner and the medi- cal student. In it the common male sexual disorders are discussed from the point of view of diagnosis and practical treatment. Both psychological and physical under- lying factors are considered, the former being recognized as the most frequent etiologically. It is unfortunate, there- fore, that the book is able to give so little real understanding of how the psychologi- cal aspect is to be handled, and that so much space is devoted to descriptions of physical measures. There is a list of references and an index. SEX IN MARRIAGE. By Ernest R. Groves and Gladys H. Groves. Emerson Books, New York. $z.oo 7X ; 2.50; I940. This is not "just another sex book." The senior author, Professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina, has long been a serious student of the problems of family life-to him is creditec[ the first college course dealing with such ques- tions. Mrs. Groves has ably assisted her husband in his work. In general, this edition differs little from the earlier one which was written "to give briefly and clearly information which an experience of twenty years in dealing with family problems has led the authors to think most useful in helping young people meet the sex demands of marriage." BIOMETRY EIEMENTI PER UNA TEORIA MATEMATICA DEL CONTAGIO. By Marcello Puma. Editoriale Aeronau- tica, R1oma. L. I3. 74 x 5; 2.00 + 9 folding charts; 1939 (paper). The well-known differential equation of growth is developed here and applied to the spread of contagion in a collectivity. The author examines briefly the modifica- tions of the general equation depending upon the conditions postulated, such as, a closed or open community; immune, partially immune, or non-immune popu- lations; direct or indirect contagion, etc. Although theoretical and elementary, this book outlines very clearly the funda- mental concepts of a mathematical treat- ment of epidemics. INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL BIOMETRY AND STATIsTICs. Third Edition, Revised and En- larged. By Raymond Pearl. W. B. Saunders Co., Philadelphia and London. $7.oo. 94 x 6 1; xv + 537; 1940. This edition of a widely used text has been extensively revised. Material that the general progress of the subject has rendered no longer useful has been omitted, giving space for new matter. Many new illustrations and tables have been added, and also a new chapter on the measure- ment of variation. Altogether the book has been increased in size by nearly 8o pages.

Oxford University</page><page sequence="40">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 505 Press, New York, London and Toronto. $8.*50 94 x 6Q; xiv + 76I; 193 8. This book presents a detailed and technical account of the most original, thorough- going, and systematic attempt at a con- sistently scientific appraisal and under- standing of human personality that has yet been made. It is a collaborative effort of a group of persons, in respect of both the observational and experimental work upon which the account is based, and the actual writing of the book. But to Mur- ray, the planner, director, analyst, and synthesizer of the investigation clearly belongs the major part of the credit for the success and significance of the out- come. The studies were made on 5I male subjects of college age. Eleven were drawn from the ranks of the unemployed. The remainder were students, all chosen by the Harvard Employment Office, with equal representation of high and low scholarship, and paid the current wage for their service as subjects. They were "'normal" persons, in the usual and con- ventional sense that they had not been regarded as, or accused of being, either more or less crazy than the general run of mankind. These subjects were put through a series of carefully and thoroughly planned ex- aminations, experiments, interviews, and tests widely ranging in their compre- hensiveness. It is safe to say that no such number of "normal" human beings have ever been so thoroughly and com- pletely studied in respect of their total personalities as these were. The primary purpose of the study was methodcological, and in this respect the net result is of first rate importance. A methodology has been developed that, even though far from being yet perfected, will yield rich and novel rewards to the psychologist and psychiatrist if it is con- sistently and intelligently employed. Spe- cifically in the present case it has yielded a composite picture of the present day individual of college age that is clear-cut and illuminating within its defined bound- aries. The book is so packed with technical detail in both its theoretical and objective aspects as to make any summary of find- ings impossible in the space here available. But every student of human biology, whatever his special field of interest, will wish to read and study it. For it is a contribution belonging in the absolutely first rank of significance. There is in- cluded at the ent a glossary of terms used, which the reader will find extremely use- ful, and a competent index. SOCIAL AND BIoLOGICAL ASPECTS OF MENTAL DISEASE. By Benjamin Malzberg. State Hospitals Press, Utica, N. Y. $.5. 91 x 6; 360; 1940. This very interesting statistical survey is based on standardized data recorded on patients with mental disease in New York State since I890. In the first chapter the trends of mental disease in New York State are investigated, and the general conclusion reached that a relative increase in such diseases exists. It is noted that this does not necessarily imply an increase in the number of defective family stocks, but is consistent with the degree and rapidity of social changes which have occurred in recent generations-a con- structive viewpoint tor mental hygiene. In the second chapter the relationship between age and mental disease is con- sidered. It is pointed out that the natural sequence of mental diseases through the diffcrent age periods-dementia praecox and manic-depressive psychoses in the early periods of life, general paresis and alcoholic psychoses in the midfdle period, and senility and arteriosclerotic psychoses in the later period-is an important con- sideration in planning a mental hygiene program. In the third chapter mental disease in urban and rural populations is compared. In Chapter IV, marital status in relation to mental disease is discussed. Except for general paresis, the incidence of mental disease is found to be higher in the single than in any other group, but it is pointed out that the marital status probably represents selection on the basis of mental characteristics. In Chapter VII, "Race and mental disease," particularly interesting findings occur. It is found that the Irish show by far the highest rate of first admissions-due primarily to</page><page sequence="41">506 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY mental diseases associated with old age and with alcoholic addiction. The Scan- dinavians rank second, ranking high in general paresis and alcoholic psychoses. Germans, Italians, and English follow in the order named. It is stressed that cultural factors must be considered in any interpretation af these findings, and that racial factors alone may be misleading. In Chapter X, "Mental dispase among Negroes," it is shown that the ratio of first admissions in Negroes as compared with whites is 2. to I. Dementia praecox is the leading psychosis, with general paresis ranking second, manic-depressive psychosis third, alcoholic psychoses fourth. In Chapter XI, economic factors in relation to mental disease are con- sidered. In the twelfth chapter it is found that illiterates have higher rates of first admissions than literates. It is not felt, however, that illiteracy and mental disease are causally related, but that both arise from the same social conditions. In Chapter XIII, it is found that mortality rates at corresponding ages are from 3 to 6 times as great among patients with mental disease as among the general pop- ulation. This heavy mortality results in a reduction of approximately i8 years and I4 years in the life span of the male and female patients, respectively. In the fourteenth chapter, the efficacy of insulin shock therapy in dementia praecox is evaluated. It is reported that, following termination of treatment, I2..9 percent of the patients were reported recovered and 65.4 percent improved. One year after termination of treatment, all of the recovered patients were still recovered and 49.0 percent were still improved. In un- treated cases the recovery rate was only 4 percent and the improved rate i i percent. Paranoid and catatonic types showed bet- ter results than hebephrenics, and short duration of illness before treatment was a favorable factor. The data on which the conclusions are based in each chapter are included in tabular form and the results of analysis shown in simple, lucid graphs. The dis- cussion is presented briefly and concisely. There is a bibliography and an index. LE SYNDROME DE DESINTEGRATION PHO- NETIQUE DANS L'APHASIE. By Th. Alajouanine, Andre Ombredane, and Marguerite Durand. Masson et Cie, Paris. 8o cents. 9 x 6; I38; I939 (paper). Four cases in which aphasia accompanied paralysis of the right side were each ob- served and treated by the authors over a number of years. Although the results of the usual neurologic examinations, psy- chologic, and reflex tests are presented for each of these patients, it is with the phonetic defects that the authors are particularly concerned. Although the mu- tations- in the pronunciation of words differed with the patients some of the fairly consistent tendencies included the use of a lip stop consonant at the beginning of words, the substitution of buccal vowels for nasal, such as da for dans; supression of r, especially when it should be vibrant, or its substitution by a liquid, e.g. Lobe for Robert [the illustrative words are, of course, French throughout the book]; the substitution of hard consonants for soft, such as pep6 for beb6; etc. One of the patients made few mistakes in spelling, word order, or grammar when putting into writing sentences which were spoken to her, or in giving in writing resumes of anecdotes and stories in pictures. The other three, in similar tests, elided syl- lables, transposed letters, and made other errors in spelling and grammar. None of these written products, however, re- sembled in their errors the phonetic muta- tions of the same material when given orally. In general the oral "phonetic disintegration" appeared to manifest itself in a reversion to a "primitive" mode of articulation resembling the first efforts of a child learning to talk. A brief theoretical discussion as to the cause of this malady and suggestions for reeducation in speaking and writing, with which the authors have had some success, are included. The illustrations consist of graphic representations of lip and laryn- geal movements in the pronunciation of certain words as made by normal persons and the patients, as registered on Rous- selot's cylinder.</page><page sequence="42">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 507 THE VARIETIES OF HUMAN PHYSIQUE: An Introduction to Constitutional Psychology. By W. H. Sheldon with the collaboration of S. S. Stevens and W. B. Tucker. Harper and Bros., New York and London. $4.50. 98X 64; xii + 347 + 45 plates; I940. The major portion of this book is devoted to outlining a method of classifying and grading body build. The approach de- scribed is two-fold. First, by visual inspection of photographs the amount of the endomorphic, mesomorphic, and ecto- morphic component, respectively, of the body and of its divisions is estimated on a seven-point scale. This estimate for the body as a whole is supplemented by the value derived from the use of the index: stature divided by cube root of weight, and for other body segments by the values of indices calculated from measurements taken on the photographs. After averag- ing in a number of ways the estimate and the computed indices, a single index such as, for example, 425 is finally obtained. This index supposedly reveals that in the particular subject the endomorphic com- ponent equals 4, the mesomorphic -, and the endomorphic 5. In the usual terms of constitutional somatology this subject would be described as an asthenic-inter- mediate, or a flaccid asthenic. According to the scheme of the authors there are 343 possible somatotypes, ranging from i i i (!) to 777 (!) but only 76 have been observed in 4000 male college students. The au- thors deserve praise for the ingenuity displayed although their index does not differ substantially from others based on combined mensurational and impression- istic techniques. On practical and ra- tional grounds they have all proven unsatisfactory. A successful -solution of the problem of somatotyping is essential to the further progress of constitutional somatology but until the problem is more clearly understood than so far has been the case, the classification of physical types must still be determined by some anthropometric indices or on the basis of the temperament types described centuries ago and to which the authors have also had recourse. GETTING MORE OUT OF LIFE. By Joseph jastrow. Emerson Books, New York. $z.oo. 8 x 52j; Viii + 3I2 I940. Although the reference of certain British physicians of the old, or thick-skulled school to a nervous breakdown as an "American luxury" is a slight exaggera- tion of the facts, there is sufficient mental instability among all classes of society to warrant an increase in the number of psychiatric clinics, as well as an increase in the number of psychology books for the masses by such level-headed psy- chologists as Jastrow. Until the layman has become thoroughly acquainted with the capabilities and limitations placed upon him by his heredity and his environ- ment, there will remain many psychologi- cal mis-fits in our various branches of society. After a person has gained some idea of his own psvchological assets and liabilities, the next step in his training to get more out of life is the dispelling of fears, signs, beliefs, and superstitions. The third step to the threshold of happy living is a recognition of the inter- dependence of mind and body. Jastrow believes that "In the near future medicine will recognize psycho- somatics as the study of mental action on bodily states in health and disease" and that "There are all sorts of difficulties which only the knife can remove; but in every case the total patient must be considered and a goodly part of him is his mental attitude in disease." He also agrees with a wise British doctor that "When a man is so ill that he thinks he is ill when he is not ill at all, then he is very ill indeed." The book is written in a stimulating and quite readable manner, and is replete with cases from the author's files. there is a table of contents, but no index.

The theory of rote learning set forth in</page><page sequence="43">508 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY these pages represents the coordinated effort of psychologists and mathemati- cians. "While it is believed by the authors that the present monograph con- tributes to an understanding of the learn- ing processes, it is judged that its chief value consists in the large-scale pioneering demonstration of the logico-empirical methodology in the field of behavior." Scientific development is constituted of the relationship between observations and ideas. The experimental procedure used in obtaining the observes facts of rote learning is dfescribed, definitions are given, and a set of postulates is developed. The theoretical system is made up of numerous theorems derived from these definitions and postulates, and couched in the symbolism of mathematics and logic. Theorems are then checked against the observed data and are found in some cases to be inadequate, although on the whole they have been experimentally verified. The authors express the belief that by utilizing the methodolofy presented in this volume the socia sciences may eventually attain the predictive power which characterizes the physical sciences. However, until such specialists as were engaged in the present work further demonstrate the general applicability of the system, it is doubtful if it will com- mand the attention of but a few in- dividuals. NEGRO CRIME. Comparative Psycholog y Monographs. Volume I6, Numbe) 2. Serial Number SI. By Jess Spirer. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. io x 68; 64; I940 (paper). This study of Negro crime is based on the commitment records of the Western State Penitentiary, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, between I906 and I935. It is found that when proportional incidence of population is taken into consideration, Negroes have been committed to the penitentiary 9.69 times as frequently as native whites. The highest proportional commitment is found Tor crimes of violence (murder and assault) for which Negroes were com- mitted 2.9.o6 times as frequently as native whites. Possible explanations of this proportionally large number of commit- ments among Negroes are discussed and the conclusion reached that it cannot be entirely accounted for by (a) the presence of proportionately more males in the Negro population, (b) the presence of proportionately more males in the crime committing ages in the Negro population, (c) the presence of Negroes who are not native-born Pennsylvanians, or (d) the concentration of Negro populations in industrial areas. It is likewise concluded that there is insufficient evidence to ascribe to the Negro a biological inferi- ority to account for his so-called "crimi- nality." There is a bibliography of I IO titles. A STUDY Or EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED COMPETITIVE BEHAVIOR IN THE WHITE RAT. Comparative Psychology Monographs. Volume IS, Number 6. Serial No. 78. By Charles N. Winslow. The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore. 75 cents. IO x 68; 35, I940 (paper)- The writer proposed to attempt to answer several questions as to the effect which competition has on the rat. To this end three experiments were set up in which first singly and then in pairs the animals (i) ran over a straight course to a visible food reward; (2.) ran mazes to the reward; and (3) pulled the reward from above by means of a pulley. The writer concludes that "Rats respond competitively to one another when they are rivals for a single piece of food" and that the animals may respond in one of two ways; either by an increased effort or by inhibition as a result of frustration at losing. Inasmuch as two rats would often fight over the food if they both arrived at the same time there was obvious competition. But from the writer's statements as to the initial be- havior of the animals upon release, coupled with the lack of statistical significance of the differences in competi- tive and non-competitive times, it would appear that by and large the rats just did not know what it was all about.</page><page sequence="44">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 509 THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE.

Gesell and his associates summarize their views and conclusions on the behavioristic development of children from birth to six years of age. In the first part of the book a general picture is given of the typical pattern of motor responses and adaption, language and person-social be- havior traits at different stages in infancy and early childhood. Included are a series of beautiful photographic illustrations of the type found in Gesell's principal publications. In the second part of the book a detailed discussion is presented of the development of each of the above characteristics. The third part contains an outline of the method and technique of examination. It is needless to say that this is probably the most authorita- tive and comprehensive work on a subject in which the work of the author and his group have been greatly responsible for such progess as has been made. SELECTED WRITINGS OF SIR CHARLES SHER- RINGTON. A Testimonial Presented by the Neurologists Forming the Guarantors of the Journal Brain. Compiled and Edited by D. Denny-Brown. Paul B. Hoeber, Medical Book Department of Harper and Bros., New York. $7.50. 3 94 X 74; xiv + 532; I940. This compilation at once pays tribute to the genius of Sir Charles Sherrington and serves as an excellent reference book for neurologists, physiologists, and psychol- ogists. No pretense is made to cover the entire range of contributions, but the selection offers those papers which are of greatest interest to workers in these fields. An effort has been made to give the volume chronological continuity as well as an orderly arrangement of the subjects treat- ed. The reprints and extracts include discussion of motor and sensory innerva- tion, spinal and bulbar reflex activity, postural reflexes, reciprocal innervation, the motor cortex, and the nature of reflex excitation and inhibition. The entire volume represents a masterful piece of work in editing and compiling this vast body of material. Following the text is a complete bibliography of Sherrington's papers and a thorough index.

Brill, Leiden. 8 guilders (paper); io guilders (cloth). 93 x 61; xi + 478; I940. The author has rendered a service to psychologists in bringing under one cover the work of numerous laboratories in an effort to synthesize an understanding of the processes of instincts, their changes through experience and learning, and their place in the total personality of animals. After a general discussion and an ordering of the more important instincts the author attempts to find out whether the instincts are endowed with "plasticity and elas- ticity." From the published literature and his own researches he concludes that they are, and may be manifested in varia- tions, adaptations, and regulatory proc- esses. He further affirms that some can also be influenced by training and imitation. The bibliography covers 35 pages, and an index of authors and one of animals has been provided. STUDIES OF ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR IN THE RAT. II. A Comparison of Some Convulsion- Producing Situations. Comparative Psychol- ogy Monographs. Volume z6, No. I. By Norman R. F. Maier and Nathan M. Glaser. The Johns Hopkins Press, Balti- more. 75 cents. IO x 64; 30; I940 (paper). There have been a number of experiments which demonstrate the occurrence of</page><page sequence="45">510 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY paroxysms in animals as a result of certain types of auditory stimulation. The pres- ent study was designed to determine to what extent the behavior abnormalities are related, and to offer possible explana- tions. The stimuli (jingling keys, hissing air, bell, buzzers, and whistle) were given to the rats under varying degrees of confinement and conflict-producing condi- tions. Several interesting findings are reported, chief among which is the in- crease in frequency of convulsions when the rats are involved in a conflict situation to which they have no adequate response. The study is well planned and clearly presented, but is open to criticism in respect to the small number of animals in the experiments. COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY: A Comprehen- sive Treatise. Volume 11, Plants and In- vertebrates. By Carl J. Warden, Thomas N. Jenkins and Lucien H. Warner. The Ronald Press, New York. $6.oo. 83 x 5'; xiii + I070; I940. This book represents a compendium of the literature on plant and invertebrate com- parative psychology and behavior, and contains a staggering list of references which covers 2.I3 pages. The material in each chapter is organized under two broad headings: receptive capacities and reactive capacities of the ground under considera- tion. The material has been well digested and is concisely summarized. An in- valuable source book for the biologist who is interested in more than the mor- phological side of his subject. There is a subject and author index. DE OMNIBUS REBUS ET QUIBUSDEM ALIIS HISTORY AND SCIENCE: A Study of the Relation of Historical and Theoretical Knowl- edge. By Hugh Miller. University of California Press, Berkeley. $2.oo. 8' x 5a; x + 2OI; I939. This is a philosophical discussion of two fields of intellectual exploration, as re- stricted by the author's own definitions. Science he limits to the study of things that occupy space, and History he expands to the study of Processes that occupy time. It was Darwin's epoch making book that caused the scientists of subsequent genera- tions to become time-conscious; previous to Darwin all science was purely descrip- tive and entirely devoid of any tendency to draw inferences by which the future might be forecast. For this reason, according to the author, Darwin and his satellites are not so much historically-minded scientists as they are scientifically-minded historians. This seems a mere verbal quibble at first, especially when we recall that modern relativity physics bids fair to accomplish the synthesis of time and space, if indeed it has not already done so. Also the author believes that the philosophy of the historian is more likely to be empiric than that of the scientist. This is surpris- ing for one would naturally think that a philosophy limited to the contemplation of things would be empiric rather than one devoted to the contemplation of processes which can be apprehended only by observ- ing things and drawing inferences from the changes wrought in them by time. But this supposition the author most emphatically denies. It is difficult to follow his logic, but the reader who endeavors to follow honestly the author's thought is likely to be converted by the essentially sane and healthy conclusions to which the author leads him before he gets half-way through the book. Perhaps most readers will feel that the chapter dealing with the relation of history and religion is the most vital in the entire work, especially in view of the strange tendency today among representa- tives of organized religion to derive aid and comfort from Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. This tendency seems more pronounced among those whose under- standing of Heisenberg is least, and its implication is that religion can flourish better in a chaotic than in an orderly universe. Miller says nothing about Heisenberg but his discussion of the historical aspect of religious development leaves no doubt as to where he stands. Primitive peoples</page><page sequence="46">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS have developed religion only insofar as they have been able to perceive unifying principles in the univserse. They pray for favor to anthropomorphic personifica- tions of these principles. There would be no point to prayer in a universe so chaotic that all happenings were for- tuitous. The theory of evolution, by making the scientific mind time-conscious and also by accentuating the unity of the universe, has served to check rather than to accelerate the Gotterd4mmerung of Chris- tianity; notwithstanding the statements of certain shallow-minded ecclesiasts who attribute to the theory the materialism of the nineteenth century. The closing chapters dealing with democracy and progress are also vitally significant and it is to be hoped that this work will receive the attention that it merits, for it is a really valuable contri- bution to modern scientific and philo- sophic thought. Unfortunately it has no index. THE WANDERING LAKE. By Sven Hedin. Translated from the Swedish by F. H. Lyon. E. P. Dutton and Co., New York. $3.75. 9 x 6 X + 29I + 3I plates; 1940. Sven Hedin's name has become so well known through earlier books of his that no special introduction is necessary here, but the title of the present work is mis- leading and requires some explanation. The lake of Lop-Nor was fed by the Konche-daria, and has no outlet but by evaporation. Some distance above the lake the river is divided as if by a delta, but the two arms so formed never unite again. The other branch is the Kum- daria, which at the time of the author's first visit to this part of Central Asia in the last century was quite dry. It terminated in a sink. Any one accus- tomed to the vagaries of rivers in desert countries, like our own Colorado as de Niza and Kina saw it, before its spirit was broken by the harness of dykes and levees that now restrain it, can readily understand how the flow of such a stream might alternate between the two arms of the delta, and if each arm led to its own sink there would be two lakes, which would alternate in receiving the flow of the water. The lake of Lop-nor was two independent lakes that existed not simul- taneously but alternately. Sven Hedin's story is of interest not because it is the report of a strange natural phenomenon, but because on visiting the area in I900 he prophesied that in the next generation the stream would shift beds again for the first time since the year 330 A.D. On his return in I934 he found his prophecy fulfilled. Since the lake occupies a position of extreme inaccessibility in the plateau of Central Asia, seldom visited by white men, the story is of great interest and importance, and the numerous illustra- tions, by the author, add much to it. It is well indexed and has several maps. SCIENCE FRONT I939. By F. Sherwood Taylor. Cassell and Co., London, Toronto, Melbourne and Sydney; The Macmillan Co., New York. 7s. 6d. net in England; $X.5o in America. 78 X S; 30I + 8 plates; I939. The Science Front of I939 was so broad that it was nearly impossible for one reporter to cover it entirely, but this is an ad- mirable attempt. The clarity and preci- sion with which are discussed such technical topics as chemotherapy, sex and the steroids, television, the atom, the treatment of cancer, schizophrenia, the aurora borealis, plant growth substances, and the universe, is commendable. For anyone beyond the age of i6, whether his interests lie in biology, chemistry, physics, medicine, astronomy, or radio, this book will prove to be as fascinating as it is informative. In discussing such vast topics-about any one of which countless volumes can be, and have been, written-it is impossi- ble to develop the entire field. The dis- cussions are restricted to the most recent discoveries, developments, theories, aspira- tions, and lines of research in the various subjects. When the scientific advance- ments of the past decade are compared with those of the previous five decades,</page><page sequence="47">THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY the astoundingly accelerating pace of science is fully realized. The textual material is well supplied with formulae, charts, graphs, drawings, and photographs, and is provided with a complete index. THE CHICAGO COLLEGE PLAN. By Chauncey S. Boucher. Revised and Enlarged after Ten Years' Operation of the Plan by A. J. Brumbaugh. University of Chicago Press, Chicago. $3.oo. 8 x 52; xiii + 4I3; I940. It is about fifteen years since the Univer- sity of Chicago first decided to com- pensate for the long neglect of its under- graduate schools by developing a system that would raise these parts of the Uni- versity to the prominent rank of its graduate divisions. The result of this decision was the formulation of the "Chicago College Plan," now widely known, but first presented to the faculty in May, i92.8, in a report of the progress made by the special faculty committee on the undergraduate colleges. The freshmen entering in September, 1931, were the first students to enroll under the new, or divisional, plan. The first edition of the present book was written and published In I935 by the dean of the College; it might well be considered another report of progress. The I940 edition, revised by Dean Boucher's successor, discusses the plan ten years after the initial changes that put it into operation. Dean Brum- baugh's edition is a good presentation of an attractive educational program by a man who is familiar with its operation, and as such it should be worth reading by anyone interested in our modern schools. THE AUTHOR PUBLISHER PRINTER COMPLEX. By Robert S. Gill. Williams t Wilkins Co.,Baltimore. $I.00. 748lx5;iv+-76; I940. This handy volume is in no sense a style manual. It gives neither rules for punc- tuation, nor for grammer, nor does it give "Examples": yet it does contain the essential directions for preparing a manu- script for the printer. Written by one with many years' experience in the publishing business, it gently, and at times with considerable humor, leads the reader through the different stages that printer and author have more or less in common in the process of getting a manuscript before the public. The beginning author, or editor, heeding the invaluable sug- gestions herein discussed will find this particular part of his work moving along with astonishing ease. MAKE YOUR PICTURES SING! How to Perfect Your Technique. By Paul L. Hexter. Camera Craft Pub- lishing Co., San Francisco. $3.oo. 81 x 6; i88; I940. Written in a manner completely under- standable to the amateur photographer, this is one of the best of numerous recent volumes on the subject. It presents many practical suggestions for producing fine photographic results. The principles de- scribed are well illustrated, but the book lacks an index. I940 BRITANNICA BOOK OF THE YEAR.
