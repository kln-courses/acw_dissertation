<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Impact of Technology on Consciousness: Some Viewpoints on the American Case, 1875-1930 Judy Hushbeck The material progress made possible by the widespread acceptance of machine technology in the 19th century granted the USA and her citizenry a prosperity the equal of which the world had never seen. A remarkable transformation of production methods engendered by the dynamic new "factory system" substantially altered the character of American life. But the proliferation of goods, luxuries, and creature comforts offered by the technological revolution was not an unmixed blessing. Profound reactions to the depersonalization and exploitation inherent in the new order were registered by a broad spectrum of contemporary thinkers. It is the purpose of this paper to explore some of these reactions. Literature plays an important role in tracing out cultural history by both mirroring and helping to form dominant trends in the social, political, and economic spheres of life. In this capacity it serves to bridge the frequently troublesome gap between ideas and action and strives to make theory compatible with reality. Late 19th and early 20th century thought on the arrival and overwhelming spread of mechanization, as revealed through literature, exemplifies the attempts writers were making to come to grips with a phenomenon which had traumatic, far-reaching, and permanent conse- quences for the way people lived and related to their world. Some writers tried to formulate basic principles of machine technology from which all major consequences could be drawn, but such absolute principles have usually been of little value, except as explanations of isolated or temporary conditions; they have had scant effect on the formulation of effective public policy. Writers who wholeheartedly praised or damned the machine accomplished no more, for their field of vision was sharply restricted by the emotional quality of their response to so complex a subject; their perceptions were distorted by their eagerness for a comprehensive, unified, unambivalent interpretation, and objectivity suffered or disappeared altogether. Characteristic American experience can be seen to have been shaped by the contradictions and discontinuities in its culture rather than by unifying forces. While this is no doubt true of all cultures, it is particularly relevant to the American experience, and American culture as revealed through its literature encompasses contradictions and extreme ranges of experience. The peculiar traits embodied in American writing are an extension of the special character of the environment. Within the span of a single generation a rustic, largely wild landscape was transformed into the site of the most advanced and gigantic technology in the world. This resulted in equivocal philosophies and profound contradictions in value and meaning, which are reflected in American writing. This paper will try to bring together some representative Judy Hushbeck is presently employed as administrative and research assistant in the Department of Economics, The American University, Washington, D.C. Prior to her present position, she was writer and editor of Bellcommunique , the employee newspaper of Bellcomm, a subsidiary of the Bell telephone system. She earned a B.A. in literature in 1970 and has done graduate work in economics and US intellectual history. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 American views (and, where useful, their European origins and influences) of the new machine technology in the years 1875-1930 - views that are optimistic, pessimistic, and frankly uncertain. The inchoate responses of intellectuals and practical men of action to the machinge age, taken together, may be the closest we can come to an assessment of the impact of mechanization on American consciousness. Background By the turn of the 19th century, the United States was clearly destined to be at the center of a new industrial civilization. Up until this time American thinkers had related primarily to a strong and enduring agrarian tradition based on the independent farmer. Long after the number of farmers had dwindled, this group possessed significant economic and political power. Their disfavor toward city life and industrialism in general continued for a time to be politically and socially relevant. But anti-industrialism was to fail in the United States as elsewhere. It had been overtaken by progress, and the strongest sense of the past could not withstand the leveling forces of the new industrial technology. For the first half of the 19th century Americans were so busily and successfully exploiting the new machine technology that its philosphical aspects were scarcely considered. Labor was in short supply, and unemploy- ment as a social problem was virtually nonexistent. This state of affairs lasted until just prior to the Civil War, at which time came the first hint of a cyclical and potentially very troublesome economic problem. With the defeat of the South, the impossibility of a nation based on agrarian values became clear. A serious business depression, accompanied by extensive unemployment, occurred a decade later, due to the sudden and sharp decline in postwar demand. Agrarianism was permanently defeated; the hopes placed in rural or agrarian Utopian and socialist schemes were short-lived; and the powerful industrialists had begun to take control of the economy, thereby dictating the terms of existence for the masses. The American Social Science Association took the lead in looking into early labor problems with respect to machine technology. In 1878 W. Godwin Moody presented his gloomy analysis in the pamphlet, Our Labor Difficulties : The Cause and the Way Out The essence of the difficulty, Moody reported, was that continuing improvements were being made in the methods of production, at the same time that peope were maintaining stable consumption patterns. His proposed solution to the problem of technological unemployment was to enact legislation which would restrict the hours of work so that all could be employed. David A. Wells: Analysis of Technology and Early Labor Unrest A more comprehensive and common-sense view was expressed 12 years later by David A. Wells, an ardent free trader with a lifelong interest in the nature and effects of technology. In his book, Recent Economic Changes (1889), he presented his analysis of the consequences of machinery. He pointed out that the depressions of 1873 and 1882 were widespread - not local phenomena, but rather, affecting other industrializing nations, too - and that they took their severest form where machine use, efficiency of labor, and living standards were highest. He saw the underlying universal cause as</page><page sequence="3">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 21 the machine: "the increased control which mankind has acquired over the forces of Nature, and . . . the increased utilization of such control - mainly through machinery - for the work of production and distribution."1 Although technological change had been gradually occurring through centuries and, in that sense, was not new, the rate of recent change, rather than change itself, marked it as different. The rate of increase - the telescoping of events so capable of altering the lives of human beings caught off guard and unprepared to adapt - he saw as the central reason for far-reaching societal disturbances. Strikes, demonstrations, and riots gave evidence of increasing discontent among workers in mechanized industries. A vicious circle evolved as strikes served to stimulate the invention of labor-saving (and labor-displac- ing) devices. Wells listed three major sources of the discontent: 1) an everincreasing efficiency in production methods rendering jobs obsolete; 2) the changing nature of work, requiring less skill and posing a threat to the worker's sense of independence, individuality, and mental development; and 3) the concomitant overall increase in the level of intelligence and education of the population. Thus, in a manner reminiscent of Marx's "immiserization of the proletariat," there had evolved a paradoxical situation wherein laborers found that more and better work was expected of them (and they were capable of it), while at the same time machines were forcing them into dulling, repetitive jobs. Such jobs tended to be looked down on by society, but they constituted the bulk of jobs available. Ultimately, though, Wells concluded that the material welfare had increased so substantially during the previous 25 years that the difficulties society was experiencing were worth it, i.e., they were the "price" of improvement. While he agreed with social reformers that all help and sympathy should be extended toward those unfortunates who were being displaced by machin- ery, he sternly cautioned against any form of governmental interference with the "free action and interaction of industrial social forces." The societal disturbances were merely temporary and would be settled by "a process of industrial evolution."2 Carroll D. Wright: The Factory System and Its Benefits Carroll D. Wright, the first US commissioner of labor, presented an equally optimistic and politically popular view of the machine. As labor commissioner, he pioneered in the collection of labor statistics and dedicated himself to the public welfare as a moral, practical commentator. Wright recognized no absolutes or historical imperatives. He identified what he called man's "divine discontent," resulting from the neverending struggle to improve living condi- tions, as the cause of labor disturbances. Saying that there was no easy remedy, he proposed the universal extension and improvement of education - the enlightenment of the population - to overcome the basic problem. In his published writings Wright championed the established order and a paternalistic capitalist system. The factory system, he felt, was "a most potent element in promoting civilization."3 Despite the evils in the system, which he acknowledged, he felt that the nation as a whole was far better off than it had been under the domestic system. The general welfare had been improved by the introduction of the factory system. Ignoring the decreasing relative share of the worker in profits and material comforts, he argued that the worker's absolute status was a marked improvement over that of 18th century agricultural workers. Working conditions, home life,</page><page sequence="4">22 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 and regularity of income were the areas he cited as showing most pronounced progress. He placed strong emphasis on the fact that the worker's life and habits had become more orderly, that factories were "usually clean and well lighted," and that the worker profited by the "health-giving tonic of the atmosphere" of the factory.4 However, he recognized that the system was subject to abuse, and that abuses did exist. The state should provide for the general welfare in this regard. Factory laws were justified and had produced beneficent effects. Wright preferred, though, to the enactment of legislation to bring powerful manufacturers into line, a system of voluntary and informed paternalism. The ultimate welfare of the population depended upon the sense of responsi- bility assumed by the employer, who was to be "something more than a producer ... an instrument of God for the upbuilding of the race."5 Frederick W. Taylor and Scientific Management Matter-of-fact and practical as were the views of Wright and Wells, they take on the character of abstract intellectual exercises when compared to the approach taken by Frederick W. Taylor, the pioneer in time and motion studies, who embraced the machine and made its usefulness to man the center of his life's work. "One of the prophets of modern work . . . the stopwatch was his bible. If any such social upheaval can ever be attributed to one man, the logic of efficiency as a mode of life is due to him. With 'scientific management,' as enunciated by Taylor, we ... go into the division of time itself."6 Although the stopwatch was commonly enough used to record the time required to perform a job in its entirety, Taylor was the first to split jobs into their component operations and time each separately. In 1899 Taylor became famous overnight when he showed a Dutch laborer named Schmidt how to shovel 47 tons of pig iron in a single day, when the worker's previous average had been 12.5 tons. Although Taylor's regard for machinery was huge, his estimation of the men required to work machines was low indeed. In fact, in addition to physical strength he stressed that stupidity and a general dullness of character were the primary requisites for such occupations. Following Taylor's lead, this attempt to rationalize man's relationship to the machine resulted in the early 20th century in a cult of scientific manage- ment, and it appeared that "efficiency experts and standardizers might try to dehumanize civilization by fractionalizing all production activities into trivialities."7 Some feared that a superrationalization of business tactics would spill over into human relationships and result in a commercial value being placed on everything. "The economic and social system would be transformed into an exact mechanism in which all elements of chance, risk, capriciousness, free will, and even esthetic and spiritual values would be eliminated. Only a cold and deadly efficiency would remain, and the destiny of man would become wealth, security, and slavery."8 The individual was being forced to accept the mass-produced products of the media and to give up his folk culture and autonomous activities. The Dissent of Fiction Literary protest to machine-based culture was widespread and generally ineffective. Americans were not interested in hearing pessimism sounded</page><page sequence="5">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 23 amidst booming progress. Science fiction writers - notably Aldous Huxley, Brave New World , and George Orwell, 1984 - were hardly taken seriously in their projections to logical extremes of the prevalent tendencies toward security, conformity, and destruction of freedom. The writings of Europeans such as Karl Marx and Thomas Carlyle, who had seen what was coming, were imbued with a gut-level reaction against the brutalization of human beings which seemed to be the handmaiden of progress. Carlyle spoke of the "destruction of moral force," the excessive emphasis on means as against ends, inherent in industrialism; Marx noted that increasing value was being placed on "things" and on the external arrangement of human affairs, while the inner, human world was being robbed of meaning and consequence. Herman Hesse in 1929 wrote a book called Steppenwolf whose hero, Harry Haller, spoke of the "ideals such as those of the Americans or of the Bolsheviks. Both are extraordinarily rational, and both lead to a frightful oppression and impoverishment of life, because they simplify it so crudely. The likeness of man, once a high ideal, is in process of becoming a machine-made article."9 "It is not a good thing," says Hesse through Haller, "when man overstrains his reason and tries to reduce to rational order matters that are not susceptible of rational treatment." 10 The Proponents of Industrial Technology But these gloomy outlooks were a decidedly minority opinion. Such pronouncements were thought to be mystical, un-American, and were dis- missed as being products of alien influences. In the United States, negative reactions to the machine were restricted to small organizations holding philosophies which ran counter to popular opinion. The prestigious publica- tions, such as the North American Review and Scientific American , touted technology with unrelenting fervor, and represented the viewpoint of business, government, and professional people. Technology in America was seen as "different" from the blight it had caused in England and elsewhere. Factory labor was viewed as a stepping-stone to higher positions, not as a life's work (despite ample evidence to the contrary). There were no satanic mills in America, nothing dark and squalid. The machine was to serve a noble end by revealing the hidden qualities of the natural world. Ralph Waldo Emerson was confident that the advance of science was to be followed by a comparable improvement in political morality; that mechanical powers (understanding) would be matched by reason (the faculty whereby value is created). He reasoned that geography - the effect of place upon con- sciousness - would be decisive in setting America apart in the utilization of machinery. As to contradictions between ideal states and reality, Emerson was simply evasive. Walt Whitman, most optimistic of American poets, placed the progresseive idiom at the core of his philosophy, and saw machine power as a point of departure toward a higher, spiritual power. Negative implications of progress in Whitman's thought are noticeable for their decided absence. . Since the early 1800's when Jefferson gave concrete American expression to the ideals of the free individual, the fundamental moral law, and a practice of moderation, the goal had been "a society of the middle landscape, a rural nation exhibiting a happy balance of art and nature. But no one . . . had been able to identify the point of arrest, the critical moment when the tilt might be expected and progress cease to be progress. As time went on, accordingly, the idea became more vague, a rhetorical formula rather than</page><page sequence="6">24 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 a conception of society, and an increasingly transparent and jejune expression of the national preference for having it both ways. . . . [This sentimental guise] enabled the nation to continue defining its purpose as the pursuit of rural happiness while devoting itself to productivity, wealth, and power." 11 Striking had been the simultaneity of the formation of the government of the new republic (as represented by the constitution) and the shift in the mode of thought with respect to machinery. There were incorporated into the constitution many of the basic assumptions of the "mechanists." Furthermore, well into the 19th century America's favorite philosopher was John Locke. Thus, "to account for the progress of American technology it is not enough to talk about geography, or even the combined effect of the virgin land and Yankee inventive skill. One must also recognize the incentives which call forth that skill. They are provided by a democracy which invites every man to enhance his own comfort and status. To the citizen of a democracy inventions are vehicles for the pursuit of happiness."12 America's system of democracy not only allowed for such improvemets as the machine age might bring, but actually fostered them. Invention and change were seen as a positive good if they enhanced life's material comforts and promoted the accumulation of power. The machine was a token of liberation of the human spirit to be realized by the American Republic. This concept seems not to have provided a contradiction to the traditional belief in the land as the locus of economic and moral value. In fact, quite the contrary; spokesmen for the nascent manufacturing interests argued that the factory system would benefit agriculture by making use of workers not suited to farming, and by providing for the development of domestic markets for farm goods. In this way machines would bring out the powers latent in human beings and the environment. Early enthusiasts such as Tench Coxe, assistant to Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, anticipated what was to become a central theme in the ideology of American industrialism: the capacity of the New World environment to purify the system inherited from Europe. The American social climate would cleanse the factory system of its more unfortunate aspects, and the transplanted system would be redeemed by contact with nature and the rural life style it was to replace. The Machine as a Culture Symbol The speeches of Coxe forecast the emergence of the machine in the United States as a culture symbol. In 1800 it was not the repository of meaning and value that it was to become. The term "Industrial Revolution," first used in France around 1810, expressed more succinctly the relationship between political and technological forces, both new, and in conjunction capable of overpowering the established order. Before 1829, although many of the features of industrialism had been visible for several decades, there existed neither a word nor a definable concept of a radically different way of life. A Harvard professor, Jacob Bigelow, in 1829 coined the word "technology" and introduced the notion of that force as an agent of change. The economy was rapidly expanding, technology was proving indispensable, and the nation was on the verge of a takeoff into industrialization. By the 1830's, the railroad was becoming a national obsession, the palpable and concrete symbol of the age. By 1860, 30,000 miles of railroad track had been laid; the telegraph arrived in 1844; a manic, celebratory spirit pervaded the literature as the machine was invested with excitement, agitation, hope.</page><page sequence="7">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 25 The political value of the machine image began to take on emphasis. The new technology was to become an instrument for equality, making plausible egalitarian aims by joining with the natural abundance of the land. Optimists saw the machine as capable of providing plenty for all, without a radical restructuring of social and property relations. The simple but compelling logic of tecnnology as the base for all other hopes - peace, equality, freedom, happiness - caused the United States to exhibit, if not always exuberance, at least complacency in its adjustments to it. Yet the influence of this technology upon mass consciousness was powerful though subtle. The power of the image of the machine as a symbol for progress stemmed from its very obviousness and simplicity. It stood out as distinct, in sharp contrast to the old ways of doing things, and came to be, as Henry Adams's Education exhaustively illustrates, invested with an almost religious significance. The machine's "meaning" was a vital part of the thing itself, so no interpretations of it were required, except as elaborations upon its possibilities. But the machine cannot be taken out of the context in which it arose, nor abstracted from its setting, a setting in which it so drastically impinged upon the lives of human beings. And, unfortunately, despite the glories of science, the "miracles" of invention, and the undeniable material progress being made, the majority of working class people were hard pressed to keep up with the pace of external events, let alone understand or influence them. Because this situation still exists to some degree today, and because one's well-being must be defined as emotional fulfillment as well as physical welfare, the literature of alienation has loomed large in recent history. This estrangement from the meaning of external events is at least partially a societal product of rapid and unrestrained technological growth. Perhaps the earliest indications of discontent were the attempts at solidarity by workers through the formation of labor unions. The growth of the Knights of Labor, the strikes of the 1880's, the eight-hour movement, the Haymarket affair - all gave to labor strife a central place in the public eye. Labor unrest and protests from the agricultural sector intensified during the depression of 1893. The population was experiencing the twin evils of a mass technological society: loss of freedom and loss of identity. Industrial capitalism, concentrating economic activity under a centralized and stratified management, deprived workers and, in some sense, managers as well of freedom in life's productive sphere. "The political concomitant of this economic concentration was centralized government, which . . . made the individual citizen a mere subject, enslaved to party or government bureaucracy." 13 Dissatisfaction with the new technology expressed through such movements as that of the Populists was often, however, oriented more toward gaining a larger share of the profits to be made - an expression of resentment against the more advantaged capitalists - than it was a direct attack on industrialism itself. Dominant social thought, whether liberal or conserva- tive, affirmed the sanctity of private property and the rights of the capitalist. Unhappy workers may or may not have agreed with these premises of the capitalist system; what was certain was that they were being dehumanized in the industrial process, their activities were becoming routinized, and the life of the spirit was being cheapened and degraded. "Long before the present prophets of doom, [such thinkers as John] Dewey warned against the pernicious consequences of an uncontrolled technological industrial soci- ety."14 As Carroll Wright had done, Dewey urged turning national attention on the educative effects of all social institutions in order that a more informed</page><page sequence="8">26 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 and humane society might achieve relevancy and satisfaction through the social processes. His scheme called for a modification of institutions within the system to ameliorate dissatisfaction. A Technological Utopia Edward Bellamy, in a marked contrast to other Utopians and proponents of socialism, glorified in Looking Backward the advent of machines and life in large towns. Whereas most socialists blamed all social ills on the machine and espoused as a solution a reversion to handicrafts, Bellamy too would make use of the existing system and its machinery to accomplish his ends. He "believed not in fighting monopolies or the machine process, but in making them the means of achieving the socialist state. In the days of petty trade and handicraft the competitive system may have worked passably well. No distinct cleavage existed between employers and employees since ťa little capital or a new idea was enough to start a man in business for himself.' Working-men were constantly becoming employers. But the innu- merable small enterprises had surrendered the field to aggregation of capital." 15 Thorstein Vehlen: The Engineers Versus the Absentee Owners Thorstein Veblen, America's dour economist and social critic, made this "distinct cleavage" between capitalist and laborer central to his analysis of social and economic behavior. In his treatment of the technological factor in human culture he displayed an optimistic, sometimes Utopian strain, which belied his bitter conclusions about what was happening to human beings in an industrial setting. Veblen attached tremendous importance to technology as a factor influencing human behavior. He developed a theory of the habitual basis of human behavior as it related to institutions. "The growth or develop- ment of institutions is conditioned by two factors, the 'material environment and the persistent propensities of human nature.' By material environment Veblen means the economic conditions or methods of production which materialize in industrial technology. Since the basic drives of human nature do not change, it is the changing industrial technology which is largely responsible for changes in institutions. Man is pretty much what he does: 'As he acts, so he feels and thinks.' His way of making a living has a profound influence upon his mental habits. As the technology underlying man's way of making a living changes, new mental habits are established which eventually harden into new industrial arrangements. In this fashion the whole institutional complex guiding human behavior is subject to the disruptive pressure of a changing technology." 16 Veblen claimed that the decay of earlier habits of thought based on an anthropomorphic view of the external world was due to changes in industrial technology. Romantic notions of this external world had been transformed by the "corrosive touch" of technology; new mental habits come into being, supported by a matter-of-fact kind of knowl- edge. Veblen asserted the superiority of such modes of thought for cultural progress, but cautioned that even the improved operations of reason and intelligence emanating from the technological discipline were not enough, in themselves, to guarantee cultural progress and survival of the race. People must use reason and intelligence creatively, within the context of traditional modes of thinking, to survive. He was ultimately skeptical about the outcome of technology as it related to man's thinking and behavior.</page><page sequence="9">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 27 Veblen's work dealt extensively with the conditions of factory labor, yet "in all probability [he] had very little direct knowledge of factories - in any case ... it is not so much direct experience with the factory as the personal and cultural interpretation of experience which dictates attitudes."17 His sympathy for mechanization, so rare among intellectuals, was doubtless a product of his Minnesota boyhood. His father had been unique in the Norwegian immigrant community for employing machinery in his farm operations. Furthermore, as a child Veblen developed a distaste for farming or, more generally, for any kind of manual labor which a machine could be made to do. Thus he "was almost completely free of the rural yearning or nostalgia of many enemies of the industrial revolution. Furthermore, his uncommonly sharp eye for leisure-class patronizations perceived that those who sighed over the passing of the peasant and the artisan of earlier times were gulled by a feudalistic esthetic, which preferred keeping the lower orders in their orderly places." 18 Veblen reacted strongly against such senti- ment, but also disdained the simple-minded and naive artisan, preferring a no-nonsense utilization of machinery to handle drudgery. Yet Veblen did not glorify machinery, for to do so would be merely to substitute one superstitious animism for another. Machines are machines, nothing more; they should be treated with solicitude, as should men, but not revered. "And in this sense the emphasis on machines served in a way of reducing differences among men. . . . Veblen made men submit to equalization by making them small, in the face of machinery and of the Darwinian flux."19 Few writers have done more to domesticate the machine, or welcome it as a means toward making men more sober and peaceable. The machine was capable of creating a "second nature" for men, workmanlike and orderly, and freed from superstitious animisms adhering to more creative work, such as that of artisans. For him, too, society could be cleansed by machinery. Veblen speaks in The Theory of the Leisure Class of "the impulse to self-expression and workmanship." In his essay, "The Instinct of Workmanship and the Irksomeness of Labor," he denies that it is natural for men to look on work as disagreeable; rather, invidious cultural definitions of work as degrading and unpleasant lead men to look upon it as such. And despite his admiration for machinery, he states in various places - particularly at the end of The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts - that human nature, having been molded in the vastly different cultures of antiquity, is peculiarly unsuited to machine industry. Veblen presented a process of the development of institutions, in a technological sense, through what he referred to as the "savage," the "barbarian," and the "handicraft" stages into the "machine" age of the present. For Veblen, as for Marx and Engels, technology was the prime mover in these transitions from stage to stage. He interpreted such movements as socialism as attempts by the rest of the culture to catch up with the machine-made industrial revolution. Within the machine age Veblen saw emerging an increasing polarity between the "engineers" and their allies - i.e., skilled workmen and scientists - on the one hand, and "absentee owners" and their allies - i.e., accountants, bankers, lawyers, politicians - on the other. These two groups played distinctly different roles in the production process: the engineers produced, and the absentee owners interfered with production on behalf of evergreater profits. Veblen emphasized "the seemingly strong contrast between the machine process and the business enterprise erected upon the process, asserting that</page><page sequence="10">28 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 the former was concerned with the satisfaction of human needs, the latter with the making of money."20 What struck him as odd was that this class of expert workers (he included farmers and artisans, as well as engineers and scientists) was allowing itself to be supervised by a class of people whose chief, if not only, aim was the largest possible returns of money, not the maximum production of goods. This seemed inconsistent since, in his view, the tremendous strides in the economic realm which had been made in the course of the industrial revolution had been due almost wholly to the progress of technology. One of Veblen's greatest contributions to the analysis of human behavior was his distinction between the operation of technology and ceremony in men's lives. His insight in this regard was no doubt given impetus by the impressions made upon him by the then infant sciences of anthropology and economics, and by the fact that he was and had always been an "outsider" in relation to society and academia. His critics disagree on many aspects of his thought, but they are generally in accord in viewing this distinction as fundamental to his analyses and among his most significant contributions to modern thought in general. This theme was "equally fundamental to the thinking of . . . John Dewey, who . . . himself acknowledged the influence of Veblen."21 The dynamics of technology, promoting continuous change, and the static influence of ceremony - ritual, myth, traditional mores - oppos- ing change, have always been in tension with one another in shaping human history. Usually the static has maintained the stronger hold on men's view of their world, and when it has not, its subjugation has been largely involuntary. There have been very few technological revolutions in history - the earliest use of tools in the Stone Age, the advent of a civilization based on agriculture, the industrial revolution. The outcome of this latest Veblen thought in 1914 ( The Instinct of Workmanship) to be still in doubt. It was to him a moot question whether "imbecile institutions" would ultimately be victorious over human values. In the last analysis, in spite of his claims to the contrary, Veblen allied himself, more or less unequivocally, with the rationalists of the progressive era. Proponents of the idea of technological or economic determinism employ the concept of "cultural lag" to demonstrate that people are slow to respond in their mode of thinking to changes in the physical nature of their existence. But, since culture not only reflects but conditions the physical side of life, the very existence of technological change is indicative of its acceptance into culture. Economic and technical advance in the United States have probably outdistanced the progress made in religion, politics, and other peripheral activities of life. Veblen applied the term "cultural lag" to this situation, speaking from a strictly economic point of view. In the American idiom, "lag" has a negative connotation, implying backwardness rather than a conservative withholding of opinion. Yet Veblen staunchly maintained - in all he wrote - that he was free of any value judgments, and that from other viewpoints such as, say, an esthetic one, what was laggard might be judged good. Much of his Theory of the Leisure Class deals with an analysis of the snob appeal that attaches to outdated and antique things and concepts, which are useless from a functional or economic point of view. This he counterposed to the negative prestige which surrounds the new and useful and mechanical. He argued that the leisure class itself is a laggard class which, because of its wealth, is able to exist at a comfortable remove from economic development. As such, it is a hindrance to progress.</page><page sequence="11">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 29 A clear distinction exists between the pecuniary employments which represent the purely economic interests of the leisure class, and the industrial employments representing the interests of the working class. Leisure class employments foster a predatory attitude and are concerned with economic functions insofar as they deal with the ownership of wealth, its management, and financiering. The captain of industry is a clever person, but Veblen says that he is of "no economic value to the community." He is not an organic part of the industrial community he supervises, and because of his wealth is not forced to change his habits and mode of thought to keep up with technological changes. On the other hand, the workers within the industrial system, because they require the means of livelihood, are more or less forced to change their life habits and make use of technological advance in order to survive. Unlike Marx, Veblen did not seek to accomplish political ends through the dissemination of his thought. As has been stated, he assumed his conclusions to be value free, and thus did not promote any concise ideology as an effective cure for the state of affairs he described. He spoke of the existence of classes - recognizing only two - as a kind of a priori condition in a technology-dominated culture, and although in his descriptions of them he ascribed very different functions to each, their interaction with one another (and the notion of class conflict) seems not to have been of much interest. Perhaps because of his own isolation from others, Veblen's presentations are characterized by those qualities he so admired in machine technology: dispassionate impersonality and matter-of-fact objectivity. He saw his role as that of an uninvolved reporter whose suggestions for reform were more an intellectual exercise than a plea for ameliorating men's miseries. The influence of Veblen's theories on American intellectual thought was testified to by the establishment in the 1920's and 1930's of Veblen clubs which sprang up for the purpose of consolidating and applying his principles of analysis. Lewis Mumford was among those who acknowledged his indebt- edness to the economist. John Dewey's "Planning Society" It remained for a man like John Dewey to take some of Veblen's notions and humanize them. Dewey was to lay much emphasis on man's "creative intelligence" as a means for affecting societal structures, as he sought to integrate the time-honored American virtue of individualism with the anonym- ity inherent in an industrial environment. American culture had undergone a rapid and thorough transformation and, although the nation was prospering, the individual had suffered the loss of a sense of self-worth and responsibility. Material progress was in direct proportion to spiritual and moral regression. Survival in a "money culture" meant nurturing those aspects of life which are external and tangible at the expense of the development of the soul. Dewey pointed out that some people chose to ignore the discontinuities of the physical world and behave according to the old standards of the free and responsible, pretechnology individual, the independent pioneer; others sought solace and meaning in group formation, not only in industry but in the nonbusiness sphere as well (Dewey hints that the motive is a negative one, a sort of "misery-loves-company" ethic). Both reactions, the old individu- alism and the new collectivism, were inadequate to the exigencies of industrial society. It was unavoidable that the machine age would be "hostile" to the traditional concept of individuality, and that the influence of business</page><page sequence="12">30 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 corporations would lead to a "tendency to combination in all phases of life."22 What was required, said Dewey, was a radically different concept of individu- ality, which is not fixed and ultimate but rather operates in relationship to a society that is ever in flux. Individuality must always be a process of becoming, a dynamic and transient thing, not a once-and-for-all end in itself which, once achieved, can be smugly asserted in any situation. Social relations and publicly held values are what produce a relevant, "assured and integrated individuality," and they are never in a final form. Dewey points to the captains of industry as prime examples of this kind of static, belligerently assertive individualism. They seem to be in control, but "until there is some consensus of belief as to the meaning of finance and industry in civilization as a whole, they cannot be captains of their own souls - their beliefs and aims. They exercise leadership surreptitiously and, as it were, absent-mindedly. They lead, but is is under cover of impersonal and socially undirected economic forces. Their reward is found not in what they do, in their social office and function, but in a deflection of social consequences to private gain."23 Such men form corporations and achieve results which give them no sense of social usefulness or inner fulfillment. Nor can it be otherwise so long as they view their business lives and profits as private. To compensate for this state of frustration, they invest more and more energy in accruing additional wealth and power. As for the masses, they lack even that status and autonomy which wealth and power confer, and function largely at the whim of circumstance. Thus, says Dewey, "the unrest, impatience, irritation and hurry that are so marked in American life are inevitable accompaniments of a situation in which individuals do not find support and contentment in the fact that they are sustaining and sustained members of a social whole. They are evidence, psychologically, of abnormality, and it is . . . idle to seek for their explanation within the deliberate intent of individuals. . . . Only an acute maladjustment between individuals and the social conditions under which they live can account for such widespread pathological phenomena. Feverish love of anything as long as it is a change which is distracting, impatience, unsettlement, nervous discontentment and desire for excitement, are not native to human nature."24 When men's minds are at odds with the reality "out there" society itself experiences what Dewey calls a "profound split." Individuality of the mind - the creative faculty - is subordinated to the pseudoindividuality of the market- place. As part of this separation he notes the dual meaning of the idea of "acceptance." There is acceptance which is made by the intellect and involves "facing facts"; there is also emotional acceptance which is a function of desires. In the new technological environment these two forms of acceptance are not only dissimilar but often mutually exclusive; that is, intellectual acceptance mandates a denial of instinctual drives and impulses. In such a system, intellectual and moral freedom is more a mythical ideal than a fact. Dewey bemoaned the fact that in the face of so much discontent Americans scarcely thought about these problems in this light, much less tried to influence them. The United States had emerged from World War I still clinging to the old socioeconomic regime, despite the war's having manifestly revealed the deficiencies of the system. American civilization was weakened by large-scale unemployment which, however injurious to the economy, was an even worse evil in terms of the humiliation and demoralization experienced by the jobless - people willing and able to work but consigned to welfare rolls, substandard housing, and unwanted idleness. Sobering, too, was the</page><page sequence="13">THE IMPACT OF TECHNOLOGY ON CONSCIOUSNESS 31 situation for many of the industrially employed, whose remuneration was so small as to render them very little better off - except, perhaps, in morale - than the jobless. Slums were breeding grounds for disease; people who managed to avoid ill health where they lived were exposed to unsanitary conditions, accident, incapacitation, and death in the factories. And if these people were still somehow able to survive and cope with the wretchedness of existence, they were repeatedly and forcefully made aware of their low level of living by a comparison of their condition with that of the well-to-do. Science, with its capacity for bettering man's existence, had been manipulated and channeled by men of means to further their own ends. The production and distribution of goods - another serious flaw, according to Dewey - had evolved and was continuing to operate on a "non-social basis," for profit and not for social good, as Veblen had extensively shown. Inefficiency was criminal because of "the failure to utilize human power. The great advance [was] ... in the utilizing of natural power."25 Refusing to embrace "socialism" (which Dewey said had been so overused and applied in so many varying instances that one hardly knew what it was), he offered that common sense should dictate a reorganization of society to remove or reduce the obvious wrongs. People should never be denied the right to work; nor be forced to live in drab, unclean dwellings; nor participate in work which they take no joy in and are powerless to influence. Dewey urged greater industrial autonomy, a granting of some measure of self-management to the worker. "We cannot in any good conscience return, after the war, to the old period of drifting, so-called evolution, as a necessary method of procedure."26 Radical social change was implausible, and in Europe had frequently produced the opposite of intended results. What had to be determined was whether the required changes in the social and economic spheres could be accomplished without destroying the valuable features of democracy. Coercive legislation would endanger those freedoms of expression and association which Americans take for granted. Mere good intentions and intellectual ability are not enough. "Social objective intelligence," creatively and methodically applied, is called for to effect social change. Such social control, resting in the hands of the society at large, can root out evils without posing a threat to the foundations of democracy. Dewey would applaud a "continuously planning society" making adjustments as circumstances war- rant; he opposed this to the socialist concept of a planned society which fixes goals and forces changing conditions to fit the mold - a not very social orientation at all. Until such action is taken, he warned, dissatisfaction and unrest must necessarily prevail. Conclusion A facile summation of the impact of technology upon American con- sciousness is impossible. An understanding of the pros and cons of the debate has been enhanced by those analyses characterized by moderation and balance - keen vision coupled with calm reasoning. Fortunately for the future, the fact that so many have failed to formulate a unifying interpretation of the technological dilemma has not been a noticeable deterrent to continued efforts. People own more "things" than ever before but are dissatisfied, as witnessed by the booming business being done by psychoanalysts and psychiatrists; the burgeoning of consciousness-raising groups; the trend toward Eastern religions and philosophies; the incidence of ulcers, alcoholism, and</page><page sequence="14">32 SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR WINTER 1974 drug addiction; the evidence of deteriorating interpersonal relationships. In the "land of plenty" there is plenty of instability and discontent. To leave it to the gods would be a statement of resignation; but we are not resigned, we do care, and in that there is hope.
