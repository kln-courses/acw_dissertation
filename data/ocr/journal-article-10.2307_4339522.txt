Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins Press; London: Humphrey Milford; Oxford: University Press (1929). Pp. XVii, io8. 2 Colored Plates, 95 Figures. $7.50. The first excavations conducted by Professor D. M. Robinson on the site of ancient Olynthus recovered the remains of a neolithic settlement. The task of publish- ing the finds was entrusted to one of Professor Robin- son's students, George E. Mylonas, who has since that time distinguished himself through his excavations at Eleusis, Hagios Kosmas, and elsewhere. Inasmuch at the contents of this book have to do with a culture that is whollv pre-Hellenic and even pre- Helladic, their discussion hardly belongs to the field of THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY. It will be sufficient, therefore, to quote the author's summary of the results of his studies (96): . . .The first settlement at Olynthus was founded towards the close of the 4th millennium B.C. by tribes who did not belong to the Indo-European race. They had no metals and they used stone for their tools and weapons. Their civilization, primitive as it was, was not very crude. They were no longer "food gatherers" but they were "food producers". They no longer depended on the fruit of the trees and on the berries of the bushes for their livelihood, but they cultivated the soil and had domestic animals. The discoverv of carbonized remains of wheat, millet, figs, of bones of domestic animals, proves that they were farmers and shepherds. The absence of weapons discloses the peaceful character of the settlers. . . . They produced good pottery, plain and more seldom incised and painted, which they baked in elaborately constructed and regulated kilns. With their primitive stone and bone tools they also made beautiful stone bracelets, stone vases and stone celts. Their religious ideas are unknown, but they must have been advanced and of an anthropomorphic nature, if we consider the figurines and the small-legged vases as representations of goddesses and as altars. Their village was finally destroyed by an invading foe. The fate of the survivors is unknown, but they never retumed to their ruined village and the site remained unoccupied till historical times . . . UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA A. D.
