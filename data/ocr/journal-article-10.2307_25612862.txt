<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CARIBBEAN WRITER AND EXILE Jan Carew* There was, a traditional format in the classical Akan theatre around which all drama-comedy, tragedy, farce-evolved. The important features of this drama were these: there was an archetypal middle man and on either side of him were powerful spirits opposing one another. The figure in the middle often stood between malevolent and benign spirits of the ancestral dead, and a host of other spirits that were urbane or demonic, creative or destructive, compassionate or cruel, surrogates of the living or the dead, ethereal or earthy, part saint, part trickster. These spirits were involved in eternal conflicts which could only be resolved if the human being periodically renewed contact with communal wellsprings or rhythm, creation and life. The Caribbean writer today is a creature balanced between limbo and nothingness, exile abroad and homeless at home; between the people on the one hand and the creole and the colonizer on the other. Exile can be voluntary or it can be imposed by stress of circumstances; it can be a punishment or a pleasure. The exile can leave home for a short time or he can be expelled forever. The colonising zeal of the European made indigenous peoples exiles in their own countries-Prospero made Caliban an exile in his. The Caribbean writer by going abroad is in fact searching for an end to exile. This, at first, appears to be a contradiction until one lays bare some of the truths of Caribbean life. The Caribbean person in subjected to successive waves of cultural alienation from birth, a process that has its origins embedded in a mosaic of cutlural fragments?Amerindian, African, European, Asian. The European fragment is brought into sharper focus than the others, but it remains a fragment. Hiding behind the screen of this European cultural fragment the Caribbean writer oscillates in and out of sunlight and shadows, exile abroad and homelessness at home. At home, he is what C.L.R. James described very aptly as a "twentieth century man living in a seventeenth century economy,"1 while abroad he is a performer in a circus of civilization. There are times when he claims that he is-a nomad, but this is one of his clever * Professor, Department of African-American Studies, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois. 1. C.L.R.

The irony of it all is that he can only become a nomad when his place in the sun, the speck on the globe that is his home is freed from the economic, psychological and political clutches of usurpers, who had seized it since the beginning of the Columbian era. The spaces that the nomad's imagination encompass exist within a circumference of seasons, and national borders have no meaning for him. For the Caribbean writer, therefore, to become a true nomad his feet must traverse a territory that his imagination encompasses without let or hindrance. In his country, however, the land, the air-space, the water, the minerals under the earth are owned from abroad and administered by local surrogates; the rights of passage are overtly or covertly restricted. Every new trespass, therefore, is a kind of reckless lurch into a wider indifference. The term Caribbean in this essay describes the island archipelago, the countries on the Caribbean littoral and Guyana, Surinam and Cayenne. Cuba is the exception that proves the rule. Cuba belongs to the Cubans. In Cuba, the northeastern sheet anchor of the Caribbean archipelago, the pre-revolutionary economic relationship between ex patriate owners, local surrogates and the majority of people, no longer exists. Cuba is, therefore, a point of reference for us, a living example of how in less than two decades, age-old problems of economic and cultural alienation, race and color, caste, class and identity, can be looked at afresh and in many instances successfully dealt with. In order to deal with one's heritage of exile today, one must return to the begin nings of the Columbian era. Marx said that history always repeats itself; the first time is tragedy and the next time farce, and in the Caribbean we often appear to be like sleep-walkers reliving the history and repeating the farce. The early accounts written by European colonizers about their apocalyptic intrusion into the Amerindian domains are characterized, with few exceptions, by romantic evasions of truth and voluminous omissions. Have we ever really examined the images that these historical fictions have created of us? If we do so empirically, then we can begin to understand this question of exile abroad and homelessness at home of the writer. After Columbus and his sailors were discovered by the Arawakian Lucayos on their beaches in 1492, the Americas of the colonizer came into being as part of both a literary exercise and one of the most apalling acts of ethnocide in recorded history. First, there were Columbus' diaries (the first literary offering of the interlopers), which told us more about the man himself than about the islands he had stumbled upon; and the man revealed to us was a schizoid being, a Janus astride two worlds, one medieval, the other of the Renaissance. These diaries are a blend of fantasies fed by writings from the Middle Ages; obsessive ramblings about a new crusade to recapture Jerusalem from the infidel Turks; special pleadings to the sovereigns of Castile; a precise sailor's log and useful scientific observations about the flora, fauna and topography of the lands visited. His writings about the people he met are</page><page sequence="3">CARIBBEAN STUDIES / VOL. 19, NOS. 1 AND 2 113 contradictory, inaccurate, biased and in the midst of pious declarations about converting "natives" to Christianity, sprinkled with asides of racial arrogance and a lust for gold. Columbus led an early life that was very similar to the one that future Caribbean artists, vagabonds, sailors, writers and immigrants would lead centuries later. In his journey from a nameless street in Genoa to the Portuguese and Spanish courts, he had to cross two centuries. Son of a wool carder, he began his trespass into the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries with little more than great expectations, and his whole life, in fact, was to become a journey to new illusions. He had had to cross not only distances in time and space, but the almost immeasurable gulf between the lower middle class and the nobility. Having made this impossible leap he carried with him a multitude of insecurities and a persistent fear of looking back and acknowledging his lowly beginnings. On his first journey across the Atlantic, Columbus became prey to the medieval fantasies nurtured like fungus on his narrow Genoese street with its gloomy doorways yawning like entrances to minotaur caves, its shuttered windows and its persistent odours of decay which the sea breezes even now do not seem to dispel completely. As he became more and more convinced that he would survive the Atlantic crossing, his mind was filled with dreams of golden-roofed palaces on the one hand, and on the other, a beastiary inhabited by gryphons and by other fabulous creatures, some of which ate human flesh, had human bodies and the snouts of dogs. When he did not find the monsters that medieval writers had dreamed up, Columbus invented a monstrous racial slander: he declared that the Caribs were cannibals. What we can prove about the Caribs is that they fought with surpassing courage and skill against the European intruders, and that this became the basis for a new kind of ideological arrangement. Those who welcomed the colonizers were praised, enslaved and exterminated, and those who resisted were damned. The contumely heaped upon the heads of the Caribs by Columbus led to interesting lexical and literary aberrations -from Carib derived the word cannibal and from cannibal Shakespeare gave us Cali ban. The institutionalisation of racism and colonialism begins with the Carib, can nibal, Caliban slander, one that has persisted for five centuries. In the Caribbean, school children are still being taught from texts, some of which have ostensibly been written by eminent Caribbean historians, that the Caribs ate human flesh. Richard Moore, the Barbadian historian, refuted this calumny in a brilliant booklet and in an article, both very well researched.2 Both the Carib cannibal and the African and other Third World species are fruit from the same tree of racism. Every time a 2. Richard B.

ARTICLES Caribbean child reads about the ancestral cannibal it becomes an unconscious act of psychological self-mutilation. "Do we not know," Jose Marti had written, "that the same blow that paralyzes the Indian, cripples us."3 But our children neither read the works of Marti nor know who he is. They are still taught to idolize the colonizer and in so doing hate themselves. On his second voyage, Columbus found human bones, relics of ancestor worship, in Carib huts in Dominica. He used this as evidence to prove his racial slander. Had a group of Caribs "discovered" Rome and visited the catacombs, they too would have found certain Catholic Orders preserving human bones, and by the same curious logic that Columbus used, could have assumed that the Pope and his followers were cannibals. If the Admiral of the Ocean Sea had stayed in Genoa he would most likely have remained a part time sailor and a worker in wool. His family had for generations been clothmakers. They took sheep's wool, spun it into thread and wove the thread into cloth which they finally sold. Since ancient times, the Genoese youth, particularly those from the lower middle class, had gone to sea in search of fame and fortune. For it they were ambitious, it would be clear as bells of the angelus that for them their society was one of many dogs and few bones. So the urge to seasons of adventure was not entirely a romantic one. During the Renaissance the challenge of conquering the seemingly infinite spaces of the Atlantic beyond the Pillars of Hercules, began to excite the imaginations of those young Genoese as it had never done before. Many of them migrated to Portugal, the foremost centre of the nautical sciences in fifteenth century Europe. There were so many Genoese in Portugal that the Cortes in 1481 petitioned the King to exclude them from his dominions. Columbus arrived in Portugal when he was about thirty years old. He is a man with whom we should be well acquainted, for he had heaped so much suffering upon our ancestors that we would be betraying their dreams of freedom for all mankind if we did not mark him well. We should know not only the mythical Columbus, but also the real one. And, since knowing is not just an abstract concept for us, we should be able to divine clearly what he looked like. His son Ferdinand said of him: The Admiral was a well built man of more than medium stature, long visaged with cheeks somewhat high, but neither fat nor thin. He had an aquiline nose and his eyes were light in color; his complexion too was light, but kindling to a vivid red. In youth his hair was blond, but when he came to his thirtieth year it all turned white.4 3. Roberto Retamar, "Caliban," Massachusetts Review (1973). 4. S.

It would be interesting to discover how many generations of the Columbus family subsequently rode on the backs of sweating and anonymous Africans. But let us return to the improverished Columbus setting himself up in Portugal. He did not remain in penury for long, because he soon married a noble, wealthy and well-connected lady, Beatriz Enriquez de Harana, and he was eventually able to plead for royal sponsorship of what he himself described as La Empresa de las Indias, the Enterprise of the Indies. The King of Portugal turned him down, but nine years later Ferdinand and Isabella, the Rulers of Castille, became his patrons. Certain that he could sail to India and China via the Western Seas, he surprised the Indians on their island beaches in the Bahamas, believing for a while that these islands were in the Bay of Bengal. Alberigo Vespucci?and I deliberately use his authentic Christian name?a Florentine dilettante and rascal, corrected Columbus' error, if error it really was, because Columbus and Vespucci remained on very close and friendly terms until the former's death in 1506. Vespucci, having sailed to the American mainland declared that what Columbus had indeed stumbled upon was a New World?a surprising decla ration about twin continents which had already been inhabited for over two hundred milleniums. Having returned from his travels, Vespucci wrote a number of letters to the Due de Medici in Paris, using a lively and entertaining prose style, and causing a great stir when these letters were published. Columbus' writings are intense, humourless, turgid, occasionally poetic. The intensity of his passions seems to burn through the dense prose and illuminate it for moments, until once again it becomes uneven, repetitive and dense?the culminative effect of what is left of his writing (most of the originals have been lost), is like fists drumming against one's brain. Vespucci, on the other hand, composing his QuatourNavigationes (c. 1504-1505) in Portugal, did not write in the white heat of his experiences.6 He gave us an elegant, 5. Ibid., pp. 62-63. 6. J.

ARTICLES retrospective and very persuasive view, and he was never averse to plagiarism if the accounts of other people's voyages could enhance his own. Vespucci invented a colonizer's America, and the reality that is ours never recovered from this literary assault and the distortions he inflicted upon it. The fiction of a "virgin land" inhabited by savages, at once a racist one and a contradiction, remains with us to this day. Amerigo was undoubtedly a Florentine dilettante, but he was also an extraordinarily clever one. Why would he otherwise have changed his Christian name after his voyages to the Americas? There is a mountain range in Nicaragua called the Sierra Amerrique, and a group of Indians called Los Amerriques. These mountains stretch between Juigalpa and Libertad in the province of Chontales, and they separate Lake Nicaragua from the Mosquito Coast. The Amerriques had, since pre-Columbian times, always been in contact with the area around Cape Gracias a Dios, and the whole length of the Mosquito Coast.7 In 1502, Columbus visited this coast at Carriai and Carambaru. In 1497, Vespucci landed at Cape Gracias a Dios, and in 1505 sailed along the Mosquito Coast. Both navigators must certainly have heard the word "Amerrique" from the Indians over and over again during those voyages. After the initial greetings and the limping exchange of pleasantries, it was a tradition with explorers like Columbus and Vespucci?they confirm this repeatedly in their writings?to ask the Indians where gold could be found. For, as Cortes confessed, they all suffered from a disease that only gold could cure. The alluvial gravels of the Sierra Amerrique had yielded gold for the Indians from time immemorial. They used gold, the sun's sweat, to create objects of surpassing beauty. It was a good metal for sculpture. Beyond that it had little value in itself until it was touched by man's creative genius. By capturing light on the burnished surfaces that metal workers and sculptors created through the use of fire, gold could link people to the sun, moon and stars, and both the act of creative labor and the object created became touched by magic, mystery and beauty. Sometimes they indented pieces of raw gold, and putting them in a sack full of sand, allowed the sea or a running stream to sculpt and polish them, and so through these processes the objects, man, Nature and the gods could become one. For the colonizer gold meant money, personal and national aggrandizement and power over others. In their burgeoning capitalist system, gold could buy a place in the very Throne Room of the Kingdom of Heaven for the most despicable sinner. And in particular, once this sinner made the right propitiatory noises to the Almighty and gave generously to the Church, he could be assured of absolution from any crime committed against the colonized. "I came for gold, not to till the land," Cortes had declared. He was noted for his occasional outbursts of brutal frankness about himself 7. Ibid., p. 8.</page><page sequence="7">CARIBBEAN STUDIES / VOL. 19, NOS. 1 AND 2 117 and his countrymen. Their lust for gold was such that the Indians declared that the colonizer could even rape the sun to rob it of its miraculous sweat. For Columbus and Vespucci, therefore, the words "Amerrique" and "gold" had become synonymous. After his visits to the Mosquito Coast?he made the last one in 1505?Vespucci changed his Christian name from Alberico to Amerigo. In the Archives of Toledo, a letter from Vespucci to the Cardinal dated 9 December 1508, is signed Amerrigo with the double "r" as in the Indian Amerrique.8 And between 1508 and 1512, the year in which Vespucci died, at least two other signatures with the Christian name Amerrigo were recorded. Robbing peoples and countries of their indigenous names was one of the cruel games that colonizers played with the colonized. Names are like magic markers in the long and labyrinthine streams of racial memory, for racial memories are rivers leading to the sea where the memory of mankind is stored. To rob people or countries of their name is to set in motion a psychic disturbance which can in turn create a permanent crisis of identity. As if to underline this fact, the theft of an important place name from the heartland of the Americas and the claim that it was a dilettante's Christian name robs the original name of its elemental meaning. Dr. A. Le Plongeon, a 19th century scholar from Merida (Yucatan), in a letter to the French Professor Jules Marcou dated 10 December 1881, wrote: The name America or Amerrique in the Mayan language means a country of perpetually strong wind, or the Land of the Wind, and sometimes the suffix "-ique," "-ik" and "-ika" can mean not only wind or air but also a spirit that breathes, life itself9 We must, therefore, reclaim the name of our America and give it once again its primordial meaning, land of the wind, the fountainhead of life and movement. In the Mayan genesis myth, the Popol Vuh, Wind stands at the centre of creation. As the story unfolds, we are told that it was manifested to the gods: That at dawn man should appear. So they decided on the creation and the growth of trees and bees and the birth of life and the creation of man. This was resolved in the darkness and in the night by the Heart of Heaven called Hurricane.10 8. Ibid., p. 79. 9. Ibid, p. 6. 10. S. Paz, "Popol Vuh."

ARTICLES On the rocky eastern slopes of the Sierra Amerrique the wind pounds like giant fists upon the gates of time demanding to be recognized. Asturias's novel Strong Wind11 resurrects this symbol of the wind in a Guatemalan setting that is near to the Sierra Amerrique. In this novel Hurricane, the Heart of Heaven, the Mayan and Carib god, unleashed its avenging wrath upon the huge banana plantations owned by an overseas concern that was remarkably like the United Fruit Company. Other Caribbean writers, English-speaking ones, had written about hurricanes. There was John Hearne,12 and Edgar Mittelholzer;13 but their hurricanes had no roots in America's mythological archetypes; the British did not encourage this kind of thing in their stultified colonial educational systems. Heame can be excused. The Jamaican indigenous connection was absolutely severed by ethnocide, but Mittelholzer came from a country where the Amerindian still lives in the forests of the Guyana hinterland and in the forests of our flesh and blood. In Strong Wind, Asturias reunites myth, magic, man, creative labor and the elements. His American characters with the exception of Stoner, the hero, are slightly unreal; and Stoner is real because he became indigenized. He fought with and for the people and in the process became their brother and no longer their master. So, by the time Stoner and his wife were killed, it was a death outside the pale of the Judaeo-Christian tradition; rather it was one that the god Hurricane demanded so that an act of expiation could be im mortalized. Hearne and Mittelholzer's hurricanes are depicted with a kind of clinical detach ment. Their strong wind seems anglicized when compared to Asturias's Amerindianized one. The similarity between Columbus' life and that of the colonials he ultimately helped to bring into being ends the moment he himself became a colonizer. The Atlantic crossing created profound psychological changes in those who made it. If all the cultural baggage dumped in the Middle Passage during the five centuries of the Columbian era were to be dredged up, it would need a new planet to house it. Having survived the crossing, Columbus and his sailors announced to their Indian hosts that they had come "from Heaven."14 It was something of a contradiction, Las Casas remarked cryptically, to have come from Heaven and to be so overcome with a lust for gold. As a dying Cuban cacique was to reveal, the colonizer gave Heaven a bad name in the eyes of the colonized. In 1509, the self-proclaimed "men from Heaven"15 had turned their attention to the beautiful island of Cuba. One of the principal caciques there, hearing in advance of their coming, carried out a propitiatory 11. M. A. Asturias, Strong Wind (New York: Dell Publishing Co., Laurel Edition, 1968). 12.

He was convinced that since gold was the only real god the Spanish worshipped, if this god was thrown away, perhaps he and his people would be spared. The invaders incensed by this act of sacrilege had the cacique burnt alive. When he was in the midst of the flames a Franciscan Friar of great piety, holding a cross before him, promised the cacique eternal life if he would embrace the Christian faith and hell and damnation if he didn't. With the fire burning slowly to prolong the torture, the Friar, as best as he could, tried to explain some half a hundred doctrines of the Christian faith. The cacique, in the midst of his discomfort, enquired if Heaven was open to all Spaniards: "Some who were good can hope to be admitted there," the Friar replied. "Then," declared the cacique, "since I would prefer not to share Heaven with such cruel company, if you'd swear that none of your people will go to hell, hell would be the perfect place for me."16 We are, in fact, re-examining the roots of our Columbian exile because as an Amerindian proverb says, those who forget the past will re-live it again and again. If we neglect to complete this task of re-examination, then the contradictions between our psychological and actual exile, an induced state of intellectual amnesia and a conscious awareness of what was, what is, and what is to be done, is liable to lead us into a labyrinth of metaphysics. For our intention must be not merely to analyse the world, our world, but to change it. Only by changing our world can we inherit it, and only by inheriting it can we end our internal and external exile. The first European settlement in the Americas was established in Marien, one of the five Kingdoms on the island of Bohio which the Spaniards renamed Hispaniola. The settlement was called La Navidad. Guacanagari, the ruler of Marien had treated the Spaniards with great hospitality on their arrival. When the Santa Maria was wrecked on Christmas Day 1492, because Juan de la Cosa and a group of Basque shipmates had disobeyed Columbus' orders and tried to save their own skins, the Admiral himself wrote that at sunrise on 26 December, this same Guacanagari came aboard the Nina: and said that he would give him all that he had, and that he had given the Christians who were ashore two very big houses, and would give more if necessary. . . . "To such extent" says the Admiral, "are they loyal and without greed for the property of others, and that King was virtuous above all."17 16. J. Thatcher, Christopher Columbus (New York: G. Putnam and Sons, 1903), I: 128 17. Ibid., p. 125.</page><page sequence="10">120 I. ARTICLES Las Casas revealed the fate that befell Guacanagari barely a decade later: The Spaniards pursued this Chief with peculiar bitterness and forced him to abandon his Kingdom ... he died of fatigue and sorrow. Those of his people who were not fortunate enough to be killed suffered countless pains in slavery.18 After a warm and hospitable reception, Columbus repaid his Amerindian hosts by enslaving them hardly a year later. The Atlantic slave trade began when under Columbus' sponsorship, a shipload of five hundred Indians was dispatched to Spain in 1493. The absence of greed for the property of others is definitely not a quality that has surfaced in the hearts of colonizers during the five centuries of the Columbian era. After the five Kingdoms of Hispaniola and their estimated three million inhabitants were erased, the peoples of Jamaica and Puerto Rico were next in line for their journey to oblivion. By 1540, these two islands which between them had a population of six hundred thousand, could boast of having hardly 200 of their original inhabitants alive. The population figures are those of Las Casas and, naturally, apologists for the colonizer have often warned us that his figures should be doubted. But who should be believed, the initiators, sponsors and apologists of ethnocide, or one who fought for its victims for sixty-eight of his ninety-two years. The silences and the empty spaces which remained in the wake of this early example of a final solution, bore eloquent testimony to the enormity of the crime. Even if the figures are incorrect we might well ask where then are the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean today? Why don't they come forward and speak for themselves? I have penetrated into those profound silences which remain in the aftermath of ethnocide, for it is not only a crime of past centuries, it lives on today. In vast areas of the Guyana highlands west of the Pakaraimas and south of the Akarai, the Amerindian peoples are still being exterminated and their land is still being violated by usurpers. There are islands of silence in those vast spaces which leave a more terrible impression on the mind than screams of the dying. In those profound silences, the Mayan Popol Vuh is no longer a genesis myth, but a prophecy, for it began like this: This is the story of how everything was in suspense, everything becalmed, wrapped in silence, everything immobile, silent and empty in the vastness of the sky.19 As one penetrates into those brooding spaces, one feels the pain and suffering of 18. Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea, 1: 390-91. 19. Paz, "Popol Vuh."</page><page sequence="11">CARIBBEAN STUDIES / VOL. 19, NOS. 1 AND 2 121 the dead Amerindian hosts, and at that moment one begins to realize that the real dead are the sowers of death, not its victims; at that moment one understands the unwritten histories of the victims intuitively and enters into the heart of their suffering. One feels their anguish in the same way that an amputee feels a persistent ache in the limb he has lost; and at that moment one also becomes the inheritor of the dauntless courage and the humanity of the victims, and at that moment suffering is no longer suffering and death is no longer death. Perhaps it is at that moment, too, that one sees the beginning of the end of exile. But before one deals with the cure one must diagnose the ailment. The history of our exile is a dismal one of ethnocide, slavery, indentured labor, racism, colonialism and more recently neo-colonialism. Everywhere that we touch the earth in this hemisphere and seek to establish roots, the roots are bound to invade the graves of the innocent dead. For, after the Indian was sent on his journey to oblivion, the colonizer established new colonies of the dead?slaves from Africa, indentured labour from India, China, Java, Madeira and once again Africa, and along with these the permanent human flotsam in Capitalism's Kingdom of Chance, the unemployed, the hungry, the sick who belong to no special race, color or creed, they are numbers in statistical tables, raw material for academics to pontificate upon. To define this situation today in simplistic cliches about black, brown or white power is to induce a kind of intellectual euphoria in which the mind becomes anesthetized with half-truths. One has to excavate the answers from the abyss of one's self and one's mutilated society. I had pointed out earlier that the Caribbean writer was, poised between limbo and nothingness, like the middle man in Akan classical drama, but we, in fact, Caribbeanized the role and became not so much a figure in the middle of Furies and benign spirits, but an honorary marginal person. The writer is, therefore, islanded in the midst of marginal tides of sorrow, despair, hope, whirlpools of anxiety, cataracts of rage. He is the most articulate member of the marginal class; articulate, that is, with the written word. There are others of his class who speak to the mind's ear with music ?the calypso, reggae, the folk-song?and who speak with immediacy and a sensuous ease to a much vaster audience. The marginal class is a creation of the "system" in the Caribbean. The system sustained itself for centuries, by ensuring that at all times there would be a large reservoir of cheap labor. Expatriate manipulators, while controlling vast acreages of land, brought only a fraction of what they controlled into productive use; they also exercised absolute controls over all other important means of production, distribution and exchange by an economic and cosmetic sleight-of-hand, which makes it appear as if the local surrogates were the real bosses, which they never were, and, under the present system, will never become. The economic base of the marginal class is, therefore, like mud on the Guyana coast. The tides carpet beaches with this mud for a season and then roll it up and move it elsewhere. After centuries in the wilderness the first law of the marginals is that of survival.</page><page sequence="12">122 I. ARTICLES To the middle class, which has only recently left the shiftless and insecure world of marginality, the marginal class appears to be truly menacing, a breeding ground for symbols of terror. The middle class, and particularly the most recent recruits to its ranks, haunted by the spectre of the marginal class, tries almost in a fury to shut itself behind ramparts of Philistinism and iron bars. A regular job, a bicycle and a collar and tie used to be the symbols of emancipation from the marginals, but now the symbols have become more expensive and they are a shirtjack, a car, and the third symbol which is optional, is what Andrew Salkey described as "a waggon wheel Afro."20 When the Black Power gesticulation promised to be safe, social and definitely not socialist, the most unlikely people began to decorate themselves with its exotic accoutrements. But, as soon as it began to crystallize into a class struggle, the middle class abandoned it and hitched their wagon-wheels once more to old tried-and-true neo-colonialist symbols. One of our distinguished literary colleagues made the profound pontifical declaration that it lacked intellectual content. But the Caribbean writer, whether he likes it or not,is an honorary marginal person, and it is from the constantly shifting islands of marginality that he makes his sallies into the world, into the wider indifference of Britain, the United States, Canada, France or wherever the rumor-gram noises it abroad that the pastures are greener. When the colonizer exterminated the indigenous inhabitants in many regions of the Americas, he severed connections with a vast network of secret tributaries that led into the mainstream of the memory of mankind. The total reservoir of memory was seriously impoverished by this loss. The colonizer, reaching into the cultural reserves he believed he had brought with him, discovered that these were soon exhausted, leaving him with psychic voids that could not be filled. The cultural baggage he had dumped in the Middle Passage could not be salvaged. In any event, it was mostly the culturally deprived who immigrated to the Americas, so that from the start they had set out with depleted stocks. Of all the major groups that came to the Americas during the initial three hundred years of the Columbian era, the African alone understood the profound need to create a fusion of his culture with that of his Indian host: The African brought with him, regardless of the mosaic of cultural groups from which he derived, a built-in ethic which bound him first, as a stranger in a strange land, to study and respect the host culture before he established elements of his own. This gave the children of the African diaspora a means of surviving anywhere in the human world and they did not need guns and superior 20.

When the African arrived in the New World, he knew that the colonizer who had brought him there was a usurper who had seized the land of the Indians, desecrated the graves and the altars of their ancestors, and sent countless of the ones who had welcomed him to the Forest of the Long Night. It was clear to the slave from Africa, that in order to escape the terrible retribution that was certain to overtake their masters, they had to make peace with both the living and the dead in this new land. . . The African had to recreate his vision of himself in the universe often being violently uprooted. . . to have seen himself only through his master's eyes and to have even appeared to be an accomplice in his obnoxious deeds, would have left him with a permanent heritage of self-hatred, distorted self images and guilt. In order to reconstruct his ontological system, the African was compelled by the logic of his own cultural past, to establish relations with his Indian host independent of the white man.21 It was fortunate for us all in this hemisphere that the African began once more to make his appearance in the New World from around 1502. It was also a matter of profound cultural significance that the African had come to the Americas in pre Columbian times. But within two decades of his arrival in the Columbian era, there were rebellions in Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Jamaica and Mexico, in which Africans and Indians joined forces against a common enemy. Herrera tells us that the Wolofs of San Juan de Puerto Rico "walked rebelliously through the land,"22 and that no sooner had they set foot in the Indies, than they "began to disaffect the Indians."23 The Wolofs could, thereafter, only move from one island to another with special permission from the Viceroy. The humane and civilized African example of cultural accommodation which runs counter to the bigotry of the white settler mentality, has largely been ignored by both our historians and the colonizers. And yet in dealing with questions of cultural roots, alienation and identity in the Americas, it is an example that cannot be overlooked. At a time when independence, that is, an anthem, a flag and a color on the map, brings into sharper focus questions of national identity and liberation, the Caribbean writer is faced with harsh choices. The end of his marginal status is now in sight. As an honorary member of the marginal class he has both consciously and unconsciously internalized the mounting chaos that is pushing this class inexorably, not into revolution but revolutionary situations. Their ranks have been swelled by unemployed 21. Jan Carew, "The Fusions of African and Amerindian Cultures." Unpublished. 22. L. Weiner, Africa and the Discovery of America (Philadelphia: Innes and Sons, 1920), I: 158. 23. Ibid.</page><page sequence="14">124 I. ARTICLES graduates from high schools and universities, by preachers of cults and fads, by crooks, pushers, choke-and-rob practitioners, political louts and bouncers, by instant prophets and trans-Atlantic Gurus; their dress, their speech, their music, the mumbo-jumbo they invent and discard seasonally are all imaginative forms of protest; they are often unsure of what they are for, but are absolutely certain of what they're against: the corrupt, bullying, pompous, dishonest, cruel, incompetent and often mindless regimes under which they live. Elements from the marginal class have taken to the streets again and again during the past decade. Their most dramatic street scenes, were acted out in Trinidad in 1969. "The revolution has started!" some of the more naive had cried out. But these street demonstrations could best be described by two lines from a Robert Bums poem, for they were "like the Borealis race, that flits e'er you can point its place. . . ." Yet, one should not dismiss the street demonstrations of the marginals lightly. In every instance they attracted elements from the working class and a minority of the intelligentsia. These elements went back to bear the brunt of the repression that followed, to become more politicized and to move the struggle to a higher level. The Caribbean writer, during this period, played the role of the middle man in the Akan Classical theatre to such perfection that scholars researching African survivals would have been delighted. Some went into hiding, others wore the gaudy costumes and transformed the slogans into academic canons. If occasionally their denunciations of white imperial ism sounded too emotional, they ended by declaring that Marx was irrelevant, long live Fanon. Others played a cunning counter-revolutionary role. The honorary marginal is a supreme mimic and in addition to this quality can perform a literary ventriloquism. He can imitate his colonial master so perfectly that the master hears himself speaking through the servant. This servant has a phonal apparatus inside his head that those who behold it marvel at its sensitivity. The colonial intellectual passes through three stages. At the first stage, he is an imitator, devoted to the idea of showing the colonizer that he has learnt all his cultural catechisms well and is ready to be accepted as an honorary white man. He is a creature who lives as though he were constantly under the scrutiny of a disapproving colonizer's eye. He is even careful about the way in which he talks in his sleep. At the second stage, our colonial has grown bold enough to be disgruntled. He has grown cunning enough to understand that Uncle Tomming from the heart is no longer in fashion; he, therefore, assumes postures of protest. The language that he has come to know better than the colonizer himself is used like a stick to beat the man, but the beating is handed out guardedly. The intention is more to make noise than to inflict pain. It is, in essence, a protest inspired by petulance, a signal to the colonizer, a plea for recognition, a cry from the emptiness of the creole soul which says: accept me as an honorary white man and I will commit new and unspeakable treacheries against my own.</page><page sequence="15">CARIBBEAN STUDIES / VOL. 19, NOS. 1 AND 2 125 The third stage is one of unequivocal adherence to the cause of liberation: one that challenges the Caribbean writer to take sides with the sufferers and not their exploiters, local and expatriate; with the have nots, not the have gots; with the scorned, the rejected, not those lapping the fat of the years. Once the writer has made the choice he is on the road to the end of exile, the road to hope, the Freedom road, the road to the new day where with morning bursting like pale lightnings from our eyes together side by side we'll burst asunder pale ramparts of Heaven with bare hands and bare feet to pluck wild orchids of ultimate release.24 The Caribbean writer is a person from the sun. "Sun's in my blood today" Seymour writes in his very fine poem,25 unconsciously entering into regions of African myth which tells of how Nyankopon, the Sky-God, shoots a particle of the sun's fire into the bloodstream of the child, thus bringing the blood to life. In the Caribbean world-view, the sun is a dialectical entity: it is creative and destructive, it gives life and takes it away. Anancy, the West African folk archetype in whose name all fables were told, is shaped like a gadwal, a sun-wheel, a mathematically perfect calendar. Anancy was also the victim of an encounter with the Wax Girl. The story goes that Anancy lost his perfect shape after his encounter. Among the Hausas, the rainbow was called the spider's bow. This shows how close Anancy was to the divinities from heaven. And his bow which had the shape of a snake was called the god of rains and storms. In the Caribbean, Anancy lost his contacts with divinities and is known exclusively as a trickster. The European, settling in the tropical world in the Columbian era brought Medieval fantasies with him, of the equatorial region being a land of fire, and when this turned out to be untrue, he invented the myth that only dark-skinned people could do strenuous manual labor in the sun. White workers in Cuba, and those thousands of miles away in tropical Australia, and white peasants in the Caribbean have proved this to be the fiction that it is, but the myth persists; and the myth is now embraced not only by its originators but also by its victims. The Creoles will still declare unblushingly that their constitutions are too delicate for them to attempt 24. Jan Carew, "Poem," 1956. 25.

ARTICLES strenuous manual labor in the sun; that only blacks or coolies are fit for that kind of thing. Exile from the sun, therefore, begins in the Creole mind. It is the result of a plot hatched by parents who are mesmerized by colonial fantasies of class and color escape. These parents begin telling children as soon as the amniotic fluid is washed from their eyes, that the only hope for them is to go abroad, away from the sun. The sun must, in this sick creole imagination, always be kept at a distance. The sun darkens the complexion and threatens to hurl the Creole back into the ranks of the blacks and coolies which he had only recently abandoned. The title of Sam Selvon's novel A Brighter Sun26 suggests an unconscious desire to move closer to his peasant origins, not to the distant lands of pale sunlight, but to the regions where it is brightest. Going away from the tropics, one loses one's place in the sun. What follows is a psychic unbalance from which one seldom recovers. But creating distances between oneself and the tropical sun was not only a question of removing one's physical presence from an equatorial to a temperate region; the colonized could also do it as part of a conditioned/psychological reflex. The colonial person rooted in the parasitical economic relationships and the schizoid cultural ones he had had with the mother country, could in his imagination be at home and overseas, in the furnace heat of his brighter sun and in pale winter sunshine at the same time. The arch-colonial still locks himself up in warm, heavy clothing in the equatorial sun and will swear that he feels no discomfort; on certain ceremonial occasions, the neo-colonial ladies and gentlemen even wear gloves. But the Creole, from the beginning of his emergence as a middle man in the Columbian era?the word creole originally meant "bred in the house" so that the creole stood between the field slave and the master?has been forever trying to sever his connections with the dark hinter lands under the sun. His journeys have been outward bound ones, towards the "superior" culture of the colonizer and away from the "inferior" one of the colonized. The very communication networks that vein neo-colonial territories are like tracings from the creole mind and the psyche of the colonized?all roads lead outward towards overseas cultural and spiritual meccas. The situation, though, remains a dialectical one at its core. There have always been important, living cultural and spiritual bases outside the ethos of the Creole's facile borrowings and spurious imitations. Both urban and rural groups, who were rejected by the colonizer and the creole alike, incorporated rich and enduring cultural survivals into the fabric of their daily life, transforming them and keeping them alive at the same time. The Caribbean writer and artist, if he must end his exile, is compelled by the exigencies of history to move back and forth from the heart of those cultural survivals and others into whatever regions of the twentieth century the island, the continent or the cosmos his imagination encompasses; and, in roaming across the ages of man in this 26.

An Acewayo droger once told me of the journeys he took in and out of the regions of his mind. The band across his forehead, and the harness strapped under his armpits distributed the hundred and twenty-five pounds he carried in his wareshi so that by thrusting his head forward he could walk at a steady, rhythmic, shuffle from day-clear to sunset. We were averaging twenty-five miles a day in the mountainous Potaro district. "How do you manage?" I asked, thinking of the thirty pounds I was carrying and the way it seemed to double itself after every ten miles. After a long pause he replied: It's like this, skipper, most of the time you see me walking here, carrying this big load, I'm not here at all. .. is only a shadow here, the substance is back home in Aquero, hunting agouti or deer or labba, playing with my children, catching a gaff, listening to the Old Ones speak, talking to the Ancestors or to God. You can ask me then how come I can be two places at the same time, I will tell you the secret: the pressure of this wareshi on my brain makes it easy for me to send my mind away. . . At the start I feel like a drunken man, there's a singing inside my head, my body feels heavy and the wareshi feels like a mountain on my back. Then all of a sudden everything gets lighter and lighter until I feel like a silk-cotton blossom floating on wind. Once I reach this stage, I can walk from here to the Forest of the Long Night without feeling any weariness. The Acewayo droger had remained for most of his life outside the awful grinding inevitability of linear time that the Columbian era had imposed upon his people. The Amerindian induction into the remorseless cycles of time of the European calendar had been trumatic. In 1493, Columbus ordered that every able-bodied Amerindian in Marien, one of the five Kingdoms of Hispaniola, should, within a specified time, pay the Spanish Crown a tribute of a hawk's bill full of gold. Those who failed were enslaved, mutilated or put to death. This was also the Amerindian's introduction to a cruel system in which forced labor of the colonized would produce wealth for the colonizer. Labor and the colonizer's timeclock became the totems heralding a new age for the Amerindian and the African. For both of these peoples, time had been something one felt like a pulse or a heartbeat. Time for them was finite. In their cosmologies, past time went back as far as the genesis of their races; it was a link between the living and their ancestors; present time merely spanned the seasons of each day, while future time covered the shortest span of all, it was restricted to the inevitable future and little else. This was how it had always been with the black and</page><page sequence="18">128 I. ARTICLES brown Men of Corn?one could live in the midst of infinities of stasis, of no time? and when one chose, one could then generate new time. In order to turn the Men of Corn into Natives of Capitalism the colonizer committed unspeakable atrocities of ethnocide and the enslavement of millions. He then attempted to remove all traces of his crime. He did it with the same cunning the authorities had used after the massacre of workers in the public square in Garcia Marquez's novel A Hundred Years of Solitude.27 In the ghoulish silence and the emptiness that came in the wake of the massacre, even the stones could not speak after they were washed clean of the blood stains. Having shattered forever the Afro-Amerindian concepts of time, the colonizer created a new time which he chained inexorably to his own future expectations, and time became money. In order to illuminate the dialectic of pre-Columbian time and time in the Columbian era a few Caribbean writers had to unlock secrets of lost centuries. They used rivers as the symbol of their journeys into the past. In my Black Midas, Aron Smart had said about his grandparents that "they felt time like a river in their blood."28 An early Wilson Harris poem had described the journey of one of his mythical characters: Down Rivers of his Night Where he must drown to banish fear.29 This orphic journey was re-enacted later in the search for the Palace of the Peacock.30 In Alejo Carpentier's The Lost Steps,31 the hero travels into primordial hinterlands up one of the great rivers of South America, traversing millenniums in his orphic journey. Carpentier went far afield from his island home to find a setting for his hero's wanderings. He needed a continent. Edouard Glissant chose a river in Martinique as the symbol of his search for roots 3 2 and a genuine identity in his novel La Lezarde. What was interesting about the droger's psychological escape route is that it led inwards. It never occurred to him to move beyond the frontiers of home and the forest. Glissant's river la lezarde however, takes us inland to its source and from the 27. Gabriel Garcia Marquez, A Hundred Years of Solitude (London: Jonathan Cape, 1970). 28.

For on an island your cosmos of the imagination begins with the sea. In the search for an identity?one of the major themes in Caribbean writing?the impulse is either to move inward towards some undiscovered heartland as in Carpentier's The Lost Steps, Glissant's La Lezarde, Reid's Newday,33 Asturias's Hombres de maiz,34 Harris's Palace of the Peacock, and my own Black Midas; or outward towards the meccas of the colonizer as in Lamming's The Emigrants and Natives of my Person, and Clarke's Survivors of the Crossing and The Meeting Point 35 These novels are works I have chosen from what has now become an impressive array. They are, therefore, by no means the only ones that illustrate the dichotomy of the in ward and the outward vision in Caribbean writing. Salkey's Come Home Malcolm Heartland is a novel about a Caribbean exile preparing to return home. Having explored the outward vision to its utmost limits, the hero is escaping the wide indifference of decades abroad to return to a spiritual Sleepy Hollow. The hero of Carpentier's The Lost Steps is a Euro-American musicologist and composer. In his search for an identity he first goes to Europe but does not find the illusory Europe that his father had brought him up to revere. His disillusionment is complete when he realizes that a psychic uprootment had taken place when his ancestors abandoned the Old Country. But in America as a white settler, he also had to seek out and find the inner sanctuaries of a spiritual heartland that racist fantasies, a strident and spurious nationalism, and a spate of colonizer's myths had unconsciously prevented him from exploring. But he was also an artist surrounded by dilettantes and colonial cultists of art with a capital "A." After a chance encounter with the curator of a museum, he sets out from New York on an expedition to find the first musical instruments that man created in the Americas. He is delayed for a while in a South American city where, from the relative safety of a tourist hotel, he watched a palace revolt flare up only to be extinguished. His journey continues over mountains as close to heaven as a man can hope to be without leaving the earth. A steep descent brings him to tropical lowlands, the main setting of his search for an American and a human identity. In a few weeks the journeys to the upper reaches of the great river and, in the milleniums he traverses during this small span of time, his journey becomes one of self-discovery-the discovery of a new American self which was hidden in primordial rainforest fastnesses; the roots of the Amerindian psyche and the Amerindian person; 33.

ARTICLES the inner spiritual sanctum of the Men of Corn; the point from which they began their migrations outwards. In this remote world where linear time as he knew it had become meaningless, the hero is, he believes at first, reborn. But this was a romantic illusion. He goes back to the world of the twentieth century, his spirit refurbished, the scales scraped away from his eyes; when he tries to return to the Eden he thought he had rediscovered, the steps are lost. Yet, he had gathered unto himself an immense creative power in that trespass into pre-history and back. He returned to the sisyphian tasks of the artist, chastened and reformed, knowing that he had to cross not only past centuries but to venture into future ones. In Glissant's La Lezarde the search for an identity follows the course of a river to its source, and the spring from which it rises is enclosed by an old colonial stone house. The river takes us into the heartland of a country. Glissant introduces us to a journey of discovery with a poem: "What is this country?" he asked And the answer was: "First weigh every word, make the acquaintance of every sorrow."36 The author's lezarde is really a river of life which runs through both a physical and spiritual landscape. As the river makes its way to the sea, one can feel the people stirring, the land awakening and the people, the land, the river, the sky coming together in a miraculous unity. And during the long season of a people's consciousness ripening, the author poses a question that goes to the heart of the dream to end the feeling of homelessness at home. "Can we," he asks, "give a name to any parcel of earth before the man and woman who inhabit it have arisen?"37 La Lezarde illuminates the psychological landscape it traverses like flashes of lightning. Its symbols are revealed to us like the vast array of different species of flora and fauna secreted away in a rain forest. The river brings clarity to the apparent chaos; it is linked to geological time; it existed before man did; it flows into an expectation of countless seasons. It is like Alegrfa's The Golden Serpent,2* a Peruvian river that threads its way through the life of a people and one that becomes a timeless symbol of a people's fight for freedom. The river is a perfect symbol of man's seminal connection with life and being. The interior landscapes of Harris's novels are veined with dreaming rivers of life, death and seasons of eternity.

It is the story of how these twins were born and how their two greatest feats were to bring fire to man, and to tame the rivers by placing gigantic rocks and boulders across them. An Amerindian poem sings about The white sun raping dark rivers the white sun biting like a Vaquero's ship the white sun singing, singing singing the songs of the dead the white sun a burning requiem but the cool night must come.39 In this song-poem the seminal anthropomorphic symbols-the sun, the dark inte rior river, the songs of the dead, the night are united. The river rises in hinterlands of silence and flows to the clamorous sea and on the way its tributaries reach into the flesh of the land like so many capillaries. The river can be the symbol of the exile journeying outwards or the exile coming home. "Al men return to the hills finally," the Roger Mais poem had declared.40 His hills, both real and symbolical, were an oasis where the writer and artist went to gather strength, to heal the wounds inflicted by the philistines at home and racists abroad. From the hills one moves outward, towards the sea. Both the consciousness of the sea and the absence of this consciousness are an interesting psychological phenomenon in the Caribbean. The dream that emerges in Caribbean writing is one of crossing the sea or of contemplating its moods, never of conquering it. The Caribs and the Europeans were conquerors of the sea, creators of sagas; their imaginations were forever encompassing new horizons of turbulent water. But for the new Caribbean man the sea was a capricious and often dangerous moat between stepping stones of islands and continents. The sea, which Lamming describes in great detail in Natives of my Person, is perceived as though from a great distance; it is something not only separating continents and islands, but suspended between them. It is a weightless, static sea, like the one described in the Mayan genesis myth, the Popol Vuh rather than a heaving, turbulent reality. In an earlier novel, Lamming's emigrants cross the Atlantic and are barely aware of this ocean's existence. But in their conversations it is clear that they're carrying 39.

ARTICLES enduring memories of the smell of their earth and the dreams of their people with them. The journey by sea is an interlude between home and the Caribbean communities islanded abroad. Clarke's "survivors of the crossing" also erase the reality of the ocean they crossed from their minds. In The Meeting Point, the emigrants have moved to air travel and are more at ease. Perhaps we all carry deep in our unconscious minds the traumatic memory of the ancestral crossing in the Columbian and slave era. In Salkey's Come Home Malcolm Heartland, the Caribbean Janus astride two worlds is about to abandon one of the two and return home regardless of the philistines, the areas of mindlessness that he must invade and conquer, the malice waiting to ambush him and the deep awareness that a part of him had died during the decades abroad in the emptiness, the racial scorn, the endless encounters with real and imagined acts of discrimination he had had to endure. Malcolm Heartland also knows that the home to which he is returning is innocent of many social and political resonances for which he had developed an inner ear. Heartland dies both a real and symbolical death before he takes the plunge. But there are Heartlands at home who survived both crossings, the one to the meccas of the colonizer and the other home to the secret heartlands where the waters of the River of Life began their flow. Perhaps the finest evocation of this return home to slowly awakening Sleepy Hollows perched on top of a people's volcanic discontents can be found in Mervyn Morris's poetry. This poetry is uncompromisingly honest, sensitive, and it penetrates the heart of the discontents that centuries of exile and cultural alineation gave birth to. "All people have a right to share the waters of the River of Life and to drink with their own cups, but our cups have been broken," laments the Carib poem-hymn. The writer, artist, musician, is directly involved in the creative process of reshaping the broken cups. But as an Asian writer had said from a Republic perched on the Roof of the World in the Soviet Far East, "Art and Literature are like lightning, and lightning can never be timid." Therefore, while we shape exquisite new cups we must, side by side with the disinherited millions of the Third World, confront those who would deny us our fair share of the Waters of the River of Life, for it was at the source of those waters that the exile of the Caribbean writer began and it is there that his exile will end.</page></plain_text>
