Kim Paffenroth University of Notre Dame In his article "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses,"' David L. Paulsen attempted to show that Christians as late as the fourth century "commonly (and perhaps gen- erally) believed God to be corporeal."2 In his brief discussion of the ma- terial from Augustine, I believe that Paulsen is mistaken about Augustine's development and especially about what exactly the Manichaean alternative to Christianity offered to Augustine. This brief note seeks to correct these errors.3 Especially problematic is Paulsen's depiction of the Manichaean alterna- tive: "At first, unable to accept Christianity because of (what he took to be) its doctrine of a corporeal deity, Augustine was much attracted to the Manichaean sect."4 This statement seems to imply that the alternative be- 1David L.

Of course, the Manichaean concept of God was highly material/corporeal, as a fuller quotation from the Confes- sions shows: I postulated two masses opposed to one another, each of them infinite, but the evil one on a narrower scale, the good one larger. ... I thought myself to be more truly religious if I believed you to be infinite in other parts, even though I was forced to admit that you are finite in that part where the evil mass stands in opposition to you.... Our Savior himself, your Only-begotten, I so thought of as being something extruded out of the mass of your pellucid substance for our salvation.5 The Manichaeans, with their abhorrence of flesh and the Incarnation, offered Augustine a corporeal, and indeed a limited God, but at least a nonanthropomorphic one. It should be noted further that an incorporeal God could be just as distastefully anthropomorphic as a corporeal one: an incorporeal God who changed his or her mind and had human emotions would be much more problematic to both the Manichaeans and Augustine than a God who was composed of fine, luminous matter, but maintained an appropriately divine impassivity. The anthropomorphism of God, especially in the Incarnation, was problematic for Augustine and the Manichaeans, as is evident in their mocking question, "Does he [God] have hair and nails?"6 Further proof is found in Augustine's inability at this point to believe in the Incarnation: "So I feared to believe that he was born in the flesh, lest I be forced to believe him defiled by the flesh."7 Thus, ironically, Paulsen is correct that Augustine believed in a corporeal deity, but he did so most fully and explicitly under Manichaean and not Christian influence. Furthermore, Paulsen seems to accept too readily Manichaean polemic and Augustine's own philosophical doubts as an accurate and literal de- scription of Christian belief at the time. Nowhere does Augustine say that any Christian taught that God is corporeal. Rather, Augustine presents him- self as incapable of conceiving of a purely incorporeal being: "I wished to meditate upon my God, but I did not know how to think of him except as a vast corporeal mass, for I thought that anything not a body was nothing whatsoever."8 Augustine could not conceive of a purely incorporeal reality, 5Augustine Confessions (trans.

Ryan; Garden City: Doubleday, 1960) 5.20 (pp. 127-28); my emphasis. 6Ibid., 3.12 (p. 85). 7Ibid., 5.20 (p. 128). 8Ibid., 5.19 (p. 127).</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND OBSERVATIONS 235 a philosophical problem shared by many, and therefore found himself think- ing of God as corporeal, not because he had been taught this by Christian- ity, but because it was the only position he could personally accept.9 It does not appear that anything in Augustine's writings would allow us to speculate that Christianity in the fourth century taught that God is cor- poreal. Rather, Augustine was unable at this point to conceive of a com- pletely incorporeal, spiritual being and therefore found the corporeal but nonanthropomorphic God of the Manichaeans quite attractive. Reply to Kim Paffenroth's Comment David L. Paulsen Brigham Young University Kim Paffenroth's comment on my article "Early Christian Belief in a Cor- poreal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses" provides oc- casion to reinforce some points made in the article and to clarify some apparent misunderstandings.1 First, my claim about fourth-century Christians is more modest than Paffenroth has made out. For instance, he writes, "Paulsen attempted to show that Christians as late as the fourth century 'commonly (and perhaps generally) believed God to be corporeal"' (my emphasis). This is a misquo- tation. The larger passage from which he quotes actually reads as follows: "In this article I show that ordinary Christians for at least the first three centuries of the current era commonly (and perhaps generally) believed God to be corporeal" (my emphasis).2 Of fourth-century Christians, I make a much more limited claim, namely, "In his Confessions, St. Augustine 9See Gerard Watson, Saint Augustine. Soliloquies and Immortality of the Soul (Warminster: Aris &amp; Phillips, 1990) 12: "He [Augustine] had been told as a child that God was a spirit and therefore did not act as we with our bodies act.... Was there any reality other than body of some sort? It seemed the more honest course to go along with the Manichaean view that God is in some sense a body composed of fine and luminous matter.... It seemed to him more honest to think that 'anything not a body is nothing whatsoever.' This was the position which the Stoics and Epicureans had felt themselves forced to take against the 'spiritualism' of Plato and Aristotle six hundred years before." Notes to the reply: lTwo colleagues at Brigham Young University, Professor James Siebach and Dennis Potter, have contributed significantly to the preparation of this reply. 2David L.
