<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ned Ludd's Mummers Play Norman Simms T HE rebellion of machine-breakers in the north of England between 1811 and 1816, but particularly in the first two or three years, may be examined from the point of view of folklore because of its dependence upon a mythical character as ideological centre for the uprising, the use of masks, disguises, special calls, and other activities characteristic of pre- political, essentially rural communal groups. We must begin by reminding ourselves both of the juridic and the violent nature of many folkloristic activities. To trivialize folk rites into superstitious customs and beliefs with no function in the community outside of nostalgia and entertainment is to distort the reality of archaic mentalities, those modes of thought which persist in conditions of actual or socially enforced isolation, economic primitivism, and non-literary culture. The function of many rituals unconnected with 'religious' belief is to affirm, preserve, or assert juridic rights within the traditional community. These juridic rights are those of the clan or family, the professional group, or the neighbourhood, sometimes glossed with the paraphernalia of religious sanction. Particularly in times when the nominal prestige of power-the juridic right to violence- belongs to alien or external individuals, such as feudal landlords, ecclesiasti- cal functionaries, and representatives of the bourgeois middle class (in late eighteenth-century England these came to be the squire, the parson, and the magistrate, school-teacher or tax-collector'), at those times the tradi- tional agents of the village community's archaic power-its juridic right to violence-proclaim their authority through words, acts, and symbols which are secret. Such agents may be certain families traditionally associated with rights, such as those of access to common lands, streams, pathways, craft fraternities, which have responsibility for the welfare of their members, their families, their craft mysteries; or even types of individuals, whose personali- ties make them suited to represent the communal sense of justice by their strength of character, perceptiveness, bravery, and so on. Such agents act in secret in two ways: first, because they have no official status within the imposed system of power, and second, because the members of the whole group protect the agents from detection by the threatening or hostile system. A third sense of secrecy sometimes obtains, and that is when the actual mani- festations of the juridic acts are known only to initiates and even the majority of the community finds or pretends to find the eruption of archaic justice a mysterious, impersonal event. Humiliation by mocking chant or jostling on the street during folk-plays are common, minor forms of folk violence. Sexual molestation, breaking of farm equipment, burning down buildings are rarer but not unusual forms,</page><page sequence="2">NED LUDD'S MUMMERS PLAY 167 indicating the range of retribution from personal to group punishment, against both persons and property. Whether or not they are recognized by the victims, the avenging agents-the representatives of folk power-wear disguises, since the acts, even if accepted by the victims as just, are contrary to the laws of the alien system, the alternative power. The need for disguise, of the person as well as of the activity, becomes stronger when the victims do not accept the justice of the retribution, and especially when they are part of the dominant power system imposed on the small community. In one sense the agents of communal power are seen as strangers in the village. Violet Alford, for example, reports that in the Basque country certain ceremonies are performed by 'rather rough' families, even persons of an in- ferior 'race'; and from the outside, that is, from the point of view of a com- munity only tolerating but not participating in the rites, they are childish, drunken, or ignorant brawls and riots.2 The disguised folk are frightening to their neighbours, and the following account of guise-dancers in St Ives, Cornwall, by the antiquary Hunt illustrates a typical response: for the most part (costumes) consist of old clothes, arranged in the oddest manner, even frightfully ugly. It is dangerous for children, and aged or infirm persons, to venture out after dark, as the roughs generally are armed with a sweeping-brush or shillalagh. The uproar at times is so tremendous as to be only equalled in a 'rale Irish row'.3 If such behaviour merely asserts some archaic right by the participants to howl roguishly down the lanes, striking not only terror into passers-by, so defying 'respectable' authority, if not perhaps proclaiming some 'survival' of more primitive magical violence, the use of disguise and violence can be seen more in line with the community's own sense of what is proper at other times. G. M. Story recounts how the jannies (mummers) of Newfoundland a hundred years ago were involved in local feuds and in the anti-government riots which took place in the port cities at the beginning of that century.4 Whatever the respectable people may have thought, the small communities of recent immigrants felt that their rights could best be asserted and pro- tected through traditional disguising violence. I would like to suggest that during the Luddite uprisings, the followers of Ned Ludd, the army of redressers, disguised themselves as strangers partly to avoid detection by the magistrates and partly to appear as the im- personal forces of archaic justice, and that they sought to rid their com- munity of polluting objects (not all, but particular, carefully chosen machines) and to punish through violence to property individuals who refused to recognize the juridical integrity of the craft-villages-the obliga- tion to care for the welfare of the workmen, their families, and the lines of respect and prestige which were based on the skilled trades. Despite the religious influence of Methodist theology and the radical preachings of Tom Paine's Rights ofMan, the essential character of the rebellion was ritualistic, a ceremonial purgation, an assertion of archaic justice in the person and myth of Ned Ludd.</page><page sequence="3">168 NORMAN SIMMS It was, rather, an affair of the small northern communities based on skilled labour, a late stage, as E. P. Thompson explains, in the medieval struggle in which artisan and journeyman pitted their pride and prestige against the profit-oriented, unskilled factory work of the new economic order.5 For the Luddites were not opposed to machinery per se. Indeed, the economic well-being of the region-Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and Nottinghamshire- depended upon machinery. Since the end of the fourteenth century, there had been a gradual diffusion of town manufacturing of cloth into the rural areas, with small villages like Halifax coming to surpass Ripon and York by the end of the eighteenth century; and from being a supplement to the income of subsistence pastoral farming, the making of cloth came to be the prime industry of many rural communities.6 The only part of this industry which could not traditionally be carried out in the domestic context was the finishing or fulling process because, from the thirteenth century onwards, the operation required watermills for the wooden stocks. Since the Luddites generally were men in this factory work, completely dependent upon machinery, it is erroneous to see their motivation as anti-machinery. Rather, towards the end of the eighteenth century, but particularly in the economic crises of the Napoleonic wars, the south English system of mill- ownership by private individuals and the introduction of improvements to the operation which permitted unskilled labourers-women, children, or apprentices ('colts')-to take over the fulling threatened both the indepen- dence of the leading craftsmen and the integrity of the communities based on their traditional prestige.7 In the north of England, where the mills were run by great estate-owners as a type of public service, the dependence of the domestic weavers and their wives upon the fullers were contained within the juridic pattern of the small community; but with the introduction of southern methods, by such capitalists as Cartwright and Horsfall, the whole archaic way of life was undermined.8 As E. Lipson put it, A striking feature of industrial conditions in Yorkshire was the good feelings exist- ing between domestic manufacturers and their workmen. In a trade depression the former rarely dismissed their hands.9 Unfortunately during the troubled times of the Orders In Council, the new capitalist manufacturers began to lay off domestic workers, and by the intro- duction of the new frames, the croppers as well.'o In addition to the network of communications between the various textile- manufacturing communities known to have existed in the person of circu- mambulating labourers, peddlars, and Methodist clergy, and in addition to special communications established by Painites and other radicals during the 1790s, there were also a series of informal connections between craft societies, some of them no doubt tracing their origins in medieval mysteries and confraternities. '' The advent of popular newspapers, the correspond- ing societies, and the itinerant agitators no doubt assured that there was some minimal co-ordination-the very fact that they were recognized as powerful-depended on older means of communication. I refer to the central questions surrounding Ned Ludd, his disguised followers, their</page><page sequence="4">NED LUDD'S MUMMERS PLAY 169 noisy attacks on the wide-frames, and a few other more probable aspects of the popular uprising. The Luddite bands, once the uprising passed its initial stage of 'rioting', were almost completely made up of young men, who travelled in sides of about a dozen or less; though they were not all 'cropping lads', they do not seem to have included any women, and only rarely an older man.1'2 Popular uprisings, like that of the Luddites, tend to focus on a named character, historical or fictional, who acts the mythic role of leader.'3 Some- times the name is historical, belonging either to one specific individual or, repeated later, by several rebel chiefs to validate their cause and establish historical continuity; sometimes the name is a descriptive title given to a known person, so that his role may be more clearly defined to the rebels and their enemies; and sometimes the name is a generic one which, though it may be (pseudo-)historical or descriptive, belongs not to any one leader, but to whomever, at a given moment, takes the leadership role for a specific action. For example, in so far as the Scottish uprisings of the eighteenth cen- tury were popular and pre-political, the historical name of the Stuart king was used in the first way, the particulars of each pretender to the crown being of less import than the assumed mythical re-appearance of the lost original.* The Romanian leader of the 1821 rebellion, to make an east Euro- pean analogy, who assumed the title Horia was so called because he took into himself the ritualistic power of the hora, a communal dance-song, which stood for the dance of national unity and brotherhood. Later, in 1848, another Romanian rebel captain, Avram Iancu, did not change his name spe- cifically, but dressed and acted out the part of a typical haiduc, Robin Hood- type outlaw. These last two characters illustrate the second category we dis- cussed above. The third category is the one to which Ned Ludd belongs, and it seems to be fairly typical of the English mode, not only in the nineteenth century, when we also have Rebecca's Daughters and Captain Swing, but earlier in the figurative-centre's Robin Hood and Jack Straw.I4 These two types clearly have roots in the archaic village rituals of England and their appearance in late medieval popular uprisings as rebel figures illustrates the pre-political basis of such mass movements. While Rebecca shows a revival- ist Christian influence and Captain Swing a generic title expanded to mythic proportions, the figure of Ned (Edward) Ludd seems difficult to trace.'I The historical basis for a captain, lieutenant, or king Ludd are, of course, non-existent. The stories of an imbecile, child, or enraged cropper of a generation previous to the rebellion who became notorious for his machine- breaking can also be discounted as a wishful euphemism; even the OED remarks that this type explanation 'lacks confirmation'. Etymologies hint at some probable alternative derivations, but most lack persuasiveness in terms of the popular acceptance and use of the Ludd myth. Seeing Ludd * 'Yemelyan Pugachev, a fugitive cossack from the Don, proclaimed himself to be "Tsar Peter III", the murdered husband of the reigning Empress Catherine II ["The Great"].' (Philip Longworth, 'The Pugachev Revolt-The Last Great Cossack-Peasant Rising' in Rural Protest-Peasant Movements and Social Change, ed. Henry A. Landsberger, London, Macmillan, 1974, pp. 195-6, and 217-18 on 'the legitimist factor' in rural uprisings.)</page><page sequence="5">170 NORMAN SIMMS as a minced form of Lord, we could take the title as a generalized description for any leader, with often ironic echoes of legal situations in the background, certainly tempting given the juridic function of the acts carried out in Ludd's name. The Latin ludus for game or play, with the rare form ludent for player, suggests another generalized generic title, this time from the essential ritual nature of the actions, so that Luddites were merely 'players' who follow a back-formed Ludd as their leader. Closer perhaps to the coarse humour of the country rebels might be a derivation from the Norse noun ludden, 'thick', which yields luds, 'buttocks', a formation which recalls the ironies ofJack Straw, where the rebels parade themselves as the bumpkin layabouts their opponents chide them with being. The rural expression, 'sent all of a lud', meaning 'stuck all of a heap', adds to this possibility of seeing the mob of rebels laughingly styling themselves a pack of asses in defiance of civil authority, and by that laughter asserting their own alternative juridic power and indentity. Frank Peel's account of the young frame-breaker called him Ludlam, and this variant on the name of the ritual-leader offers a con- nection with the Lincolnshire proverb (also attested in Yorkshire): to be as lazy as Ludlam's dog, who had to lean his head against the wall when he wanted to bark; here the same self-pejorative view, which actually enhances the initiates at the expense of the aliens supposed to take the joke seriously, would be at work. Another possibility of this sort, though not local enough for real probability, might lie in the slang term for London's debtors' prison Ludgate as 'Lud's Bulwark'.'6 What is important, since there is no way of actually settling the question of derivation, is to see that all the possi- bilities are possible for very much the same reasons, and that even if a real Edward Ludd were to emerge from some lost document, the important fac- tor is the mentality of the people, their receptivity to a name which could be identified with the rebellion and could be played on in so many settings- songs, letters, threatening bangings on the door in the middle of the night, petitions to Parliament, and strawmen paraded through the streets. For real or not in the historical sense, Ned Ludd was the mythical centre of the revolt, and in each area of discontent the leading individual would act in the name or in the disguise of Captain Ludd. He could have clerks, lawyers, friends, wives, sons, and enemies, and yet what the Luddites did was 'to lud', to do something more than merely break machines or run amok through the streets and lanes of north England. They were performing some form of juridic folk play, the mumming of Ned Ludd. These mummers wore disguises but, as so often in studies more concerned with causes and effects than in processes, the exact nature of these disguises is hard to come by. One of the fullest descriptions appears in Spen Valley: Past and Present. It occurs in the account of the Luddite attack on Cart- wright's mill at Rawfolds, one of the locus cassici of this sort of literature; the attack took place on 11 April 1812. There was a combined effort by many Luddite sides, including one from Leeds which arrived after the attack began, and Peel describes the military order of the rebels, a formation of gun-carriers, axe-handlers, hammer-toters, and so forth. Unfortunately,</page><page sequence="6">NED LUDD'S MUMMERS PLAY 171 Peel does not speak of any co-ordination between disguise and implement carried. They were nearly all disguised, some having their faces simply blackened and others wearing masks to conceal their features effectually. Many of them were dressed in carter's smock frocks, others had their coats turned inside out, some had their checked shirts over their clothes, and a few had actually dressed them- selves partly in women's apparel.'" The range of disguise is impressive, from simply black-face to more elab- orate costumes, but Peel is not clear enough for us to really understand the functions of these disguises, the extent to which they were to hide identity, assert new identity, and fit together into an ensemble play. One is struck by the similarity of these disguises given by Peel and those recounted as worn by the janneys of Newfoundland.'s Although Peel does not say so, we may assume that disguise of features was accompanied by distortions of voice, posture, and gesture. As in Newfoundland mumming, we may take the function of disguise to be concerned with transforming local people into 'strangers', that is, those who speak and act outside of the bounds of normal behaviour. From other sources than Peel we can put together a fuller description of the Luddite disguisings, and so attempt a tentative interpretation. An attack in Loughborough on John Heathcoat's frames was carried out by 'dissi- dents, with blackened faces and wearing high cravats ...'19 At Stockport in April 1812, 'two men dressed as women (curiously they called themselves "General Ludd's wives")' led the rebels.20 In a report by a Golcar cloth- dresser, William Hinchcliffe, in February 1812, the fifty Luddites had their faces disguised with black and white markings.2' The Yorkshire dialect- novel, Ben o' Bill's, The Luddite, recounts how the title character initially heard of the rebels in February 1812, when: we had the first news of any violence in our neighbourhood. Late of a Saturday night a number of men with faces blacked and their dress disguised, some wearing women's gowns and others strange head-gear, broke into the dressing-shop of Mr Joseph Hirst, of Marsh ...22 Later, Ben o' Bill's describes the disguises used at the famous attack on Cartwright's mill at Rawfolds: Some were dressed in smocks, and all had their faces part concealed, either by a mask or by a 'kerchief drawn across the lower face. One gaunt being strode on before us dressed in women's skirts; but a pair of men's trousers, that showed at every step, and a manly stride were in ill-keeping with the skirt.23 With these brief snatches of detail, we can generalize from Peel's description into the following categories: I. Simple concealment of face: a. face blacked b. cravat or kerchief drawn over lower face c. mask over eyes and upper face</page><page sequence="7">172 NORMAN SIMMS II. Complex concealment of face a. face marked with black and white streaks b. 'strange' head-gear c. indeterminate use of masks III. Simple disguise of body a. carters' smocks b. coats worn inside-out c. inner garments worn outside IV Complex disguise of body a. women's clothing (sex-change) b. masquerade as Ned Ludd c. other unknown types We have already pointed out that the function of the disguising was not simply that of avoiding detection by the agents of state power, although that must always be taken as an important consideration. Many of the dis- guises go beyond the needs for masking identity; categories I and III could be taken as disguise to hide, while categories II and IV could be considered as disguises to assert new identities. A contemporary cartoon, often reprinted,24 shows a man with blackened face, wearing a woman's bonnet and dress, and carrying a long stick; in the background there is a vague picture of a machine-breaking raid in progress. If this picture is not merely a satirical gibe at the Luddite's 'effeminate' fear of detection, but an insightful perception into the archaic centre of the mentality of the rebellion, we may find that the female Luddite is the culmi- nating disguise in the mumming play. At this centre, the skilled craftsmen asserting their masculine identity as independent bread-winners and agents of the virile force of the community's power paradoxically appear as women, not only to show that they are made women by the introduction of the new frames (their skilled jobs can now be performed by untrained women, they are now out of work and depend on the womenfolk to earn their bread) but also to identify themselves, the strongest members of the community-the handsome young cropping lads-with the women most affected by the breakdown of the village economy (the women, also, who were so much in evidence in the bread riots associated with the Luddite outbreak). 'One of the simplest but most universal sources of power in the supernatural sense,' writes Anthony Forge, 'seems to be the combination of male and female symbols.'25 Hence at the most archaic level of the mentality of the rebellion lies a magical symbol of the community's power and its powerlessness com- bined: by reversing their sex, the Luddites make themselves most strange to their community; but at the same time, coming back into the community to attack its most polluting evil, the wide-frames, they restore something potent to the juridic centre of life, pride. It is not possible to speculate on the meanings or implications of the other complex disguises. The white and black marks on the face seem magical enough, but we need to know more about the 'strange' head-gear and whether the full-face masks were representational or not, anthropomorphic,</page><page sequence="8">NED LUDD'S MUMMERS PLAY 173 zoomorphic, or what. The last unclear type of full disguise, that of Ned Ludd himself, must wait until later for discussion, if the straw-filled dummy called Ned Ludd is to be taken as distinct from the men dressed as women who occasionally called themselves Ned Ludd's wives. Although there is yet no evidence of disguised voices in the ritual aspect of Luddite activities, there is a vague indication of a ceremonial call or yell used at crucial moments before machine-breaking. That the yell was pri- marily an expression of defiance and energy is undoubted; that it was not random and merely a noise made by rabble must be argued as much by analogy as by analysis of the meagre evidence. In 1381 the English rebels in the north had a yell they called hountays and which is once recorded as being 'A revel! A revel!'2 6 The Basques have a mysterious cry called irritzina recorded by Violet Alford, and while having no verbal sense to it does proclaim a mystical bond of defiance.27 Such yells were characteristic of family clans in the Middle Ages, both among the nobility and the peas- antry, and among the former could be a single word, as Jacques Heers explains: soit nom d'ancetre ou sobriquet, soit nom d'un chateau, d'un lac, d'une riviere28 These cries are associated with family blazons, heraldic devices, and other noble signs, and perhaps, among peasant clans, with analogous symbols once connected to what used to be tribal or totemic objects. One is very tempted to interpret the Ned Ludd figure either as such an object or as a recent his- toricization of such an object, much as back through King George to Saint George we catch some vague survival of an earlier cult figure. Frank Peel reports that in the attack on the mill at Rawfolds, once the windows were broken and the disguised Luddites entered the yard, Then follows a terrific yell from the desperate multitude-a yell loud enough and wild enough to strike terror into the boldest heart. The echoes of that savage cry have not died away before the rioters fire a volley through the empty windows.29 The'savage cry' immediately recalls the clamor horrendissimus the fourteenth century chroniclers report for the Corpus Christi Day rebels. In the fifteenth century, Caxton labelled the uprising the 'hurling time', that is, a period not only of tumultuous activity, but one clearly identified with great noise-- the hurling of the waves against the rocky shore. As with other aspects of ceremonial rebellion, the 'terrific yell' was neither pointless nor haphazard; it was an assertion of communal identity, the sound of the army of redressers re-establishing archaic justice on Ned Ludd's behalf. Charlotte Bronte seems to preserve a bit more of local tradition in her Shirley. She certainly captures more of the religious controversy and vio- lence in the early part of her novel than Peel does in his studies or Sykes in his book; and by shifting the attack on Cartwright's mill (fictionally Moore's mill) to Whit Sunday she suggests the ritual power of the event, even if she can only articulate two young girls' fears of gruff men to give the feeling of the attack itself. Perhaps her own syntactic outburst is closer</page><page sequence="9">174 NORMAN SIMMS to the mentality of the rebellion than all the rest she has written; once the rioters have broken into the mill-yard, she writes, there is: a rioter's yell-a North-of-England-a Yorkshire-a West Riding-a West Rid- ing-clothing-district-of-Yorkshire rioter's yell ... And she goes on further to describe the yell's sound: That yell was a long one, and when it ceased, the night was yet full of the swaying and murmuring of a crowd.30 Two factors can be gleaned from Charlotte Bronte's novelist description: first, the attempt to localize the yell down to a specific district, to a com- munity of textile-workers; and second, the sound of the yell was long and perhaps wavering, like the irritzina, if the syntax is any guide to possible onomatopoeic intent. It might be tempting even to adduce a further etymo- logical reading of Ned Ludd's name, from ludd as loud, lewd, and thick; one might even go back to the howling of lazy Ludlam's dog; but the evi- dence is insufficient to bear these interesting speculations. Noise has its place in juridic village rites and it is one of the ways in which mummers disguise their activity, separate it from normal behaviour. In Lin- colnshire there is a form of punishment ceremony called the Ran-tan-tan.3' When someone in a village offends the communal sense of justice-such as a wife-beater or schoolmaster too zealous with the strap-a side of re- dressers gathers. With kettles, cans, and sheets of iron banging a great ran- tan-tan, the avengers march on the house of the offender, and for three nights they taunt him with songs and speeches. They also carry to him a Straw Man; a large man 'e 'ad ter be, an' all covered in straw, an' a long straw tail 'angins off 'im. The effigy has been further described by one villager as a disguised member of the side who has a role to play in their ritual; he was a man: on a pole, stuffed with straw, with coat, trousers, and hat on it, and this figure was tarred, and after a great deal of banging of tin cans, etc.' a speech was made and the effigy solemnly burnt. In the village of Willoughton, the avengers did not use an effigy, but the offending person was 'got out of his house', taken to the Duck Pond and 'beaned'-that is, beaten with short-stocked whips with five thongs. After that he was ducked in the pond. Since the violence of the Luddites has a similar juridic function, with the offender usually the frame rather than the owner of the machine, the following account from Middleton on 25 April 1812 may be of interest, showing the use of a straw jack in the rites of Luddism: At the head of this armed banditti, a Man of Straw was carried, representing the renowned General Ludd whose standard-bearer waved a sort of red flag ...32</page><page sequence="10">NED LUDD'S MUMMERS PLAY 175 Whether the jack was meant to represent Ned Ludd as this informant asserts or whether it might have been an effigy of the enemy cannot be known without further investigation. A generation earlier, the anti-Jacobins carried effigies of Tom Paine through the streets to be burnt; but the rebels here could be following the religious practice of processing with an icon of their saint. At the very least, it would not be out of keeping with archaic practice for the straw man to be at the same time the saviour and the despised enemy. It is not unlikely that the ritual leader of the Corpus Christi Uprising of 1381 was Jack Straw, both the enemy in effigy to be killed at Mile End and the embodiment of the people's communal juridic sense punishing the lawyers and tax-collectors. In the Stockton and Nottingham bread-riots, when women and men dressed as women claimed to be General Ludd's wives, 'One group carried a woman in a chair who gave the word of command and was given the name of "Lady Ludd".'33 We have an image analogous to that given for Middle- ton. It is possible then that the last, speculative types of disguise in category IV may include straw figures and men or women assuming the role of Ludd him- or herself. Just as the disguises begin with simple blacking of the face and lead up through distortions and reversals of clothing to sexual in- versions, and so lead into a potent, irrational symbol of male and female combined, here we may see in the more clearly juridic rite-the bread-riot and power-procession-the merging of salvation and pollution: the proto- political symbol is, as Mircea Eliade would say, at the centre of the world, and those who control access to that centre, the Luddites, have the power to recreate a just society. The rebels not merely challenge the alien authority and purge themselves of pollution, but they incorporate into their own cere- monies, that is, into their own power, the images and figures of their enemy. This can be understood more sympathetically if we realize that machine- breaking was not the only or perhaps even the defining activity of the Lud- dites, though that is how it certainly appeared to magistrates and generals. Like other artificially organized fraternities, as opposed to natural family or clan groups, they were concerned with the welfare of their members and their families; so that the Luddites appeared at night not only at factories to set fire to the offending frames, but at the doors of lonely cottagers to collect money. When 12,000 troops roamed the north country to put down the uprising, no doubt guns and ammunition were sought for self-defence; but usually, the money was to feed families of croppers and weavers put out of work by the economic depression and the advent of the new machines. Midnight knocks at the door by disguised men, roughly growled demands for money and arms, and violence against the property of those who refused were no doubt frightening,34 no mere Hallowe'en games of trick or treat. Nevertheless, these activities did not turn the populace against the Luddites, and their support came from almost all members of the village who were not direct agents of the manufacturers or civil authorities. If frightened by these strangers, the villagers were probably only ritually so, partly for effect, to protect themselves from the magistrates by this disguise of being forced into aiding the wild ruffians, and partly for integrity, to believe that the</page><page sequence="11">176 NORMAN SIMMS Luddites were not merely our cropping lads but stronger, more archaic agents of true justice. This kind of ceremonial visitation by mummers asking for gifts is so often met with in folklore in a trivial form that we may be reluctant to recognize here a striking instance of an old tradition functioning in the midst of an historical crisis. Rather than psychotherapy or garbled survival of fertility magic, the mumming play and quite is immediate and essential. The fearfulness of the situation cannot be overstressed. Real- strangers-military patrols, angry magistrates, bitter manufacturers like Horsfall and Cartwright-roamed the countryside, and to a cotter on the lonely moors a midnight knock could not be a trivial game of let's pretend. 'Too often, and I am afraid not entirely without justification,' writes Venetia Newall, 'the English folklorist has been regarded as an antiquarian romantic ... there has been a tendency to avoid offensive, embarrassing topics'.35 Let us add historical topics and those which are seen as the domain of history and economics. It is not only that the folklorist does not like to talk about real sexual activity (as distinct from green poles and fairy rings) and racism, but that the effect of so-called folk-beliefs, what I am more in- clined to call the archaic mentality of people from non-literary cultures who are more inclined to think in variants of received, traditional patterns of thought than urban, individualistic cultures-the effect of these beliefs is not examined. A folkloric approach to the Luddite rebellion shows the tradi- tional play of disguise and juridic rites functioning in an historical situation and explaining how and why the countryside could support a small group of rebels who were constantly being harassed by outsiders. The mentality of the people involved, the Luddites as well as their supporters, is as much a part of the history of the rebellion as the Orders in Council and the record of Parliamentary petitions. Hindsight can tell us perhaps that opposition to the new machines was against the best interests of the community and romantic idealism can perhaps treat the rebels as handsome young heroes, but towards the end of the nineteenth century an eighty-year-old woman sang to Frank Peel a song about the defeat of the Luddites at Rawfolds mill, and in that song can be found the dignity of the village, the hope for archaic justice:36 How gloomy and dark is the day When men have to fight for their bread; Some judgment will sure clear the way, And the poor shall to triumph be led.

Robert Baldick (New York, 1962); and Gideon Sjoberg, The Pre-Industrial City: Past and Present (Glencoe, Illinois, 1960). On the essential features of vicinage and fraternal-structuring, still useful is George Unwin, The Guilds and Companies of London, London, 1908. 12. For example, see James Barry, The Luddites in Yorkshire (Clapham, Yorks.: Dales- man Publishing Company, 1970), p. 6; but Barry's only named source is Frank Peel. 13. I have discussed this at greater length in 'Riscoala tirrineasca ca limbaj popular' (Peasant Uprising as Popular Language) in the forthcoming celebration anthology Limbajul Artei Populare (The Language of the Popular Arts) for the Centenary Celebrations of The Museum of Popular Art, Bucharest, Romania. 14. See N. Simms, 'Some Social and Theoretical Aspects of Late Medieval Drama in London', Parergon (1973); also the forthcoming, N. Simms, 'Chaucer's Allusion to Jack Straw,' also in Parergon, 8 (May, 1974), 1-11. 15. For example, see E. J. Hobsbawm, Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries (Manchester, 1959); also N. Simms, 'Chaucer's Allusion to Jack Straw', note 17 above. 16. Aside from references to the Oxford English Dictionary and The English Dialect Dic- tionary, the evidence here adduced comes from such sources as John S. Farmer and W. E. Henley, Slang and its Analogues: A Supplemental Glossary ofColloquial English, vol. IV (London, 1896), which cites T. Fielding's Select Proverbs on Ludlam's Dog (1824); Francis Edward Taylor, The Folk-Speech of South Lancashire ... (Manchester, 1901), a sympathetic account of the discontented and riotous workman named Lud who gave his name to the movement; Walter E. Haigh, A New Glossary of the Dialect of the Huddersfield District (OUP, 1928), a snobbish account of the attacks against 'enterprising' manufacturers by the followers of the 'imbecile' Ned Ludd. 17.

Widdowson and Herbert Halpert, 'The Disguises of Newfoundland Mummers', in Christmas Mumming in Newfoundland, pp. 145-64. The meanings and implications of the disguises are discussed in two essays of this anthology especially, Melvin M. Firestone, 'Mummers and Strangers in Northern Newfoundland', pp. 62-75, and Louis J. Chiaramonk, 'Mumming in "Deep Harbour": Aspects of Social Organization in Mumming and Drinking', pp. 76-103. Perhaps the most incisive discussion, however, is in John F. Szwed, 'The Mask of Friendship: Mumming as a Ritual of Social Relations', pp. 104-18. 19. Liversidge, The Luddites, p. 51. 20. Ibid., p. 64. 21. Ibid., p. 71. 22. D. F. E.

The connection between the Luddite attacks and the bread-riots has not been explored; generic- ally they are distinct but occur simultaneously in the same regions and often with the same crowds participating. 34. At the trial of Luddites in York on 6 January 1813, witnesses reported that masked strangers had come to their cottages in the darkness, 'rapping loudly on the door as if with the butt end of a gun, and demanding: "Your arms! Your arms! General Ludd, my master, has sent me for your arms!" ... they had fired shots and made a noisey disturbance'. Barry, The Luddites in Yorkshire, p. 26. 35.

Thompson (London: Frank Cass &amp; Co., 1968; original edition, 1880), p. 120. If I have not referred to Peel's study earlier it is not from lack of influence: his The Rising ofthe Luddites, as Thompson's introductory statements assert, is the prime source for all subsequent study, and the more documentary evidence is turned up in letters, news- papers, and diaries, the more they confirm the 'oral' traditions Peel relied on.</page></plain_text>
