<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Eating Things: Food, Animals, and Other Life Forms in Lewis Carroll’s Alice Books MICHAEL PARR I SH LEE What can we learn from the Duck, this character in Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) who conflates things with ani- mals and food? The Duck distinguishes itself as an emphatic ‘‘I’’ through its simultaneous possession of knowledge and status as an eater: ‘‘‘I know what ‘‘it’’ means well enough, when I find a thing,’ said the Duck: ‘it’s generally a frog, or a worm.’’1 As an edible animal, however, the Duck resides in the very food chain of ‘‘its’’ and ‘‘things’’ upon which its subjectivity seems to rest. While, to a certain extent, this ensnarement of self and thing fits within the ontology of ‘‘thing theory’’ where ‘‘things seem slightly human and humans seem slightly thing-like,’’2 Nineteenth-Century Literature, Vol. 68, No. 4, pp. 484–512, ISSN: 0891–9356, online ISSN: 1067–8352, © 2014 by The Regents of the University of California.

By the Duck’s definition, things are not objects that appear uncannily human, but edible life-forms that presumably have appetites of their own. As Lewis Carroll’s Alice puts it, ‘‘how confusing it is all the things being alive’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 75). Of course, thing theory has produced some fascinating discussions of the liveliness of things, but when we extend this field of discussion to eating things, we must take the ‘‘life’’ of things more literally and think seriously about their corporeality and survival. Moreover, we find that the realmof things now enlarges to include nonhuman animals, those things that eating sooftenpositions at the contact point between agent and object, living and dead. Attempting to expand the investigation of things beyond a human/thing dichotomy, this essay draws on the actor-network-theory (ANT) ofBrunoLatour toexplore theentanglement of humans, objects, animals, and appetites that generates so much of the wonder in Lewis Carroll’s Alice books. I argue that these texts attempt to reconcile the Victorian destabilization of discrete ‘‘human’’ and ‘‘animal’’ categories facilitated by evolutionary theory with an increasingly commodified culture where everything and every- one seem potentially consumable. Carroll presents a world that is both fully social and thoroughly objectified, where humans, animals, and objects trade, share, and fight for positions in a net- work of edible things. I therefore hope, through reading the Alice books, to com- plicate thing theory by using eating as an invitation—although potentially a violent one—to the world of nonhuman animals. To do this is also to put a bit of pressure on the twomain strands of thinking about things that have taken hold of current literary studies. The first is the Heideggerian model of thing theory, articulated most famously by Bill Brown. This strand of thought concerns itself with, in the words of Jonathan Lamb, ‘‘the differ- ence betweenobjects that serve humanpurposes and things that don’t.’’3 Such theory is, for Brown, invested in ‘‘sacrific[ing] the clarity of thinking about things as objects of consumption, on the one hand, in order to see how, on the other, our relation to 3 JonathanLamb,TheThingsThings Say (Princeton:PrincetonUniv. Press,2011),p. xi. </page> <page sequence="3"> 486 nineteenth-century literature things cannot be explained by the cultural logic of capitalism’’ (A Sense of Things, pp. 5–6). In order to differentiate the seem- ingly reductive ‘‘object’’ from the more uncanny, or even sub- lime, ‘‘thing,’’ thing theorists attempt to remove the thing from any kind of circulation or exchange that seems capitalist or human. According to Brown: As they circulate through our lives, we look through objects (to see what they disclose about history, society, nature, or culture. . . . We begin to confront the thingness of objects when they stop working for us . . . , when their flow within the circuits of produc- tion and distribution, consumption and exhibition, has been arrested, however momentarily.4 But although, for thing theory, capitalist logic is too narrow to contain the liveliness of things, Catherine Gallagher has more recently argued that nineteenth-century conceptions of capital- ism were foundationally concerned with ‘‘organic ‘Life’ itself’’ as ‘‘the ultimate desideratum and the energy or force that circu- lates through organic and inorganic nature.’’5 An investigation of Victorian things in particular, then, might lose more than it gains by granting the life of things a status of exception from the nineteenth-century economic concerns with ‘‘issues of life and death’’ stemming ‘‘from the thought of Thomas Robert Mal- thus’’ (Gallagher,TheBodyEconomic, pp.4,3)—developed initially in An Essay on the Principle of Population (1798)6—and concentrat- ing not only on ‘‘modes of production and exchange’’ but also on ‘‘the interconnections among populations, the food supply,’’ and ‘‘their impact on life forms generally’’ (Gallagher, The Body Eco- nomic, p. 3). Moreover, for all the efforts of thing theory to outrun the human, it operates, as StevenConnor suggests, through a ‘‘covert anthropomorphism.’’7 It is only by escaping from the realm of human circulation that these things become themselves—as if 4 Bill Brown, ‘‘Thing Theory,’’ Critical Inquiry, 28 (2001), 4 (emphasis in original). 5 Catherine Gallagher, The Body Economic: Life, Death, and Sensation in Political Economy and the Victorian Novel (Princeton: Princeton Univ.

I would suggest that the focus of such theory on the singularity and alterity of things causes it to miss out on the networks that things form, networks that mid-Victorians like Lewis Carroll, haunted by Charles Dar- win’s ‘‘tangled bank’’ of interspecies relations,8 found it difficult to ignore. It is important to remember that the Victorian rise of commodity capitalism was a rise that occurred in the age of evolutionary theory, when concerns about human/object rela- tions would have been enmeshed with concerns about the en- tanglements between humans and other life forms.9 According to Andrew H. Miller, with the nineteenth-century triumph of capitalism, there was amid-Victorian anxiety that the ‘‘social and moral world was being reduced to a warehouse of goods and commodities, a display window in which people, their actions, and their convictions were exhibited for the economic appetites of others’’ (Novels Behind Glass, p. 6). And as Nancy Armstrong notes, ‘‘objects’’ in Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland ‘‘are neither inert nor speechless’’ (‘‘The Occidental Alice,’’ p. 559). But for Carroll, in themidst of theDarwin debates, the experience of this world of ‘‘economic appetites’’ could not be severed from the bodily appetites of the biological ‘‘Struggle for Life’’ between creatures ‘‘remote in the scale of nature, [but] bound together by a web of complex relations,’’ ‘‘all feeding on each other’’ (Dar- win, Origin of Species, pp. 648, 101, 102).10 For Carroll, capitalist 8 Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection or The Preser- vation of Favored Races in the Struggle for Life (New York: Modern Library, 1998), p. 648. 9 For discussions of the Victorian rise of commodity capitalism, see for example W.

In the Alice books, to be a thing is not to transcend circulation, interconnection, or the conditionof being potentially utilizable or consumable by others; rather, it is to be part of such networks when these networks reach beyond the domain of the human. Of course, Brown is not a Victorianist, and in fact the sec- ond, more object- and circulation-friendly strand of thinking about things in literary studies has strong Victorianist represen- tation by scholars such as John Plotz and Elaine Freedgood.11 These thinkers represent a looser thing trajectory influenced less by Martin Heidegger than by Arjun Appadurai’s edited volume The Social Life of Things (1986).12 They are more com- fortable with things as property, as objects of consumption, and as telling stories about human history and culture. These think- ers, however, risk looking through things to what Freedgood calls ‘‘the ideas in things’’ (The Ideas in Things, p. 76), and their things are very much objects in the way that Lamb and Brown describe objects, remaining quite human, or at least circum- scribed by human identifications, values, and use values. I want to suggest that, without quite letting us have our things and eat them too, Lewis Carroll’s Alice books can productively mediate these two strands of thought. They give us the surprise, the strangeness, the irreducible excess, and the tangled relation- ship between subjects and objects of thing theory’s uncanny ‘‘things,’’ but without throwing circulation or consumption out - Criticism, 45 (2003), 383–415; Rose Lovell-Smith, ‘‘Eggs and Serpents: Natural History Reference in Lewis Carroll’s Scene of Alice and the Pigeon,’’ Children’s Literature, 35 (2007), 27–53; Akira Mizuta Lippit, Electric Animal: Toward a Rhetoric of Wildlife (Min- neapolis: Univ. of Minnesota Press, 2000), pp. 137–39; Mervyn Nicholson, ‘‘Food and Power: Homer, Carroll, Atwood and Others,’’ Mosaic, 20, no. 3 (1987), 37–55; and Margaret Boe Birns, ‘‘Solving the Mad Hatter’s Riddle,’’ Massachusetts Review, 25 (1984), 457–68. 11 See John Plotz, Portable Property: Victorian Culture on the Move (Princeton: Prince- ton Univ.

While thing theory remains rooted in Heidegger’s vision of things as ‘‘inde- pendent’’ and ‘‘self-supporting,’’13 the Alice books give us things in networks, but networks that supersede, and have utility beyond, the human. Eating, I propose, is our way into these networks. What kind of a thing is food? According to E. M. Forster, ‘‘food in fiction is mainly social. It draws charac- ters together, but they seldom require it physiologically, seldom enjoy it.’’14 Forster’s assertion, I have suggested elsewhere, points to the way in which nineteenth-century British novels ‘‘often obscure the material side of eating linked to bodily appetite and sensory pleasure in favor of a version of eating’’ that is more purely, or narrowly, ‘‘social,’’ usually at the service of the marriage plot.15 Lewis Carroll, however, in focusing on childhood—which earlier nineteenth-century novels tended to marginalize as anuninteresting space of alimentary appetite16— and entering fully into the subject/object merging occasioned by nascent commodity culture and the human/animal slippage hinted at by evolutionary theory, pries open the conventional novelistic social to discover a world animated by the foods and eating processes that might otherwise function as background, symbols, or structuring devices. Alice occupies a world that makes her confident that ‘‘something interesting is sure to hap- pen . . .whenever I eat or drink anything’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 32; emphasis in original) and asks us to consider the narrative implications of it being ‘‘always tea-time’’ (p. 64)— always mealtime for someone or something. Following Alice’s lead, critics ofCarroll’s texts have ‘‘always t[aken] a great interest 13 See Martin Heidegger, Poetry, Language, Thought, trans.

And while I am closer to critics such as Nina Auerbach, James R. Kincaid, Mar- garet Boe Birns, and Rose Lovell-Smith who read Wonderland eating as expressing a vision of predation than to those such as Armstrong, Carina Garland, and Carol Mavor who read it as re- flecting anxieties about control,17 I want to suggest that the Alice books deploy eatingmore radically to remap the novelistic social, merging literary character, and indeed ‘‘the human,’’ with ‘‘the things’’ that, for Brown, ‘‘comprise the stage on which human action, including the action of thought, unfolds’’ (A Sense of Things, p. 3). Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871) open up a space in which food and eating refuse to behave themselves as stage, backdrop, symbols, or empty vessels for any kind of preexisting social. Instead, Carroll offers us the opportunity to see the social itself as something that is assembled, at least in part, so that we, and others, might eat—but also, if paradoxically, as something that is assembled by food. So, first and foremost, food in Alice is social—but not in the way that Forster means. Food is not simply an object utilized by social subjects. Anticipating Jane Bennett’s theorization of food as a form of ‘‘agency,’’18 Wonderland foods are cocreators of human character, as hinted by Alice’s contemplation: ‘‘Maybe it’s always pepper that makes people hot-tempered . . . and vinegar that makes them sour—and camomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and such things thatmake children sweet-tempered’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 78). Moreover, Carroll gives us a world in which subjects and objects are not essentially different and where everything and everyone is potentially on themenu. For Carroll, food is a social 17 See Nina Auerbach, ‘‘Alice and Wonderland: A Curious Child,’’ Victorian Studies, 17 (1973), 31–47; James R. Kincaid, ‘‘Alice’s Invasion of Wonderland,’’ PMLA, 88 (1973), 92–99; Birns, ‘‘Solving the Mad Hatter’s Riddle’’; Lovell-Smith, ‘‘The Animals of Wonderland’’; Lovell-Smith, ‘‘Eggs and Serpents’’; Armstrong, ‘‘The Occidental Alice’’; Carina Garland, ‘‘Curious Appetites: Food, Desire, Gender, and Subjectivity in Lewis Carroll’sAliceTexts,’’The Lion and the Unicorn, 32 (2008), 22–39; andCarolMavor, ‘‘For-Getting to Eat: Alice’s Mouthing Metonymy,’’ in The Nineteenth-Century Child and Consumer Culture, ed.

Press, 2010), p. 41. </page> <page sequence="8"> lewis carroll’s alice books 491 thing—a thing that associates and socializes. For instance, near the beginning ofWonderland, Alice drinks from a bottle labeled ‘‘DRINKME’’ (p. 13) and eats a cake ‘‘on which the words ‘EAT ME’ [are] beautifully marked in currants’’ (p. 14). These food- things function bothpartly as objects andpartly as subjects. They can be picked up and consumed as objects, but they also make the requests that lead to their ingestion,making them thepartial agents of their own consumption. I say ‘‘partial’’ agents because Alice, who eats and drinks them (pp. 15, 13–14), must also be a partial agent of their consumption. But the very acts of inges- tion that might seemingly secure Alice’s status as a consuming subject over and against consumable objects renderAlice object- like, making her a tool through which the food-things realize their consumption. Such ingestion also causes Alice to experi- ence herself as an object, first ‘‘shutting up like a telescope!’’ (p. 14), and then ‘‘opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!’’ (p. 16). The meeting of Alice and the edibles thus makes each party inhabit and overflow the position of subject and object at once, becominguncanny ‘‘things,’’ but hardly indepen- dent or self-sufficient ones. They become things through asso- ciation and collaboration, things operating together as both partial agents and partial objects to form a network of consump- tion. In Alice, one never eats alone. Eating, for Carroll, is a particularly vivid intersection of multiple agencies, bearing resemblance to the theory of action put forth by Bruno Latour. Action, Latour suggests, is ‘‘not transparent’’ and ‘‘is not done under the full control of con- sciousness; action should rather be felt as a node, a knot, and a conglomerate of many surprising sets of agencies,’’ or ‘‘ac- tors,’’ forming an ‘‘actor-network.’’19 In the instance above, Alice forms a network with the following actors: 1. The ‘‘DRINK ME’’ drink constituted by the bottle and the liquid within that relies onAlice todrink it and causes her to shrink. (When Alice tastes the liquid, we encounter a resulting sub-network of ‘‘mixed flavour’’ consisting of still more actors: ‘‘cherry-tart, custard, 19 Bruno Latour, Reassembling the Social: An Introduction to Actor-Network-Theory (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2005), p. 44. </page> <page sequence="9"> 492 nineteenth-century literature pine-apple, roast turkey, toffy, and hot buttered toast’’ [Alice’s Adven- tures in Wonderland, pp. 13, 14].) 2. The ‘‘EAT ME’’ cake that relies on both the drink to shrink Alice to a size where she can find the cake under the table and Alice to eat the cake, causing Alice to grow. But as Alice grows, this network expands to include another pair of actors: 3. Alice’s feet. Growing taller upon eating the cake, Alice experi- ences her feet as separate actors, bidding them ‘‘Goodbye’’; won- dering ‘‘who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?’’; worrying that if she is not ‘‘kind to them’’ they ‘‘wo’n’t walk the way I want to go’’ (p. 16); and contemplating sending them presents (pp. 16–17). Rather than giving evidence of ‘‘spiteful attempts of the male author to suppress and control Alice’s agency’’ (Garland, ‘‘Curi- ous Appetites,’’ p. 22) or being part of an effort to represent ‘‘the body as something already out of control, something always in need of regulation’’ (Armstrong, ‘‘The Occidental Alice,’’ p. 551), the consumption of the ‘‘DRINKME’’-‘‘EATME’’ items dramatizes Alice as an actor reassembling, dividing, and realign- ing through her incorporation of other actors that are them- selves presumably reconfigured through Alice’s ingestion and digestion of them. Latour’s actors have more ontological flexi- bility than either conventional objects or the things of thing theory. They can include humans, animals, objects, concepts, and, in the case of Alice, food and body parts. But with such versatile actors at hand, why hold onto ‘‘things’’ at all? First, I would suggest, because Carroll himself makes frequent and imaginative use of the term ‘‘thing.’’ Second, because, while the Alice books anticipate Latour’s sense of the multiplicity and ‘‘dislocated’’ nature of agency (Reassembling the Social, p. 46; emphasis in original), Carroll’s things are actors caught up in a historically specific imagining of objects, people, and animals trading positions—actors embodied within a social network of Darwinian commodities mobilized by eating. Upending the conventional nineteenth-century novelistic model that defines deep human character and narrative </page> <page sequence="10"> lewis carroll’s alice books 493 interest against the interest in food,20 this sequence shows Car- roll reworking literary form. Alice’s consumption of other actors simultaneously moves the story along and quite literally trans- forms her. Undoing distinctions between eating and reading,21 the sequence also stands as a particularly self-reflexive instance of the text’s participation in themid- to late-nineteenth-century conceptualizations of reading as a bodily experience discussed by recent criticism concerned with the relationship between aesthetics and corporeality.22 But the tendency for such criti- cism to underplay the alimentary dimensions of embodiment23 points to the enduring relegation of gustatory taste to the lower rungs of what Carolyn Korsmeyer describes as the ‘‘hierarchy of the senses,’’ a hierarchy informing the modern aesthetic mod- els24 that influence so much nineteenth-century narrative.25 Carroll breaks with these models, grounding literary form and reading alike not simply in the body, but in the potentially ani- malistic domain of bodily appetite. Alice’s network with the ‘‘EAT ME’’-‘‘DRINK ME’’ things—at once objects, characters, edibles, and texts—presents appetite eliciting and shaping liter- ary interest, which functions here not as a demonstration of deep interiority26 but as a bodily vector of association with het- erogeneous things in Carroll’s expansion of the social. We see a more aggressive example of the social life of food near the end of Through the Looking-Glass, when Alice attends 20 See Lee, ‘‘The Nothing in the Novel.’’ 21 See Mavor, ‘‘For-getting to Eat,’’ p. 101. 22 See for example Nicholas Dames, The Physiology of the Novel: Reading, Neural Science, and the Form of Victorian Fiction (New York: Oxford Univ.

Press, 1999), p. 5. 25 See Lee, The Nothing in the Novel,’’ pp. 368, 376. 26 Deidre Shauna Lynch argues that the turn of the nineteenth century saw the rise of reading practices in which literary characters ‘‘became the imaginative resources on which readers drew to make themselves into individuals, to expand their own interior resources of sensibility’’ (Lynch, The Economy of Character: Novels, Market Culture, and the Business of Inner Meaning [Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Press, 1998], p. 126). </page> <page sequence="11"> 494 nineteenth-century literature a coronation feast where she is to be officially recognized as a queen, surely the top position in the Looking-Glass food chain, a position defined as ‘‘all feasting and fun!’’27 But ‘‘the feast enacts a radical and pervasive unraveling of the division of the human and the inhuman,’’28 and the would-be objects of con- sumption turn the tables on their would-be consumers. Alice is ‘‘introduce[d]’’ to a leg of mutton that ‘‘ma[kes] a little bow to’’ her (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 229), and upon announcing her wish to slice the leg, Alice is informed that ‘‘it isn’t etiquette to cut any one you’ve been introduced to’’ (pp. 229–30). She is then introduced to a Pudding, andmust ‘‘conque[r] her shyness by a great effort’’ to ‘‘cut a slice’’ of it, after which the Pudding says, ‘‘in a thick, suety sort of voice,’’ ‘‘What impertinence! . . . I wonder how you’d like it, if I were to cut a slice out of you, you creature!’’ (p. 230). Soon consumers and objects of consump- tion trade positions—the leg of mutton sitting in the White Queen’s chair, and the White Queen ‘‘disappear[ing] into the soup’’ (pp. 232–33), the guests ‘‘lying down in the dishes,’’ and the soup-ladle ‘‘walking up the table towards Alice’s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way’’ (p. 233). This revolt of food-things puts pressure on Brown’s claim that ‘‘the tale’’ of ‘‘possession—of being possessed by possessions—is something stranger than the history of a culture of consumption. It is . . . a tale not just of thinking with things but also of trying to render thought thing-like’’ (A Sense of Things, p. 5). Possession, Alice shows us, is richer and stranger than consumption only if we take consumption in a rarefied economic sense.What if we don’t, asCarroll doesn’t, separate ‘‘consumption’’ fromthe conditionof having a body, of needing or wanting to eat and survive—and, perhaps inevitably, to ‘‘cut,’’ to kill—of beingpart of a food chain? Alice occupies worlds in which both subjectivity can become thing-like and the things she would consume are already subjects. 27 Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, in his ‘‘Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland’’ and ‘‘Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,’’ p. 144.

For Carroll, consumption is haunted by animals and the violence done or always on the verge of being done to animals. As Sara Guyer notes, the leg of mutton and the suety Pudding respectively are and bear the remains of ‘‘slaughtered and cooked animals’’ (‘‘The Girl with theOpenMouth,’’ p. 162). And even some of the less-fleshy inhabitants of the table assem- ble into animal form: ‘‘As to the bottles, they each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: ‘and very like birds they look,’ Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning’’ (Through the Looking- Glass, p. 232). This ‘‘confusion’’ that nearly overwhelms Alice’s subject-defining ability to ‘‘think’’ is as much a rebellion of ani- mals as of food, which is perhaps fitting for a feast consisting mainly of animal products and attended by ‘‘animals’’ and ‘‘birds’’ (p. 229). Lewis Carroll’s things override the status of mere objects not only through becoming (human) subject-like but also through being or becoming animal-like, or simply through being animals, as in the case of the Wonderland croquet-ground where ‘‘the croquet balls were live hedgehogs, and the mallets live flamingoes’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonder- land, p. 73). If Carroll’s lively things are partly a response to the sub- ject/object ‘‘confusion’’ resulting from the sense of a commod- ified human world under Victorian capitalism, then they also suggest that this confusion was interwoven with concerns about the commodification of animals. Besides bearing witness to the evolutionary theories that blurred the boundaries between hu- mans and animals, the nineteenth century saw an accelerated objectification of animals through the advent of ‘‘zoos, realistic animal toys and the widespread commercial diffusion of animal imagery,’’29 along with the ‘‘more abstract process of [animal] domination implicit in both popular zoology and the scientific 29 John Berger, About Looking (London: Bloomsbury, 1980), p. 26. </page> <page sequence="13"> 496 nineteenth-century literature work it reflected and distilled.’’30 The Victorian period also saw the very visceral objectification of animals by the meat-canning industry and vivisection,31 a practice that, as Jed Mayer notes, Carroll himself became an outspoken critic of.32 In the Alice books, animals frequently occupy the positions of objects for use and consumption while simultaneously troubling their role as objects through their very animalism in a world where ani- mals often command the subject-announcing power of speech. As we have seen, the ‘‘things’’ that the Duck designates are ani- mals that it—another animal—regards as edibles. TheQueen of Hearts describes theMockTurtle as ‘‘the thingMockTurtle Soup is made from’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 81; emphasis added). TheMockTurtle in turn sings a song inwhichoneof the central characters is a whiting, and when the Turtle asks Alice if she can describe whiting, she responds by describing them as food, with ‘‘their tails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs’’ (p. 90). In Through the Looking-Glass, well before the animal-food-things of the coronation feast, a talking Gnat shows Alice a ‘‘Snap-dragon-fly’’ with a body ‘‘made of plum-pudding,’’ ‘‘wings of holly-leaves, and its head’’ a ‘‘raisin burning in brandy’’ and a ‘‘Bread-and-butter-fly’’ whose ‘‘wings are thin slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump of sugar’’ (Through the Looking-Glass, pp. 150, 151)—both at once living creatures and novel objects of consumption. Yet more elusive things seem to trouble this world of ani- mal objects in a Looking-Glass shop run by a Sheep. Alice finds: The shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things—but the oddest part of it all was that, whenever she looked hard at any shelf, to make out exactly what it had on it, that particular shelf was always quite empty, though the others round it were crowded as full as they could hold. ‘‘Things flow about so here!’’ she said at last in a plaintive tone, after she had spent a minute or so in vainly pursuing a large 30 Harriet Ritvo, The Animal Estate: The English and Other Creatures in the Victorian Age (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ.

It’ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, I expect!’’ But even this plan failed: the ‘thing’ went through the ceil- ing as quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it. (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 176) I quote at length because this scene seems to present things at their most Heideggerian. Much to a prospective thing theorist’s delight, Alice faces the refusal of these ‘‘things’’ to be pinned down and reduced to concretely identifiable objects of con- sumption. The things seem uncannily alive precisely in their ability to evade human categorization and use and their conse- quent ability to render Alice thing-like. For, as Alice turns about to try and see these things, the Sheep asks if she is a ‘‘teetotum’’ (p. 176) or spinning top.33 We find, however, that the elusive, metamorphic qualities of these things are not due to their tran- scendence of capitalism, but rather to their embodiment of it. The Sheep says to Alice: ‘‘plenty of choice, only make up your mind. Now, what do you want to buy?’’ (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 178; emphasis in original). The dream logic of these things that refuse to stay still or hold a single form reflects the dizzying phantasmagoria of overwhelming consumer choice and desire more than it reflects pure thingish alterity. Once Alice learns that the things are for sale, she decides that she ‘‘should like to buy an egg’’ to eat (p. 179), bringing us back into a domain of bodily consumption where the ‘‘thing’’ to be consumed is an animal product (and potential source). Yet the egg resists easy consumption. Alice finds that ‘‘the egg seems to get further away the more [she] walk[s] towards it’’ (p. 180), and then that it grows ‘‘larger and larger, and more and more human’’ (p. 181), until it becomes ‘‘HUMPTY DUMPTY’’ (p. 181). This humanized egg thus occupies the intersection between food, person, animal, and purchasable object that a Darwinian con- sumer culture made available to an imagination as vivid as 33 See Hugh Haughton, note to Through the Looking-Glass, p. 343, n. 10. </page> <page sequence="15"> 498 nineteenth-century literature Carroll’s. And if Humpty Dumpty’s desire ‘‘to be master’’ of words and their meanings (p. 186) seems to place him insis- tently on the subject side of the subject/object dichotomy, then the shattering ‘‘fall’’ of his well-known story, played out here in ‘‘a heavy crash’’ (p. 193), reaffirms the Wonderland slippage between subject and object as well as the fragile corporeality that haunts all of Carroll’s actors, whether human, animal, object, or some combination of the three. In the end, the shop of elusive things shows us how animals produce and animate Carroll’s objects. Not only do things materialize as eggs, but the shop is, of course, presided over by a Sheep who sells these consumable goods and whose persistent knitting (pp. 175–78) drives home the objectification of animals. This is not to say that all of the things or even all of the food-things in the Alice books are animals or directly bear ani- mal remains, but rather that animals mobilize the networks of things, especially when eating is at stake. It is, after all, while chasing aWhite Rabbit down a rabbit-hole that Alice encounters the ‘‘EAT ME’’ cake and ‘‘DRINK ME’’ bottle, the ‘‘burning’’ ‘‘curiosity’’ that initially motivates her adventure (Alice’s Adven- tures in Wonderland, p. 10) arising in relation to an animal and quickly becoming indistinguishable from the appetite she shows during her interaction with the edibles. And what prompts Alice’s ‘‘curiosity’’ about the White Rabbit is its waistcoat- pocket and its watch (p. 10), objects for human use that render the Rabbit a novel thing that blurs the boundaries between human and animal.34 Alice’s response to this thing is to blur her own species’ boundaries and take to the rather predatory ani- malistic activity of chasing a rabbit down a hole. The network of actors that we began to trace in the previous section now grows more complex. Even before Alice enters into association with the ‘‘DRINK ME’’ drink, she forms a network that consists of her and the Rabbit. And while she loses sight of the Rabbit during her interactions with the food and drink, the Rabbit soon reappears to help further multiply actors. To our 34 See also Lovell-Smith, who notes that, in John Tenniel’s illustration, the rabbit ‘‘occupies a point between animal and human, simultaneously both these things and neither of them’’ (‘‘The Animals of Wonderland,’’ p. 384). </page> <page sequence="16"> lewis carroll’s alice books 499 provisional list of: 1. The ‘‘DRINKME’’ drink, 2. The ‘‘EATME’’ cake, and 3. Alice’s feet, we can now add the following: 4. The White Rabbit. The initial animal-thing that Alice chases into the rabbit-hole now reappears. Alice attempts to address the Rab- bit who—possibly alarmed by the advances of a creature that has been chasing him and has now grown in size dramatically—re- sponds by ‘‘start[ing] violently,’’ dropping its gloves and fan, and ‘‘skurr[ying] away into the darkness as hard as he could go’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 17). 5. Mabel. After growing and reencountering the White Rabbit, Alice has an identity crisis and is no longer able to tell if she is herself or someone else. She wonders if she has ‘‘been changed in the night’’ (p. 17); asks, ‘‘‘Who in the world am I?’ Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’’ (pp. 17–18; emphasis in original); and worries that she has ‘‘been changed for Mabel!’’ (p. 19). 6. The little crocodile. Worrying that she has been changed for Mabel, Alice tries to remember ‘‘all the things [she] used to know’’ (p. 18). She attempts to recite Isaac Watts’s 1715 poem ‘‘Against Idleness andMischief,’’35 but it comes out as a poem about a ‘‘little crocodile’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 19; emphasis in original). 7. Little fishes. In the poem, the little crocodile ‘‘welcomes little fishes in, / With gently smiling jaws’’ (p. 19; emphasis in original). If Alice’s initial consumption of the edibles is an example of cooperative network building, then the reintroduction of the White Rabbit expands this network to include the more violent (if smilingly social) consumption of fish by crocodile, replaying but inverting the initial invitation from the ‘‘EAT ME’’-‘‘DRINK ME’’ things to Alice to ingest them. This entry and reentry of animals into an apparent human/thing-only club shows ani- mals—even when forgotten—mobilizing and making possible the interactions between humans and things, especially the things that people eat. 35 See Haughton, note to Through the Looking-Glass, p. 302, n. 6. </page> <page sequence="17"> 500 nineteenth-century literature Alice’s identity crisis and inability to remem- ber accurately the ‘‘things’’ she ‘‘used to know’’ opens up another dimension of Wonderland things. As she later tells a hookah- smoking Caterpillar, Alice’s sense that she is ‘‘not [her]self’’ is due to the fact that she does not ‘‘keep the same size for ten minutes together!’’ and that she ‘‘ca’n’t remember things as [she] used’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, pp. 41, 42; empha- sis added). Alice’s sense of selfhood is thus reliant on things: the edible things that change her size and the ‘‘things’’ that she cannot quite remember. And similarly to the case of the Duck’s ‘‘thing,’’ these latter denoted ‘‘things’’ turn out to be animals.36 When the Caterpillar asks Alice, ‘‘Ca’n’t remember what things?’’ she replies: ‘‘Well, I’ve tried to say ‘How doth the little busy bee,’ but it all came different!’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 42; emphasis in original). Alice is referring to her earlier recitation of the poem about the little crocodile (beginning ‘‘How doth the little crocodile’’ [p. 19]). Her feeling of not being herself, then, comes from forgetting ‘‘things’’ not so much as abstract entities or units of information but as specific animals with specific rela- tions to food. Alice has forgotten the productive bee and remem- bered instead the predatory, consuming crocodile. The text thus experiments with amodel of identity that is not based on a recall- able human selfhood or body of knowledge but configured by re-membering: by participating in the assembling and reassem- bling of a diverse network of actors, including animals and foods—by accepting membership within what Latour calls the ‘‘Parliament of Things.’’37 Alice feels as though she has ‘‘been changed’’ for someone else (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, 36 Gilles Deleuze understands ‘‘denoted objects’’ in Carroll’s work as ‘‘always con- sumable or recipients of consumption’’ (Deleuze, The Logic of Sense, ed. Constantin V. Boundas, trans. Mark Lester with Charles Stivale [New York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1990], p. 26). He points out that the Duck ‘‘understands ‘it’ as a denoting term for all things, state of affairs and possible qualities (an indicator). It specifies even that the denoted thing is essentially something which is (or may be) eaten. Everything denoted or capable of denotation is, in principle, consumable and penetrable’’ (The Logic of Sense, p. 26). While Deleuze is right about the consumable—and usually edible—nature of Carroll’s things, he seems to forget their animal dimension, a dimension that the Duck insists on. 37 See Bruno Latour, We Have Never Been Modern, trans. Catherine Porter (Cam- bridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Press, 1993), p. 144. </page> <page sequence="18"> lewis carroll’s alice books 501 p. 17) because she has entered into association with an unfamil- iar network comprising the White Rabbit and the ‘‘EAT ME’’- ‘‘DRINK ME’’ items and cannot, through memory, align herself with the correct animal-‘‘things.’’ As Lovell-Smith suggests, ‘‘in Wonderland humans are the creations of animals, it appears, just as much as animals are the creations of humans’’ (‘‘Eggs and Serpents,’’ p. 43). But is Alice’s alignment with the fish-eating crocodile instead of the bee really a mistake? After all, critics like Edmund Wilson, Auerbach, and Kincaid have regarded Alice as predatory and aggressive.38 And this little crocodile might indeed mirror the hungry Alice. But I think that its appetite points instead to another misremembered fish-loving predator: Alice’s cat, Dinah. I want to suggest that the most crucial ‘‘things’’ in the Alice books are Alice’s cats. In conjunction with Alice, they are the pivotal actors assembling the network of Wonderland. For La- tour, ‘‘action is borrowed,distributed,’’ ‘‘influenced, dominated,’’ and ‘‘translated’’ (Reassembling the Social, p. 46), andAlice, I would argue, similarly borrows and translates theappetite andpredatory aspects of her cats. Several critics have touched on Alice’s ‘‘con- spicuous affinity with cats’’ (Nicholson, ‘‘Food and Power,’’ p. 50) and the ‘‘somewhat puzzling centrality ofDinah and theCheshire Cat’’ inWonderland (Lovell-Smith, ‘‘TheAnimalsofWonderland,’’ p. 408). For example, noting the Cheshire Cat’s ‘‘long claws and a great many teeth,’’ Empson argues that ‘‘Alice is particularly at homewith [theCheshireCat]; she is the same sort of thing’’ (Some Versions of Pastoral, pp. 273–74). Gilles Deleuze writes that Alice ‘‘identifie[s] herself with the Cheshire Cat’’ (The Logic of Sense, p. 235). Auerbach points out that the Cheshire Cat is ‘‘the only creature in Wonderland whom [Alice] calls her ‘friend,’’’ and suggests that he is ‘‘the only figure other than Alice who encom- passes all the others’’ (‘‘Alice andWonderland,’’ p.38). Auerbach also makes telling connections between the Cat’s ability to dis- solve ‘‘into his own grinningmouth,’’ the grinning crocodile, and the centrality ofAlice’s appetite (‘‘Alice andWonderland,’’ p.39). 38 See Edmund Wilson, The Shores of Light: A Literary Chronicle of the Twenties and Thirties (New York: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1952), pp. 543–44; Auerbach, ‘‘Alice and Wonderland,’’ pp. 35–37; and Kincaid, ‘‘Alice’s Invasion of Wonderland,’’ pp. 95–96. </page> <page sequence="19"> 502 nineteenth-century literature The fleeting critical comments on Alice’s pet cats bring us even closer to the mark. Florence Becker Lennon opened up the pos- sibility of thinking about the significance of the ‘‘real’’ cats of the Alice books to the world of Wonderland by suggesting that the Cheshire Cat ‘‘is Dinah’s dream-self’’ and ‘‘a sort of guardian imp and liaison officer between the two worlds.’’39 Kincaid writes: ‘‘In Alice’sworld,which framesbothbooks,Dinah is awarmsymbolof friendly cuddliness, but in Wonderland she is a monster’’ (‘‘Alice’s Invasion of Wonderland,’’ p. 97). More recently, Mavor connects cats to ‘‘memory,’’ suggesting that ‘‘it is thecat—perhaps only the cat, whether it takes the form of Dinah, or themetamor- phosed form of the Cheshire Cat, or the form of a black kitten or a white kitten as birthed by Mother Dinah—that Alice misses’’ (‘‘For-getting to Eat,’’ p. 101). Most evocatively, Auerbach picks uponLennon’s connectionbetween theCheshireCat andDinah but claims an additional ‘‘shift of identities between Alice and Dinah,’’ noting that Dinah ‘‘is the only above-ground character whom Alice mentions repeatedly, almost always in terms of her eating some smaller animal,’’ and positing that Dinah ‘‘seems finally to function as a personification of Alice’s own subtly can- nibalistic hunger’’ (‘‘Alice and Wonderland,’’ pp. 38, 36). Yet even Auerbach underestimates the central role that Alice’s cats play in structuring the world of Wonderland. And while there is indeedanentanglement of identity betweenAlice andDinah, the text avoids reducingDinah to apersonification. Rather thanmak- ing this animal stand in for an aspect of this human, Carroll ex- plores an interspecies model of identity in which humans and animals are each other’s co-creators and mediators, borrowing from, translating, feeding, and feeding off each other. If the ‘‘burning curiosity’’ that drives Alice to chase the White Rabbit at the beginning of Alice’s Adventures in Wonder- land seems to borrow and translate the exploratory and preda- tory instincts of her cat (that most notoriously curious species), then her entry into the world below is marked by her concern for Dinah’s food supply. As she falls down the rabbit-hole, Alice wonders if, in her absence, anyone will ‘‘remember [Dinah’s] saucer of milk at tea-time,’’ and she muses: ‘‘Dinah, my dear! 39 Florence Becker Lennon, Lewis Carroll (London: Cassell and Co., 1947), p. 121. </page> <page sequence="20"> lewis carroll’s alice books 503 I wish you were down here with me! There are no mice in the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s very like a mouse, you know’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 11). This only seemingly absent feline appetite becomes a palpable presence whenAlice, attempting to communicate with amouse, says, ‘‘Ou` est ma chatte?’’, causing the mouse to give a ‘‘sudden leap’’ and ‘‘quiver all over with fright’’ (p. 21)—a reaction not wholly different from the White Rabbit’s fright at Alice. Alice’s response—‘‘I quite forgot you didn’t like cats’’—is met with the mouse’s reply, which at once makes explicit a version of the social that is a predatory food chain and invites Alice to imagine herself occupying the mouse’s place within this chain: ‘‘Not like cats! . . .Would you like cats, if you were me?’’ (p. 21; emphasis in original). But Alice continues to evoke her cat’s appetite. Among an assorted group of creatures (including birds), Alice says: ‘‘Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catching mice, you ca’n’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds! Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!’’ (p. 29), a speech that sends the creatures hurrying away. Lovell- Smith has noted that ‘‘it is through her series of size changes that Alice finds herself continually being repositioned in the food chain’’ (‘‘The Animals of Wonderland,’’ p. 406), but Alice’s position in this chain also depends on her association with Dinah. Alice’s references to Dinah modify her social rela- tions with the creatures of Wonderland, putting them in the position of potential food objects. And just as Alice eventually learns to eat and manipulate her size more strategically, she also begins to use her references to Dinah more deliberately to vie for power among the creatures of Wonderland. After Alice gets stuck in the White Rabbit’s house, the Rabbit concludes that he ‘‘must burn the house down,’’ and Alice responds: ‘‘If you do, I’ll set Dinah at you!’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 36). That said, Dinah hardly insures Alice a secure position at the top of the Wonderland food chain, as we see when Alice shrinks and participates in the rather cat-like fear of becoming prey for a relatively ‘‘enormous’’ puppy (p. 37). Alice’s journey through Wonderland thus develops a model of being in which identity is less a fixed essence than a position on a food chain that varies through association and </page> <page sequence="21"> 504 nineteenth-century literature diet. After her run-in with the puppy, Alice’s earlier, ‘‘‘Who in the world am I?’ Ah, that’s the great puzzle!’’ (pp. 17–18; empha- sis in original), soon gives way to her comment: ‘‘I’d nearly for- gotten that I’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is ‘What?’’’ (pp. 38–39; emphasis in orig- inal). And upon eating a bit of Caterpillar-givenmushroom that makes her grow tall, Alice meets a Pigeon, who further asserts that questions of fixed identity are secondary to questions of what one eats and eats like. The Pigeon identifies Alice as a ‘‘Ser- pent’’ trying to steal its eggs (pp.47–48). Alice’s protests that she is ‘‘a little girl’’ rather than a serpent prove irrelevant when the Pigeon points out that if, as Alice says, ‘‘little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do,’’ then little girls are ‘‘a kind of serpent,’’ a notion that is ‘‘such anew idea toAlice, that she [is] quite silent for a minute or two’’ (p. 48). If Alice’s silence signals some recognition of her role as an animalistic eater, then we should recognize that such a role does not simply mark Alice as an individual consumer, but as a node in an interspecies network of consumption. We should not read Alice’s references to Dinah’s appetite and hunting skills as mere evocations of Dinah or personifications of Alice’s hun- ger, but rather as extensions of and forms of contact with Dinah. While Alice deploys Dinah as a kind of tool to help her move through the social world of Wonderland, she also imagines her- self becoming a tool for Dinah, that Dinahmight begin ‘‘sending [Alice] on messages,’’ or errands, including watching a ‘‘mouse- hole’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, pp. 31, 32). Such think- ing invites us to imagine humans as servants or instruments in animal meals and hints that Alice’s adventures are not just her own, but also act as ‘‘messages’’ for Dinah and Dinah’s kittens. Utilizing Dinah’s appetite to effect her position on the food chain of Wonderland, Alice also functions as a kind of feline prosthesis, imagining meals on behalf of her cats and returning to feed them. Much as Alice’s descent into Wonder- land is marked by her concern about when Dinah will be fed (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 11), her journey through the looking-glass is brought on by Alice’s conversation with Dinah’s black kitten and her desire to pretend that the kitten </page> <page sequence="22"> lewis carroll’s alice books 505 is the Red Queen and marked by her concern over whether the kitten will get milk through the looking-glass (Through the Look- ing-Glass, pp. 124, 127). Once Alice is through the glass, it is the Red Queen who proposes to her that they be queens together, a position that, as we have seen, she defines as ‘‘all feasting and fun!’’ (p. 144). And at her royal coronation, Alice remarks to theRedQueen: ‘‘it’s a very curious thing, I think—every poem[in the Looking-Glass world] was about fishes in some way’’ (pp. 230–231; emphasis added), a point that could also be made about most of the poems in Wonderland. When Alice asks the Red Queen, ‘‘Do you know why they’re so fond of fishes, all about here?’’, the Queen somewhat evasively but tellingly re- sponds, ‘‘As to fishes,’’ and suggests another poem about fishes (p. 231). Once the feast has turned against the Queens, Alice shakes the RedQueen (who she supposes is ‘‘the cause of all the mischief’’ [p. 234]), turning her back into a kitten and waking from her dream. As Jacques Derrida notes, the entire penultimate chapter of Looking-Glass ‘‘consists in a single [partial] sentence’’: ‘‘—and it really was a kitten, after all.’’40 Critics of the Alice books tend to pass over this emphatic commitment to the revelation of the kitten’s identity, and even Derrida points it out mainly to oppose his contemplation of the potential responsiveness of animals to Alice’s apparent certainty ‘‘that one cannot speak with a cat on the pretext that it doesn’t reply or that it always replies the same thing’’ (Derrida, ‘‘The Animal That Therefore I Am,’’ p. 8; see Carroll,Through the Looking-Glass, p. 238). Alice’s frustration that ‘‘whatever you say to [kittens], they always purr,’’ however, does not in fact stop her from talking to her kitten (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 238; emphasis in original). Now awake, Alice says to her kitten: ‘‘You woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! And you’ve been along with me, Kitty—all through the Looking-Glass world. Did you know it, dear?’’ (p. 238). But when the kitten only purrs in response, Alice not only keeps talking but also moves from asking for language as 40 Jacques Derrida, ‘‘The Animal That Therefore I Am (More to Follow),’’ in his The Animal That Therefore I Am, ed. Marie-Louise Mallet, trans. David Wills (New York: Fordham Univ. Press, 2008), p. 7; Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, p. 236 (emphasis in original). </page> <page sequence="23"> 506 nineteenth-century literature response to offering it as a gift: ‘‘if only you’d been really withme inmydream, there was one thing youwouldhave enjoyed—Ihad such a quantity of poetry said tome, all about fishes! To-morrow morning you shall have a real treat. All the time you’re eating your breakfast, I’ll repeat ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’ to you; and then you can make believe it’s oysters, dear!’’ (p. 239; emphasis in original). Alice’s inability to differentiate her kit- ten’s vocal responses and thus to know the extent to which the two of them share a language does not drive Alice to contem- plate philosophy (as Donna J. Haraway notes that Derrida does under the silent gaze of his own small black cat),41 but rather moves her to reshape her language into a form that she knows her kitten will enjoy if not understand in human terms. Instead of continuing to inquire about the truth behind identity (‘‘Con- fess that [the Red Queen] was what you turned into!’’ [Through the Looking-Glass, p. 238]), Alice offers a narrative about food that she translates into the material food that she feeds her kitten. The animals in Alice at once do and do not fit Ivan Kreil- kamp’s claim that ‘‘animal characters are fundamentally ‘minor,’ in the sense defined by Alex Woloch,’’42 functioning as ‘‘subordinate beings who are delimited in themselves while performing a function for someone else.’’43 On one hand, Wonderland animals can be even more explicitly functional than Woloch’s minor human characters, sometimes occupying the positions of objects and meat. But on the other hand, the human Alice, ostensibly the narrative’s central protagonist, her- self performs functions for and acts as an extension of her cats, who are only delimited in a superficial way. Her cats trouble Woloch’s concept of minor characters; without occupying much obvious narrative space, they crucially structure the dream worlds of Wonderland and Alice’s own character, to the 41 See Donna J.

Instead of a ‘‘character-system,’’ or a ‘‘distributional matrix’’ in which ‘‘the discrete representation of any specific individual is intertwined with the narrative’s continual appor- tioning of attention to different characters who jostle for limited space within the same fictive universe’’ (Woloch, The One vs. the Many, pp. 17, 13), Carroll brings us tangled interspecies net- works assembling and reassembling as humans, objects, and animals exchange, share, and create new positions. Fictional ‘‘space’’ in these texts cannot be dominated by the human or mapped with accuracy by human-centered reading practices; instead, the nonhuman territories of things and animals extend beneath and beyond the conventional spaces of readerly atten- tion. Shaping the networks of Wonderland are animal bodies and appetites that draw us in not simply as readers but as social things inhabiting a food chain. Alice’s interaction with her kitten also takes us beyond Derrida’s concerns with animal alterity and human/animal slippage—concerns that have become touchstones for the field of ‘‘animal studies’’44—toward something closer to Haraway’s concept of ‘‘becoming with,’’ a mode of ‘‘species interdepen- dence’’ in which ‘‘the partners do not precede the meeting; species of all kinds, living and not, are consequent on a subject- and object-shaping dance of encounters’’ (When Species Meet, pp. 3, 19, 4). Far from Gilles Deleuze and Fe ́lix Guattari’s ecstatic notion of ‘‘becoming-animal’’45 (which Haraway argues shows a ‘‘profound absence of curiosity about or respect for and with actual animals’’ [When Species Meet, p. 27]), ‘‘becoming with’’ resembles Latour’s actor-networks, involving interspecies ‘‘beings-in-encounter’’ that ‘‘gather up those who respond to them into unpredictable kinds of ‘we’’’ (Haraway, When Species Meet, p. 5). The ‘‘we’’ assembled by Alice and her kitten is a 44 See for example Cary Wolfe, introduction to Zoontologies: The Question of the Animal, ed.

Whether or not Alice’s exten- sion of ‘‘make believe’’ to her kitten is itself an anthropomorphic fantasy, such extension is an offer rather than a demand, and it has both the material consequence of enhancing Alice’s enthu- siasm for feeding the kitten and the narrative-shaping effect of animalizing Alice’s fantasy life. The edible sea life in both Alice books seems at least as much a feline fantasy as a human one, even if such a fantasy is the product of eating practices and appetites that develop through cats’ association and cohabita- tion with humans. And what is ‘‘The Walrus and the Carpen- ter’’—in which the eponymous characters ‘‘talk of many things: / . . . / Of cabbages—and kings— / And why the sea is boiling hot— / And whether pigs have wings’’ in order to lure oysters to their culinary deaths (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 161; emphasis in original)—but the story of an interspecies alliance between a human and an animal using language and ‘‘make believe’’ in order to eat together? Fantasy and fiction, for Carroll, are not human tools for writing over animals or animal necessity, but coinventions with animals—modes of ‘‘becoming with’’ that remain rooted in bodily needs and pleasures and that shape the identities of human and animal inventors together. After offering to repeat ‘‘The Walrus and the Carpenter,’’ Alice further draws our attention to the question ofmake-believe and invention by asking her kitten to help her understand the origin of Wonderland, saying, ‘‘Now, Kitty, let’s consider who it was that dreamed it all’’ (Through the Looking-Glass, p. 239). Alice is referring back to something that occurs after she first hears this poem (pp. 158–63) from the mouth of the some- times ‘‘fish’’-resembling Tweedledee (p. 167), when Tweedle- dee says that Alice is ‘‘only a sort of thing in [the Red King’s] dream!’’ (p. 165). The text follows up this idea in a chapter titled ‘‘It’s My Own Invention’’ in which Alice wonders whether ‘‘we’re all part of the same dream,’’ adding: ‘‘Only I do hope it’s my dream, and not the Red King’s! I don’t like belonging to another person’s dream’’ (p. 205; emphasis in original). But Alice’s anthropocentric contemplation of the potential dream- owners is ‘‘interrupted’’ by two battling Knights and their horses </page> <page sequence="26"> lewis carroll’s alice books 509 (p. 205). The victorious White Knight—a self-declared ‘‘great hand at inventing things’’ (p. 211)—proceeds to show and describe his ‘‘inventions’’ to Alice. These inventions mainly include ‘‘things’’ that come into being at the intersection of humans and animals. They include an upside-down box emptied of the ‘‘things’’ (‘‘clothes and sandwiches’’) it is designed to hold (p.207) andhungona tree ‘‘inhopes somebeesmaymake a nest in it’’ and create ‘‘honey’’ (p. 208); ‘‘anklets’’ that the Knight puts around the feet of his horse ‘‘to guard against the bites of sharks’’ (p. 208); a helmet ‘‘like a sugar-loaf’’ used in case the Knight falls off his horse (p. 211); and a song in which the speaker makes ‘‘butterflies’’ into ‘‘mutton-pies’’ and ‘‘haddocks’ eyes’’ into ‘‘waistcoat- buttons’’ (pp.215,216; emphasis inoriginal).We learn that, ‘‘of all the strange things that Alice saw in her journey Through The Looking-Glass,’’ the sight of theKnight singing this song and ‘‘the horse quietly moving about, with the reins hanging loose on his neck, cropping thegrass’’ is ‘‘the one that she always remembered most clearly’’ (p. 214). In other words, when it comes to reassem- blingLooking-Glass networks, it is not just theKnightwho invents with and for animals thatmakes such amemorable impressionon Alice, but ‘‘the strange pair’’ of man and horse (p. 214). The question of who is dreaming the dream thus lodges between a poem about one human-animal alliance and the spectacle of another, and reemerges when Alice offers to repeat the poem to her kitten. In this way, the text hints that we all might be ‘‘things’’ in a dream, inventions ‘‘becoming with’’ and belonging to one another in an interspeciesnetwork.The returningoysters of ‘‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’’ remind us, however, that ‘‘becoming with’’ has its victims; networks have their prey. Like somany other Wonderland animals, the oysters are at once food objects and social things, the never fully digested remains of fiction and invention. Thing theory is fascinated with the irreduc- ibility of things, as is Carroll. Brown, imagining things ‘‘as what is excessive in objects,’’ makes a point that is as inescapable as it is evocative (‘‘Thing Theory,’’ p. 5). But Brown, looking for this </page> <page sequence="27"> 510 nineteenth-century literature excess of things in ‘‘the void constituted by the jug’’ and ‘‘the emptiness at the center of the Real’’ (A Sense of Things, p. 7), gets so sidetracked by the allure of nothing that he misses out on the living things that teem within and behind the seemingly empty spaces of the human world. One way to remember things is to forget animals, but this is not the remembering that Carroll has in mind. As I have been suggesting, Wonderland things do not exceed object status by concealing a mute unknowable core of pure potential but rather through the networks they create with other objects and life forms. What might at first seem like ‘‘the amorphousness out ofwhichobjects arematerializedby the (ap)perceiving subject’’ (Brown, ‘‘Thing Theory,’’ p. 5) in the Looking-Glass shop of elusive things is already a network of con- sumable goods mobilized by a Sheep, and it is only invisible to the human Alice because she has not yet learned how to join it. For Carroll, the main things that make ‘‘things’’ excessive are animals. And, whether in the form of food, or companions, or some combination of the two, when the networks of Wonder- land begin to unravel, animals are what remain. Alice’s Adventures inWonderland approaches its endwith a trial over stolen tarts (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 96) during which the Queen of Hearts sentences Alice to beheading, utter- ing her famous cry, ‘‘Off with her head!’’ (p. 108). The Queen, a card woman, is a particular kind of Wonderland thing: a human-object hybrid. Her sovereign power over life and death seemingly suggests a world in which commodity objects have taken control over human existence.46 Yet Alice in turn seems able to reduce the Queen and her card men minions to objects for human use. Alice escapes the trial and wakes up from Won- derland by declaring, ‘‘You’re nothing but a pack of cards!’’ (Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland, p. 108), ostensibly turning these subject/objects into mere objects and reaffirming the power of human imagination to animate and control the object world. The card men now become a pack of cards that ‘‘r[ise] up into the air’’ and ‘‘fl[y] down upon’’ Alice (p. 108) but resolve 46 See also Armstrong, who suggests that Alice’s ‘‘farewell’’ to the cards ‘‘could be said to echo’’ a Marxist vision of society ‘‘under conditions of late capitalism’’ in which ‘‘relations among things determine relations among people’’ (‘‘The Occidental Alice,’’ p. 551). </page> <page sequence="28"> lewis carroll’s alice books 511 into even more innocuous ‘‘dead leaves’’ when Alice wakes ‘‘with her head in the lap of her sister’’ (p. 109). But in the end, human imagination proves as much a failed tyrant as the Queen of Hearts. After Alice tells her older sister of her ‘‘curious dream’’ and then exits the narrative to have her ‘‘tea,’’ her sister experi- ences ‘‘the whole place around her bec[oming] alive with the strange creatures of her little sister’s dream,’’ including ‘‘the White Rabbit,’’ the ‘‘Mock Turtle,’’ the ‘‘frightened Mouse,’’ and the ‘‘rattle of the teacupsas theMarchHareandhis friends shared their never-ending meal’’ (p. 109). Despite this contagious immersion in the life of Wonderland, Alice’s sister ‘‘kn[ows] she ha[s] but to open [her eyes] again, and all would change to dull reality’’ (p. 110). Such ‘‘reality,’’ however, is not a strictly human world: ‘‘the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd-boy . . . , and all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs’’ (p. 110). In other words, what remains of the curious things of Wonderland is a reality assembled by the traces of ani- mals and human-animal relations. Such traces are all the more visible in Through the Looking- Glass, which ends with Alice waking from the revolt of food- things as she shakes the Red Queen—this time a human-chess piece hybrid—into her kitten (Through the Looking Glass, pp. 234–37). In the wake of the dissolving meal, Alice offers her remaining animal the narrative animal remains of ‘‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’’ and tries to persuade her kitten to help her solve the riddle of ‘‘who it was that dreamed it all’’: ‘‘This is a serious question, my dear, and you should not go on licking your paw like that—as if Dinah hadn’t washed you this morning! You see, Kitty, it must have been either me or the Red King. He was part of my dream, of course—but then I was part of his dream, too! Was it the Red King, Kitty? You were his wife, my dear, so you ought to know—Oh, Kitty, do help to settle it! I’m sure your paw can wait!’’ (pp. 239–40; emphasis in original) But the ‘‘provoking kitten’’ responds with what looks like coy silence, ‘‘beg[inning] on the other paw, and pretend[ing] it </page> <page sequence="29"> 512 nineteenth-century literature hadn’t heard the question’’ (p. 240). The text then turns the question of thedream to the reader, asking, ‘‘Whichdo you think it was?’’ (p.239; emphasis in original). I take the fact that the text here places the silent reader in a similar position toAlice’s kitten as an invitation to think beyond the human options that Alice provides. To the question of who dreamed the Wonderland worlds, I would venture that the answer is Alice and cats together, forming a network, a food chain in which everyone is edible and every thing is social. University of Nottingham ABSTRACT Michael Parrish Lee, ‘‘Eating Things: Food, Animals, and Other Life Forms in Lewis Carroll’s Alice Books’’ (pp. 484–512) This essay tests how Lewis Carroll’s Alice books might bridge four potentially disparate approaches to literary analysis: thing theory, animal studies, actor-network theory, and food studies. Expanding the investigation of objects and ‘‘things’’ in literature beyond a human/thing dichotomy, I draw on the actor-network theory (ANT) of Bruno Latour to explore the entanglement of humans, objects, animals, and appetites that generates so much of the wonder in Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865) and Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871). I argue that these texts attempt to reconcile the Victorian destabilization of discrete ‘‘human’’ and ‘‘animal’’ categories facilitated by evolutionary theory with an increasingly commodified culture where everything and everyone seem potentially consumable. The Alice books give us ‘‘things’’ in networks, but networks that supersede, and have utility beyond, the human. Eating, I propose, is our way into these networks. I show how Carroll presents a world that is both fully social and thoroughly objectified, where humans, animals, and objects trade, share, and fight for positions in a network of edible things.
