<plain_text><page sequence="1">"The Paradox of My Work" Making Sense of the Factory Farm with Temple Grandin Jessica L. W. Carey McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario "People are often confused by the paradox of my work," writes Temple Grandin in Thinking in Pictures , "but to my practicad, scientific mind it makes sense to provide a painless death for the cattle I love' (2006, 235). In a sense, this assertion summarizes Grandins lifelong struggle, documented in her bestselling popular science books about her autism and her career as a farm architect and animal welfare consultant, to explain to others and herself how she reconciles her intense identification with farm animals and her role in perpetuating a system that confines and kills billions of them per year. Grandins explanations for the factory farm would be critically notable on the basis of her growing notoriety alone: her ongoing work with major fac- tory farming corporations to improve the living and slaughter conditions of "food animals" is becoming legendary, as she has single-handedly redesigned the equipment and facilities used in one third of Americas livestock-handling facilities. Moreover, along with Michael Pollans The Omnivores Dilemma , Grandin s bestselling books Animals in Translation , Thinking in Pictures , and CR: The New Centennial Review, Vol. 11, No. 2, 2012, pp. 169-192, ISSN 1532-687x. © Michigan State University Board of Trustees.

Solely given Grandins influence in both the farming industry and popular culture, sustained critical engagement with her work and its implications in the field of critical animal studies is past due. Yet Grandins cultural vis- ibility only supports my argument in this article for what makes the content of her work so compelling: her explanations for the factory farm amplify and crystallize the justifications for intensive farming that we rely upon and circulate in our daily lives. In using Grandins work to illuminate broader cultural narratives in this way, it would appear that I am at least partly appropriating her assertion that she possesses a vast "video library" of information in her head, and can operate like a "tape recorder," repeating back to her readers in her singular manner- loud, determined, full of brass-tacks certainty- what we all tend to say more subtly and less often (2006, 5, 17). In other words, I am provision- ally employing her work according to Oliver Sacks s landmark description of Grandin, as an anthropologist on Mars (1995)- if only in that "Mars" in this case represents a North American culture that loves and respects animals and yet subjects them to unprecedented biopolitical control on the factory farm, in conditions that, as Jacques Derrida has argued, "previous genera- tions would have judged monstrous" (2008, 26). Reading Grandins account as symptomatic of certain conceptual apparatuses, however, requires that I complicate the rendering of Grandin as an unmediated tape recorder. Con- temporary theories of the witness are useful here: if Grandin is a witness of sorts to the cultural logics I am trying to identify here, what kind of witness is she? After all, it is sloppy to simply claim that she is an anthropologist on Mars - a claim that conjures up particularly dated assumptions about the relationship between an anthropologist and her object of study. We are now thoroughly aware, of course, that anthropologists could never be the objective, mechanistic recorders of culture that they were once supposed to be. I want to situate Grandin s work differently, complicating the relationship between Grandins rhetoric and the cultural logic it appears to illuminate. I try to read Grandin in a manner recently advocated by Dominick LaCapra</page><page sequence="3">Jessica L. W. Carey • 171 as being "sensitive to processes whereby texts question themselves, as well as overly restrictive interpretations of them, and [which is] not reducible to their symptomatic, ideologically reinforcing tendencies, however important these may be" (2009, 15). As we shall see, aspects of Grandins arguments un- dermine her own overall, seemingly justificatory and status-quo-preserving purposes. Yet it is crucial not to respond to these cracks in Grandin s discourse in a way that too quickly either underestimates them as meaningless idio- syncrasies of the witness, or immediately appropriates them yet again into a merely more complex, yet still unmediated, picture of cultural attitudes. Both of these conclusions, to my mind, would risk interpreting Grandins role as a cultural witness too reductively; both conclusions are inadequate to the task of refiguring what LaCapra identifies as a common tendency in witness theory: to contrast the experience of bearing witness as "the unmediated vision, the ineffable or unrepresentable experience itself" against a definition of testimony that "is tantamount to a pressing, even necessary, descent or fall into inadequate discourse" (2009, 63). Against this binaristic definition of witness and testimony, I argue that if the voice and arguments in Grandins books are at once self-certain and fraught, it is important to read such ten- sions in a mode that remains vigilant both to the conditions of production of their own particular truth effects and to the ways they reflect and bring alive tensions in the broader culture.1 For our purposes here, then, I see Grandin less as a "human tape recorder" of rhetoric about farm animals and more as a contingent witness to cultural justifications of intensive farming practices, whose testimony should be read in dialectical relation both outward to the type of narratives it symptomatizes and inward to the conditions that would produce such {New York 7ïmes-bestselling) testimony. Resituating Grandins work in this way- in way that is attentive precisely to her work s "situatedness"- requires some attention to its operating discur- sive and material contexts, perhaps most notably the conceptual apparatuses of popular science and neoliberal economic logic. Operating within the terms of these apparatuses allows Grandins work to assume a readily intelligible air of cultural authority from the outset. Through popular science, Grandin is able to marshal the naturalized epistemological legitimacy that continues to accrue to a certain notion of "Science." The sciences are undoubtedly political</page><page sequence="4">172 • "The Paradox of My Work" and ideological; but through a secondary political and ideological process, popular science books condense a heterogenous, contingent, and mutable range of conclusions and processes (science) into a culturally authoritative, monolithic account (popular science), with a truth claim all its own that is thus doubly political and ideological. Bruno Latour describes this differ- ence as a distinction between "the sciences" and "Science," the latter term standing for "the politicization of the sciences through epistemology in order to render ordinary political life impotent through the threat of an incontestable nature" (2004, 10).2 The political authority of Science, Latour argues, stems from its naturalized Platonic presumption that the human world is divorced from the nonhuman world- a divorce that allots the knowledge-power of nature exclusively to the scientists, those with privileged access to the world beyond the cave of human ignorance. Latours argument helps bring into sharper relief the political stakes of apprehending Grandins popular science as cultural testimony: because we invest science and scientists with such authority- because we invest in them the unique power to interpret and bear witness to what for the rest of us is "unwitnessable" or "unrepresent- able"- their testimony, communicated through the "inadequate discourse" of popular science, is potentially read as incontrovertible. Yet I would argue that no less a consequential frame for Grandins work, if perhaps a less overt one than popular science, is the logic of economic neo- liberalism, or free market fundamentalism. For our purposes here, I use "neo- liberalism" to refer to the current phase of global capitalism that, as David Harvey argues, is characterized by an economic logic of "accumulation by dispossession." As opposed to accumulation through the expansion of wage labor, accumulation by dispossession entails privatization, commodification, and mass appropriation through finance and speculation- all to an unprec- edented degree, and to an extent that seems to systemically render entire sectors and populations disposable, according to the terms of the economic apparatus (2005, 160-61).3 As with the epistemologica! conversion of science into the assumed authority of Science, we can generally agree that, if nothing else, economic neoliberalism has proven itself to be more than a mere type of logic, more than a mere set of principles that gird and explain the monetary economy. In his Collège de France lectures, Michel Foucault identifies what</page><page sequence="5">Jessica L. W. Carey • 173 much cultural theory continues to grapple with: a situation in which the free market is no longer only our chosen site of social jurisdiction, but has grown into an epistemic scaffold whose "regime of veridiction, in fact, is not a law (loi) of truth, [but] the set of rules enabling one to establish which statements in a given discourse can be described as true or false" (2008, 35)/ In other words, the free market principle becomes an epistemologi- ca! arbiter of truth, a naturalized conceptual apparatus par excellence for rendering any given political practice as intelligible and legitimate. I call attention here to Foucaults rendering of the market-as-episteme not least because, as Harvey and many others continue to point out, the ideological force of neoliberal logic has a penchant (so far) for surviving the recent and ongoing glaring failures- on its own supposed terms, along with most other familiar terms of justice and politics- of neoliberal economic policy. The theory that the only means of realizing personal liberty and well-being are found in embracing unrestrained market capitalism persists as a key facet of common sense in North America5- even as the reality of unrestrained market capitalism continues to concentrate power and wealth at the ever- shrinking, monopoly-ridden top, while it increases social inequality to an extent that structurally forecloses, for the vast majority of individuals, much of the freedom promised by neoliberalism. I rehearse this paradox here pri- marily because I think it goes some distance in helping us understand the paradox of Grandins work: it helps render intelligible her effort, and ours, to improve animal welfare within the factory farm context, which causes animal suffering in the first place. It also underscores another key source of Grandins cultural authority: we are as easily convinced as Grandin evidently is that a liberal project of ensuring mass well-being is possible within the thoroughly neoliberal context of the factory farm. What enables this belief, beyond a general faith in science and the mar- ket? In what follows I will gesture to three recurring justificatory narratives in Grandins books that buttress her overall claim that ethically improved intensive farming is possible: she articulates a model of symbiosis that emphasizes the predator-prey dynamic in a way that ultimately privileges humans; she reinforces this framework through an ambivalently hierarchi- cal rendering of human and animal 'worlds'; and finally, she attempts a</page><page sequence="6">174 • "The Paradox of My Work" redemption of the scene from a different angle, by advocating the imple- mentation of an ethical rubric of sacrifice. Each of these narratives has an inherently conservative relation to the factory farm, in that each of them works to preserve the status quo of our relationship with food animals. To be sure, however, the picture here is very complicated: each of these frame- works variably figures forth a liberal humanist ideal, which appears to clash with and mount a resistance to the neoliberal form of mass disposability that for Grandin - and for most of us, undoubtedly - is the factory farms most troubling and egregious feature. Yet as I will argue, in this context it seems that the more or less liberal explanatory frameworks at hand do not ultimately possess the wished-for capacity to mount a truly transformative challenge to the current ethics of the factory farm. Instead, each narrative provides not only a ready alibi for the economic and ethical status quo, but also the ethical salve of assurance that we humans and our factory farms are potentially humane after all- thereby maintaining, in ideological inertia, the conclusion that we are worthy of our dominion, our state of exception, our higher species station. "Over the years I have done lots of thinking" Grandin writes in her latest book, Animals Make Us Human , "and have come to the conclusion that our relationship with the animals we use for food must be symbiotic. Symbiosis is a mutually beneficial relationship between two different living things" (Grandin and Johnson 2009, 297). In Grandins application of a specifically mutualistic form of symbiosis to the situation of food animals here, what might seem to be straightforward is in fact complex. The "must" alone is arguably equivocal- is she calling for a symbiosis l'avenir, issuing a fervent call for more equitable relations on the farm? Perhaps. However, an assertion just as legible in light of Grandins abiding faith in rationalist, deductive logic employs the "must" as the expression of a rational conclusion, the QED of a proof. Our relations on the farm are symbiotic, by definition, full stop. What might we make of this equivocality? I would suggest that it reflects and ar- ticulates the growing cultural tension I have already mentioned, between our faith in the market and its failure to deliver on its promise of well-being: on one hand, something seems very wrong; on the other, of course nothing fun- damental needs to be changed, because the model promises mutual benefit.</page><page sequence="7">Jessica L. W. Carey • 175 I need to back up a bit here, of course, lest I imply a conflation of "sym- biosis" and "the market." Instead, I want to mark symbiosis as a compelling conceptual apparatus in its own right, with both radical and conservative potentialities- one being that it can operate in a highly compatible way with prevailing economic logic. We are familiar with the radical potential of symbiosis in critical animal studies: as a conceptual tool of resistance against humanist rhetoric that tends to naturalize humanity's separation from "nature," many post-humanist scholars continue to emphasize hu- mankinďs more humble situation in a condition of ecological symbiosis with other living creatures.6 Yet we should remain aware that, as with most encompassing or "epistemic" concepts, symbiosis is also recuperable as a means of explaining away problems instead of working to solve them. One such conservative move, in my reading, would be the uncritical extrapolation of the model of symbiosis to describe the modus operandi of the factory farm. Derrida cautions us not to slip too quickly into assuming symbiotic immersion or " continuism," arguing that "we should never be content to say, in spite of temptations, something like: the social, the political, and in them the value or exercise of sovereignty are merely disguised manifestations of animal force, or conflicts of true force, the truth of which is given to us by zoology . . ." (2009, 14). In such explanations of politics, Derrida locates the dangerous impetus to naturalize- thus immunizing against critique- what are in fact historical (and thus deconstructible) phenomena. In this case, describing the farm wholly in terms of symbiosis effaces the provocative evidence that the factory farm might be premised upon a conceptual apparatus of human exception, or the sovereign exemption from nature, which constitutively rejects symbiosis as a model of living-with.7 In other words, reading the factory farm as if its logic is wholly immanent to that of mutualistic symbiosis ultimately does more to perpetuate the apparatus of human exception than it does to take it apart: if we can use the descriptive model of symbiosis to explain all of our actions, then it ironically becomes the new alibi for humanistic endeavor, the new Grand Unified Theory that permits no intervention. At its most extreme extrapolation, under this model the factory farm is figurable as merely the latest expression of universal sym- biosis; the latest act of human solidarity with the lion eating the antelope s</page><page sequence="8">176# "The Paradox of My Work" guts on the savannah, to evoke one of Grandins oft-repeated descriptions of nature. I argue, and I think Grandins equivocality suggests, that models of mutualistic symbiosis need to be twisted and reduced considerably to properly describe the operation of the factory farm. Conveniently for the farming corporations, the direction of this twisting points to the fulfillment of short-term economic efficiency that benefits very few (human) individu- als, although claiming to benefit all parties. Grandins emphasis upon symbiosis is grounded in her general reliance upon a sociobiological framework for understanding both human and animal behavior. Grandin stresses in Animals in Translation that she is not a strict behaviorist- that her consciousness-inclusive model gathers knowledge of animals not only through their reactions to direct stimuli, but also through deductive assumptions both about an animals memories of past stimuli and about the range of drives and desires that have been instilled in animals, through evolution, as neural pathways and hormonal response systems. In this way, Grandins approach works in sync with the tenets of cognitive sci- ence and evolutionary psychology, which are presently coming to occupy a hegemonic dominance across the sciences, social sciences, and even the hu- manities. In an important sense, this model works- "as far as it goes," again to use one of Grandins favored turns of phrase. Grandin has amassed large amounts of data, especially concerning the physiology and cognition of "prey species,' ' and the scientific conclusions about individual animal behavior that she draws from her data are sound and modest. Moreover, I do not wish to create the impression that Grandin commits the all-too-common explana- tory error concerning evolution as a scientific model: that evolution operates with a sense of immanently deterministic purpose.8 She is careful to assert that "you can t know why one thing evolved and another thing didn't, and its a mistake to assume that everything we see in nature serves a purpose' (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 204). However, I want to suggest that it is in her particular effort to apply this framework to the situation of factory-farmed food animals that some stretching and attenuating of the concept of symbio- sis is necessary to make it fit. Grandin lays the groundwork for this stretching in her considerable at- tention, throughout all of her books, to the attributes of species that have</page><page sequence="9">Jessica L. W. Carey • 177 evolved in tandem with their general predator or prey status in the wild. For instance, she cites the evolutionary utility of eyes suited to panoramic vi- sion in prey species, as opposed to the hunting abilities endowed by frontally placed eyes in predator species (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 40-41; Grandin 2006, 168). Perhaps even more significantly, she frames the evolutionary de- velopment of consciousness itself in terms of predator-prey symbiosis: "the orienting response is the beginning of consciousness, because the animal has to make a conscious decision about what to do about that sound. If he's a prey animal, should he run? If he's a predator, does he need to chase some- thing? A predator might need to flee, too, of course, so a predator actually has two decisions to make" (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 49)- However, again it is important to note that the pervasiveness of this conceptual apparatus in Grandins work is not tantamount to a wholesale evolutionary determin- ism: perhaps the best example of Grandins precision on this score is the fact that she assigns no special ontological significance to the sensory affinities between autistic people and prey animals: she certainly does not argue that the possession of prey animal characteristics renders autistics into prey, or that autistics have such characteristics because they are prey. Instead, she frames the affinities autistics share with prey species like cattle- "thinking in pictures' instead of language, extreme sensory awareness and sensitivity, thinking in visual details instead of abstract generalizations, to name a few of her examples- in terms of mutations in the brain structures of autistic people, which she writes at length about, comparing them to wiring and processing problems in a computer. It is when the discussion of predator-prey symbiosis turns away from humans and animals in general and toward the factory farm that Grandins emphasis upon predator and prey roles in the symbiotic scene seems to acquire a more determinist and essentialist bent. To illustrate the shift, I will juxtapose Grandins comments on the prédation of dogs with her discus- sion of human food choice, which are both found in Animals in Translation. Interestingly, in the former case, Grandin uses a dog's understanding of what constitutes "food" as an exemplar for the innumerable ways that animals are not locked into their instincts: "everything an animal does to act on his emotions, except for the fixed action pattern [in this case, how to make a</page><page sequence="10">178# "The Paradox of My Work" killing bite], is learned Strange as it may sound, a dog has to learn from other dogs that groundhogs are good to eat" (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 137). I cannot help but be reminded here of Derridas oft-cited assertion in his conversation with Jean-Luc Nancy, "'Eating Weir": "since one must eat in any case, . . . the question will come back to determining the best, most respectful, most grateful, and also most giving way of relating to the other and of relating the other to the self" (1995, 282, 281-82). We need to eat: this is the deterministic element of symbiosis for both Derrida and Grandin. Yet the moment of potential intervention in modes of symbiosis, the nondetermin- istic moment, is the moment of deciding how- and evidently, to a certain extent, what- to eat. Formally, then, it would seem that Grandin articulates a model of symbiosis that leaves an opening for flexibility, even with regard to the specific predator-prey relations concerning who eats whom. Ostensibly, humans have to learn from other humans that factory farmed hogs are good to eat; the fact that we are physically equipped to eat meat does not lock us into eating factory-farmed meat any more than the dog s killing bite requires the dog to eat groundhogs. Yet in her discussion of human food choice, Grandin refrains from draw- ing such conclusions. Her negative physical experience with attempting vegetarianism in the past leads her to argue: So until someone proves otherwise I'm operating from the hypothesis that at least some people are genetically built so that they have to have meat to function. Even if that's not so, the fact that humans evolved as both plant and meat eaters means that the vast majority of human beings are going to continue to eat both. Humans are animals, too, and we do what our animal natures tell us to do. (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 180) Here, Grandin rhetorically suspends her prior distinction between the biological drive to eat (in some cases, the biological necessity to eat meat), and the socio-cultural decision concerning what to eat within those broad biological parameters, in favor of the vaguely determinist assertion that "we do what our animal natures tell us to do." Consequently, factory farming becomes more fait accompli, as well: "that means were going to continue to</page><page sequence="11">Jessica L. W. Carey • 179 have feedlots and slaughterhouses, so the question is: what should a humane feedlot and slaughterhouse be like?" (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 180). To be clear, this move does constitute quite the extension of her argument, since the number of animals processed at feedlots and factory farms far exceeds the number necessary to provide the required amount for "at least some people" who "need meat to function." Here, I am not condemning Grandin for resigning herself to the existence of large-scale farms as much as I am trying to trace how, for all of us, such acceptance relies upon a certain conceptual process of calcifying and essentializing our supposed roles in the predator- prey dynamic. I would further suggest that the very structure of the factory farm model reinforces this rigidity for us: we have eliminated the tenuousness of the predator-prey relationship in the wild, for on the factory farm we have en- sured that our prey- built to flee, by definition- can never escape; moreover, as predators, we no longer have to chase down our prey. Our role as ultimate predators is thus naturalized and finalized on the factory farm, but in a slippery way that also naturalizes a notion that we have attained a position entirely above prédation. Fully natural, yet fully separated from nature, we are now in an incontestable position to instrumentalize other animals and subject them to the prevailing economic apparatus. What does this consolidation imply about the claim that symbiosis between humans and food animals is mutualistic, benefiting all? In her dis- cussion of our genetic selection of farm animals, Grandin implies that the factory farming ethos does not necessarily match the symbiotic model that renders a level playing field of incidental selection pressures: instead, "when it comes to domestic animals, were the environment We create the selection pressures" (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 73). Significantly, Grandin implicitly distinguishes traditional forms of husbandry from factory farming practices in this regard, suggesting that "unconscious" selective breeding is often mu- tually beneficial for humans and animals, unlike the single-minded single- trait breeding that has become ubiquitous on factory farms, which produces what Grandin calls "warped evolution," full of unintended consequences that derail the thriving of animal populations (72, 77). We are the environment, or at least a key part of it, in any context of husbandry, but Grandin identifies as</page><page sequence="12">180 • "The Paradox of My Work" "natural"- and as usually more mutually beneficial- the situations in which "nobody was doing anything on purpose to affect the pigs' evolution" (80). If the factory farm is a site, then, of our thorough effort to exclude the incidental selection pressures that characterize mutualistic symbiosis in the wild, could Grandiris welfare reforms ever sufficiently transform the factory farm into a site of mutual benefit? Evidently, she fervently wishes to affirm this possibility: "people feed, shelter, and breed cattle and hogs, and in return the animals provide food and clothing" (Grandin 2006, 235). In this render- ing, mutualistic symbiosis is supposedly manifested in a kind of liberal con- tract-an almost desperate insistence that mutual benefit can be ensured, especially once the quality of feed, shelter, and treatment are brought up to snuff.9 Yet there is a conceptual slippage here: a welfare contract instituted at a deeply overdetermined site of human dominance is simply not the same as a relationship that can be defined as symbiotic according to the principles of evolution that we have been discussing. However, ultimately Grandin rhe- torically naturalizes the operation of the factory farm along such lines in her assertion that, "If I had a choice, I would rather go through a slaughter system than have my guts ripped out by coyotes or lions while I was still conscious" (2006, 235). Most of us may have a similar preference, but we should not overlook the consequences of making such a comparison: the factory farm is thereby naturalized as merely the latest- and perhaps "best"?- scene of interspecies symbiosis; moreover, a potential insight into the complicity be- tween this appropriation and the economic imperatives that condition the factory farm is foreclosed. Again, instead, through this particular figuration of symbiosis, our position is simultaneously naturalized as both safely above, and wholly ensconced within, the ecological scene, with the consequence that we are dually licensed to treat animals however we desire, despite Gran- diris insistence that we owe animals a certain type of treatment.10 In other words, to utterly control the lives and bodies of animals to our ends in a context of neoliberal instrumental rationality becomes, figurally speaking, an expression of our participation in the rhythms of nature. To be sure, throughout her books, Grandin links her welfare measures to the realization of increased economic efficiency and profit; for instance, she notes that "these methods not only benefit welfare but also increase</page><page sequence="13">Jessica L. W. Carey • 181 productivity and profit, improve meat quality, reduce illness, lower mortality rates, and prevent injuries to both animals and people" (Grandin and Deesing 2008, 1). I argue that, given her naturalization of the factory farm as a poten- tially symbiotic site, this link cannot be read solely as a politically strategic appeal to factory farm operators to adopt better welfare measures, even if it is wholly intended to be such. Instead, in the context of a naturalized appeal to symbiosis on the factory farm, the link between welfare and economic efficiency unavoidably also naturalizes- and goes some rhetorical distance toward immunizing from critique- the nonsymbiotic market-based logic that underwrites the farm. I would suspect that Grandin, committed as she so clearly is to the proj- ect of reforming the factory farm, does not intend to place the practice of intensive farming above reproach. Again, I emphasize that her work unfolds in necessary conjunction with extremely powerful conceptual and economic apparatuses that, I'm sure she would argue from a pragmatic standpoint, require some degree of negotiated compliance to effect any kind of transfor- mation at all. However, it is important to note that her work s complicity with a fairly conservative figure of symbiosis is supported by a similarly status-quo rendering of animal epistemology and of the ethical uses of sacrifice, both of which I can really only gesture toward in the remaining space here. Again, my primary intent is not to condemn Grandin for not being radical enough, but to illustrate how difficult it can be to identify what is really transformative in our fraught cultural reflections upon the human-animal relationship. In her assertions about the epistemologies held by animals, Grandin makes a compelling- and again, ambivalent- intervention on the subject of anthropomorphism. The ethics of anthropomorphic projection continue to be hotly debated in critical animal studies, which is a field that currently seems to be attempting to steer a middle course between the rock of naively assuming knowledge of animal epistemology on one hand, and the hard place of too rigidly denying the possibility of ever knowing anything about animal experience on the other. In general, I would suggest that many in the field are arriving at the conclusion that some form of human identification with other animals is ethically and even scientifically preferable to what evolutionary scientist Elliott Sober calls "anthropodenial" (2005); preferable,</page><page sequence="14">182 • "The Paradox of My Work" that is, in Matthew Calarco's estimation, as long as we "proceed agnostically and generously, as if we might have missed or misinterpreted the Others trace" (2009, 81). Such caution is surely necessary in the wake of continued anthropomorphic identifications, both within and beyond animal studies, that as Derrida says of Heidegger's theory of animal "world," "reintroduce the measure of man by the very route it claimed to be withdrawing from that measure" (Derrida 1989, 49). Theories of animal rights, for instance, tend to be premised upon the recognition of traits in other animals that are sufficiently similar to human traits to warrant our ethical consideration - thus doing little to dissect the supposed superiority of human traits. Grandins challenge to this well-worn model of anthropomorphism consists in her reestimation of "trait value" and in her emphasis upon epis- temologica! diversity in the human community- manifested through au- tism-that opens up new, seemingly more complex avenues of identification with other animals. Having been told that the act of thinking and the state of consciousness depend upon the capacity for language, Grandin strongly asserts that both animals and nonverbal humans do think; they merely think otherwise. For instance, since she claims to mentally engineer her inventions using only images, not words, she deems the necessity of lan- guage for tool-making "ridiculous" and argues that "differences between language-based thought and picture-based thought may explain why art- ists and accountants fail to understand each other. They are like apples and oranges" (2006, 11, 187). By representing the two kinds of thought as normatively recognized, abled persons- artists and accountants- Grandin rhetorically challenges, in normatively recognizable terms, the assumption that an epistemological difference in kind implies a value-differentiated hierarchy. This type of re-valuation paves the way for her assertion that "as a person with autism, I do not feel offended when I compare myself to an animal. In some ways animals such as cattle or dogs have traits that are to be greatly admired" (2006, 203). Asserting epistemological equity from another angle- and echoing Derridas contention that the "possibilities or necessities [of trace, iterability and différance ], without which there would be no language, are themselves not only human (Derrida 1995, 285)- Gran- din suggests that the primacy of language is also undermined if we realize</page><page sequence="15">Jessica L. W. Carey • 183 that forms of language exist beyond the human species barrier (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 272-76). Clearly, Grandin is interested in promoting a kind of species humility for humans, whose epistemological hierarchies she has experienced as narrow and oppressive. Where do I see, then, the hierarchy of human-animal epistemology reemerge in Grandins work- the reentry of the "measure of man through the back door? Here it is necessary to read more closely the epistemological differences Grandin outlines between "normal" human brains and those of animals. Animals "see everything and they react to everything," and in fact "are controlled by what they see" (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 26, 17), because animals- and to varying extents, Grandin asserts, autistic people- have "hy- pervigilant senses" (Grandin 2006, 169), extreme sensory perception (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 57), and a detail-based, rather than concept-based, form of perception: "animals and autistic people don't see their ideas of things; they see the actual things themselves. We see the details that make up the world, while normal people blur all those details together into their general concept of the world" (30).11 Whereas Grandin figures animal and autistic brains as having an inescapably unmediated perceptive relationship with the world, "normal" brains cannot escape mediation in their mode of perception: "a normal persons brain uses the detailed raw data of the world to form a generalized concept or schema, and that s what reaches consciousness. . . . they can't consciously experience the raw data, only the schema their brains create out of the raw data" (65). In other words, Grandin tends to figure the difference in perception between normal humans and animals as a differ- ence in kind- despite arriving at this conclusion through a number of differ- ences in degree: animals are simply more vigilant than normal humans, see and hear more stimuli, appear to prioritize details in the environment, and have "smaller and less developed" frontal lobes, not necessarily non-existent ones (52). Ultimately, though, in Grandin's account of brain evolution, she rhetorically reinstitutes a difference in kind along species lines: "so you have your lizard brain to breathe and sleep, your dog brain to form wolf packs, and your human brain to write books about it" (54). To illustrate the stakes of Grandins appeal to this kind of age-old dif- ference in kind - again, despite her own references to differences in degree</page><page sequence="16">184# "The Paradox of My Work" between human and animal brains, and despite her call for redistributing value across differences in kind- I want to make an impossibly brief refer- ence to Heidegger's notorious theorization of human and animal "worlds" in his 1929-1930 lectures. In a manner intriguingly akin to Grandiris model, Heidegger argues that an animals orientation to its world is one of com- plete, unreflexive immersion- a "poverty in world" determined by "being held captive to the disinhibiting ring" of stimuli- whereas human Dasein is constituted by being "world-forming," or having the capacity to apprehend objects and beings in its surroundings as such (1995, 269). Despite Heidegger's intention to rethink the species hierarchy in his analysis of animal life - "which possesses a wealth of openness with which the human world may have nothing to compare"- it is often agreed that he was unable to shake humanist prejudice, and not simply because he used words like "poverty" to describe animal life (255). As I mention above, Derrida argues that Heidegger "reintroduce [s] the measure of man" in a fundamental way; ironically enough- though perhaps not so ironic if we have a sense of the endemic epistemologica! abuses of anthropomorphism throughout history- vis-à-vis the link Heidegger forges between human and animal experience. It is a link that expresses a relative privation, as Derrida points out; and the source of this privation seems to lie, to cite Giorgio Agamben s succinct summation of Daseins profound bore- dom, in the fact that "Dasein is simply an animal that has learned to become bored; it has awakened from its own captivation to its own captivation" (2004, 70). On one hand, like an animal, a human being can experience a form of captivation to its environment. On the other, the human form of captivation operates in what Leonard Lawlor might call "staggered analogy" with the captivation of the animal: resulting from a stage of development figured as succeeding or exceeding the animal form of captivation, the human form of captivation is figured as being of a second order (2007). Fundamentally, the animal is not just different, but deprived. Of course, those familiar with Grandin's work undoubtedly will have noticed that she situates autistic perception at the border of the supposed difference in kind between normal human and animal modes of perception: Grandin makes the highly provocative claim that "autism is a kind of way</page><page sequence="17">Jessica L. W. Carey • 185 station on the road from animals to humans," and later reiterates, "autistic people s frontal lobes almost never work as well as normal peoples do, so our brain function ends up being somewhere in between human and animal. . . . Autistic people are closer to animals than normal people are (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 6, 57). Such claims are likely to be offensive to those who hold a hierarchical appreciation of humans and animals, but for the moment I am more interested in the implications of such statements for the supposedly nonhierarchical, nonspeciesist context that Grandin seems to be striving to articulate. Grandin hardly ascribes higher worth to normal human percep- tion when describing it, often figuring it as a kind of conceptual prison of inattentional blindness.12 To bring home the analogy with Heidegger, however, a form of humanist teleology survives in Grandin s model in the way she figures the relation of the difference in kind between "normal" human perception and that of animals. Because her model of epistemologica! difference is based in the evolution- ary narrative of brain development I cite above, wherein the "human" part of the brain has been added to the conserved "dog" and "lizard" parts, the implied figure of privation for the animal brain endures beyond subsequent efforts to redistribute epistemologica! value. Consequently, too, here we can see why Grandin's situation of autistic perception as "between" that of ani- mals and normal humans ultimately fails to initiate an interspecies model of reappraised epistemological diversity comprised of innumerable differences of degree: her evolutionary narrative of species difference casts the radical potential of autistic perception as an epistemological anomaly- one that doesn't necessarily upend our concepts of normal human and animal worlds. In the context of factory farming that is my focus here, the subtle human- ist teleology of such an account- in combination with the reinscribed episte- mological binary between normal humans and other animals, and the utter certainty with which Grandin assumes knowledge of animal minds- elides, so far, the radical potential in Grandin's work for conceiving animal worlds otherwise. Because in her model she is able to assume that cows, for instance, have a kind of immediate and nonconceptual relation to the world, she can rest in the assumption that improving animal welfare is the only necessary change in our factory farming operations: "what I have observed over the</page><page sequence="18">186# "The Paradox of My Work" years and at many meat plants is that the things that frighten cattle usually have nothing to do with death. It is the little things that make them balk and refuse to move . . ." (Grandin 2006, 167). She reiterates this conclusion at several points, asserting, "I have learned not to fear death and have accepted my own mortality. This has enabled me to look at slaughtering objectively and perceive it the way the cattle do" (94). Here, Grandin's unproblematized anthropomorphic identification with cows, coupled with her conclusions about their frontal lobes and abilities to form concepts, lead her quite com- fortably to presume that animal epistemology has "nothing to do with death" except when the disinhibitors at hand immediately suggest it. She writes: "I have seen Holstein steers bellowing to penmates that were departing in a truck. The cattle that were left behind watched as their fat penmates walked up the ramp to get on the truck that would take them to Burgerland The nice feedlot manager was worried that his cattle knew they were going to die. They had no way of knowing this; they just didn't like being separated from their buddies" (195). This passage provides a clear sense of the epistemo- logica! presumptions and assumed certainties that are necessary to render this scene in such an untroubled manner. Because the cattle are assumed to lack a normal humans concept of death (and most other concepts), animal welfare becomes measurable in atomized moments of calm behavior; larger questions about the ethics of engineering and controlling vast populations of living beings are simply rendered irrelevant- conveniently enough for the economic apparatus, and for those of us who do not wish to interrogate the operation of "Burgerland." To further illustrate the epistemological assump- tions of this particular passage, note that we are not called upon to question the potential ethical significance of observed separation anxiety in the cattle: What of the possibility, for instance, that for "prey animals," an orientation toward death might be inextricably bound up with fear of separation from the group? Or, what of the innumerable other unheard-of relations that make up an animal s world, and all of their possible ethical implications? It seems that if we can rule out the animals immediate fear of death, conceived in human terms, then we can consider our hands clean. At this point, I must all too quickly round out the picture I am sketching here of Grandin's somewhat conservative rendering of the factory farm, by</page><page sequence="19">Jessica L. W. Carey • 187 mentioning the crucial role played in her account by the logic of sacrifice. If symbiosis and "worlding" are Grandins favored epistemologica! frameworks for explaining the human-animal relation, then the logic of sacrifice is her preferred normative and prescriptive apparatus. In Thinking in Pictures , she advocates for an explicit performance of sacrificial ritual at the factory slaughterhouse: "I believe that the place where an animal dies is a sacred one. There is a need to bring ritual into the conventional slaughter plants and use it as a means to shape people's behavior. It would help prevent people from becoming numbed, callous, or cruel. The ritual could be something very simple, such as a moment of silence" (2006, 239). On one hand, I can understand Grandins nostalgia for a sacrificial orientation to the animals we plan to eat: in response to the poorest welfare conditions imaginable- which are the side effect of an economic apparatus that is driven to accumulate ever-higher quantities of product, regardless of quality and regardless of the number of disposable casualties that are also produced- sacrifice easily comes to signify an alternative that would imbue the scene with a much- needed reverence for animal life. Yet on the other hand, appealing to the deeply humanist institution of sacrifice to counter the abuses of neoliberal logics of disposability is not the transformative move it may seem to be. In one of the few critical articles yet published on Grandins work, Kari Weil argues as much when she reminds us that "it must be remembered, however, that in all this breakdown of boundaries among human, machine, and animal [in Grandins work], what remains unaffected is the sacrificial structure that violently reestablishes those boundaries at the moment they appear to be effaced. It is, of course, the animal alone who dies or at least perishes" (2006, 92). Indeed, it is a strange form of value that can only be ascribed to the animal in and through the act of killing and consuming it. Of course, Derrida argues that the strangeness of this supposed "animal value" has to do with the fact that it is not meant for animals after all: that we use the apparatus of sacrifice to produce this form of value only to appropriate it to ourselves. So significant is this source of human value, Derrida argues, that "in our culture, carnivorous sacrifice is fundamental, dominant, regulated by the highest industrial technology . . . carnivorous sacrifice is essential to the structure of subjectivity . . . [and is]</page><page sequence="20">188 • "The Paradox of My Work" at the basis of our culture and our law" (2002, 247). If sacrifice endows the animal with value only to immediately reappropriate that value for human ends, I would suggest that it carries more potential to work in tandem with the economic imperatives of accumulation through dispossession that are in effect at the factory farm, than it does to ethically "save" the animals from such an operation. What I glean from this brief tour of Grandins cultural testimony is a sharper sense of the necessity of carefully parsing the premises and narra- tives of popular work on animals by writers like Grandin. In Cary Wolfe s recent book What is Posthumanism ?, he argues that he is "less concerned with evaluating Grandins assessment of her own case and its broader im- plications-an assessment that is often problematic, in my view- than with mobilizing her observations about her experience toward my own critical ends" (2010, 128). I certainly do not fault this theoretical approach, which for Wolfe results in the suggestion "that Grandins example of the relationship between disability and trans-species affinity directs us toward the possibility of taking up [a project] . . . that runs directly counter to the liberal model of the subject as above all a creature of volition, autonomy, and agency" (139). Although it is absolutely crucial to identify the posthumanist and/or trans- formative possibilities in work that does not necessarily advocate for those possibilities in a straightforward way, I argue that it is also vital to critically trace how such work functions as cultural testimony in its own sphere of bestselling rhetoric. In what specific ways do these narratives rupture or re- main complicit with prevailing cultural logics? And what do these particular challenges and conservatisms say about current cultural attitudes toward food animals- attitudes which are undoubtedly more complex than we often presume them to be?13 The stakes of such a line of inquiry, for both food animals and for the field of critical animal studies, are high. - &gt;</page><page sequence="21">Jessica L. W. Carey • 189 NOTES ì. Here I am attempting to historicize Grandin in a manner at least partly inspired by Ian Baucom's careful articulation of what it means to read dialectically between the general culture and the particular text in Specters of the Atlantic: "historicism must be understood not only as a means of accounting for phenomena by situating them within their moment and as a mode of constructing moments that account for phenomena, but also as a genre that typicalizes phenomena as exemplary representatives of their moments by deducing moments from a range of always- already typical phenomena" (2005, 45)- 2. All italics are original to sources unless noted. 3. Although the phenomena of disposable labor and disposable populations are analyzed in much criticism on the topic of neoliberalism, I get the particular figure of "disposability" from Henry Giroux's work on neoliberalism; for example, see Giroux (2006). He describes "the new biopolitics of disposability" : "the central commitment of the new hyper-neoliberalism is now organized around the best way to remove or make invisible those individuals and groups who are either seen as a drain or stand in the way of market freedoms, free trade, consumerism, and the neoconservative dream of an American empire" (2006, 175). 4. Both u(loi)n and "[but]" are present in the original text. 5. The endurance of this facet of our common sense remains to be seen in the ongoing fallout of the current global financial crisis. I would register, though, that at least for the moment, it seems that popular discontent continues to be represented in the media, at least, as being directed at "bad apple" banks and politicians, rather than toward a widespread interrogation of the neoliberal market principle itself. 6. To cite only two examples, see Donna Haraway's work, specifically her contention that humans and dogs "make each other up, in the flesh" (2003, 2-3), and H. Peter Steeves's comment in Animal Others that "even the body is many. Thousands of parasites make their home on my body; yet even to say that they are on my body is problematic. They partially constitute this body; we share it and we are it" (1999, 7). 7. Although it is safe to say that frameworks of human exception are also in play at sites of traditional husbandry (pre-twentieth-century family farms, for instance), it is also true that traditional farms keep in closer rhythm with the nonhuman environment, mostly because doing is proven to encourage the most health and productivity for all involved- plants, humans, and other animals. I am suggesting that something more extreme happens on the factory farm, something makes it possible to ignore principles of ecology and symbiosis altogether. 8. Although Grandin more or less steers clear of many of the deterministic pitfalls of evolutionary psychology, we should remain vigilant in our own reading on this score, if only because the discipline is so seductively concerned with what Barbara Herrnstein- Smith calls "the unusually preemptive nature of its claims" (130): for instance, "the unremittingly purposive, rational idiom of evolutionary psychology: genes for,'</page><page sequence="22">190 • "The Paradox of My Work" 'designed for,' natural selection as the ever-ingenious engineer' of fitness optimizing 'devices' and so forth" (2005, 138). For a writer who does regularly commit such errors, see Michael Pollan's widely read, New York Times bestselling The Omnivores Dilemma (2006). For example: "in fact it makes just as much sense to regard agriculture as a brilliant (if unconscious) evolutionary strategy on the part of the plants and animals involved to get us to advance their interests" (23); and later: "corn completely threw its lot in with humanity when it evolved its peculiar husked ear. ... So far, this reckless- seeming act of evolutionary faith in us has been richly rewarded" (27). The error here might be primarily rhetorical rather than strictly logical, since I (generously) suspect that such comments are more than a little bit tongue-in-cheek, but I also suspect his caveat "(if unconscious)" may lose rhetorical force given the seductiveness of the overall descriptions. 9. In fact, Grandin (2006, 235) explicitly "adds" the notion of symbiosis to a theory of "the ancient contract" articulated by Stephen Budiansky in U.S. News and World Report (1989). The article in question presents on its own a rather rosy amalgam of evolutionary symbiosis theory and humanist species paternalism: "The animals that come under man's care are following out their evolutionary destiny- and are flourishing as a consequence" (79). 10. See, for instance, the "Stairway to Heaven" chapter of Thinking in Pictures: "We owe it to the animals to give them decent living conditions and a painless death" (Grandin 2006, 235). 11. Here we also see one of many examples in Grandin's work of the utter certainty with which she conceptually separates "ideology" from "reality." In Animals in Translation, she delivers a screed against those who would "overabstractify" animals (Grandin and Johnson 2005, 29), quite rightly and beneficially arguing of abstract welfare standards that they tend to be focused on " inputs , such as maintenance schedules, employee training records, and equipment design problems, instead of outputs, which is how the animals are actually doing" (269). Her frustrated response to this phenomenon is that "I don't care about floors. I care about cows. Are they falling down? That's all I need to know" (269). Yet because she does not point to the ways that the "reality" she cites is also ideological, in both its structural conditions and her perception and theorization of it, it is crucial that we continue to explicitly draw out her ideology of animal and human worlds so that we may better understand its material and ethical consequences. 12. See, for instance, Grandin and Johnson (2005, 51-52). 13. I am reminded, for instance, of a colleague's comment after I delivered a paper on Temple Grandin's work at a conference in 2009: she related that after reading Grandin's books, she felt justified in continuing to eat meat. To my mind, compelling and fascinating lines of ethical and cultural inquiry open up when Grandin- an author who is considered one of the top animal advocates in the world- rhetorically inspires such conclusions in her readers.</page><page sequence="23">Jessica L.
