RANDOLPH Clyde Connell is a phenomenon, not just because of the interesting and provocative nature of her sculpture, but also because she came into her full creative powers late in her sixties, sustained them during her seventies, and displays no signs of waning in her mid eighties. The occasiopal prodigy aside, clearly the typical pat- tern is for artists to find their voices or signatures much earlier, closer to the mid-point of life.' And once finding them, much of their subsequent work life is dedicated to exploring ways to refine and strengthen their work, bringing into it still more profound levels of expression. Connell is doing that now. Connell's first important one-woman show opened at the Tyler (Texas) Museum of Art in 1979. The ex- perience of it was profound. Indeed, to wander through an exhibit of her work is to feel in the presence of ancient religious artifacts that have been transmuted into an art that is relevant to the modern world. This spiritual quality is heightened when the artist is pres- ent. A diminutive, white-haired woman, her straight back and disproportionally large hands are the only physical evidence that she herself might have con- structed the imposing pieces of sculpture. She was born Clyde Dixon in 1901 on a cotton plan- tation in Belcher, Louisiana, and family myth has it that her third-generation American parents named her for the Scottish river. The eldest of nine children, she has lived almost all of her life in the northeast area of Louisiana, around Shreveport. Clyde grew up in a time and place of persistent ra- cial tensions. Her mother was a proper, somewhat dis- tant, Scotch-Irish lady who declined even to shake hands with arriving or departing guests. Her black nurse, Susan, who had been her grandmother's maid, was the opposite: warm, loving, and physical. Susan died when Clyde was still small, and the sculptor, it seems, transferred the respect and affection she had for this surrogate mother to her black neighbors. On Sundays she preferred the rhythmic music of the black congregation to the solemn services at the Presbyte- rian Church her family attended. This racial split in her early childcare has had an enormous impact on her life. She tells two remarkable tales2: In 1968, while sitting in her car at a filling station, she clearly heard a sound, and she says that she knew instantly that "that was it"-that was what she wanted embedded in her art. The sound was that of her black nurse 65 years earlier moaning and chanting in a deep, grief-stricken tone as they walked together in the woods. It was a sound not completely understood by a three-year-old, but one she later grew to know meant a lynching had just occurred. The second tale also deals with a sound from her plantation childhood-the sound of horses' hooves run- ning over a wooden bridge. The sound struck terror in her heart as it usually meant white men were cross- ing the bridge to the black section of the plantation. When the children heard that sound, particularly at night, they knew that a lynching or some act of vi- olence would most likely occur. Although she never actually witnessed a lynching, she recalls vividly a time when, after hearing horses' hooves, she and her brothers and sisters wandered along a secret path they had made in the woods to where the blacks lived. They saw before them "a tall, dark, lean young man with chains all over him stretched out on a porch. He was gasping for breath and his chest seemed to form a cavity." To her parents, Clyde Connell is indebted for making her aware of the world beyond northeast Louisiana, for stimulating her intellectual curiosity, and for in- troducing her to the world of art. She looked forward to the discussions that occurred regularly at the fam- ily's evening meals. Often topics were prearranged and everyone was expected to participate. She knew there were artists in the family: A portrait in their home of a woman with a plumed hat and a falcon on her arm painted by her Scottish paternal grandmother had fascinated her since earliest childhood. She was for- tunate in having had a sensitive first grade teacher who offered music and art in the one-room school she attended. Her interest in art persisted all through her school years. In 1918 she enrolled at Breneau College, Gainesville, Georgia, where she took several art courses. She left in 1920 after what she believed was an unproductive two years. Within two years she had married Thomas Dixon Connell, whom she called T.D. over their more than 60 years of marriage. It was not until the mid-1920s and after the births of their three children3 that Con- nell began, in her words, "a serious study of art." She quickly absorbed all the education that a relatively small city like Shreveport had to offer at the time and</page><page sequence="3">Woman's Art Journal 31 then turned to a broad-ranging and life-long study of art books, magazines, and catalogues. From 1930 to 1950 Connell worked as a volunteer at a Presbyterian church school for black children. This led to her becoming involved in civil rights strug- gles, despite considerable criticism from members of her family and the community. She vividly recalls "night-riders" circling the schoolhouse determined to frighten and intimidate her and the children. To help ease the terror during one of these living nightmares, she conjured up the sounds of the "swamp orchestra," sounds of night herons, owls, frogs, cicadas, crickets, and the winds that characterize the Louisiana night. Years later, in the late 1960s, through intricate cal- ligraphic notations, she visually recorded this night music, calling what is close to automatic writing on large rolls of brown paper her Swamp Songs. In 1949 T.D. Connell became the resident superin- tendent of the Cado Parish Penal Farm, and for the next nine years Clyde helped her husband supervise this minimum risk facility. She also studied, from 1950 to 1955, at the Louisiana State Museum at Shreveport. Her paintings during this period were primarily fig- urative. In 1954, through her work on behalf of the Presbyterian Church Council, she began regular, semi- annual trips to New York City, precisely at the height of the abstract expressionist movement. "I really think that my art education began with visits to the Museum of Modern Art and certain New York galleries," she Fig. 1.

The art she encountered-Pollock, de Kooning, Kline, and the eccentric artist Frederick Keisler were her favorites-irreversibly altered her painting from representational studies to abstract forms, although some reference to nature always remained. She began to work with collage, painting with obvious brush strokes on colored paper which she tore and glued to canvas. One series of collages she called her Sun Path Series, another she titled Lake Verticals. In 1954 she joined with three other Shreveport art- ists, Flora DuVal, David Middleton, and Jack Beard, to form The Contemporary Art Group. A year later, in an exhibit at the Louisiana State Museum, they introduced abstract art to Shreveport. During this pe- riod her work was accepted in juried shows, mostly in the South and Southwest, and she began to gain recognition and win awards. The next major transformation in her work began with her husband's retirement in 1959 and their sub- sequent move to Lake Bistineau, some 30 miles from Shreveport. The lake is surrounded by dense woods, the trees draped with Spanish moss and entwined with rattan and vine. The cypress trees and their "dwarfed knees," which stand in and along the water's edge, summon connections to prehistoric swamps and the amphibian process. The total ambience, which often seems forbidding to strangers to the region, remains for Connell a familiar and variegated universe where the visible and audible processes of nature never cease. At this time her life began "to idle down, down to the essences. I would walk outdoors and feel part of a presence that's in nature." She also began reflecting on the southern writers with whom she was familiar and wondering why it was that they found their creative voices at home while most southern visual artists did not. Gradually she began to establish what she felt the writers had so clearly attained-a means of expression that flowed from her immediate relationship to her own sur- roundings. Her collages began to take on new dimensions. They were becoming layered and concerned with bringing viscera to the surface. As she began using heavier and heavier materials, from weighted paper to wood and found objects, she abandoned canvas for wooden bases. "By 1963, the urge to surround the house with sculpture became so strong that I began to experiment in three dimensions." These experiments marked the most significant change in her work to date. "After six years at Bistineau, I became part of the region," she recalls. From closely observing how dirt daubers, paper wasps, moths, and other creatures formed their habitats, Connell developed her own system of build- ing and binding to create a place for the spirits and the sounds of her life. Indeed, she "was creating a new habitat." Today her personal collection fills her modest cement-block and glass studio-home as well as the surrounding grounds which gently slope down from the edge of the woods to the lake and pier that are her front yard. The free-standing sculptures appear to have been placed by nature and not by design. Connell's first constructions were simple, free-stand- ing verticals which she called Totems or Earth Sculp- tures. They were assembled from lumber left over from the building of her present home and studio. Standing</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2.

She attached found objects to them, as she had to her collages, and gave them an outer covering of what she refers to as "skin," a papier mach6-like mixture she concocted of macerated newspaper, brown paper, and Elmer's glue. These were followed by her Families Series, in which she used, for the first time, the cedar and cypress so abundant in her environment. The anthropomorphic figures are placed together, usually in groups of three-typically mother, father, and child. They stand about six feet tall and are very slender, about eight to ten inches in diameter. Connell uses the bark-stripped skeletons of the wood. She ties the joints together and then binds them with her skin concoction. The skin hardens to form an outer covering similar in color to Spanish moss and textured like stone. Frequently, before applying the skin, she hammers into the pieces hundreds of nails. The nails, if used alone on a totemic piece, make the sculpture almost indistinguishable from the nearby hackberry trees. More often the nails support stones, chains, gears, gaskets, or other old iron pieces she has gath- ered over the years. This rusted rural archaeology lines a wood fence that runs along one whole side of the property. On the ground below rests her collection of stones, all waiting for just the right place. The chains, she points out, are not just evidence of restraints placed on people and animals: they also contain traces of labor. The rust of the nails and many of the iron pieces bleeds through the skin of her sculptured forms, enhancing the color and adding a dimension of time, of erosion. A group of work she calls Posts and Gates was started in 1969. The Posts refer to the ways in which Connell saw her society perceive and use black people; she gave them titles like non-people post, non-person woman, and non-person man. The Posts are very much like the earlier Totems, the distinction being that they were, as their titles suggest, more individualized in their content. (In 1981 she did another series of posts, which she called Sound Posts.) Gates of various sorts are ubiquitous on southern plantations. It is not surprising, then, that as images they figure significantly in Connell's art, except that for her, gates are seen not as enclosures but as occa- sions for passage. Gate of the South Wind (1972; 751/2" x 28" x 20") is part of the collection of Louisiana State University, Alexandria, where it was first exhibited in a show entitled "Posts and Gates" (1973). Made from cedar, Gate of the South Wind stands vertical, is symmetrical, and is covered with skin like the Posts; however, it is open like a four-sided ladder. A chain hangs from its center and large abstract hands, which seem to hold the piece together, are formed with flat stones in relief at the crosspieces. Larger than the Totems, Families, and Gates, but similar in material and structure, are the Guardians from the mid- to late 1970s. Brown Guardian (1976; Fig. 1) is a fine example of these silent sentinels, others of which are called Heart Guardian and Gray Guardian. Half woman, half tree guardian, Brown Guardian is distinguished by the attachment of iron pieces to signify face, breasts, and navel; embedded chains further define the body. The many nails ham-</page><page sequence="5">Woman's Art Journal 33 mered to hold the iron pieces before the outer covering was added give this guardian a beautifully textured, rusted surface. The pieces in the Habitat Series (1977-79), like the Posts, Guardians, and Gates, are "tall, dark, and lean," but they have another dimension: they all con- tain hollowed-out spaces that serve as altars or resting places. In Vine Habitat (1977; Fig. 2), which is con- structed of cedar and cypress and bound with skin, a rattan vine is woven up pyramid-shaped steps. A bird-size resting place is hollowed out near the top. It is in this space that we are invited to project our spir- its, rest our souls, or perhaps recall the heaving chest of a "tall, dark, lean young man" stretched out on a porch. Expressive of just this feeling, she titled one of the works in this series Inner Place Habitat. As Connell explains, "My art evolves from some- thing I'm working on." The earlier archetypes continue to combine with the recently invented. Rain Place (1978; Fig. 3), for example, is a wide ladder with three small habitats placed on an open shelf close to the top, each of which contains a stone. An open-work rattan "curtain" cascades down the ladder evoking running water; the entire piece is covered with her skin concoction. Some of her work, in title and construction, is rem- iniscent of that of the American Indian. One, Stone Place (1980; 52" x 44" x 39"), is a teepee-like, iron mesh, skin-covered hut, in front of which are placed a stone altar and rattan strips, as though awaiting shaman and ritual. Another, Trail Marker (1980; 35" x 20" x 58"), displays the same kind of ceremonial expecta- tions. A skin-covered, rattan structure, it appears to guard a long line of stones and rattan sticks. (Both works are in the artist's collection.) Connell has not studied Indian culture or been influenced by the objects they create; rather, it seems that since her move to Lake Bistineau she has naturally followed a similar path and felt similar presences. Like the Indians, she feels close to the land and has observed: "Unless some change is made the people of this earth won't know what it means to live close to nature." By the mid-1970s Connell had formed her basic vo- cabulary. Her subsequent work has continued the ear- lier techniques and themes, but has shown a significant refinement of craft and an increased com- plexity in form and content. This is abundantly clear in the magnificent Dialogue Gate (1981; see cover), a cypress construction covered in part with skin and, at 84" x 74" x 63" a commanding presence in the art- ist's collection. Composed of platforms and ladders, it is more architectonic than her earlier works. Indeed, it recalls some of the structures of the early-20th-cen- tury Russian Constructivists. Yet there is the poetry and delicacy that marks all Connell's work. On top of a high platform Connell has placed a large, smooth stone. The ladder leaning against the platform seems to pay homage to the stone. The ladder and stone forms are repeated at the base of the structure. The skin-covered platform is the color of eroded metal while the ladder forms retain their natural redness. Despite its visual strength, the piece is fragile and not built for climbing. The ladder forms are called upon again in the Wind Ladder Series, also from 1981. Connell's fascination with architecture continues. Fig. 4.

Following a trip to the Melrose Plantation in Natchi- toches, Louisiana, in early 1984, she reacted: "When I saw that building [the slave-built African House] yesterday, built two hundred and fifty years ago, I saw three pieces of wood or beams going up to a tri- angle, but it was the pink clay between them that will become part of what I'm doing." She continues to think in architectural metaphors, with works titled Wind Ladders, Thresholds, Meditation Benches, Walk Throughs, and Gates of Communication, several of which invite participation. One can sit on the benches, walk through the gates, or tap on her stones to create sound. Communication Piece (1982; Fig. 4), for example, is a wide, skin-covered trestle. Hanging from the top crossboard are six vertical pieces, each of which is embellished with a series of crosspieces and two flat stones near top and bottom. A single board with rungs that leans against the structure echoes the ladder in Dialogue Gate. Here the evolving aspect of her art is reflected in the introduction of moveable parts that can create sound. When the stones are tapped with a stick, explains the artist, the resultant vibrations are "reminiscent of many different rituals and com- munication devices." Clyde Connell has achieved an integration of the modernist language into an art form that, like the southern literature she so admires, contains life expe- riences from a specific time and place. Her age often causes people to dismiss her and her work, denying larger audiences the extraordinary accomplishments of this already substantial body of work. But Connell is a serious and original artist whose contributions, noted critic Kim Levin, are "worthy sisters to the work of Nevelson and Bourgeois."4 In 1981 she had her first one-person exhibition in i I</page><page sequence="6">34 Woman's Art Journal New York at the Clock Tower Gallery, largely due to the efforts of Texas sculptor James Surls and the Clock Tower's willingness to give regional artists exposure in New York. In 1984 she had another New York ex- hibition, this time at the Delahunty Gallery (presently the Carpenter &amp; Hochman Gallery of Dallas and New York). In 1985 she was one of six women honored by the Women's Caucus for Art at their national meetings in Los Angeles. Several days after that conference T.D. Connell, her husband of more than 60 years, died. Clyde Connell's life and her work form a continuous strand that weaves her world, a world of social con- science, nature, sound, and rich human relationships into another world, a spiritual world that she invites us to join. Hers is an art that appears timeless, simul- taneously evoking the ancient and the modern without being exhausted by either. It is an art that brings us to an understanding of a stranger's home while deep- ening our understanding of our own. 0 cs - L X s __ C U -0 V I vi I A % 1.
