<plain_text><page sequence="1">* NEW LIGHT ON THE VEDIC GOD- BY Dr. R. N. Dandekar, M.A., Ph.D. There has been a considerable difference of opinion, among vedic scholars, regarding the exact interpretation of the personality of the vedic god, This fact naturally enhances our interest in the study of the vedic mythology concerning that god. A ciritical approach to the problem about the essential nature of is expected to greatly clarify our views in the matter of indo-germanic mythology in general and vedic mytho- logy in particular. Oldenberg is strongly of the opinion ( Religion des Veda ) that the conception underlying the god cannot, under any circumstances, be taken back into the indo-germanic period. *TÍŠT5[ is comparatively a younger member of the vedic pantheon ; this fact is amply corroborated by the very name of that god, i. e. which is directly derived from the vedic root ( to stimulate, to vivify ), as well as by the manner in which that god has actually come into being. The genesis of indicates clearly, according to Oldenberg, a very late phase in the evolu- tion of vedic religious thought. The earlier and more important gods of the 1$V, like fàsr, etc., are mainly the personi- fications of natural phenomena. In the descriptions of these gods, the naturalistic element often becomes quite apparent. They consequently possess a sort of 4 concreteness 9 about their nature and character. A natural step further in the evolution of the religious thought was to go from the external concrete form of natural phenomena to the inner abstract spirit, which was supposed to be working behind those phenomena. The most outstanding characteristic of the whole universal life is the manifold form of * motion ' or 4 movement ' ( Bewegung ), which is clearly perceptible everywhere. Every phenomenon of nature as well as every activity of human beings has some form * Paper read at the All India Oriental Conference, 10th Session, Tirupati. 11 [ Annals, B. O. B* I. ]</page><page sequence="2">294 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research institute of 4 movement ' involved in it : The sun rises and sets ; the go on their usual rounds ; the rivers flow ; men start working ; - all these happenings presuppose some kind of 4 stimulation ' ór 4 vivification ' from within. It is only as the result of that 4 stimulation ' that the whole world-order is kept eternally going. The physical fact of 1 movement ' and 4 motion ' thus, led logically to its spiritual counterpart of stimulation. It is this conception of 4 stimulation ' as the result of which the whole universal order is set into motion, that was deified in the later phase in the evolution of the vedic religious thought. A definite and. independent god came to be looked upon as mainly and exclusively responsible for this 4 stimulation 9 and that god was He was the 1 god stimulator ' The origin of therefore, belongs, according to Oldenberg, to a period when abstract conceptions were deified and added to the vedic pantheon : vrrrTr, even STSTiTÎà" are the other gods, who belong to this category. The grammatical aspect of the name also is quite unique. Here a present participle is made to represent a distinct vedic god as also in the case of qrčTT, %rïT etc. The vedic poet does not any longer restrict himself, while naming a god, to the physical function of that god, such as the 4 pervader 9 or the ' kindler 9 etc., but he now refers to the deeper spiritual function of that god. The god tfñrf is often described as stretching out his huge golden hands in order to 4 direct 9 and 4 stimulate ' movements in the world. Oldenberg further believes that the fact that is a later vedic god can be clearly proved by the consideration of the position of that god in vedic ritual, has no dedicated to him. At the beginning of big sacrifices, is honoured with the words, This position given to is positively an afterthought A place was specially made for since he did not have it in the original scheme of ancient vedic ritual. He was therefore glorified just at the beginning of the ritual. Oldenberg puts forth still another viewpoint regarding the nature of It was generally observed that the sun-god is mainly responsible for the most enormous movement in the universe and that all other movements are apparently dependent</page><page sequence="3">New Light on the Pedic God-^fà^ 295 upon him. Ultimately therefore the sun-god came to be regarded as the ' stimulator ' par excellence and the epithet, was, io many passages, employed with reference to This consequent- ly led to the usual misconception that was originally oonoeived of as being identical with Oldenberg has strongly - and as will be shown, in detail, later on, rightly - opposed this idea of the identification of these two vedic gods, and ( Z . D. M. G. Vol. LI ). In eleven entire hymns addressed to *rrer$, as well as in the several references made in the Veda to that god, the solar charaoter of that god is hardly brought forth with prominence. is, without doubt, associated in vedic hymns with ' light ' and ' splendour ' ( IV. 6. 2 : VI. 13. 2 : VII. 76. 1 ) ; he is said to stimulate splendour in the east ( X. 139. 1 ) ; he illumines the and ( I. 35. 9-11 ) ; he brings blessings to man, with all seasons, by day and in the night ( IV. 53. 7 ) 5 he is the father of ; indeed the whole hymn, V. 81., seems particularly to emphasise the sunlike character of But these references do not indicate, as may be shown later, the ' solar sources ' of the origin of The evidence against the identification of with is quite overwhelming. Oldenberg has thus arrived at three important conclusions regarding the nature of •* ( 1 ). The god belongs to a late phase in the evolution of vedic religious thought, - to a phase when abstract concep- tions came to be deified. íTÍlr^ represents an abstraction of the idea of ' stimulation ' ( 2 ). is, therefore, clearly a later addition to the pantheon of vedic gods. The study of the evolution of vedic mythology and the consideration of the position of in vedic ritual would corroborato this viewpoint. ( 3 ). The identification of and is a gross misconcep- tion. The ' essential * in the nature of ■HHtf is not the idea of the sun-god in general or of the sun-god in his particular aspect ; but the ' essential ' in his nature is definitely the abstraction of the idea of stimulation. As regards Oldenberg's first conclusion, it must be said that</page><page sequence="4">296 Annals of the Bkandarkar Oriental Research Institute there is abundant evidence to show that cannot be regarded merely as an ' abstraction-divinity ' The descriptions of ^isr&lt;£ in vedic hymns are so pictorial that one is definitely inclined to believe that the vedic poet must have thought of some ' concrete, personality ' as represented by that god. The RV describes as possessing golden arms ( I. 35. 9-10 : VI. 71. 1-5 : VII. 45. 2 ). He is broad-handed ( II. 38. 2 ) ; he has beautiful hands ( III. 33. 6 ) ; he wears a tawny garment ( IV. 35. 2 ) ; his omniform car is golden ( I, 35. 2-3-5 ) and it is driven by two radiant steeds ( I. 35. 2-5 ). irnhï raises aloft his two strong arms in order to bless all beings and set them working ( II. 38. 2 : VI. 71. 1 and 5 •* IV. 53. 4 ). He is once called 3TTÌ JTira; ( I. 22. 6 ). All these descriptions go to prove convincingly that the vedic poet thought of çrfèf as possessing a positively concrete persona- lity and not as representing merely an abstract conception. A comparison between the descriptions of on the one hand and the descriptions of purely abstract divinities like srrřTT, vrrcrr etc. on the other, will be very suggestive in this connection. As Max Müller has aptly observed, the vigour and brightness of ^rílrç significantly contrast against the pale and shadowy features of deities like 5Tïïr etc., which are included by Oldenberg in the same category as íTÍ%^. The latter divinities have no concrete personality behind them and so the personifica- tion of abstract conceptions represented by them is lifeless and unconvincing. The case of íTÍ%&lt;í, however, is quite different. There is considerable anthropomorphism to be seen in the personality of ; the activities of that god are described, by the vedic poets, from the human point of view. The vedic poets seem to have actually seen, with their divine poetic eye-STPÍ ^g-the majestic personality of raising aloft his huge golden hands in order to direct and set in motion the affairs of the world. Oldenberg further puts too much emphasis on the significance of the formula, mi often repeated at the beginning of the vedic ritual. He maintains that the fsct that is men- tioned just at the beginning of the ritual indicates that the place given to *TÍ%iT in vedic ritual is an afterthought and that the formula, brings forth prominently the nature of</page><page sequence="5">New Light on the Vedic God-* rf^[ 297 ^rř^í as representing the abstract conception of stimulation. But it must be remembered that that formula is often followed by the words, srrgvqr, çsnwm , which show that the whole formula is stereotyped and does not possess any definite significance of its own. On the other hand, un'ira is regularly referred to in WïrèïR and the mention is often made of the 4 3Tf ' dedicated to him. In the ctrftg 5rr§niï, the s^gs are associated with and are called his • The RV ( I. 110. 2-3 : I, 161. 11 ) describes the as living in the house of for twelve days. This latter reference clearly pre- supposes a definite persona] character of the vedic god is here undoubtedly the name of a distinct mythological personality, is again called smi^r in these RV passages ; flwor explains the word smriT as STíT^T. This implied connec- tion of with STri^r makes possibly a member of the ^^iï-3Tifçrq,-mythological circi 3. In ãrr%*hr %ÎÇrTF ( I. 1. 9 ), is associated with 4 fetters ' which fact again goes against his being merely an abstraction-divinity. On the whole, the position of *TR?ï in vedic ritual contrasted with that of sfictt, %rTT etc. proves conclusively that belongs to quite a different category from that of the latter divinities. The vedic ritualists, like vedic poets, looked upon Hnrç? as possessing a clearly concrete personality. The second conclusion of Oldanberg namely that is a later addition to the pantheon of vedic gods is based upon his first conclusion and must therefore needs fall to the ground with it. The conception of a god, who stimulates and directs the huge world-order cannot be said to be belonging exclusively to vedic mythology. It is to be met with in almost all indo- germanic religions. The evolution of indogermanic religious thought may be briefly stated as follows : It was first of all the infinite vastness of nature, which strongly impressed the mind of the indogermanic people, They deified this infinite vastness and glorified it in the divine form of ť Father itv - PTcrç- Jupiter. This may be regarded as one of the oldest religious conceptions of the indogermanic mythology. They later on came to realise that this infinitely vast nature was not an un- controlled chaos : The sun rises and sets punctually ; the rivers</page><page sequence="6">298 Annals of the Bhandarhar Oriental Research Institute flow in their well-defined currents ; the stars shine with un- disturbed regularity ; every activity in the universe was regula- ted in a perfect but inconceivable manner. All this must be due to a certain 4 law ' or 4 order 7 which works behind all the world phenomena. This gave rise to the abstract conception of ^rar -cosmic order - and its mythological counterpart, in RV, the sovereign-lord, ^raïêT, whose function it was to see that this 4 world-order 9 remains undisturbed and unbroken. The sover- eign-lord supervises, controls, and directs every 4movement' big or small, from the enormons daily rounds of the sun-god to the slightest winking of the eye in the case of an ordinary mortal. This conception too occurs predominantly in every ancient indogermanic mythology. The abstract idea of stimula- tion and its divine counterpart ^rRr&lt;ï, both of which are so closely related to the sr^n-^rT conceptions, need not therefore be regarded as belonging to a late phase in the evolution of vedic religious thought. Oldenberg has included in the category of ^TTrTi, etc. which latter are obviously later creations of the vedic poets. The very fact, however, that eleven entire hymns are addressed to and that about 170 references are made to that god, should be sufficient to disprove the contention of Oldenberg. No other divinity belonging to that late category proposed by Oldenberg has bsen so much glorified and sung in vedic hymns. Oldenberg has not been able to explain why only one god, 37%$, in preference to other gods belonging to the same late group and category, should be raised so high and be placed, in vedic hymns themselves, on the same level aa the older and more important vedic gods. The association of with the greater and older gods of IfcV is such as would definitely go against the possibility of being a younger member of the vedic pantheon. The fact that plays a comparatively small and unimpor- tant role in vedic ritual does not at all prove, as Oldenberg avers, that he is a later vedic god. The similar is the case with 3W, who cannot, under any circumstances, be regarded as a younger member of the vedic pantheon. On the other hand swrfft, who clearly belongs to a late phase of vedic religious thought, is very prominent in the vedic ritual. I shall try to show later on that though the name of this god, may be of purely Indian origin, the main characteristics and functions re-</page><page sequence="7">New Light on the Vedic Goá-^TOj 299 presented by thai god caD be definitely traced back to ancient indogermanic mythology. Oldenberg vehemently opposes the proposition that the ve die god was originally conceived of as an aspect of the sun- god. Hillebrandt and L. von Schröder have indeed identified with It will be necessary, at this stage, to consider critically and in detail, the view of Hillebrandt regarding the essential nature of He first of all takes into considera- tion the position of in the vedic ritual. There is in St» ( III. 10. 1 ) a reference, in connection with 3ti?rr%in, to an altar of «ďwn^-# Tsrerajirnr ^riRšř etc. Accord- ing to Hillebrandt, this description clearly indicates the solar nature of Further he points out that the possible connec- . tion of with animar implied in RV ( 1, 110. 2 : 1. 161. 11) supports the assumption that is identical with the sun- god. In a sacrifice, there are offerings to be made to on each day, during the year, which fact suggests the nature of that god as the ' lord of the year '. And this ' lord of the year ' cannot be any other than the sun-god. These arguments based on the study of vedic ritual and brought forth by Hillebrandt in order to support his proposed identification of with UÍ, are far from being convincing. It must be remembered that the original personality of the vedic god is greatly changed when that god is transferred to the ritual. TW, who played such an important role in indogermanio mythology in general and in vedic mythology in particular, is, for example, rarely the central figure in the vedic ritual. To try to ascertain the nature of a vedic god from the study of the position of that god in the vedic ritual is therefore not the cor* rect method. The main characteristics of a god usually fall into the background and his minor features, which afford some scope for ritualistic employment, are greatly maginified. The ori- ginal personality of a god is thus often distorted for the sake of the contingencies of the ritual. Moreover the arguments put forth by Hillebrandt, regarding the nature of on the strength of the position of that god in the vedio ritual do not prove anything positively except that the vedic ritualists had known 9Ì3H as possessing a concrete personality. The peculiar form</page><page sequence="8">300 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute of the írrñNr altar, which, according to Hillebrandt, represents the solar orb, may aa well be suggestive of the conception of ' motion ' in the world-order, which is kept eternally going, as a consequence of the ' stimulation ' given by The implica- tion that írfà? is one of the arrías does not further prove that íríir? is the sun-god, since, the 3Tri%?7s originally belong to ^&gt;or- 5JTÎT mythology. Further, several gods besides are glorified as ' lords of the year About for instance, it is said in RV ( L 25. 8 ), H nrcrr ^aarcr: çrçsr snrnra: i t srsmrà. There are, on the other hand, other ritualistic details about 91%?, which positively go against his being identified with In ( 1. 1. 9 ) is associated with fetters, which fact rather leads to the possible identity between srw and frfêîjf. The TT^Ts are an exclusive feature of the ^m-mythology. In RV ( VI. 71. 5 ), is compared with the ersfiCT priest. This STT^rFr is, in later ritual, called ferrar, thus perhaps indirectly connecting with fîm-^ir mythology. There is not the slightest hint, in vedic ritual, that is identical with Had 9Í%»| and been identical with each other, they could have interchanged their places in the ritual ; one could have been substituted for the other. As a matter of fact, however, each of them is men- tioned at distinct stages in the course of the ritual, and the parts which they are made to play in the ritual are also quite distinct. When Hillebrandt refera to the descriptions of in the JtV he is on firmer ground. His views in this connection may be briefly summairsed as follows •• In a large number of &amp;V passages, is predominantly described as the 4 Lord of light and splendour. ' These descriptions very clearly bring about the solar nature of that god. The WJliïs which afford the most obvious indication of the identity between and g?r are the fourth and the fifth. The hymn IV. 53 will be perfectly unintel- ligible without the assumption of the identity of these two gods. The idea of stimulation is, no doubt, often emphasised in the RV, But the contention of Oldenberg that ^risj&lt;ï, as the god represent- ing the abstract conception of vivification, is older than ^rrcif, faintly and secondarily possessing the characteristics of the eun-god, cannot stand. Indeed we find both these ideas in one and the same hymn.</page><page sequence="9">New Light on the Vedic God-^rfkř£ 301 V. 81. 2 SITOT^r Vff =^&lt;T^ „ „ 5 aftrsft srenw 55 „ „ 2 1% íTnpmFrc* ^rr%?rr aŘtrcr: 3T5 *PTT"Î 3T# T% TTJíťÍT.

IV. 13. 1 and 2 3řg?rr ^ňm&lt;rr t* çrlr- etc. The ideas expressed in these passages are similar ; the literary expressions too are almost similar. The only natural conclusion therefore is that 3.T and were, to the mind of the vedic poet, identical with each other. They are often spoken of indiscri- minately in the RV. One is described in terms usually applied to the other and it becomes therefore hardly possible to keep the two gods apart. With reference to these arguments of Hillebrandt in favour of identifying HÍ%&lt;J with it must be said, at the outset, that the learned vedic scholar takes into consideration only very general characteristics of Such divine characteristics, as being the lord of light and splendour ; spreading t ays of light everywhere ; moving in golden chariot etc. etc. ; are the oommon property of the vedio poets. They employ these features with referenoe to any vedic god, irrespective of his intrinsic nature. Association with light and splendour and other kindred features is the most common device of the vedic poet used by him for the glorification o.f each and every divinity. Further in a few passages quoted by Hillebrandt, ^iar&lt;J seems to be brought in close connection with $7, because the predominant function of namely that of stimulating, directing and controlling the 12 I Annab, B. O. B. I. J</page><page sequence="10">302 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute world-phenomena- is the peculiar feature, if but in a restricted manner, of the nature of also. What is to the whole universe including the eun-god, wif is to a few happenings in the world. This fact naturally gave rise to the misconception re- garding the identity of these two vedic gode. A closer and more critical examination of the personality of clearly indicates that that god definitely transcends the limitations of the sun- god. and may appear from some vedic passages to be closely connected, but they are more often differentiated from each other. The contents of ^rnr^-hymns differ substantially from those of the çg-hymns. The $;«T-hymns are usually restricted merely to the descriptions of ' rising illumining light, ' while the hymns put conspicuous emphasis upon the nature of that god as the 4 stimulator, controller and director ' of the world-order. It is said of *n?&lt;ï, in more glowing colours than of Q?r, that he con- ducts, ceaselessly and with care, day and night, clearly defining their limits. Let us bring together a few features of the sun-god, which are prominently described in the hymns addressed to him and which are, at the same time, never mentioned with reference to is the eye of mšrc^or ( I. 115. 1 : VI. 51. 1 : VII. 61. 1 ) or the eye of gods ( VII. 77. 3 ), while is himself described as ( V. 139. 1 ). W is the spy of the world ( IV. 13. 3 ) ; his chariot is drawn by seven steeds ( V. 45. 9 ) as against the two radiant steeds of ( I. 35. 2 ). The path of fljr is prepared for him by ( I. 24. 8 : VII. 87. 1 ) or by the arrías, ífo, and STIHI ( VII. 60. 4 ), while himself makes paths for all ( II. 38. 7 and 9 ). *rer's father is ( X. 37. 1 ) and he is said to be god- born ( X. 37. 1 ) ; the mention is often made of wi being produced and placed in heaven by several gods - by ( II. 12. 4 ), by VII. 99. 4 ), by roïnsreoft ( IV. 13. 2 : V. 63. 4 ), by f=?r- srçoft ( VII. 82. 3 ), and by ( X. 190. 3 ). This is a feature which clearly distinguishes g;i from for it is who is said to have produced and set in motion other natural powers ( II. 38. 7 and 9 ). is further described as a bird ( X. 177. 1 ), or a bull ( X. 189. 1 ), or a steed ( VII. 77. 3 ), while in many other passages he is spoken of even as an inanimate object ( VII. 63. 4 : V. G3. 4 •• V. 62. 2 ) ; this is again a feature, which can never be thought of with reference to who is the stimulator of all</page><page sequence="11">New Light on the Vedic God-^ik^ 303 objects, animate as well as inanimate. On the other hand, is described, unlike fri, as vivifying and "Sjri ( X. 64. 7 : X. 139. 1 ). Other features which clearly differentiate the funotions of these two gods are the following : Waters obey the ordinance of *n?&lt;ï ( II. 30. 1 ) ; with his hands frfêïj leads the rivers onwards ( III. 33. 6 ) ; water and wind obey the law of ( II. 38. 2 ) ; T|#ï is smfèfn as well as ( IV. 53. 6 ). The above discussion will be sufficient to prove how the vedic poets thought of and as two quite distinct personalities with quite distinct functions. Another feature which clearly distinguishes these two gods from each other is the fact that is a morning as well as evening god, while is exclusively the god of morning. Descriptions like *3TCTT wámsŤt O&amp;SPrac srçà ^ ( I. 35« 2 ) 3Tiwrs«i pjsnrrg: fTTOir Titrer aíHr ( I. 35. 4 ) can hardly be reconciled with the nature of who is the lord of light and morning, and who is said to be travelling on an illuminated path even after sunset. It may be incidentally noted that the western direction is assigned to hříšní in the SremrargPT, thus again suggesting the distinction between and Another exclusive feature of is his association with amis, the mighty splendour or form. This has something magical in it ( IIT. 38. 8 : VII. 38. 1 and 2 : VII. 45. 3 ). It is a supernatural miracle, something like the UTTT of or *çor. No such magical power is ever connected with the sun- god. The part played by in connection with the funeral rites ( X. 17. 4 : AV XII. 2. 48 ) ; his being raised to the status of snmfò in RV ( IV. 53. 2 ) and in later brahmanical literature ( 5T. 1. 3T. and à. an. ) ; his being preeminently called ( IV. 53. 1 ) 5 these are still more characteristics of the personality of which clearly distinguish bim from unlike g?T, controls the working of all other gods ( II. 38. 7 and 9 ) ; no god dare resist his will ( IV. 82. 2 ). *rrt&lt;ï bestows immortality not only on the 3tSs but also on other gods ( IV. 54. 2-5-6 : II. 3. 1 s V. 81. 1 ). Do such references even faintly suggest the</page><page sequence="12">304 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute identity of and ? Do they not indicate, beyond doubt, that the personality of is far more transcendent than that of the sun-god and that the functions of are far more r comprehensive and important than those of Î The frequent juxtaposition of these two gods again proves nothing if not the clear-cut distinction between them. The references such as that ^rfirq; declares men sinless to ( I. 123. 3 ), or that combines with the rays of ( V. 81. 4 ) go to show that qjr is obviously subordinate to *rfè&lt;ï. Indeed the whole hymn, V. 81., is important from this point of view. In VII. 35 , where distinctive characteristics of different v edic gods have been mentioned, and *nin£ are clearly distinguished. In several other passages ( I. 35. 9 : I. 123. 3 : I. 157. 1 : V. 81. 4 : VIL 45. 2 : X. 149. 3 ) the names of *rîl&lt;ï and ç*r appear side by side. The activity of is frequently connceted with the setting of the sun (II. 38. 1-5). How can this be explained if and sriir^ are identical ? is said to bring forth night ( II. 38. 3ff ), which description is unthinkable with reference to The vedic poet asks srg* 17 rrt ?®î! ( I. 35. 7 )- thus further suggesting that was regarded, in BV, as the controller of all the activities of the sun-god. It is therefore more than certain that the vedic pöets distinguished very clearly between the vedic gods, and and that they looked upon ^rf^, as a god who is responsible for stimulating and directing all the phenomena of the world, including that of the sun-god. Macdonell thinks that was originally a general epithet, of Indian origin, applied later on, in a restricted manner, to the sun-god as the typical stimulator. Thomas seems to corroborate this view when he asserts that is the divine power of personified. These seem to be merely attempts to bring about the compromise between the views of Oldenberg and Hillebrandt. The word, may have been, in some cases, used as an epithet of - god in general. This fact would perhaps merely indicate a stage when the present participle from N/^had not been com- pletely transformed into a proper name of a definite god. It should be remembered that the descriptions of are not of a general character, so that they could be applied to any god in his cap- acity of a 4 stimulator. 9 ás Max M'ùller has said, the nam?</page><page sequence="13">New Light on the Vedic GotHifaj 305 may be of the nature of a general title, but it is never, on that account, applied to any enlivener, whether rain, or moon, or wind. It will be shown that the characteristics of are indicative of a distinot vedic god in his aspect of the stimulator of the world-order. Roth compares irönj with the Greek ' Hermes ', who is the usherer of day and night. But he does not seem to have taken into consideration other distinctive characteristics of íTÍÍTj. Even after long discussion, Bergaigne does not arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the essential personality of He, however, says that the nature of cannot be explained by means of solar functions. The distinction that ^ represents the physical orb of the sun-god, while represents the inner presiding divinity of the sun-god is, according to Bergaigne, not correct. He brings forth the implied identity of irf^î and xm ( IV. 55. 10 : V. 82. 3 : VI. 50. 13 ) ; the close connection between and snrcna ( IV. 53. 2 ), between and fror ( IX 81. 4 •* 1. 13. 10 ), between and iJTI ( VI. 50. 3 ), and between and ^Tfinj ( X. 149. 5 •• III. 56. 6 ). Bergaigne, further puts stress upon the ' Hermaphrodite ' nature of iriwtj ( III. 38. 8 ) remarking that combines in himself the chara- cteristics of both sexes. These are, however, merely stray references, which obviously do not indicate the true nature of Hriftj. It may be that íTÍ%rJ, in his different capacities, as the benefactor who distributes wealth, as the creator of the univers® and the sustainer of the world-order, as the nourisher of the creatures etc., has been brought into close association with several vedic gods. This fact shows that the nature of is not identical exclusively with the nature of any one of these gods, but that it definitely includes and transcends the distinc- tive features of all these gods. The above discussion will clearly indicate how the explana- tions regarding the true nature of WPirJ proposed by Oldenberg, Hillebrandt, Macdonell, Thomas, Roth and Bergaigne are either onesided and incomplete or definitely beside the mark. A critical consideration of the views of these scholars has, however, led us so far to the following main conclusions : ( 1 ) is not merely an abstraction-divinity of the type of M, etc. It is therefore not necessary to believe that</page><page sequence="14">30 6 Annals of the Bbandarkar Oriental Research Institute belongs to a later phase of vedio religious thought and that therefore the conception underlying that god cannot be taken back beyond the vedic mythology. (2) The view that írrt&lt;£ was originally conceived of as identical with is a misconception, which originated on account of the fact that the main function of ^3, namely ' stimulation was also observed in a restricted manner, among the descriptions of the sun-god. As a matter of fact, however, the vedic poets have clearly differentiated between these two gods. ( 3 ) The word is not an epithet of a general character, so that it could be applied to any god in his capacity of ' enliv- ener '. There is a distinct divine personality behind that name, possessing its own essential nature. What then is the essential nature of ? In order to under- stand it correctly, we have to analyse the eleven entire hymns addressed to that god, and 170 references made to him in RV in a manner so that only such characteristics of his personality are brought together as clearly distinguish him from other vedic gods. It is an indisputable fact that vedic poets were often in the habit of using stock phrases with reference to any and every god. This their propensity has given rise to the innumerable repetitions in the Veda, as pointed out by Bloomfield. These common poetic formulas do not help us in estimating the character of a particular vedic god. We have therefore to base our views regarding the true and intrinsic nature of any god on the study of the fòfors - the exclusive characteristics - mentioned in connection with that god. A very prominent feature of the nature of is that the conception of the world -order - sinr- is often predominantly associated with his personality. is the god who supports and preserves the whole world - iif9# *nTT«farřfT ( IV. 54. 5 ). He is said to be mainly responsible for sustaining the world- order and the ethical laws, so much so that he is regarded aB a standard in that connection : S* flsrwrr ( X. 34*8 ) ^rrtaT I*5T T ïTCsft ( X. 139*3</page><page sequence="15">New Light on the Vedic God-^fa% 307 Waters are subject to the ordinance of írfl? • 3TT&lt;TT«r^T 3TT ÎH^ïTT ( II. 38'2 ) 5 he leads the rivers onwards with his hands ( III. 33. 6 ).

Whatever this god of beautiful hands, orders cannot be contradicted or trans • grossed ; his law stands as eternal truth : * sair* ?rcrar 1 řT?2f%5in wi?ïRn aa » ( IV. 54.4 ). is the lord of what moves and what is stationary ( IV. 53.6 ). He is the supporter of the sky ( IV. 53.2 : X. 149.4 ) and is once said to have fixed the earth with bonds and made the sky firm in the rafterless spaoe (X. 149. 1). It is again, who sets in motion the chariot of strops ( I. 34.10 ). It is further under his behest that several affairs of the world, huge and small, are set going ( I. 124. 4 '• II. 38.1ff ). The Atharvaveda clearly men- tions (VI. 23'3): These references to in various vedic passages provide us with a definite starting point for ascertaining the true nature and personality of that vedic god. In a very large number of passages, associated with the conception of *EW. It has been indicated above that already a stage had been reached in the evolution of common indogermanic religious thought when it was positively asserted that this vast and infinite universe is not a lawless ohaos, but that it presupposes a well-defined cos« mio order working behind all world-phenomena. This concep- tion of - world-order - is to be met with in many indo- germanic religions, which fact shows that it belonged to the common mythological heritage of the indogermanic people. Those religions had also to invent necessarily a mythological counterpart of that conception- a god who should be responsible for seeing that this functions regularly and without break.</page><page sequence="16">3p8 Annals of the Bhandarkat Oriental Research Institute That god was consequently looked upon as the sovereign-lord of the universe, as the ruler, who sustains the law - cosmic and ethical - and who directs and regulates the world-phenomena. He keeps the whole world bound down by means of his fetters, so that it should not go astray from its regular well-defined course; and when he finds that his ordinance is broken, he binds the off- ender also by means of his fetters. The working of the cosmic order was however beyond the ken of human beings. The god, who controlled that cosmic order and made it function in an exceedingly perfect but inconceivable manner, was therefore naturally regarded as the greatest magician and was usually associated with majestic magic power - HPJT or 3wftr. Several indo-germanic mythologies possess this conception of the world-order and more often of the magician sovereign-lord who sees that that cosmic order works without hindrance or break. In RV, we have sjtcT and ; in Avesta, there is Ahura Mazda ; in germanio religions, this world-sovereign is Odin ; in the Lappish conception of the 4 Welten-mann ' we find a counter- part of vedic grçtiT ; a god of the Thrakers is called Darzales- a ' gcd of bondage as the name suggests. Comparative mytho- logy and comparative philology have proved, beyond doubt, that all these gods are the mythological counterparts, in several indogermanic religions, of one and the same abstract conception, namely that of the world-order. The features of such a god, like sovereignty, magical power, giving of orders, and binding by means of fetters, are common in all the indogermanio mythologies. Our thesis regarding the essential nature and personality of may now be stated as follows •* possesses, as has been shown above, all the characteristics of a god who stimulates, controls and directs the cosmic order. He is very often associated with all the main implications of the conception of The vedic poet must have originally thought of as the god, who is responsible for stimulating, directing and controlling the world-phenomena. In other words, was, for vedic poets, only another aspect of the god, A com- parison of the fòí^s of htï PJ with those of ^or, which will be attempted presently, clearly indicates that these two gods are,</page><page sequence="17">New Light on the Vedic God-yfa&lt;¿ 309 according to the vedic poet, identioal with each other. The sovereign lord was viewed by the vedic poets from a particular standpoint ; and special emphasis was put by them on certain of ^çot's peculiar functions. It was under such definite circumstances that «TÇT was glorified in the form of The word derived from was employed in some passages, as shown above, merely as an adjectival present participle connected with different gods in their capacity of ' enlivener ' 5 thus srftïir or stimulator in the domain of light was } *rr%ir or stimulator of good luck was W ; or stimulator in the matter of creation was This is only an extension, in a general way, of the conception of stimulation. There is another possibility in this regard. The word may have been originally used in a very general adjectival sense and in this stage of transition, the word was employed with reference to several gods like WT, f^T, etc. It was only in later times that the epithet, which had then become almost a proper noun, was restricted to an aspect of But two facts definitely go against such hypothesis. With this hypothesis, will have to be placed in the category of vrrčIT, etc., which possibility has already been shown to be out of, question. Secondly the connection of with other older gods of RV is such as would favour his being originally regarded as an old and prominent member of the pantheon of vedic gods, - namely as an aspect of ^çnt. The association of CT33 and the conception of ITtT and consequently the implied identity between Wi and seem to be, therefore, more ancient in vedic mythology. What is the peouliar aspect of the world-sovereign, which is represented by ? Before an attempt is made to answer this question, it would be better to bring together the several features which are, in the Veda, common to the person* ality and nature of both sreot and To begin with it should be noted that ia some vedio passages and have been mentioned in such a manner as would clearly bring about the identity of those two gods ; for instanoe, si fsn g^ari% m 1 ( X, 85.24 ). 18 I Annali, B.

The same is the case as regards III. 54.10 and III. 54.11, where is mentioned directly after ÎBœî^jOT, thus suggesting a close connection between these divinities. The functions of in his capacity of a stimulator and director of the world-order and the preserver of cosmic and ethical law (II. 38.2: III. 33.6 : IY. 5.34 : X. 34.8 '• X. 139.3 ) are entirely similar to those of SW in the same connection ( VI. 70.1 •* VII, 88.1 •' VIII. 41.10 : VIII, 42.1 ). is again closely associated with other members of the circle of SW mythology, namely, rn?, *m, sronq; etc. ( VII. 66. 1-4 ). By reason of his laws is said to become Wsf, ( V. 81.4 ). plays a double role ; he sets in motion and also puts to rest all worldly activities ; he is both UíntčTT and ( IV. 53.6 ). This unique feature of wt^'s charaoter indicates, in a convincing manner, that the word was not merely an epithet suggesting the abstraction of stimulation. In that case the two-fold nature of would have been quite inconsistent. It is thus certain that the vedic poet thought of as a dis- tinct god wielding complete control over all the phenomena of the world. The usual exclusive epithet of namely 3TQT, is employed in a very significant manner with leference to also ( I. 35,7 •* I. 35,10 : IV. 53.1 ). The word 3Tij* ( 31® + t, pos- sessive termination ) had originally the particular sense of a god possessing greatest magical power. The epithet was therefore originally restricted to the magician sovereign-lord of the world, 9Ç0T, When was glorified, in his peculiar aspeot, as the epithet 3TQT was also naturally transferred to him. ^ot'b car is prominently described as shining like the sun ( I. 122.15 ) and as traversing the highest heaven ( V. 63.1 ).

HT?čj puts on a tawny garment ( IV. 35. 2 ), which may be compared with the golden glistening mantle of srewr (I. 25. 13 •• I. 152. 1 ). and are both connected with the nocturnal heaven ( I. 35. 2 ). As a moral governor ^roi stands far above any other deity.

Similar are the characteristics of who makes men sinless ( IV. 54. 3 ) and drives away evil spirits ( I. 35. 10 '• VII. 38. 7 ).

He uses them in a two-fold manner. He binds the world by means of these fetters, so that it should not swerve away from its well-defined order ; he also binds, with these fetters, the offenders who break his law ( I. 24. 15 : I. 25. 21 s VI. 74. 4 • X. 85. 24 ). is similarly described as binding down the world-order with fetters in order to keep it intact * arrear I srš tffaftr u (X. 149. 1). It has already been indicated that R. *r. ( I. 1. 9 ) also speaks of the fetters of It should be noted that no other god, who does not belong to the circle of ^wr-^tîT mythology, is ever associated, in the Veda, with fetters. The mention of the bondage employed by *rnr&lt;ï ( X. 149. 1 ) should therefore in itself be sufficient proof of his identity with Another significant feature of mythology is the frequent mention of smfè. The word 3WTIW is used in a special sense with reference to Out of nine places where that word occurs in RV, in four places it is directly connected with ( III. 38. 8 : VII. 38. 1-2 VII. 45. 3 ). It occurs also in AV ( VII. 14. 2 ). The R*PJf explains the word sroťff as ' ' ; Geldner ( Glossar ) and Weisser ( ZWB ) understand it in the sense of " peculiar form, pattern or structure ". The word ^7 has retained, in later literature, the sense of a ' mystical, occult form '. A critical study of the passages, where the word swfà occurs, leads one to the con- clusion that to the vedic poet, stdrâ indicated some mighty splendour - a magical form - something almost like the WIT of (V. 63. 4. WKZM XIII. 320. ). It is very often des- cribed as a supernatural miracle. This fact brings and quite close to each other. ^fT, like is said to be possessing such occult power ( III. 61. 7 : V. 85. 5 ), by means of which he makes the sun cross the sky and obscure it with cloud and rain ( V. 63. 4 ), So the epithet, , is principally applied to among the gods ( VI. 48. 14 : VII. 28. 4 s X. 99. 10 ). The con- ception 3 of and ftPTT are quite similar and belong exclusive- ly to ttie gfçot-mythology. The counterparts of in other indogermanio mythologies are also invested with Buoh magical</page><page sequence="21">New Light on the Vedic God-q¡fa% 313 power. This occult power, 3W1ÍT or WTTT, is a necessary feature of the whole ^-ideology. Bergaigne has pointed out, in this connection, that the activity suggested by is very often ( X. 137. 4 : X. 99. 6-7 : AV VI. 119. 3 : VII. 53. 6 ) characterised by some form of mystical or magical power. The indicates not ordinary stimulation, but it indicates stimulation, which has some form of magic underlying it - a sort of ' magioal charg- ing'. The Vs; is sometimes used, in this sense, with reference to himself ( II. 28. 9 ). *tt^, whose activity is described by the employment of several forms of the V*i, is therefore clearly the world-magician, whose ways regarding the direction and control of the world-order are entirely inconceivable to the human mind. It is thus abundantly clear that is only an aspecfc of TOU, a ' Hypostase ' of He represents the world-sovereign as seen from a distinct point of view and in a definite attitude. What is this peculiar aspect of 3W, which is so much glorified by the vedic poets through the hymns addressed to ? An analysis of the vedic hymns addressed to brings forth very prominently one unique feature of the presonality and function of that god. In the descriptions of the movement of his hands and fingers is particularly emphasised by the vedic poets. In the oase of no other god is this feature noticeable, infoj raises aloft his strong golden arms, which extend to the ends of the whole world ( II. 38. 2 : IV. 14.2 » IV. 53. 4 : V. 81. 2 : VI. 71. 5 : VII. 45. 2 ). His arms are golden ( I. 35. 9-10 ), broad ( II. 38. 2 ) and beautiful ( III. 33. 6 ). By his out-stretched hands blesses and enlivens all beings and directs all movement in the world. The raising of ^TR^'s arms is so characteristic that the aotion of other gods is often compared with it. sriTT raises his arms like ( I. 95. 7 ) ; dawns extend light as extends his arms ( VII. 79. 2 ) ; fPTHT is implored by means of hymns of praise upraised like the arms of ( 1. 190. 3 ). is 8&lt;nť3ř, ffmrerm, ^R, gsnf eto. Inâo too it is said •* ipmi sraprç; çrrfSr: 5515: TČT snprr 1 v» This gesture of by means of his huge golden hands was so deeply rooted in the mind of the vedic poet that even in later brahmanic literature the f w *rçrgr was regarded as saored to y 1^4,</page><page sequence="22">314 Annals of the Bhandarkar Orientai Research Institute on the basis of philosophy. Bergaigne rightly observes that the raising of arms by does not indioate merely the spreading of the rays of the sun. This gesture, whioh is so often and so prominently described, with reference to must have some speoial and deeper significance. By his widely stretched out arms *rr%&lt;ï gathers together the beings and then lets them free. He distributes life and motion to all beings. The great sovereign of the universe spreads out, every morning and every evening, his gigantic hands and thus sets the whole cosmic order working. This peculiar gesticulation of is indicative on the one hand, of the oommandant of the universe giving orders and, on the other hand, of the great world-magician produoing his magni- ficent magic. The vedic poets were so thoroughly impressed by the sovereignty and the magio power of the world-sovereign gçnr, that they created this most profound imagery on the brilli- ant rays of the sun at the time of the sunrise and the sunset. The vedic poets believed that they could see, every morning and every evening, the otherwise invisible and imperceptible world- magician actually in action of giving orders and produoing magic by means of his out-stretched majestic hands. Continu- ally from day to day, when light and darkness ohange places, one sees the giant hands of the commandant of the universe stretched out to the ends of the sky in the gesticulation of a magician over-lord. On the beckoning of *nf&lt;ï, the sun is set into motion in the morning, the s take up to their paths, men get up and start their activities. In the evening, however, when the order comes from the commandant magician - the peculiar gesticul- ation of his gigantic out-strectched hands being then seen in the west- the sun leaves his routine, the night draws together the threads of darkness and puts them, like a veil, over th® earth, the moon comes out as the watchman of the night and the stars in the east hasten up to obey the orders of is further said to be raising his voice in order to establish firmly his law- a feature which is also indicative of the same essential cha- racter of that god : sgr# «nfít ••• ••• ••• ••• sr 3Tg *rr%?rr »•( ••• ••• (IV. 53.3).</page><page sequence="23">hew Light on the Vedic Goi-^i farcj 315 It is in the same sense that is desoribed as a priest giving order for sacrifice thrice a day (III. 54.11 ). The visible occult gesture of the majestic hands of the magician sovereign-lord, thus brings about the inter- change of the grandest contrasts in nature - of day and night, of light and darkness, of activity and rest, of motion and static condition ( II. 38. Iff ), The sovereign of the world, is by nature infinitely comprehensive. H e is, however, described in his particular aspect of 4 giver of orders 9 and 1 producer of magic That is ftq; of RV - a representation of in his special gesture of the commandant and the magician of the world, a gesture which is easily the most impressive, and at the same time the most expressive of the essential personality and nature of The conception of the world-sovereign, with the giant hands reaching to the ends of the sky upraised in a gesticulation of ordering and producing magic is not exclusively the creation of the vedic poet. It may be traced back to pre-vedic indogermanic mythology. Prof. Giintert has tried to prove this on the strength of the evidence derived from nordic rock-paintings. These paintings have represented a manly form with an axe in the right hand, which he raises up together with his left hand ( a rock-painting from Backa near Brastad ). An exactly similar figure is represented in a rock-painting from Kinnekule. By the side of the figure, there is the * wheel of the sun 7 and the * foot-print ' In this figure the right hand is so very big, when compared with the left, that one feels inclined to believe that it must be some mythological form. Both gigantic hands in an upraised position, with particularly distinctive five fingers on each of them, are to be seen in a prehistoric figure of a god represented in a painting from Brecke near Brastad. In a paint- ing from Tanum one sees the god with both giant hands upraised, and having a spear in his right hand. The spear seems to be indicative of power and sovereignty. It is undoubtedly a re- presentation of a god who gives orders in this attitude. Similar figures of the god ' with majestic hands ' are also discovered in Southern Russia and Caucasus regions. On a rock-painting from Backa near Brastad in Bohuslän, the god with big hands is</page><page sequence="24">3i 6 Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute represented as holding a long rope in his hands. This feature is clearly indicative of the fact that the god of huge majestic hands - £«g&lt;nivr *rfih£ - is identical with the god possessing long rope - i. e. with his &lt;mSTs. The conception can thus be definitely traced back to prehistoric indogermanic period. We have the conception of vedic m represented picto- rially on the nordic rock-paintings belonging to ancient bronze- age. Or we must say that the ^rt^-hymns are the literary counterparts of these prehistoric rock-paintings. The real and the most fundamental significance of these im- portant combinations lies in the fact that we find hereby the com- pact prehistoric locality of the indogermanic peoples comprising the abodes of the nordic people in the west and extending over the thrakian lands to the land of the vedic Aryans, on the str- ength of the evidence of their common religious heritage in the form of the god with big hands. In prehistoric times the mutu- ally-connected indogermanic stocks, who had not lost touch with each other, lived in a locality which extended from Sweden, over Germany, Southern Russia, and the Caucasus region, upto Iran and the Punjab. Can we find any traces of this important vedic god, in Avesta? A hypothesis may be hazarded in this connection. Just as and rTrarra* are made demons by Zarathrushtra, so too is this god turned into a demon in Avesta. The vedic ^ETT%r does not only stimulate but also brings to rest all beings. This latter feature of was probably emphasised in Avesta, and there arose the divinity - demonaic and yawning-inciter- Bõgy- astä, usually feminine, but once in Yt. 18.2, also masculine. Bõsyastã puts people to sleep, is * dardjogava ' i. e. longhanded, and ' zairina 7 i. e. golden. The magnificent and majestic per- sonality of the great vedic gods, *TT?&lt;ï, was thus grossly disfigur- ed in Iran- the essential nature of that god, however, being re- tained in a profound manner in the personality of Abura Mazda.</page></plain_text>
