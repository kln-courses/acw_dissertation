Fournier (1998), for example, argues that some consumers perceive brands as veritable relational partners. Since the publica- tion of Aaker's (1997) work on this subject, the concept of brand personality has generated a great deal of interest in the marketing field. Borrowing from psychological theories on human personality traits, a number of authors have studied the personality of objects and places in various contexts. D'Astous and Lévesque (2003) look at the personality of stores, while Ladhari, Boulaire and Nyeck (2004) turn their attention to the personality of television shows. However, despite a growing number of stud- ies on the effects of object and brand personality on consumption, the cultural domain - which Bourgeon-Renault (2000) describes as charac- terized by its symbolic and subjective dimen- sions as well as by the essentially experiential nature of its consumption - has been largely neglected. Many cities in Canada and elsewhere are increasingly relying on arts and entertain- ment to gain a competitive edge, most notably in the context of tourism. Therefore, the per- sonality of the infrastructures - particularly performing arts venues - in which stakeholders invest may prove to be extremely important to decision-makers, administrators and market- ing professionals. For example, with Montreal in the midst of developing a Quartier des Spec- tacles, or entertainment district (Quartier des Spectacles, 2005), that will eventually play host to 28 performance venues in the heart of downtown, one of the issues that have arisen is precisely how to define the district's image (Rudel-Tessier, 2005). An underlying concern of the promoters is to ensure that this image is consistent with that sought by the different actors in the milieu, including consumers. The purpose of this study was to investigate the congruence between the personality of the performance venue and that of the consumer. White we can intuitively assume that the choice of the performing arts consumer is influenced by the show, the venue can be just as influen- tial. When the venue is an attraction in itself, as is the case with New York's Carnegie Hall, Milan's La Scala and the Sydney Opera House, the show may have even less influence on con- sumer choice than the venue. Moreover, some theatres are institutions in their own right, with their personality reflected in the program- ming. Thus, in the case of theatres the con- sumer's choice may be guided largely by the personality of the institution. Gainer (1995) demonstrates that, for some consumers, the choice of a specific theatre may be a consump- tion ritual linked to the creation of "small Jean-François Ouellet holds a PhD from the Université de Grenoble 2 and a postdoctorate from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Following a review of the literature, we develop a tool for measuring the personality of performing arts venues. Existing scales, such as the store personality scale (d'Astous and Lévesque, 2003) and the brand personality scale (Aaker, 1997), are not a priori suitable for measuring the subjective and symbolic dimensions inherent in cultural consumption (Bourgeon-Renault, 2000). This lies in con- trast to the at least partially utilitarian dimen- sion underlying consumption in most other markets (Assassi, 2003). The festival person- ality scale (d'Astous, Colbert and d'Astous, 2006) also appears to be unsuitable for use with performance venues in that these two fields pose distinct challenges (Bourgeon-Renault, Filser and Pulh, 2003). We next conduct empirical tests on the effects of congruence between the personalities of venues and those of consumers on the behaviour of consumers. We conclude with a discussion of the contri- butions and limitations of the study. Literature Review Experiential and Cultural Consumption While most consumer behaviour research focuses on the utilitarian aspect of products (Evrard and Aurier, 1996), it is generally rec- ognized that consumers take into account their feelings as well as the consumption experi- ence itself in their decision-making process (Pham, 1998). Moreover, Voss, Spangenberg and Grohmann (2003) argue that consumer attitudes can be measured along two dimen- sions: hedonic - that is, in relation to the con- sumer's feelings during the consumption experience; and utilitarian - that is, in relation to the product's function. Experiential marketing has recently become an important area of research within the mar- keting field, with researchers and practitioners alike paying more attention to the intangible aspects of products. Holbrook and Hirschman (1982) define the consumption experience as "a phenomenon directed toward the pursuit of fantasies, feelings, and fun" (p. 132). Indeed, the literature confirms the role of emotions and mood in consumer behaviour (Bagozzi, Gopinath and Nyer, 1999), particularly in the context of hedonic products (Pham, 1998). According to Pham (1998), consumer atti- tudes are influenced differently depending on whether the product is hedonic or utilitarian. While many industries offer mainly tan- gible and functional benefits to consumers, the cultural domain is characterized by the strong - not to say exclusive - experiential connota- tion of consumption. Bourgeon-Renault (2000) asserts that cultural consumption is defined largely by its symbolic and hedonic dimen- sions: "The consumption of cultural products, particularly in the arts, implies more subjectiv- ity than the consumption of other products" (p. 4). A fortiori, a performing arts event, defined as a "physical encounter between performers, an audience and an artistic creation" (transla- tion; Robin, 1992, cited in Assassi, 2003, p. 130), is distinguished by the absence of any functional dimension linked to its consump- tion (Bourgeon-Renault, Filser and Pulh, 2003). Performing arts consumption appears to be 50 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT ^^^^9 ^^^^^ The authors develop the concept of personality as applied to performing arts venues. They develop and test a measurement scale and test hypotheses derived from the congruence model of consumer behaviour. The findings suggest that venue personality can be measured along the dimensions of prestige and trendiness. They further suggest that, while consumers generally seek congruence between their own perceived levels of prestige and trendiness and those of performing arts venues, they tend to react negatively to venues they perceive as more prestigious than themselves and positively to venues they perceive as trendier than themselves. Performing arts venues, personality, self-congruence, attitudes, consumer behaviour</page><page sequence="3">motivated mainly by the pursuit of pleasure and an aesthetic experience (Assassi, 2003). Bourgeon-Renault et al. examine the factors that influence performing arts consumption and theorize about the behaviour of consum- ers. From an economic perspective, consumers evaluate the pertinence of attending an event based on a series of attributes such as the characteristics of the theatre and the names of the artists. From a sociological perspective, they are influenced by a social norm motiv- ating them to attend performing arts events that are appropriate for their particular social standing. Atmosphere and Venues The ambience at the point of purchase can greatly influence the image that is projected and also consumer behaviour (Turley and Chebat, 2001). In fact, Kotier (1973) asserts that the consumer's buying behaviour is influenced more by the atmosphere of the buying environ- ment than by the product itself. Kotier defines the creation of atmosphere as "the effort to design buying environments to produce spe- cific emotional effects in the buyer that enhance his purchase probability" (p. 50). Various studies demonstrate that atmos- pheric elements such as colour, odour, music and lighting affect not only a store's image or buying environment but also purchasing behav- iour. For example, Bellizzi and Hite (1992) claim that the colour blue has a calming effect on consumers and that red has a stimulating effect. Baker, Grewal and Parasuraman (1994) suggest that there is a relationship between a store's atmosphere and its image, especially in terms of quality (p. 332). In the field of cultural production, the venue plays a central role, as it constitutes the environ- ment in which the product is consumed. In their study of the influence of the design of a performing arts venue on consumer attitudes, Bouder-Pailler and Damak (2005) found that the venue projects certain symbols, serving as a showcase for the organizations that perform within it and offering a glimpse of the artistic project (p. 2). Indeed, the venue constitutes the first step in the hedonic consumption experience. Therefore, consumers' perceptions of it will influence not only their overall appre- ciation of the cultural product but also their future consumption choices. Bouder-Pailler and Damak (2005) suggest that a consumer who is seduced by a venue's design may even be prompted to make an impulsive purchase. Moreover, the reputation and image of a venue may serve to reassure consumers in the risky arena of cultural con- sumption (Colbert, 2007). Marteaux and Mencarelli (2004) go so far as to suggest that the venue is a tool that should be exploited by cultural institutions as part of their position- ing strategy. Thus, the value attributed to a cultural consumption experience may depend not only on the product that is offered but also on the space in which it is presented, since "the performance venue cannot be separated from the performance being presented" (translation; Marteaux and Mencarelli, 2004, p. 76). From Human Personality to Brand and Product Personality Allport (1937) defines personality as "the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his unique adjustments to his environment" (p. 48). While Allport refers to the "dynamic organization" of the traits that form personality, most personality experts agree that personality VOLUME 10, NUMBER 3 • SPRING 2008 51 RÉSUMÉ MOTS CLÉS L'étude développe le concept de personnalité appliqué aux lieux de diffusion des arts de la scène. Elle conçoit et fait l'essai d'un outil de mesure et teste des hypothèses dérivées du modèle de congruence du comportement du consommateur. Les résultats donnent à penser qu'il est possible de mesurer la personnalité du lieu en fonction des deux dimensions que sont le prestige et le côté branché. Ils laissent aussi entrevoir que, même s'ils recherchent généralement la congruence entre leur propres niveaux de prestige et côté branché et ceux de salles de spectacle, les consommateurs tendent à réagir négativement aux salles qu'ils perçoivent comme ayant plus de prestige qu'eux, mais positivement à celles qu'ils perçoivent comme plus branchées qu'eux-mêmes.

The work of numerous research- ers has resulted in the emergence of the Big Five personality model, which posits that the human personality comprises five dimensions, expressed as OCEAN: Openness to new experiences, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness and Neuroticism (Azoulay and Kapferer, 2003, p. 148). Since the appearance of the work of Gilmore (1919) and Guthrie (1997), it has been widely recognized that consumers frequently use anthropomorphism to "humanize" brands and products in order to reduce the uncer- tainty associated with their consumption. According to Fournier (1998), this tendency corresponds to a universal need underpinning the formation of relationships between humans and the immaterial world. All of this led Aaker (1997) to apply human personality traits to brands. According to Plummer (1984, cited in Aaker, 1997), personality traits become associ- ated with a particular brand through the con- sumer's direct and indirect contact with the brand. Thus a brand's typical users, its pro- moters and the company's employees all play a role in the direct assignment of personality traits to the brand. Personality traits can also be assigned indirectly, through product attrib- utes, brand name, logo, advertising, price and distribution channel. Caprara, Barbaranelli and Guido (2001) argue that the model proposed by the cognitivists (the Big Five) does not adequately explain personality in the context of brands. Thus Aaker (1997) argues, based on the dimensions of human personality, that brand personality can be positioned according to five traits that differ slightly from the Big Five human traits. Aaker's five traits are sincer- ity, excitement, competence, sophistication and ruggedness. Ferrandi and Valette-Florence (2002), for their part, apply the human per- sonality scale developed by Saucer (1994) to brands, proposing the following dimensions: introversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism and openness. Long before Aaker became interested in brand personality, Martineau (1958) had sug- gested that stores have a personality and that consumers tend to prefer stores whose image most resembles their own self-image. Later, d'Astous and Levesque (2003) defined store personality as "the mental representation of a store on dimensions that typically capture an individual's personality" (p. 457). According to Martineau (1958), consumers form an image of a store based on specific aspects, namely architecture and layout, colours and symbols, advertising, and sales personnel. Bouder-Pailler and Damak (2005) argue that design affects the personality of a place. To these sources of inference, Lévesque (2001) adds the entourage, the opinion of shopping companions and the profile of other customers present in the store. The dimensions proposed by d'Astous and Lévesque (2003) to define store personality - enthusiasm, sophistication, genu- ineness, solidity and unpleasantness - differ from those proposed by Aaker in the context of brands. Research on brand personality has recently spilled over into the cultural domain. For example, d'Astous, Colbert and d'Astous (2006) propose a scale for measuring the per- sonality of cultural festivals on the basis of five dimensions: dynamism, sophistication, repu- tation, openness to the world and innovation. Ladhari, Boulaire and Nyeck (2004) apply Aaker's (1997) scale to the personality of tele- vision shows. Their findings show that not all of Aaker's dimensions are suitable for the realm of television. For example, due to important differences between the cultural and retail 52 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT RESUMEN PALABRAS CLAVE En este estudio se desarrolla el concepto de personalidad aplicado a las salas de artes escénicas. Los autores elaboran y ponen a prueba una escala de medición y las hipótesis extraidas del modelo de congruencia del comportamiento del consumidor. Los resultados sugieren que la personalidad de la sala puede medirse en términos de prestigio y actualidad social. También indican que, si bien el consumidor busca por lo general la congruencia entre el nivel de prestigio y actualidad sodai que percibe en sí mismo y el de las salas de espectáculos, tiende a manifestar una reacción negativa hacia aquellas salas que le parecen más prestigiosas, a la vez que reacciona positivamente frente a aquellas que percibe de mayor actualidad.

Self-Congruence The notion of personality has attracted much attention in marketing, particularly as a result of self-congruence theories asserting that the purchase intention increases when the prod- ucts image is congruent with the consumer's self-image (Sirgy, 1985). Self-image refers to one s current perception of oneself, while self- congruence is the similarity between one s self- image and the image of a given product (Sirgy, 1985). In the same vein, Govers and Shoormans (2005) maintain that people favour products whose personality is congruent with their actual or ideal self-image. According to Sirgy, Grewal and Mangleburg (2000), a person's attraction to or attitude towards a store will be influenced by the congruence between their own person- ality and that of the store (i.e., self-congruence). In other words, consumers are more likely to shop at a place whose image matches their image of themselves. As Colbert (2007) states, because arts consumption involves an import- ant symbolic dimension, it is associated with a relatively high social risk, causing one to be concerned about the overall image of the prod- uct one is purchasing. Based on the literature review, we can pos- tulate that consumers are more likely to con- sume goods or attend venues whose image is consistent with their own (Sirgy, 1985; Sirgy, Grewal and Mangleburg, 2000). Thus, we can put forth the following two hypotheses: HI: The greater the congruence between the personality of the performing arts venue and the personality of the consumer, the more positive the consumers evaluation ofthat venue will be. H2: The greater the congruence between the personality of the performing arts venue and the personality of the consumer, the more frequent the consumers attendance at that venue will be. It should be noted that numerous studies of consumer behaviour have found that consum- ers' degree of familiarity with the product cat- egory also influences their attitude towards the product (Vanhuele, 1995). Therefore, con- sumers' familiarity with the different venues can be expected to limit the impact of per- ceived personality differences on attitudes and attendance. H3: The greater the consumer s familiarity with a venue, the less significant the effects postulated in HI and H2 will be. Development of the Measurement Scale date, no tool has been developed or adapted to measure the personality of performing arts venues. Thus, in order to ver- ify the above hypotheses, we first had to design an appropriate measurement instrument. The methodology used to do so was based on Churchill's (1979) paradigm of scale develop- ment as well as on the work of Aaker (1997) and d'Astous and Lévesque (2003). The details are described below. Item Generation and Initial Purification In order to measure the whole construct, we conducted a series of individual, semi-struc- tured interviews with adults familiar with the performing arts venues used in the construc- tion of the scale. Of the 28 venues located in Montreal's Quartier des Spectacles, we selected four: Salle Wilfrid-Pelletier, Spectrum, Theatre du Nouveau Monde and Theatre St-Denis 1 . These venues were chosen because they are all major, high-profile theatres and are very differ- ent from each other, thus ensuring variance in the generation of items and offering the pos- sibility of covering all aspects of personality. Eleven interviews lasting approximately 30 minutes were conducted with adults aged 18 and over who had frequented at least three of the four venues. These interviews generated 79 distinct themes. The list of attributes used in the development of other personality meas- urement scales in marketing (Aaker, 1997; Ferrandi and Valette-Florence, 2002; Lévesque, 2001) were added in order to complete the list of items generated by the individual inter- views, bringing the total number to 139. VOLUME 10, NUMBER 3 • SPRING 2008 53</page><page sequence="6">These 139 attributes were evaluated by five expert judges, who were either marketing pro- fessors or doctoral students familiar with the cultural scene in Montreal. The judges were asked to evaluate the pertinence of each item in the context of a performing arts venue on a five-point Likert scale (1 = does not describe a performing arts venue at all; 5 = describes a performing arts venue very well). Only those items that received a score of at least 4 from a minimum of three judges were retained. Of the 139 items, 36 were retained for the question- naire used to develop the measurement scale. Exploratory Factor Analysis The 36 items were administered to a sample of consumers. The respondents were asked to rate each of the traits, on a five-point Likert scale, in terms of how it described each of the four venues (1 = not at all; 5 = very well). We recruited a convenience sample using the snowball method and we administered the questionnaire electronically. In total, 133 adults (69.8% women) completed the questionnaire. Of these, 75.8% held a university degree, 90.9% were under the age of 34 and 46.7% reported an annual income of under $40,000. Although not representative of the general population, this profile is consistent with cultural consum- ers, who tend to be better educated, younger and more likely to be female than the general population (Colbert, 2003). It should be noted that 85.7% of the respondents had attended at least three performing arts events in the pre- ceding 12 months. We carried out exploratory factor analysis with varimax rotation on the sample in order to identify the dimensions that describe the personality of performing arts venues. Cattells criterion suggested a total of five dimensions, explaining 61 .6% of the variance. At this stage, we eliminated items with a factor loading of over .400 on more than one dimension or less than .400 on all five dimensions. This resulted in the elimination of 10 items, leaving 26 items available for confirmatory analysis (Table 1). Confirmatory Factor Analysis In order to confirm the five-factor structure of the personality of performing arts venues, we tested the model obtained from the explora- tory analysis using AMOS structural equation modelling software. Based on the confirma- tory subsample, the indexes initially obtained for this structure were weak: %2/dl = 3.074; GFI = .773; CFI = .777; RMSEA = .109. We therefore attempted to improve the model by means of post-hoc analyses, which led us to retain only eight items on two dimensions: prestige and trendiness (%2/dl = 2.325; GFI = .957; CFI = .952; RMSEA = .071). Table 2 presents the final structure suggested by our findings. Findings Methodology During the main data collection for the development of the scale, we measured the attitude towards each of the four venues using an overall venue appreciation scale comprising three statements - like/do not like the venue; positive/negative opinion; (would) like/ (would not) do not like to attend the venue - used in various studies (d'Astous, 2005; d'Astous, Legoux and Colbert, 2004). We also measured the number of visits to each venue over the preceding 12 months. In addition, we asked respondents to evaluate themselves, using a five-point Likert scale, on each of the 36 items initially retained for the exploratory analysis (e.g., I am a trendy person: 1 = totally disagree; 5 = totally agree). For each of the eight items retained follow- ing the confirmatory factor analysis, first we created two variables of personality difference measuring the distance between the prestige and trendiness characteristics of the respond- ent and those of the venue. For each item, a score was computed for this distance on a scale of 1 (large difference) to 5 (no difference). Next, in order to detect the direction of the effects, for each item we calculated two other variables such that potential variance would range from -4 (the respondent is more presti- gious/trendy) to +4 (the venue is more presti- gious/trendy), with 0 indicating no difference between the two. Impact on Attitude In order to test our hypotheses, we carried out a linear regression with backward elimination. 54 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTS MANAGEMENT</page><page sequence="7">VOLUME 10, NUMBER 3 • SPRING 2008 55 ■Q2&amp;H STRUCTURE CORRELATION MATRIX, AFTER VARIMAX ROTATION Dimension Item Prestigious Disagreeable Trendy Unpleasant Welcoming Reputable .797 -.060 .101 -.053 .146 Impressive .758 .255 .157 -.057 -.188 Classy .753 .384 .085 -.234 .172 Imposing .753 .218 .005 .081 -.343 Well-known .738 -.341 .091 .084 .056 Majestic .720 .358 .037 -.112 -.032 Dirty -.564 -.163 -.011 .393 -.160 Popular -.185 -.714 .205 .085 -.082 Accessible -.165 -.686 .036 .007 .199 Inaccessible .196 .674 .118 .229 -.061 Unifying -.207 -.574 .327 .081 .052 Modern .054 -.016 .785 -.013 .020 Original .002 .048 .745 -.143 .286 Trendy -.181 -.261 .727 -.033 .229 Fashionable .109 -.270 .683 -.165 -.021 Contemporary .125 .048 .632 -.138 .148 Urban -.137 -.317 .613 -.009 -.015 Unique .257 .142 " .469 .023 .187 Seductive .394 .022 .453 -.326 .317 Unpleasant -.230 .091 -.020 .727 -.243 Cold .217 .375 .020 .581 -.295 Lacking in character -.153 -.051 -.306 .529 -.224 Masculine -.196 -.207 .014 .525 -.001 Friendly -.041 -.365 .082 -.191 .736 Charming .298 -.031 .254 -.246 .697 Intimate -.289 .142 .270 .060 .688</page><page sequence="8">The dependent variable was attitude towards the venue and the independent variables were vari- ances between the two personality dimensions, familiarity with the venue and two interaction terms between differences and familiarity. The results are presented in Table 3. In the case of the model exploring the role of similarity in the prestige and trendiness characteristics of the respondent and the venue, only the interaction between familiarity and similarity in the prestige characteristic and familiarity on its own appeared to affect atti- tude towards the venue. In other words, a similar level of prestige in self-perception and in perception of the venue positively influ- enced the evaluation of the venue only in those consumers who were familiar with the venue. A second model was therefore devised to determine whether positive or negative differ- ences in perception on both personality dimen- sions would influence the consumer's attitude. This second model found four variables to have a significant effect on attitude towards the venue. First, the perception that the venue was more prestigious than the consumer had a negative - albeit slight - effect on the consum- er's attitude towards the venue (p &lt; .05). Con- versely, the perception of the venue as trendier than the consumer had a positive effect on attitude towards the venue (p &lt; .005). How- ever, the negative influence of the interaction term between familiarity and difference in trend- iness suggests that the effect of this difference on the formation of the consumer's attitude decreases with familiarity. Finally, simple fam- iliarity with a venue had a positive influence on the consumer's attitude towards it. These findings tend to confirm HI as well as H3, at least in terms of prestige. Impact on Attendance We carried out two additional linear regres- sions with backward elimination.

R2 = 60.5% and 60.4%. the preceding 12 months and our independent variables were attitude towards the venue, dif- ferences between the two personality dimensions, familiarity with the venue and two interaction terms between differences and familiarity. The results are presented in Table 4. The first model revealed, as suggested by the hierarchy of effects, that attitude towards a venue was the main factor influencing the consumers attendance at the venue (p &lt; .001). This confirms the hypothesis that the greater the congruence between trendiness of the venue and trendiness of the individual, the greater the attendance will be (p &lt; .01) - subject, however, to the moderating influence of fam- iliarity (p &lt; .05). In other words, a high degree of similarity in perceived trendiness of the venue and perceived trendiness of the consumer will trigger attendance only in those who are not very familiar with the venue. Finally, congru- ence between prestige of the venue and pres- tige of the individual translates directly into a favourable attitude only among those who are very familiar with the venue. In exploring more deeply the potential attendance effects of differences in perception of the venue and perception of oneself, the sec- ond model retained only two variables, includ- ing attitude towards the venue. This model shows that a positive variance in perceived trendiness of the venue significantly influences attendance (p &lt; .01). In other words, a venue that is perceived to be as trendy as or slightly trendier than the consumer will be attended more frequently by that consumer. Overall, this confirms H2 but not H3. Atti- tude appears to mediate the effects of differ- ences in prestige of the venue and prestige of the consumer on attendance at the venue. Discussion study represents a logical extension of studies on brand personality and experi- ential marketing (Aaker, 1997; Holbrook and Hirschman, 1982) in that it attempts to con- ceptualize the personality of performing arts venues and to better understand how people form a mental image of a performing arts venue. Contrary to what is suggested by congru- ence theory as applied to consumer behaviour, it appears that performing arts consumers do not necessarily seek perfect congruence between their own personality and that of the venue. Frequent consumers of the performing arts appear to seek a level of prestige similar to their own. Regardless of their degree of familiarity with the venue, however, consumers' attitudes towards a venue are negatively influenced by a level of prestige higher than their own. With regard to trendiness, a venue that is perceived as trendier than oneself is viewed positively, VOLUME 10, NUMBER 3 • SPRING 2008 57</page><page sequence="10">although this effect decreases as familiarity increases. In terms of attendance, congruence between consumers' perception of their own trendiness and that of the venue has a positive influence on attendance except among those who are very familiar with the venue. In all cases where there is variance, consumers appear to favour venues they perceive as trendier than themselves. These findings suggest that it is important for managers of performing arts venues to assess how their target consumers perceive themselves in terms of prestige and trendiness, as well as their degree of familiarity with the venue. Venues should aspire to be as trendy as or slightly trendier than their target audience. In terms of a venues prestige, consistency with perceived level of prestige appears to be import- ant for regular patrons, who are often loyal consumers of the performing arts and there- fore of key importance to the venue. In gen- eral, however, a venue that is higher than the consumer in terms of prestige appears to be a negative influence, which suggests that man- agers should not aim too high when it comes to prestige. Although we used a rigorous methodological approach, this study is not without limitations. First, it is clear that, due to the snowball sam- pling method employed, the sample used to construct the measurement scale is not repre- sentative of the general population of Montreal or the world at large. Our findings should therefore be interpreted with care. The princi- pal limitation of the study is the fact that only four venues were used to develop and test the measurement scale. While we attempted to use venues as orthogonally opposed as possible, the use of other performing arts venues in Montreal or elsewhere may well have resulted in different personality dimensions. It would be interesting to repeat the study, particularly the confirmatory portion, using other perform- ing arts venues in Montreal and elsewhere. References Aaker, J. 1997.
