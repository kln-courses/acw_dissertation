<plain_text><page sequence="1">PERFORMING GOD: GOD, ORGANICISM, AND POSTMODERNISM Vaughan McTeraan / Beloit College rganic paradigms have increasingly appeared in theology to V^/provide models and metaphors for interpreting God and the divine world relation. The cosmos is seen as a mutable mass of interconnections. This dense mass is in constant flux as entities within the cosmos grow, change, create, decay, and establish new interconnections. The constantly refigured cosmos is nonlinear, multidimensional, and multifaceted?entities choose different radial paths, dimensions shift, and facets regroup in a constant improvisation. Theologians use organic images to establish that God's relationship to the cosmos reflects the unceasing creativity and change inherent within it. God orders the cosmos in ways that are fluid and unconstrained, and an enticing variety of routes and connections can achieve God's aims. These aims are neither singular nor pre-established as God continually responds to actions within the cosmos and offers the best aims for entities accordingly. This organic paradigm is drawn particularly from the work of process and feminist theologians, and the lens they provide contributes to theology a postmodern model for God/world connections. In this paper I argue that the organic provides a postmodern framework for discussing the process of constructing God within specific historical and cultural locations. The paper focuses on how individuals imbedded in their own times and places construct God as a part of active relationship with God. The first part of this paper, based on the work of process theologians, suggests that individualized ontologies of God develop within individual relationships. The second part, based on the "performative" stance of poststructuralists, suggests that individual relationships with God can be nonfoundational yet still give evidence for the active presence of God. Introduction: Organic Postmodernism</page><page sequence="2">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 237 The combination of process and poststructuralist modes of thought raises intriguing questions about how images of God are constructed and, specifically, what is happening during the process of construction. What happens to believers when they construct images of God? What happens to God? What happens to the being or ontology of God? How is the nature of God affected? In short, how is the fluidity and dynamism of God played out in the cosmos? These questions are logical extensions of theologies that reflect postmodern, nonfoundationalist views. What follows is an exploration of these questions through the poststructuralist work of Judith Butler, the work of process philosopher and theologian Charles Hartshorne, and the work of feminist/process theologian Marjorie Suchocki. As a result of this investigation, I propose that monolithic conceptions of the nature of God are inadequate for contemporary theological paradigms. Contrasting Models he organic model contrasts with ideas of the relationship between A God and the world that fit with quantitative, linear, and hierarchical ideas of progress. A hierarchical, evolutionary1 view rooted in modernity assumes that humans' relationship with God is progressing toward a perfect, preordained salvific goal that, once reached, will not change. Classic images of the Kingdom of God that fit into this paradigm assume that humans establish a singular, unalterable type of relationship with God. Drawing on a combination of biblically-based monarchical and juridical metaphors2 for God, these images of relationship are duty and law oriented. When people follow particular duties and laws established by God the King they are assured of God's protection and hope to be judged as righteous, thereby gaining access to the Kingdom of God. This view of relationship with God as it develops after the Enlightenment incorporates a modernist, nineteenth-century evolutionary view of progress in which the ability to quantify and have knowledge of the world makes it an increasingly better place. At the same time, this evolutionary concept is allied with an ethical concept of 1 The term evolutionary is used in reference to notions of progression from one defined point, considered inferior, to another, considered superior. It is not used here in conjunction with ideas of creation or creationism. 2 Sallie McFague identifies traditional monarchical and juridical models of God in The Body of God (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress Press, 1993), 135.</page><page sequence="3">238 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy the Kingdom of God. The result is belief that through moral progress a just and ethical society will bring about the Kingdom.3 Salvation depends upon following God's laws which include the laws of nature, and both moral and natural laws are quantifiable, ordered, and unchanging. 'The laws of society and the laws of nature alike were held to be unchanging expressions of the will of God, the divine ordering of the world in the best interest of the whole."4 Following in the modernist path, humans fulfill their duty and uphold moral law in order ultimately to achieve a perfect, unalterable (as natural law is unalterable) relationship with God. Most significantly, people immersed in modernity even now assume that salvific relationship with God will be essentially the same for all types of humans. In this view the teleological path to salvation is straight and narrow. Modernity's emphasis on progress and evolution has convinced Christians that in their soteriological journey they should make consistent step by step progress toward becoming better and better, adding on goodness and going forward. Ultimately in their soteriological evolution, all strive to reach that unvaried, predetermined, and perfected relationship with the divine. In a Christianity molded by modernity, it is not an option to imagine there might be enormous variation in salvific goals for both God and humans and especially in what constitutes a perfected relationship with God. Process and feminist theologians have moved away from this monolithic view of divine/world relations, especially as theologians of color and various cultures have made their voices heard. But in order to be adequate in contemporary culture, theological discussions also need a fluid postmodern framework within which varied and radically different images of the God/world relation can be considered and constructed. The organic model already emerging in the work of process and feminist theologians provides this system. Using an organic framework, theologians can systematically discuss processes for the imaginative, nonlinear and nonhierarchical construction of God and divine/world relations. This paper provides an example of such a systematic discussion by taking particular theological concerns about 3 Carl E. Braaten, "The Kingdom of God and Life Everlasting," in Christian Theology, eds. Peter C. Hodgson and Robert H. King, 2nd ed., (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1985), 342. 4 John Dillenberger and Claude Welch, Protestant Christianity Interpreted Through its Development (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1954), 236.</page><page sequence="4">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 239 the construction of God in various social locations and addressing them through the organic paradigm. Transgressive God he kinds of relationships that develop between individuals and God A are determined by peoples' historical experiences and cultures. This has been demonstrated again and again in the work of theologians like Katie Cannon, James Evans, and Kwok Pui-lan who draw particularly on the experience and culture of African-American and Asian Christians. They have shown that their relationships with God are profoundly affected by being the "Other" in the presence of dominant cultures. This paper assumes that the relationship of individuals and God is permeated with Otherness. God shares the radical Otherness that exists within humanity by being in intimate relationship with those who are Other. God's intimacy with them, as well as with all humanity, changes God, thus also making God radically transgressive of dominant culture. In a poststructuralist understanding, the imaginative construction of God takes place within the boundaries of historicism established by culture and experience. As such, there is no fixed foundational or normative location from which to develop truth claims about God. Questions about the viability of normative criteria and how to accommodate competing visions of reality set the background for this paper. The central task here, however, is to discuss how historical and cultural location individualizes peoples' relationships with God, and to look carefully at how the nature of God changes and is unique to each person. I propose that by changing and becoming unique within each relationship, God shatters the "sameness" 5 imposed upon God by the linear, evolutionary teleology of modernity. The disruption begins as individuals construct images of God that are realities within their unique relationship with God. These images are not simply the result of perceiving God through various cultural lenses. A "cultural lenses" view of plurality is inadequate because it dulls differences in constructions of God by maintaining that even radically "other" religious beliefs are just varying versions of 5 David Tracy, "Theology and the Many Faces of Modernity," in Readings in Modern Theology, ed. Robin Gill (Nashville: Abbingdon Press, 1994), 225. In this article, Tracy discusses the sameness imposed by modernity upon theological models in general.</page><page sequence="5">240 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy belief in the same monolithic God. It thereby incorporates even extraordinarily different conceptions of the divine into a modernist, foundationalist schema in which the traditional, monolithic view of God is dominant. Radically other beliefs are then easily categorized as more or less developed versions of the One God?the less developed versions being, of course, inferior. Such a setup obliterates the need to see different beliefs as radically distinctive. This domestication of plurality is predicated on the notion that all people strive for a similar if not identical kind of perfected relationship with God in which there is little or no variation on what God is or becomes in relationship with humans. In contrast, when interpreting the divine/world relationship through an organic paradigm one assumes that there is enormous variation in the nature of God. In an organic framework, the divine ontology is not static, it changes and, as a result, is organically multilithic and multidimensional rather than monolithic. In addition, God does not simply change from time to time being monolithic in each separate moment, but is many things in each moment. Each construction of God is historically and ontologically distinct and "real" within a particular relationship. Importantly, God's ontology reflects the otherness of individuals thereby maintaining God's trasgressive qualities. God is real in particular, individualized ways that deny sameness. While God may remain loving, omnipresent, and even omnipotent, God is ontologically unconstrained. The organic concept proposed here falls between the idea of the existence of multiple gods and a cultural lenses view of plural gods as variations of the one God. The organic view does not propose multiple divine entities, but it does emphasize and radicalize the incommensurability of different constructions of God in order to retain their distinctiveness. In the organic model, God and individuals function together in an improvisational mode resulting in different ontologies of God. This is so precisely because individuals in different cultural and historical locations live in intimate relationships with God that continually change God's being. To say that the being of God changes and becomes individualized and multidimensional as each person lives out his or her life in relationship with God, is something different than to say, as do process theologians, that the consequent nature of God is affected by the decisions of entities. In the case discussed here, the reality of God becomes more individualized than in process thought. However, the</page><page sequence="6">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 241 work of process theologians, particularly Charles Hartshorne and Majori? Suchocki and their assertions about the consequent nature of God, set the stage for the idea of individualized divine ontologies. God And Intimacy Hartshorne and Suchocki's understanding of the intimate relationship between God and entities leads easily to a multilithic idea of God. Charles Hartshorne describes his theism as surrelative, meaning that God is both relative and absolute. There is nothing whose being is more affected by relationship with the world. For Hartshorne, God is related to and affected by every individual entity in the cosmos. Hartshorne envisions God as related to the world both internally and externally. God is internally related to the cosmos because God both affects other entities and is affected by them. God is externally related to the cosmos because God's ability to be related to the cosmos cannot be changed by any other entity. Both of these modes of relating concern God's interaction with individuals. The first establishes the relationship; the second asserts that nothing can interfere with or mitigate it. Furthermore, individuals must be able unrestrictedly to affect God in order for God continually to be in optimum relationship to them and to meet their needs. As Hartshorne writes, "It is precisely the ideal case of knowledge, knowledge absolute in certainty and complete adequacy to the known, that must ... be literally and unrestrictedly relative."6 For Hartshorne and other process theologians there are two parts to God's nature, the consequent and the primordial. As they see it, God's consequent nature is affected by interrelationship with entities, whereas God's primordial nature encompasses all the probabilities for relationship (that is, concrescence) that entities might choose. As John Cobb puts it, it is in light of how God is affected by an entity that God puts together the best probabilities and creates an ideal or initial aim for it.7 God presents the initial aim to the becoming entity along with all other probabilities. If the initial aim proves enticing because it puts together as many probabilities as can be put together in a harmonious 6 Charles Hartshorne, The Divine Relativity: A Social Conception of God (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1948), 9. 7 John Cobb, A Christian Natural Theology (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1965), 154-155.</page><page sequence="7">242 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy way, the concrescing entity values it up or down including it more or less in its concrescence. In this scenario, both God's consequent and primordial natures are affected by individual entities. God's primordial nature is not static and unchanging any more than God's consequent nature is. For Hartshorne, what affects God's consequent nature is taken into account in the probabilities that make up God's primordial nature. God's primordial nature reconfigures probabilities as needed in response to the world. In this way, shifts and changes of the world are incorporated into God's knowledge of the cosmos. Furthermore, Hartshorne emphatically points out that God's accruing value does not diminish God's perfection. He says God is not less perfect because God gains value from one moment to the next. God is not less perfect in the first moment than in the second.8 The intimacy of relationship with God underscored by Hartshorne lays the groundwork for the intimacy of individualized constructions of God. For Hartshorne, the process through which God is affected by entities and produces particular aims for them is individualized. In order to fashion the world, God influences entities in a way that requires knowing them intimately. In intimate relationship the world has effects upon God which God then uses to create the world in an ongoing process. "It is," says Hartshorne "by molding himself that God molds us, . . . God orders the universe ... by taking into his own life all the currents of feeling in existence. He is the most irresistible of influences precisely because he is the most open to influence." 9 Creation, then, in this scenario, is specifically the result of intimate relationship in which God is changed by each individual. Extending this view to the organic model, we see how the intimacy of creation that unfolds in the world's construction of God and God's creation of the world emphasizes the historically and culturally located relationship of individuals with God. It is in fact the historical and cultural specifics that constitute God's particular knowledge of individuals and that affect God. At the same time, it is through the historical and cultural particulars that God works most effectively to entice us, to lure us to turn toward God. For Marjorie Suchocki, even more than for Hartshorne, God is intimately connected to individuals' cultural and historical locations. 8 Hartshorne, 47. 9Ibid.,xvii.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 243 Creation is the result of God and the world working together in intimate relationship. God is not distanced from the differences replete within the finite world. Suchocki is primarily concerned with relationships and the complexities and differences that arise from them. For her, the cosmos is becoming increasingly complex and chaotic, and it is only through intimate relationship with individuals that God can offer an enticing order that lures them away from sin and toward goodness. For Suchocki, like Hartshorne, God's consequent nature is affected by each entity. However, in contrast to Hartshorne but in concert with Delwin Brown10 and Cobb,11 Suchocki asserts that God's primordial nature already contains every possible ideal configuration for each individual. This encompassing inclusion is necessary in order for God to respond quickly to the actual situations of individuals. If a person is in serious trouble, God can respond immediately and there is no need for God's primordial nature to first be transformed by added information and then be reconfigured to offer the best initial aim. In Suchocki's configuration of God's primordial and consequent natures, it is possible for God, as Suchocki states, "to know each unit of actuality precisely as it experiences and/or knows itself." 12 God is immediately present in all of existence, and in all stages of the process of concresence. God is in all moments and aspects of creation, including, of course, historical and cultural contingencies. As Suchocki maintains, "God in goodness bends to our condition, fitting divine harmony to the human situation. . . . God shapes our redemption according to who and where and when we are."13 God integrates the particularities of our decisions, which are based on who we are, where we find ourselves, and what is happening to us historically and culturally, into the divine harmony. In this way, God self-creates within interrelationships with individuals. On the one hand, what the world does determines what God works with and what is harmonized in the divine nature. On the other hand, God determines how to work with what the world gives. 10 Delwin Brown, To Set at Liberty: Christian Faith and Human Freedom (Maryknoll, NY: Orbis Books, 1981), 59. nCobb, 230. 12 Marjorie Suchocki, God, Christ, Church: A Practical Guide to Process Theology (New York: Crossroads Press, 1992), 68. 13 Ibid., 170.</page><page sequence="9">244 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Without question, for Suchocki and Hartshorne, God responds to people in their individualized locations. God is affected and changed by each individual in order to respond to particular circumstances, and clearly, changes in God's nature are not directed at all entities but at the particular circumstances of the one entity to which God is responding. Far from being universal or foundational, the initial aim presented by God to an entity is specific to that one entity. Furthermore, it is within historical and cultural particularities that relationship with God occurs and that individuals form images of God and the ontological reality of God. For example, for a Latino woman in Los Angeles, images of God, Our Lady of Guadelupe, and Jesus, and how she interacts with them are quite distinct from Anglo and Euro-Spanish constructions. From an organic view, this means that through the particularities of relationship God becomes multilithic. But, even though Suchocki and Hartshorne do understand God as responsive and changing, they seem to take for granted a monolithic rather than multilithic image of God (whether a being or otherwise). They do not imagine a distinct form of God functioning within distinct, individualized relationships. And yet, they emphasize the effects individual entities have upon God's nature and God's response with an individually tailored initial aim. Certainly it is not their intention to present a multilithic image of God, but as we have seen, there is no reason to assume that their construction logically requires a monolithic image and ontology of God or that ontologies of God cannot be particular to particular relationships. These theologians' work strongly indicates that the construction of God's reality occurs on an individual basis. In light of this individualization, it seems reasonable that there need be no single foundational reality of God. How the divine is ontologically affected by individuals occurs as various separate events. The divine is multilithic and multidimensional, and further, these dimensions are constantly changing. Despite not taking this logical step in the direction of change and dynamism, process theologians establish the ground work for nonfoundational images of God that account for different truth claims and do not confine God to static rigidity. Still, it would be easy to dismiss all this as a misstep away from monotheism in an attempt to explain religious plurality. However, that would be to overlook the essence of what occurs in organic process and to dismiss valid critiques of foundationalism. The organic view presented here is a paradigm for</page><page sequence="10">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 245 overcoming subject/object dualism in the process of a subject's construction of God. It combines postmodern (antifoundationalist) views with process thought and results in a multilithic ontology. The organic paradigm offers a fluid, nonlinear, multidimensional organic framework for thinking about God and God/world relations. To clarify I appeal to Whitehead. Whitehead's model of organic unity rejects the very notion of subject and object as separate realities. There is no emphasis on either because an object is always becoming a part of a concrescing subject and then immediately the newly concresced subject becomes an object for a further subject, and so on in a seamless process. Because of this organic unity of subject and object, Whitehead describes each entity or organism as "superject."14 Subject and object retain their distinctiveness and are not the same, but they also do not remain separate. They are organically interrelated in such a way that each creatively forms the other. For process theologians like Hartshorne and Suchocki, God is never only a subject but also becomes object. Individuals and God each become data for and influence the formation of the other. In this regard Suchocki can say God's creation of the world is a creation with the world rather than a simple creation of the world.15 And we can say the individual's construction of God is a construction with God, and in which God takes part. What God is in individual relationship is never totally separate from what the individual is, and individuals are not separate from what God is. God's ontological being is never totally separate from the historical and cultural everyday location of people. Since this location varies and always involves degrees of difference, sometimes radical, God's nature in various relationships also involves degrees of difference, sometimes radical difference. Here we are not speaking of separate divinities, but rather asserting that the nature of God is unconstrained. That God has differing relationships with individuals does not make God polytheistic. Rather, God acts in infinite ways that affect God's nature and that shape dynamically changing norms. Attempting to make God absolutely monolithic in the midst of these variations ultimately diminishes the reality of God. When we 14 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality, corrected edition, eds. David Ray Griffin and Donald Sherburn (New York: The Free Press, 1929), 28,47. 15Marjorie Suchocki, The Fall to Violence: Original Sin in Relational Theology (New York: Continuum Press, 1994), 56.</page><page sequence="11">246 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy separate God from intimate relationship in which God knows us at least as well as we know ourselves in the intricacies of our lives and needs then we lessen the encompassing reality of God. In an organic view, God's reality takes shape within individual relationships. By being intimately involved in differences, God transgresses monolithic models that do not take radical otherness into account. The Other is never minimized, it is maximized in God's nature. Performing God ven as intimate, God is not simply a projection of individuals' X-/cultural locations, and while God's reality changes, it is not simply because people have different histories. Nor is it at the whim of humans. Those attributes such as relationship with God that ground human identity are not so easily or individualistically put in place. Poststructuralist Judith Butler maintains that the basic realities of identity like gender, while culturally molded, are not chosen as one would chose a coat out of the closet. Rather they are constructed within a continually changing cultural process of hegemony and "interpellation" (interpolation). Butler's poststructuralist thought illuminates the constructive task that occurs in individuals' relationships with God, especially as it goes beyond projection and relativism. The performative (performance like) aspect of constructions is addressed by Butler who, although primarily dealing with gender and political issues, neverthless goes beyond what one can call correspondence poststructuralist thought. A correspondence view narrows the constructive task to the subject, a person, constructing images of the object, God or otherwise, that merely correspond to the subject's cultural location. I argue this is a narrow view in three respects. First, it considers the subject and object as separated entities, not interrelated, not affecting each other, and not creating one another. It does not acknowledge that what we construct, whether God or gender, has its own effects on what we become and how we act or perform in our culture and world. Second, a correspondence view pits truth claims and claims to reality against constructions; it maintains that what is constructed cannot be real. And, third, it does not take into account changes and deviations from the cultural norm and how they might affect constructions. The correspondence view sees constructions as essentially static and does</page><page sequence="12">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 247 not consider that they do not become norms until they are contrasted with or challenged by deviations. Butler's work recognizes these problems and attempts to move beyond them. In discussing the interrelation of subject and object, she states that "construction is neither a single act nor a causal process initiated by a subject and culminating in a set of fixed effects."16 Instead, it is a process in which construction occurs through reiteration, by which, she explains, both subjects and acts come to appear.17 For Butler, no power or influence, cultural or historical, exists that is so dominant that what the subject constructs is only a mirror of that influence. Reiteration goes beyond mirroring as subject and acts form one another. It is within just such a reiterative process, I contend, that God and individuals mold a divine/world relationship that impacts the shape of God. Furthermore, when considering gender constructions, Butler maintains that subjective, performative constructions are "not over and against what is true." 18 It is not, she says, "fantasy over and against reality." 19 The same can be said for organic constructions of God: they are not fantasy over and against reality. Butler asserts concerning gender and bodily materiality that there is a necessity that accompanies primary and irrefutable experiences such that they cannot be thought of as mere constructions or "masks." Primary body experiences for Butler are things such as living, eating, feeling pain and pleasure, enduring illness and violence. Among these, from the perspective of the organic relationship between God and humans, can be included the experience of God. For people constructing images of God, the experience of God is primary and irrefutable. It is that without which, as Butler says of primary experiences, "we would not be able to think, to live, to make sense at all . . . we could not operate without them." 20 While Butler might be aghast at this inclusion of God, her concept of performing cultural constructs delineates how images and experiences of God are formed. It offers a viable perspective on what is going on in the process 16 Judith Butler, Bodies that Matter (New York: Routledge Press, 1993), 10. 17 Ibid. 18 Ibid., 6. 19 Ibid. 20 Ibid.,xi.</page><page sequence="13">248 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy of believing and what is going on that makes images "true" when people construct images of God. For Butler, constructions are "performed" because they are being "played out" as they are being formed. Primary experience becomes embodied or constructed only through a process of reiteration or defining again and again in discourse. In this discursive process, the construction itself is continually changed and redefined. Echoing Whitehead, Butler does not separate subject and object, but engages them in a process of reiteration by which they are organically intertwined. In this process, subject and object not only form one another but also transgress each other thereby changing the norms of which they are a part. Further, the shape of a construction, or what will be considered the "norm" for that image is not fiilly defined until it is differentiated from other emerging shapes with which it does not fit. The "norm" or identification of what a construct should be and thus what is believed in is formed only as the process of construction takes place. The norm develops at the same time as the construction, rather than the norm being defined and then the image constructed to fit the norm. Butler understands performativity, "not as the act by which a subject brings into being what he or she names, but, rather as that reiterative power of discourse to produce the phenomena that it regulates and constrains."21 The construction, therefore, whether of God or gender, is not merely a reflection of a subject's cultural norms. Through reiteration, there is an interaction between the subject/self standing within a norm and that which the subject/self constructs around and within him or her self. The construction then is not a mask but a necessity. It becomes primary and irrefutable. Constructions are "disruptive" of the norms because they are continually redefined, but the disruptions become as Butler explains, "a critical resource" as individuals struggle to construct images of the self or, in this case, of God that are legitimate and intelligible22 within their cultural and historical location. Here, room is left for the radically Other both to develop and to be acknowledged as such. Performed images of God include the radically Other of plurality and individual construction and also account for change. The differences created in God by performance can be extensive, as evidenced by the broad array of constructions. For some, 21 Ibid., 2. 22 Ibid., 3.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. 23, No. 3, September 2002 249 God really is love, for some judge. For various individuals, God really is anthropomorphic companion or conceptual ground of Being and God functions as such in relationship. For the African-American community Jesus/God as co-sufferer takes on a different shape than in the Anglo community. These conceptions/constructions can influence and be incorporated by one another, but the way God is performed in different locations and cultures makes God different in different performances. God functions in a particular way in each relationship and is thus formed in particular ways that are a real part of God's nature in those instances. Within cultures individuals may have similar relationships with God, and as cultures overlap there may be similarities. Forms of God may overlap or intertwine, but the shapes expressed are real within particular relationships. In this organic, reiterative process the nature of God, what God really is, is shaped while in relationship with individuals and cultures. In this regard, these performances fit an organic view of God as multifaceted, fluid, and unconstrained. In the midst of God's varying ontological formations, God's performance with us remains loving, and God unceasingly desires connection with humanity and the whole cosmos. Out of this desire, God is omnipresent continually and omnipotent necessarily. However, each of these grounding characteristics is played out in multifaceted and changing ways. Out of love, God connects us to God's self and to a more flexible Kingdom by continually reconfiguring possibilities. To make connections, God responds with different orders or patterns of interaction as required by various historical and cultural circumstances. Thus exhibiting omnipotence, God nevertheless orders the cosmos not like a King ordering subjects about but by designing shifting moments of perfection that we understand to be connection to and performance with God. Omnipotence here is the ability to make flexible, changing connections. God's love, wisdom and power are unceasing but they are neither monolithic nor static. They are arrayed again and again in multifaceted, nonlinear moving patterns. This absolute fluidity that we understand to be God encompasses all the vast probabilities and harmonies that come together to make moments of perfection. As each of these moments connects us to the Kingdom of God, we become more than we could be otherwise. We enter a constructive performance space where our connection with God is played out and we become more than our historical and cultural particularities.</page><page sequence="15">250 American Journal of Theology &amp; Philosophy Along with Hartshorne and Suchocki, Butler's work emphasizes individualized aspects of the construction of reality. Butler conveys the intimacy and individuality of each person's primary experiences and how those experiences become embodied as they are performed or played out in discourse and reiteration. As individuals play out or perform their construction of God, the intimacy of their relationship with God develops, just as Hartshorne and Suchocki maintain, until there is, in one's life, nothing more intimate and personalized than God. This is the absolute relativity of God that takes into account and that allows God to take into God's own nature, whether consequent or primordial, the individual location and circumstances of each person. However, Butler's view adds to process theology the specific notion that as individuals act out their relationship with God, the nature of God changes for that individual. Furthermore, Butler takes steps to define how constructions of God could be individual and yet ontological, that is, real, a problem that Hartshorne and Suchocki do not go so far as to address even though they emphasize individualized relationships with God. By showing how constructions, whether of God or gender, are formed within culture through reiteration and performance, Butler challenges theologians to take up transgressive constructions of God that challenge the monolithic sameness of modernity. While organic constructions of God are real, primary experience, they are not foundational or monolithic in the traditional sense. They are multilithic, individualized ontologies that embody the dynamic interactions of the cosmos. Individual, particularized ontologies or constructions make God the most real because they include the most particular as well as encompassing the widest possible reality. To dismiss human, culturally located constructions of God as meaningless because in them God is not "real" misses the intense, specific reality of God. These constructions are more meaningful than monolithic foundational images can be. They are full of meaning for the life and circumstances of each individual. God's response is not general and vague; it is specific and pertinent to each person. Only this kind of organic view of God is adequate to encompass our diverse historical and cultural locations. Its beauty23 is that it is unhindered by the strictures of modernity and so escapes sameness. 23 Beauty is, in a process understanding, the most complex and varied configuration of probabilities that is also harmonious.
