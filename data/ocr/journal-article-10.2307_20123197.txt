<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DIVINE EXISTENCE: AN ANSWER TO MR. HARTvSHORNE I have read Mr. Hartshorne's comments on my review of his book, The Divine Relativity, with interest and instruction. He has, I believe, clarified his position in certain important respects. On some points, my criticisms may have arisen from insufficient understanding. But on others, his clarifying com ments accentuate certain issues which lie between us. In view of the basic importance of these issues for metaphysics and natural theology, I am very happy to continue the discussion. Mr. Hartshorne thinks that I have failed to do justice to his composite conception of Deity as in a certain respect "absolute" and in another "relative." My failure, I suppose, was due to the grave difficulties which seem to me to attach to any such view. In this case, I can only say that Mr. Hartshorne's further explanations have for me rather intensified than solved these perplexities. How can a being be both absolute and rel ative, independent and dependent in existence ? In his book it seemed to me that Mr. Hartshorne was emphasizing the relativity rather than the absoluteness of this "Deity." Hence I felt that I might be doing more justice to his doctrine by considering this aspect of it alone, without con fronting him with what seem to me to be the even greater dif ficulties attaching to a theory of the Deity as both absolute and relative all at once. But now this seems impossible, for Mr. Hartshorne is clearly defending this composite view (p. 32).1 Hence I must consider it, and raise some of those objections which such a view in my opinion has to face. I think they may be best suggested by examining the freedom from need which Mr. Hartshorne believes he can attribute to his Deity (p. 38). This I think can be truly predicated of any being who is existentially independent. Mr. Hartshorne argues that it can be truly predicated of the being with which he is concerned, since this being never lacks a world of some sort, the class of 1 Unless otherwise indicated, all page references are to Hartshorne's Reply in this issue. [61]</page><page sequence="2">62 John Wild creatures never being empty, and since "the exhaustive actual ization of possibilities is nonsense" (p. 38). Now even though it be granted that God never lacks some creatures he requires for His concrete perfection, it is quite clear that on Mr. Hart shorne's view He always lacks an indefinite number of further perfections which He might have but does not have. This strikes me as the description of a being which is incomplete or potential in nature, which needs to have this nature fulfilled by change, and which is therefore finite. By finite being I mean precisely something whose nature is potential in this way, lacking further existence which it needs to fulfill itself. I do not understand how the predicates "absolute" and "independ ent" can be properly attached to such a being. Nor do I understand how such a being as this can be held to exist necessarily, by any version of the traditional, ontological argument or by any other argument. Mr. Hartshorne replies to this objection by asserting that "God has a necessary essence in a literal sense . . . which is certain always to be actualized, though never certain to be actualized in this way rather than that ..." (p. 43). In other words, once granted that the divine essence exists, it must necessarily actualize itself in concrete "accidents." Here Mr. Hartshorne has definitely misunderstood my question. I am not asking why something must happen when such an essence exists. I am asking why any such essence, or essence-plus-accidents must actually exist at all. The classical arguments of western natural theology have answered this question by asserting that the Divine essence is precisely the act of existing. Such an existence, if there is one, cannot not exist. Whether or not such arguments can be ultimately defended, on this point at least they make sense. But Mr. Hartshorne has clearly cut himself off from any such theory. I am very puzzled as to what he means by the divine essence, and even as to whether he means by it anything at all. But certainly it is clearly distinct from the act of existing, for it is "empty or abstract" and definitely opposed to "the concrete ness or fullness of factuality which is . . . uniquely present in his (God's) particular actuality now..." (p. 42). "Empty outlines" (p. 43) and other abstractions of this sort are no doubt</page><page sequence="3">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 63 present in the minds of philosophers. But they certainly do not necessarily exist. Their non-existence would involve no contradiction, as is indeed true of all the finite entities known to us. The nature of such a thing, plant, animal, or man, is not to exist. Hence they may gain it from some external source, or not. Such con tingency also attaches to the essence of Mr. Hartshorne's deity, apparently in a most exaggerated form, since this essence is "abstract," "indeterminate," and as we have seen, "infinitely less than actuality." Now my question is this. Why should such an empty abstraction exist in the first place, or why should it exist with some set of concrete "accidents" which it needs for its completion ? More basically the question may be phrased in this way. Why should anything whose essence is not exist ence itself necessarily exist ? It is true that Mr. Hartshorne has suggested an answer in his new version of the ontological argument.2 The first premise of this argument is as follows: "whatever is coherently conceivable is either actual or an unactualized (but real, more than merely logical) potency." 3 In my opinion this premise is fallacious. By "coherently conceivable" Hartshorne means: (1) not nonsense; and (2) not self-contradictory like round square. Hence any concept which is self-consistent, means something which is really possible in the actual world. This I find to be clearly false. Logical consistency in the concept is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for real possibility. In addition to this, there must be an actual, existent cause, or causes, really capable of producing the consistent effect. To omit this is to confuse logical possibility, the capacity to be thought, with real pos sibility, the capacity to exist in rerum natura. Thus I can think of a Chopin prelude, having the proper Chopin style and struct ure, but quite distinct from any of those composed by him. Such a concept is perfectly consistent. It contains no inner contradictions. Yet this does not show that such a prelude 2 Philosophical Review, LUI (1944), pp. 225-45. 3 Ibid, p. 225.</page><page sequence="4">64 John Wild is really possible. As a matter of fact it is not, because Chopin no longer exists to compose it. The capacity to conceive of something cannot be equated with the capacity really to exist. It is not sufficient for Mr. Hartshorne to think coherently of his Deity Whose essence is not to exist, but something far short of actuality. What evidence has he to offer for the real existence of such an entity ? even more for its necessary existence ? What contradiction would we fall into if we sup posed it non-existent ? I have read several times Mr. Hartshorne's lengthy dis cussion of the divine essence and existence, but I find no clear cut answer to this question. He devotes considerable space to the consideration of a question which he thinks I raised in my review, i.e., how he can in his own terms refute the ontological argument in its classical form (p. 45). I never raised this question, and I still do not raise it. My question is this: what argument or arguments does Mr. Hartshorne have to offer for the actual existence of his surrelative Deity ? The classical ontological and causal arguments conclude in a non-finite being Whose essence is the fact of existing, and Who, therefore, exists necessarily. It is quite clear that Mr. Hartshorne rejects these arguments in their classical form, for he wishes to reach a very different conclusion ? the existence of a being meeting all the requirements of what has been universally considered finitude, an essence really distinct from its concrete actuality, possessing vast capacities for further completion and enrich ment. My question is simply this: what evidence has Mr. Hart shorne to offer for the existence of such a being as this outside of his own mind ? So far I have received no answer. One reason for this, I believe, lies in Mr. Hartshorne's tendency to identify being with abstract "constants," "universals which are not modified by changing circumstances" . . . and which are "in becoming" (p. 32). As a matter of fact, he attributes to me the radically essentialist view that subordinates concrete dynamism to such fixed and changeless essences. Thus I cannot enter even provisionally into his concrete mode of thought because I am "so completely in the habit of assuming: ( 1 ) that pure being is primary and superior, becoming second</page><page sequence="5">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 65 ary and inferior; and (2) that the absolute is primary and Superior to the relative . . ." (p. 32). Hartshorne on the other hand, with logic by his side, "supports throughout the notion that the absolute, or the constant, independent, and necessary, is in the relative, dependent, and contingent happenings, not vice versa . . ." (p. 34). I am somewhat bewildered by this charge, as I am unaware of having said anything of this sort in my review or indeed anywhere else, and he fails to give any quoted evidence to substantiate it. Hence I can only assert categorically that I do not hold the ontological conceptions he attributes to me. A brief explanation may perhaps clarify some of the most basic issues that lie between us. As I use the term being, it is certainly not to be identified with that fixed and determinate aspect of finite being which has been traditionally called essence. It includes this of course within its range of extension, as indeed it includes everything whatsoever, every mode or kind of being from the most abstract to the most concrete. But being is not exhausted by the con stant, changeless essences of finite things and accidents. It also includes the act of existing which realizes such possibilities, bringing them out of their causes, and giving them a being of their own in rerum natura. Being thus refers to anything which is able to be in any way (essence) and that existence which realizes them. In fact only nothingness is excluded from the range of this primary concept. How can anything whatsoever that is in any sense real fail to be ? Hence when Mr. Hartshorne thinks of being as exclusively identifiable with abstract phases, "elements" of which "are found in concrete happenings" (p. 33), many questions leap to my mind. If being is only an abstract phase of concrete happenings, what then of the remainder ? Must we say that this is not ? Then it is nothing. Obviously this is far from Mr. Hartshorne's position. But if, as he says, being is only an "element" lying "in the relative, dependent, and contingent happening" (p. 34), how is this to be avoided ? I think some further clarification of his ultimate ontological categories is required.</page><page sequence="6">66 John Wild He identifies being with "the absolute or the constant, inde pendent, and necessary" which is an abstract phase of "con tingent happenings" (p. 34). But is it not clear that he is here using the terms "absolute," "independent," and "necessary" in a very peculiar, and to use his own epithet, "Pickwickian" sense ? If the whole concrete happening is "contingent," in what sense can an abstract phase of this contingent happening, contained within it, he absolute or necessary ? Surely not in its existence. If so, it would necessarily exist, and could not be called contingent. If not, then we are surely concerned with a finite entity, whose essence is distinct from its existence. If such an entity is found to be existent, its existence is supplied to it from some source beyond itself. Such an entity cannot be called "absolute," or "necessary," or "independent" in any strict and proper sense. Of course we can say that the essence (those determinate traits without which such an entity cannot be such ) is absolute and necessary in the sense that if such an entity is given exist ence, then it must have such traits. But this is only a hypo thetical and derived necessity, which does not deserve to be called absolute. It is certainly quite different from that existen* tial necessity which is the object of the classical arguments for an unconditioned being. This is not a being with a "necessary" essence in the sense that it is fixed and determinate. Any finite essence would meet these conditions. What is involved here is a being whose intrinsic essence demands existence, which can itself account for its own act of existing, and which there fore exists necessarily. Mr. Hartshorne's tendency to identify being with essence leads him, I believe, to slur over this question of existence, to think that he has settled it in the case of his surrelative deity by mentioning certain edifying traits that must necessarily belong to it if it exists, the capacity to make a world, the exhaust ive knowledge of what has been, an indefinite capacity for further expansion, etc., if it exists. But what is the reason for supposing that such a being actually exists ? In what sense is this existence necessary ? If it is not, what then brought it into existence ? In what sense is its existence "absolute" and</page><page sequence="7">The Divine Existence : An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 67 "independent" ? These are the questions I have sought to bring to Mr. Hartshorne's attention. So far I have not received an answer Turning now to the question of whole and part, I find again that Mr. Hartshorne has not quite understood the nature of the question I tried to raise in my review. Since this is prob ably due to a lack of clarity in my own statement, let me try to formulate it again. Mr. Hartshorne still thinks that the whole "is itself something distinct from the parts" (p. 52). He then proceeds to defend his theory that the relation of whole to part is not "convertible," the whole being really related to the parts, but the parts not really related to the whole. My question, however, did not concern the kind of relation between whole and parts. I was questioning rather the under lying assumption. Is there any real relation between whole and parts ? I question this, for, as I see it, a relation must involve a real difference between that which has the relation, and the term to which it is-related. Hence if there is any relation of any type whatsoever between whole and parts, the whole must be more than all the parts. I called this view "the theory of the organic whole." Perhaps I should have used another term. But irrespective of what we call it, I still think it is impossible, for at least two reasons. The first is this. If all the parts, A, B, C, both relational and non-relational, of a single whole, when they are present, give rise to a new entity, W, distinct from all of them, but including them (p. 52), I ask why then do not these entities A, B, C, W, when they are present, give rise to a new entity X, distinct from all of them but including them, and so on ? If it is answered that they (A, B, C, W) simply do not, since they constitute a finished whole, then I ask why the same cannot be said of A, B, C? i.e. all the parts ? Why is anything more necessary ? Why cannot they constitute the whole, W, as I am sure they do, in the first place ? If it is answered that A, B, C, W do give rise to a new entity X, then we are in an infinite regress, as we always are when we start to imagine fictitious entities.</page><page sequence="8">68 John Wild The second reason is apparently recognized by Hartshorne himself, who notes that "this (i.e., the organic theory) cannot be if any analysis is possible." 4 What he means, I think, is this. If the whole is more than all the parts, then any parts into which we analyze any such whole will always be inade quate, and distinct from the whole itself. Such a whole will always be something new and unique which cannot be exhaust ively analyzed. I think Hartshorne is correct in pointing out that this must lead to a mysticism in which all true analysis is impossible. We certainly agree on this. But then I wish to know how his own doctrine ? that the whole is distinct from all the parts (p. 52) ? whether it be called "organic" or not, escapes from this criticism. I suggest that the way to avoid it is to hold that the whole is nor distinct from all the parts, and therefore not related to them, but actually constituted by them. With respect to Mr. Hartshorne's doctrine, concerning the "inclusion" of what is known in the knower, I am not sure that further argument is profitable. Here I think we simply disagree. I cannot see how even the most exact knowledge I could ever conceivably possess of Africa would bring Africa within me, except in that particular, noetic, intentional sense, which is quite distinct from any physical or spatial "inclusion." The basic idealism of Mr. Hartshorne's thought leads him categorically to reject any such distinction (p. 55). But without some distinction of this sort his thesis seems to me to be sheer nonsense. To know Africa of course is to include it within the scope of my knowledge. It is not physically to include it. Of course my own pain is physically inside me, and I can know it (cf. p. 55). But I fail to see how this proves that everything I know is similarly inside. There is no evident correlation between "being known" and "being inside" in this sense. There are many things inside me, like my cortical cells, which I hardly know at all, and many things outside me, like my friends, whom I know rather well. 4 The Divine Relativity (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1948), p. 69. Cf. Reply, p. 53.</page><page sequence="9">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 69 Mr. Hartshorne suggests that "the known is external just to the extent in which we really fail to know it..." (p. 55). In the case of physical things and other persons, I submit that this theory is demonstrably false. Childish views of nature are subjective and egomorphic. At first we interpret others as though they were mere extensions of ourselves. The more we know about these beings, the more we recognize their external ity, and come to understand them precisely in their otherness from ourselves. This failure to distinguish between entitative and noetic presence underlies Mr. Hartshorne's view of the past as being "included in" the present, and therefore actual (pp. 56 f.). He claims to be using the term "inclusion" in a special sense distinct from spatial inclusion, but from his remarks I am not as yet at all clear as to what this special sense is. As a realist, I believe that the noetic faculty immaterially grasps or assimil ates its object, and in this sense "includes" it. But apart from this sense, certainly not that of entitative "inclusion," I fail to see any natural meaning for the term "inclusion" which would justify the assertion that the present entitatively "in cludes" the actuality of the past. In fact this doctrine would seem to me to destroy the distinction between past and present, as I tried to indicate in my review. If the past is entitatively included in the present, how then can it escape from being itself a part of the present, and thus present ? So far as I can see, neither the relation of container to contained, nor that of whole to part, is equivalent to that of present to past. To say that the past is still actual seems equivalent to the statement that it is present, and thus not past. As to Mr. Hartshorne's objection to the view expressed by me that the past is now no longer actual, but that it may be made noetically (not entitatively) present by the cognitive faculties of memory, etc. (pp. 56 f.), I answer as follows. We live in a passing, temporal reality. What now is, ceases to be. As past, it is not. But it once was. This past cannot, of course, be identified with possible being. But neither can it he identified with absolute nothingness which is not, never was, and nether will be. Our noetic faculties are not restricted to Mr. Hart</page><page sequence="10">70 John Wild shorne's categories ? the actual, the potential, and absolute nothingness. They can also make noetically present what now physically is not, but once was, or at some time will be. Mr. Hartshorne now sees some difficulty with the thesis that the subject of a relation "includes' its term (pp. 58 ff.), and the whole subject of relation is at present in a very con fused and uncertain state. But I am still puzzled by his asser tion that "to be contemporary is . . . the absence of relation" (p. 58). It is not true that I am now related to my children as their father, and that right now Boston is north of New York ? These are clearly real relations. But I find no natural sense of the word "inclusion" which would enable me to say that I include my children, or that New York includes Boston. Hence I see no justifiable reason for Mr. Hartshorne's reluc tance to abandon the idea that the subject of a relation "includes" its term. This may have something to do with the, to me, obscure and very widespread usage he makes of this term "inclusion," and his acceptance of the idealistic thesis that "If we abstract from all meaning, awareness, and feeling, and consider bare "objects," they exhibit no sort of positively con ceivable real connectedness" (p. 55). I turn now to Mr. Hartshorne's objections to classical theism. I suppose that he would admit the extreme difficulty of this topic, involving as it does a transcendant existence, concerning whose insight and activity we can have at best only a dim and inadequate understanding. One thing that rather worries me about the surrelative deity is the fact that Mr. Hartshorne seems to be able to understand Him so well. The questions he puts to classical theism cannot possibly be answered without becoming involved in all the basic problems of theology. They have been asked before. I am ready to admit that no answer yet formulated fullv satisfies me. Is there any theology yet formulated that is fully satisfactory to any active intellect ? And yet these matters lie at the very heart of ontology. They are of central importance for the practical endeavors of men. They cannot be ignored except at the risk of betraying the obligations of philosophy. No solution yet proposed is</page><page sequence="11">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 71 fully adequate. All are subject to grave difficulties. It is a matter of selecting that mode of approach which is least inade quate. In the remaining portion of my reply I shall try to indicate my reasons for believing that even with respect to Divine freedom and the Divine caritas, Mr. Hartshorne's view is subject to objections more serious than those he urges against a more classical approach. I agree with his objection to the Thomistic doctrine of Divine pre-motion of the human "free" will (cf. p. 46). As has often been pointed out, the human "freedom" which results from this theory is extremely diluted and attenuated. I should go at least as far as Mr. Hartshorre in asserting unequivocally in accordance with what I take tc be unambiguous, empirical evidence that within a certain limited field man is able to choose between alternative courses of action. Mr. Hartshorne, how ever, has a tendency to identify freedom exclusively with liberty of choice. This leads him to neglect another factor, that of spontaneity, which in my opinion is also required for the exercise of freedom, and which underlies all liberty of choice. The questions Mr. Hartshorne raises concerning the Divine freedom concern liberty of choice. None of them refers to spontaneity. The first (pp. 17-18) is this. If God is neces sary in the sense that He cannot not be, how then are we to understand His freedom, and more especially His free choice to create a world of creatures ? If this choice is really free, it might not have been. If it is really present in God, must this not require us to abandon the concept of an absolutely necessary and self-sufficient being ? Mr. Hartshorne thinks so. Hence he defends the thesis that we must reject this classical conception and substitute that of a Deity Who is incomplete and imperfect, Who needs creatures in some sense independent of Himself, but Who is really free in the sense that He chooses between alternatives that are actually possible in the way that is familiar to us. Admitting that Mr. Hartshorne has made his point in a cocrent way, and raised an objection bristling with well-known difficulties, what of his own view of the Divine freedom ? How free is his Deity ? Is He free in the most perfect sense of this</page><page sequence="12">72 John Wild word ? In dealing with this question we must attempt at least a brief analysis of freedom itself, a task which also has its difficulties. As we have already remarked, this line of argument identifies freedom exclusively with freedom of choice. I believe that it omits something even more important, on which freedom of choice, if it is to be real, must be based. This is a factor of inner power or command over the situation. Anglo-Saxon ethical thought has in my opinion been singularly blind to this factor, recognizing it, if at all, in purely negative terms as merely freedom from compulsion or external restraint. Of course it includes this, but also something positive ? a spon taneity of action, welling up in the agent. Without this, free dom of choice cannot be realized, and is either extremely atte nuated (provided some spontaneity exists) or purely nominal. We recognize this artificial character in many of the so-called "freedoms" which have been widely celebrated in this country, such as the freedom of a laborer to leave his job and take another, of any man to start a newspaper if he so chooses, etc., etc. Such freedoms can be asserted only if we forget about the actual power and resources of those supposed to be able to exercise them. Genuine freedom of choice must rest on a high degree of security and spontaneous power in the agent. Such actual power is the very foundation of free choice which is a sort of crowning expression of inner, spontaneous independence. Human nature is essentially weak and dependent upon a vast multiplicity of extraneous factors which always restrict it. Hence human beings realize their freedom only in very limited degrees. Nevertheless even the slightest tinge of inward spontaneity and freedom bestows a peculiar dignity upon the human person when he achieves it. Such free achievements are always hedged in by many external constraints. But we can distinguish in our voluntary activity certain levels, possessing an increasing degree of spontaneity and freedom, starting with the acceptance of given situations, like the fact of being born, being in the world, etc., which expresses no spontaneity or choice.</page><page sequence="13">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 73 Next there are the nominal choices we have spoken of which involve, we may say, a certain insignificant and minimal degree of freedom. A laborer with a family could abstractly and theoretically leave a job for which he has been trained, and prepare himself for another. But unless his circumstances are very exceptional, this would involve such financial loss, and such a material and psychological upheaval that the exercise of this freedom would jeopardize the very life and spontaneity of which it is supposed to be an expression. There is not suf ficient power and command in the agent to give it an adequate foundation. Hence it possesses only a minimal degree of free dom, not really capable of being exercised with the survival of the agent's integrity and spontaneity, and hence purely nominal in character. Next there are forced choices between alternatives no one of which would have been freely chosen by the agent. To submit to an overwhelming tyranny or run the risk of death is such a choice. Such situations may be met by choices involving the highest degree of human heroism. But it is not difficult to see that the element of freedom is acutely limited by the weakness of the agent, who cannot choose anything he spon taneously desires, but only the lesser evil. There is a higher level of freedom in which we choose between what is evil and what is good. But since evil is what corrupts our activity and destroys our spontaneity, this also is only a subliminal degree of freedom. It is only at the next higher level that we come to human acts that really deserve to be called free. Here we freely choose between goods. Of course such choices concern only means, since the ultimate end of human activity has been determined for us, and is beyond our control. In so far as a certain means is dictated by this natural end, we are less free in choosing it. But sometimes we may choose between means which are so nearly equal that a genuine exer cise of free choice is possible. Now in such cases I think we can see that a higher degree of freedom attaches to those means: (1) which are Zeasr necessary to the attainment of</page><page sequence="14">74 John Wild the end; and (2) which, therefore, make the least real difference to the spontaneous activity of the agent. Think, for example, of a master-violonist, who eminently possesses the power to play a difficult piece, and who spon taneously desires to play it. Suppose then that he is offered two instruments from which he may choose. If one is clearly worse than the other, his choice will be less free, for he will realize that the better instrument will be required for the proper playing of the piece. Without this, the end may not be attainable. Hence the choice of this better instrument will make a great difference to him. If this is denied, he may even refuse to play. But if the two instruments are almost equal in quality, his choice will be freer. It will make less difference to him. Of course, the greater his talent and musical power, the more indif ferent, and therefore the freer his choice will be, and the less real difference it will make in attaining the end. If great enough, he may be willing to use a very defective instrument. Still even in cases of this sort, some instrument is necessary for achieving the end, and the result will be at least slightly different depending on the choice. As a result of the foregoing analysis, it seems to me to be clear that perfect freedom would be the exercise of a free choice resting upon the most perfect spontaneous power and autonomy. If this choice is to be made with the maximum freedom, it must concern something on which the activity of the agent is least dependent, in the limiting case not dependent at all. If so, the choice itself must merge with the spontaneous action itself, making no real difference to it at all, though making a vast difference to the violin that is played. To the player, the choice is purely an expression of his activity as a musician. It makes no difference as he sees it, for the piece will be played in either case ? just the same. So his choice adds nothing to his action, though it is no mere caprice. The piece will be played either way. All right, then; let us turn to theology. As I see it, freedom is one of the most basic human values. It is a simple perfection, not necessarily restricted to man. Hence I believe that it must be attributed to God. Indeed, I should defend the proposition that</page><page sequence="15">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 75 God is necessarily free, in the same sense that He cannot be otherwise than free in an eminent or perfect degree. According to what we can see of the imperfect levels of freedom in man, I should say that this must mean first of all, an absolutely un hampered and unrestricted spontaneity of action. This is the very heart of freedom. If it is to be crowned by freedom of choice, this choice must be free in the most perfect and eminent sense. This must mean a choice wholly uninfluenced by any extraneous, or any internal, natural, or moral necessity of any kind. Such a perfectly free choice could be made only by an existence of infinite perfection, hampered by nothing, needing nothing, obliged by nothing. The autonomous existence would exist necessarily, not in the sense that any act would be excluded from it, but precisely in the sense that it exists of itself alone, in perfect self-suffi ciency, dependent on nothing and necessitated by nothing, not even that essence or nature which our familiarity with finite creatures leads us to attribute to it. In attributing even those simple perfections which are not essentially mixed with finitude to unconditioned being, we must be very careful to remove every incidental element of limitation from them, so that we are left with the pure perfection in its unlimited or eminent sense. Necessity is no exception to this rule. God is not restricted or necessitated in any way. These are finite mani festations of necessity. He is necessary only in the eminent or negative sense of the absence of all constraint. It is this infi nite spontaneity, that cannot not be, this free act of existing that must be. Such a being of course lies far beyond our powers of clear apprehension. Nevertheless there is certainly no le gitimate reason for refusing to grant it the perfection of liberty of choice. Indeed the existence of finite and contingent creatures shows that such a choice must be granted. Such an agent, however, beyond both necessity and free dom in the usual senses of these words, would not require the result of this choice as a means, for the choice would be per fectly free. Furthermore the choice itself would make no real difference to the agent, but would merge with the infinite spon taneity of His existential action. It might, however, make a</page><page sequence="16">76 John Wild vast difference to something resulting from the choice (cf. the violin). I believe that the act of creation ex nihilo, as analyzed by the classical defenders of western theology, meets these require ments of perfect freedom. It is based upon an unlimited act of unrestricted existence, subject to no external nor internal compulsion. This creation is not required as a means for the fulfilment or completion of the Divine existence. Finally the choice adds no new entitative accident to God, though it brings the world into being. I see many possible contradictions but no necessary con tradiction in the view that a perfectly free being should freely bestow existence upon finite beings sharing to some degree in His own free spontaneity, and capable, like Himself, of making genuinely free choices within the limits determined by their nature. I see no insuperable objection to the view that He is aware of our freedom and that He acts towards us in ways which are appropriate to free persons, and which preserve our freedom intact. I see no contradiction in maintaining that He may freely care for us and even suffer for us. But this concern and suffering must be carefully purified of all anthropomorphic limitations before they can be attributed to a being who is infinite and perfectly autonomous. When purified in this way they will be distinct from our concern and suffering in at least two basic respects. First, they will be freely willed with perfect spontaneity, and thus in no sense externally demanded or imposed. Second, they will be directed solely to their objects, with a radiant generosity which our love can only rarely and remotely approximate. Sometimes, it is true, we come to love someone freely, almost for his own sake. But in such human love there is always a certain element of self-reference and constraint. We love our friend partly because of the joy we feel in his presence, of what he does for us, etc. In God these factors of self-reference are completely eliminated. If He loves us it must be for our sake alone, with a completely outward-going generosity, since He has nothing to gain. If He suffers for us it must be similarly a suffering spontaneously given to us, and for us alone, not a</page><page sequence="17">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 77 suffering for Himself, since He has nothing to lose. I see no necessary contradiction between the divine infinity and the divine freedom and necessity when these are eminently and properly understood. These traits must all be analogously attributed to Him in the most perfect degree. They must belong to the object of any rationally purified human worship. But now let us examine Mr. Hartshorne's Deity. In what sense is He free ? The view I have been briefly outlining no doubt has its difficulties, and certainly its mysteries. But Mr. Hartshorne's more anthropomorphic conception, while possibly freer from any sense of mystery, is nevertheless subject to far more serious objections from the standpoint of religious wor ship. This Deity has, of course, a certain degree of spontaneity, but this is definitely limited. He is incapable of creation in the strict sense (ex nihilo), the most spontaneous form of tran sitive action that is conceivable, for, as I understand it, he rejects this idea. His God is, therefore, always confronted with something external, for which He is not responsible, and which limits His freedom from the outside. He is also subject to an inner necessity, which binds Him to act 5 on the given situation confronting Him. This also limits His freedom of choice. He is apparently not free to do evil, for His decisions are always "right." But this means that in His externally directed acts He is subject to a moral necessity which obliges Him to do what is best. This may make Him very "moral" and worthy of the high est respect, but so far as freedom is concerned, it leaves Him only those clearly imperfect modes of which men are capable. He may make "forced choices" between evils. On occasion He may choose between means that are almost equally good. But such a choice will be distinct from the future end to be attained which it will actually benefit to a greater or less degree. Hence the choice will be partly determined by this end, and not completely free. What is this end ? As I understand Mr. Hartshorne, it is the greatest possible maximizing of limited goods. But such a quantitative conception 5 The Divine Relativity, op. cit., p. 86.</page><page sequence="18">78 John Wild is subject to indefinite increase. An indefinite future time con fronts this Being. No matter how great an aggregate of goods is achieved, more are always possible. Can a final, ultimate good ever be achieved ? It would seem not. But if not, I find it hard to reconcile any concept of perfect liberty with the picture of an immortal Sisyphus, condemned to the constant climbing of a steep ascent which has no final summit. If there is no final end, in what sense are these moral means ? Means to what ? How are they to be justified ? I have merely tried to indicate some of the difficulties which one may honestly feel in connection with Mr. Hart shorne's view of the divine freedom. The picture he leaves in one's mind is that of a finite being, something very much like a man on a vastly magnified scale, hemmed in by external obstructions and necessities, and struggling with heroic intens ity for an unattainable and non-existent goal. I cannot see any very high degree of freedom in this picture. Hence it seems to me that with all its defects and difficulties, which are in desperate need of clarification, the classical approach is prefer able. It is, in my opinion, capable of yielding an intelligible concept of more perfect liberty, and certainly a sense of sharper transcendance. Mr. Hartshorne devotes considerable attention to the many difficulties and downright contradictions which he claims to find in classical theories concerning divine foreknowledge of free acts and divine knowledge of creatures in general. So far as his polemics are directed against the Thomistic theory of divine pre-motion I believe that a strong case can be made. As I have already stated, this Thomistic theory allows for genuine human freedom only in an acutely attenuated form. The traditional theories of predestination and providence are open to very serious objections, and need to be revised and reformulated in major respects so as to take account of the genuine freedom of man. This I believe can be done without jeopardizing either the perfect freedom of God, which depends upon his unqualified self-sufficiency, or the genuine freedom of man. But Mr. Hartshorne's objections for the most part (pp. 48 ff.) proceed along quite different lines.</page><page sequence="19">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 79 He attributes to me the view that God "is a necessary, eternal essence," Who "is through and through necessary," and Who "knows that the world exists." Then he argues (pp. 49 ff.) that my belief in the non-necessary existence of the world is irreconcilable with these assertions. I think that this whole discussion suffers from a failure of Mr. Hartshorne to define what he means by necessity, and to distinguish between different types of necessity, as for example the logical necessity of entailment which he seems to have chiefly in mind, as over against the existential necessity involved in the classical concept of God. But since this argument seems to be specific ally directed at me, I should like to make a few further com ments upon it. First of all I do not accept the first two propositions attributed to me that God "is a necessary eternal essence" who "is through and through necessary." The view I should attempt to defend would be rather that God is the pure act of existing, with no "necessary eternal essence" whatsoever, dis tinct from his existential act. He is by no means "through and through necessary" in the sense in which I am afraid Mr. Hart shorne uses this phrase, namely that all his other traits and accidents are necessitated or determined by this necessary essence, as all the acts and accidents of a finite being are determined by its necessary essence (what is must be if it is to exist at all). As I see it, God has no such essence distinct from His existence, as Mr. Hartshorne maintains. Any such ontological composition would render him finite and existen tially contingent, like ourselves and all the beings of which we are immediately aware. God has no essence in this sense. He is the pure act of existing, of which we may gain a confused, analogical notion from the imperfect existences of finite entities, all necessarily limited by their divergent essences. The divine act of existing, as I conceive it, is indeed necessary in the peculiar sense that it is unrestrictedly spontaneous and autonomous, altogether inde pendent of any necessitating factors, and therefQre incapable of being hampered or thwarted in the realization of itself. Such an act is necessary only in the sense that it cannot not be.</page><page sequence="20">80 John Wild Its own act of existing cannot be frustrated or reduced to nothing. But the acceptance of this proposition does not entail any specific consequences with respect to what this being must be or do ad extra. I see nothing in it which would prohibit such a being from creating a world of finite creatures, sharing in His existence to some degree, and rational creatures capable of guiding their own conduct freely, thus sharing in His own perfect spontaneity to some degree. Where is there any contradiction here ? Why should He not deal with these creatures as the free beings they are ? Wy should He not act upon them, love them, and suffer for them ? As to how He can do all these things, this is no doubt far beyond the level of anything we can ever clearly comprehend. We cannot create. We can only remould or reform something already existent. At the highest levels of human conduct we cannot love another for his sake alone, or suffer solely for another. It is always at least in part for our selves that we love and suffer. We are not pure acts of existence, but only restricted existences of this kind or that. Existence itself transcends us. But we can see that it is required for the explanation of the limited beings around us. By analogy we can dimly grasp it. The creative acts to which we have just referred would involve contradictions only if they involved a sacrifice of that spontaneous energizing which constitutes an infinite act of existing. Mr. Hartshorne has not shown any such contradic tions. As a matter of fact, when closely examined, they would seem to be precisely those manifestations which a free and spontaneous being might freely choose to make. How more effectively could He manifest Himself than in the creation and support of finite creatures sharing to some extent in His own autonomous spontaneity ? Where is there any contradiction in this ? Mr. Hartshorne is especially concerned about God's knowl edge of the world He has created (pp. 49 ff.) This knowl edge, as indeed all knowledge, is necessary in some sense. God knows necessarily and certainly that the world exists. From this proposition Mr. Hartshorne believes that with the aid of</page><page sequence="21">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 81 modern logic he can show that the existence of the world is absolutely necessary, not contingent. Unfortunately, however, as is the case with all meaningful propositions, something more than mere logical structure is at stake. The nature of knowledge and its relation to its object is also involved. This question cannot be settled by logic alone. Mr. Hartshorne's implicit idealism leads him to identify knowledge with its object in an unqualified way. Hence to him it is quite evident that if the mode of knowledge is contingent, the object known must also be contingent, and that if the mode of knowing is necessary the object known must also be necessary. There is a vast array of empirical evidence, however, which shows that this is not the case. The child may apprehend a logically necessary object, such as a proposition in geometry, by a mode of knowing which is extremely tentative and hypothetical. Furthermore, contingent objects such as the pen on my table, once they exist, may be known by a knowledge that is certain and necessary, in the sense that given the object, the knowledge cannot be otherwise, and knows that it cannot be. Such examples as this make it abundantly clear that there is a definite sense in which the object of knowledge is distinct from the noetic mode by which it is known. The knowledge by which we know change, for example, does not have to change. The knowledge of vice need not be vicious. Hence we cannot safely argue, as Mr. Hart shorne wishes us to do, from the modal character of a certain kind of knowledge to an identical modal character of the object known. This will only involve us in countless fallacies, as it has involved Mr. Hartshorne in the fallacy of assuming that because God knows the contingent world, once it exists, with noetic necessity, therefore the world must exist with the same existen tial necessity as that which pertains to the knowledge by which it is known. This is a fallacy. By the same line of argument I could prove, with the Bergsonians, that by my con cept of change (which is changeless) I can never know an object that is really changing. Since the existence of the object must be distinguished from the relational knowledge by which</page><page sequence="22">82 John Wild it is known, there is no reason for supposing that God cannot know a contingent world by a knowledge which is hypothetic ally necessary. At this point Mr. Hartshorne will object that we have fallen into another contradiction, for such hypothetical neces sity will "mean that, on certain conditions, themselves in some sense possible, He (God) might have lacked something He actually has (His knowledge that the world exists); and there with the sheer necessity of his actuality would be given up .. ." (p. 50). I can well understand how this might seem to be a contradiction to anyone holding a panentheistic view like that of Mr. Hartshorne, according to which creatures are "parts" of God. A composite creature, without certain parts, is indeed in a state of privation or need. But I hold no such view. The God in Whom I believe is in no sense made up of creatures. He needs them not at all. He transcends them alto gether. His act of creation is a free and spontaneous gift from which He derives no benefit at all. But Mr. Hartshorne will ask, did He not at least derive new knowledge which He lacked ? (cf. p. 50). I fear that this question also must be answered in the negative. More beings have been created. But there is no more being than before. How can the pure act of existing lack any perfection possessed by those participating finite acts which it bestows ? Knowing its own act of pure existence, how can God fail to know the various ways in which this may be participated ? Does Mr. Hartshorne really think that an infinite creative agent may be surprised by what it spontaneously creates ? There are certainly mysteries here, and innumerable dif ficulties for our minds, as we attempt to clarify them further. But a mystery is not a contradiction, and I see no contradic tion here. Mr. Hartshorne criticizes me because "nothing is said about the divine love in my review" (p. 38). He says this presumably because he holds that the classical religious con ception is very weak in this respect, and that its defects are definitively remedied by the new theories of surrelativism. I have already made a few comments on this difficult subject, and since I believe that there is no better way of bringing out</page><page sequence="23">The Divine Existence: An Answer to Mr. Hartshorne 83 the issues that lie between us, I shall conclude with a brief summary of what I have tried to say on this topic. I should define caritas or love in general terms as the seeking for that which is good. In man it may become conscious or voluntary. It becomes purer and higher in quality in so far as that which is desired is freely or spontaneously desired for its own sake, with no admixture of self-aggrandizement. It seems to me that Mr. Hartshorne admits this, for he objects to the "traditional" view which holds that our love of God is directed only to benefits we expect for ourselves, and which therefore reduces morality to self-interest.6 I agree with Mr. Hartshorne here, at least with his opinion that the higher manifestations of love involve the seeking of what is good for its own sake with a minimum of self-interest. But now bearing this in mind, let us turn to that concept of Divine Love which seems to be implied by his view. God's love for us, as he makes quite clear, is far from being devoid of self-interest. He needs us to benefit Him, etc., etc. Is there not a peculiar reversal of roles here ? Is he not more worried about us than about the Divine ? Does he not place God on a lower moral level than that of man ? Here also it seems to me that the traditional approach can do more justice to the demands of a perfect and transcendant, sacrificial love. According to this view, there is not the slightest admixture of self-interest in God's love for the creature. It is perfectly free and pure from any desire for self-aggrandize ment. The creature is loved for his own sake with no reverber ation of self-benefit. Does this not come closer to perfect sacri ficial action ? As Mr. Hartshorne points out, such love is partially approximated in the highest examples of human love. The essence of religious worship and adoration is the love of God for His own sake alone, not primarily for any benefits we may attain. He is right here. Any benefits to be attained by us are certainly dependent upon this in the first place. Never theless, owing to our weakness and imperfection, the thought of our own needs can never be wholly absent from our minds. This thought can be subordinated, not eliminated. We are not divine. Nevertheless this basic desire for our own perfection ?Ibid., p. 133.</page><page sequence="24">84 John Wild can be definitely deposed from a ruling position, and ordered to the love of the good for its own sake. Indeed it must be, if even the most rudimentary levels of religion are to be attain ed. In conclusion I should like to say that I sympathize pro foundly with many of Mr. Hartshorne's objections to certain classical doctrines of natural theology. They often portray the divine being as a cosmic dictator and pantocrat rather than as a spontaneous energizing and liberating power. The theories of predestination and providence leave little scope for genuine human freedom, and require drastic revision and modification. I agree with his objections to these doctrines, derived as some of them are from ancient forms of tyranny and political misrule. These things we hold in common, and more especially a sense of the basic importance of natural theology both for philosophy and for religion. If Mr. Hartshorne had been more willing to argue with me than with what he calls "Thomism," and with that strange array of theories which he claims to have culled from what he calls "the tradition," I think that our discussion might have been more profitable. I agree with him that this "tradition" needs to be rethought and to be corrected and revised in certain respects. His surrelativist reconstruction, however, seems to result in an anthropomorphic Deity which can satisfy neither the demands of philosophy nor those of religion. The evident con tingency and dependence of finite being seems to found a rational and cogent argument for an infinite and unconditioned existence. I know of no defensible argument whatsoever which offers any evidence for the existence of such a composite, de prived, and schizoid entity, partly absolute and partly relative, as he describes. Even if such a being did actually exist, its confusion with limited creatures, and its lack of perfect spon taneity and transcendance would make it an unfitting object for a rationally purified form of religious worship.
