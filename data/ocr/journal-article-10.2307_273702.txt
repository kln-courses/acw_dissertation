SHORE Sombre Green Challenge: Notes on Art and Education in Modern Africa Africa, you were once just a name to me But now you lie before me with sombre green challenge To that loud faith for freedom (life more abundant) Which we once professed.... "The Meaning of Africa," Abioseh Nicol AFRICAN ART TODAY, like so many other aspects of African life, stands at the confluence of many streams. It is an art of search, reaching back into the African past, out to the life that surrounds it, out fur- ther still to the influences that come from Europe and America, Asia and the Arab world, to find the forms of its future and the substance that is modern Africa itself. The artist is a special kind of seeker. He is a creator, a myth maker, who creates according to the depth, the quality, and the timelessness of his belonging, out of his search for roots and an identity that extends beyond himself. Today, Africa struggles to find itself, to understand its past and pres- ent, to forge a unity of old and new and to bring together the many in- fluences that have mingled in the African heritage. Art and culture are part of that search for the characteristics and developments which will distinguish Africans from others, portray Africans to others, and, at the same time, link Africans to and articulate them with mankind as a whole. Africa has a rich and varied heritage. The Pyramids, the Mali Mosques, the ruins of Timgad, Zimbabwe and Meroe, the bronzes of Benin and the stone tools of Uganda, the hilltop forts of Mapungubwe, the remains of Monomotapa and Timbuktu, and written documents of African, European, Hindu and Chinese origin all suggest past cultures and civilizations that have left a heritage of thought and beliefs, art and custom throughout Africa. As Placide Tempels states in Bantu Philoso- phy, "The false image of primitive man, of the savage, of the manlike creature deprived of a full growth of the intelligence, irremediably dis- appears . . ." We are dealing with "an adult humanity, conscious of its own wisdom, conditioned by its own universal philosophy." The question is no longer whether Africa has a cultural past, but what that past is, and what are its dynamics. What are its developments into the Afri- * Based on a paper presented to the "Dag Hammerskjold Conference on Leadership Training in Africa," held at the University of Denver. 380</page><page sequence="2">SOMBRE GREEN CHALLENGE can cultural present? And how is that cultural heritage fusing with and transforming the influences that have come from Europe, Asia, and the Middle East? More than three hundred years of cross-cultural impacts under co- lonial rule have disrupted, undermined, fragmented, and, in some cases, shattered the African cultural heritage, producing built-in in- ferior-superior relationships. The broad psychological impact of Euro- pean religion, science, technology, and social structure, under colonial- ism, tended to stifle indigenous inspiration along traditional lines. Cre- ative work was further undermined by "commercial incentives" and by "assembly-line" approaches to art. Traditional forms of apprenticeships and other means of transmitting artistic values and techniques from gen- eration to generation were discouraged. In territories where the British practiced indirect rule, the outward forms of traditional culture were left more or less intact, although over- zealous missionaries sought to exorcize the "satanic" creative impulses that produced bronze sculpture and wood carvings for "pagan" wor- ship. Indigenous authorities were used, but colonial administrators and educators drove home constantly the fact that British education, British dress, British economic and political systems, British literature, and British custom were the acme of progress, the epitome of civilized man. Those who advocated the enlightened policy of equality for all civilized men in Africa, defined civilization in terms of European clothes, houses, language, manners, and education. Cultural and artistic village life lost its sponsorship and support as the chiefs became civil servants, no longer able to patronize the wood carver who gloried in the process of carving, the village poet and singer of songs, and the other forms of art in which all shared. In the French, Belgian, and Portuguese territories, governed by the concept of assimilation, only the evolues and the assimilados could achieve equality. Today, the assimilated, French-speaking artist has turned violently against European culture in favor of his African roots which he feels the need to recapture. More and more, Africans have come to realize that they have been made to live in ignorance of their own heritage, their own values, and their own contributions to mankind. Their children have been uprooted in the schools and made to turn their backs on their own past. African values, African art, and African culture have become "folklore." Afri- can intellectuals and the educated elite have come to look upon African values with the eyes of strangers. According to W. E. B. DuBois in The Souls of Black Folk, there was created a strange feeling, a double consciousness, an impression of forever watching ourselves through the eyes of others . . . of measuring our soul with that of a world which regards this action with amusement, 381</page><page sequence="3">PHYLON pity and distrust. One forever feels his duality: being at once both American and Negro, both French and African, English and African, Spanish and African, Portuguese and African, Italian and African. Two souls, two thoughts, two irreconcilable tendencies; two ideals conflicting in but one black body whose unconquerable spirit alone prevents it from being torn in two. The result is a tormented, ambivalent person, whom Frantz Fanon calls "black skin, white skin." A major task of the man of culture, be he artist, scholar, or teacher, lies in combating this dramatic duality, and through the rehabilita- tion of his cultural heritage to restore to the African his sense of con- tinuity and of dignity. This does not mean a romantic turning to the past, a going backward, a "go for bush" psychology. Acculturation is a process in which a person, deeply rooted in his past, is confronted with a new cultural environment, and his progress at adaptability depends very much on how quickly he is able to discern that the new life is a de- sirable modification of the old and not its total rejection. At no time has there been a cultural vacuum in Africa. In a sense, only through change can the cherished ways of old survive and invest the process of acculturation with a sense of history. Soon the earth will cover us all: then the earth, too, will change, and the things also which result from change will continue to change forever, and these again forever. Marcus Aurelius Although the original sense of unity in a culture has been broken, it is possible that former colonial people can reconstitute it and integrate its new experiences, hence its new wealth, within the framework of a new unity. Japan co-mingles traditional elements with those bor- rowed from Europe and elsewhere, and melts them down into a new cul- ture that remains Japanese. Such co-mingling postulates a kind of his- toric boldness, a self-confidence, a willingness to experiment with new forms. Roger Bastides, in Bresil, Terre des Contrastes, points out also that At the moment when African intellectuals, while feeling that Africa needs to modernize, industrialize, and equip itself, understand that it is not therefore necessary to destroy the indigenous cultures, Brazil affords the most success, that of a group of Negroes who have known how to wed harmoniously modern techniques of work and the religious or artistic spirituality inherited from their ancestors. It is imperative that the universities developing in Africa today be characterized by a serious desire to strengthen African culture. They must be dedicated to a serious scholastic policy that will abolish the contradictions of the colonial educational system. The cultural heri- tage of Africa must not be disparaged, either directly or indirectly, either by sins of commission or omission. It must not be thrown into the dustbin of history. African history and culture must be deemed worthy of uni- versal consideration and African languages must not be rejected. In 382</page><page sequence="4">SOMBRE GREEN CHALLENGE many ways, the African university today is a crystalization point of African contradictions. Its academic language and pedagogical meth- ods, its organization and form, and sometimes even its architecture, bear the stamp, Made in Europe, or more recently, Made in the U. S. A. African studies, especially African history, can link the university with the African heritage and with humanism in the widest sense, and the arts offer dramatic illustrations of the manner in which past and present, and Africa, Europe, America, Asia, and the Arab World are being fused and molded into new forms of expression and new aesthetic means of communication. In a one-room shanty in a township, a black ghetto on the outskirts of Johannesburg, six or seven young men crowd into the small room for a jazz party. The records spin - Duke Ellington in "The Mooch" or "Perdido," Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie, Johnny Hodges, Jelly Roll Morton, Ma Rainey, Blind Lemon Jefferson - from New Orleans to Chicago to San Francisco. The chatter, the buzz, the screams of township life beat on the walls of that room, but no one hears. Up the street, a combo gives for a "non-stop dance." Boys and girls beat out the smoldering anger that piles up in them. They try to beat down the unfulfilled - the impossible - urges and dreams. The boy on the trumpet plays like Satch. He learned from listening to Armstrong records, but there is a distinctive South African flavor to the sound he makes. This is African jazz, born out of the jerry-built shacks, the rutted roads running with urine, the pass laws. Out on the land, away from the city streets, every village has its choirs- male, female, mixed and children's. They sing pastoral music, lyric songs, epic praise songs out of the past, and from this a modern choral music is being created. Todd Matshikiza, one of a number of prom- ising African composers south of the Zambezi, has composed moving choral works. This choral music uses European notation, but the themes and the rhythms are African. It has been popularized without being prostituted and is a regular feature of the music festivals. African serious or classical music is as popular as jazz. It is neither highbrow nor cheap and everyone can share in the emotional and intellectual experi- ence. A compound art form is developing from the impact between Euro- pean and traditional life. Bantu culture in South Africa is fragmented, but Africans do not look back. They do not urge a return to the past to re-create their sense of unity. Their culture changes, and they attempt to forge a new cul- tural unity out of many strands. The wedding song is an interesting survival of traditional African music among urbanized people. For about a month before the wedding is to take place, a small white flag is hoisted at the home of the bride- 383</page><page sequence="5">PHYLON to-be. There is singing in the streets every night. After supper, the young men and women, the boys and girls, converge. The group moves up and down the street singing. The songs no longer tell of harvests, drought, or folk myth, as they did in the past. Now they tell of tough men who live lustily, who defy the law, of men who get rough with their girls, or of boys who lose themselves in shantytowns and the girls who follow them and make them feel like heroes. They express a mad- dening urge to be someone who can be respected by society, people who want to be useful but are balked by the pass laws and the other instru- ments of police power. A small thing deflects a boy's course and sud- denly he wants to be someone feared by society. The young man and young woman sing before their wedding and dance with their well-wishers. They know that the characters of the drama their songs tell about could easily have been them. Because they are not, these songs can be sung for them. In West Africa, night clubs are an important part of urban life. They level all classes. One can spend long hours in a tropical night club in Lagos or in Accra for only a shilling. The jazz is "high life," very easy to dance to with a cool rhythm. There is a hot, earthy version too, called "juju high life," making intense use of percussion instruments. Around Onitsha in Eastern Nigeria, there is a flowering of cheap lo- cal literature in English. On an afternoon in Onitsha market one could buy almost one hundred cheap paperbacks ranging in price from 8d. to Is. 6d., covering a fairly wide range of human experience. It is by no means great literature; in fact, it is often very bad in language and technique, but it reflects something of the values of the new society with roots in the old, bridging the chasm, as it were, between telling a story to a group of friendly folk and writing it for an unknown pub- lic. Coincidentally, three of Nigeria's best known authors, Achebe, Ekwensi, and Nzekwu, come from the Onitsha area. There is an eagerness in Nigeria to get things into print and a colossal appetite for the written word. In the musical arts, West Africa boasts not only "high life" but also the development of opera forms in the work of Ogunde, Duro Ladipo, and Ogunmola, all experimenting with traditional Yoruba styles to meet the demands of a modern musical theater. Traditional forms of African painting are dying out. Few are prac- ticed any longer. The geometrical drawings and ornaments on clay walls, on skin (including tattoos), and in beadwork, are composed of colored circles, triangles, rhomboids and lines repeated in perpetual relations, forming an extremely decorative symbolism. The paintings on altars, sacred rocks, and temple walls, religious symbols and cult objects, repre- sent in traditional art a combination of personal inspiration, realism, 384</page><page sequence="6">SOMBRE GREEN CHALLENGE mythology, and symbolism. The colors are laid on with exact limits. They are never blended or shaded. There is no scene in space, no per- spective, and no frame. Figures are dispersed freely over the surface, are suspended in ideal space, or are stippled or divided into colored fields. The new painting is not an imitation of the past, although it does repre- sent something of a renaissance. Its subjects are taken from modern life but it retains many of the features characteristic of traditional painting. The brush replaces tufts of leaves or the finger. Oils, water colors, gouache, and vinyl paints are replacing earth, chalk, manioc flour, red insects, and tree bark. New techniques from Europe are studied and em- ployed, but not simply imitated. African artists feel that they must not repeat the themes of the past, but rather that their task is the penetration of the modern world, in theme, content, techniques, and media, nourished by the artistic tra- dition of their countries. Ibrahim el Salahi of Khartoum, for example, in his paintings, presents us with a series of anthropomorphic images that are extremely haunting. The images are human in their suffer- ing, but the forms seem to suggest the human, the divine, and the animal elements all at once. As in ancient African mythology, there are no clear-cut divisions between the animal, the human, and the divine. Demas Nwoko and Uche Okeke of Nigeria have acquired modern techniques and work in a modern context for an international public, but still they seek their inspiration from the rich folklore and art of their native Ibo culture. There is no question here of a cheap perpetuation of Ibo tradi- tion; they are interpreters of contemporary Nigerian life and they have been able to use and develop some of the transposed forms which Ibo sculptors have been using, and above all they have recreated some of the depth of feeling and dramatic tension that is associated with Ibo masks. Deep-rooted concepts of art are part of the African cultural tradi- tion, concepts which artists of today seek to retain and transform to meet the demands of modern life. Throughout the history of African cultures, art has been a technique of approach or identification, influencing high- er powers, a technique of appropriating them by identifying oneself with them by gesture or word, by poem and music, dancing and singing, sculpture and painting. Along with labor, art has been considered a generic activity of man. The artist is homo faber who realizes himself in homo sapiens. Art is in some way functional. It is not a diversion or a decoration added to an object. It gives the object its effectiveness. It gives the object its character of object. In African culture too, all the arts are interlinked, the artist is dedicated more to the process of crea- tion than he is to the possession of the final art object. The work of art is, in a sense, accomplished by all for all, and thus art is committed be- cause it is functional and collective or social. These concepts are not 385</page><page sequence="7">PHYLON only attitudes toward art and the work of the artist, but they are to be found as themes and subject matter themselves in contemporary works being created for the stage and in literature. They are important threads, for example, in Wole Soyinka's highly allegorical play, A Dance of the Forest. It must be the task of African universities, as they evolve, to develop an African art history, an aesthetics (or several) of African art, both traditional and modern, a means of linking African art to that of the rest of the world. It will probably be the task of African universities to develop art centers, programs and activities to link the world of art to the community at large, and institutes or schools for the training of artists that will be dedicated to helping them become aware of their cultural heritage, understand the cultures of parts of Africa other than their own, and assisting them to effect their own personal and individual synthesis of the many influences that mingle in them from all parts of the world. Why must we always learn from books Which tell us of distant things? And then, their school is so sad, Sad like These town gentlemen These proper gentlemen Who no longer know how to dance in the moonlight Who no longer know how to walk in their feet's flesh Who no longer know how to tell an evening's tale. Lord, I don't want to go to their school anymore. "Prayer of a Little Black Child" Guy Tirolien Only about 5 percent of the total population of Africa is able to speak, read, and write a European language. Of course, as time passes this percentage will grow rapidly, but still, the division of Africa into linguistic zones according to the language of the colonizing power is nonsense. Man's feelings, man's thought, man's whole personality is shaped and expressed by the language he uses. The use of a European language is one of the contributing factors in the separation of the edu- cated elite from the mass of African people. It has prestige value. It is important in administration and commerce. It has utility as a lingua franca in a multilingual community. The use of a foreign language has impressed itself deeply in the general consciousness as a symbol of a way of life. Not to be able to use it is to be at a social and economic dis- advantage, to be backward, uncivilized. Education is conducted in a foreign language, and the command of it is a gauge of a person's educa- tion. The level of education - attested to by certificates, diplomas, and degrees - has come to determine the salary of a man and thus his social position. The new African elite is not necessarily an intellectual 386</page><page sequence="8">SOMBRE GREEN CHALLENGE one. It is by no means composed of Plato's "philosopher kings," but rather it is an educated one, separate from the mass, detribalized, not just by money, clothes, and training, but by language as well. The educational system imposed upon African societies has effective- ly cut off Africans from their roots and from their native tongue, a tormented state for an artist to find himself in, especially a man of letters. It is true that in their present state African languages cannot be used to express highly specialized ideas of modern techniques, but to ig- nore the possibility of their development is not valid. Any language has the mechanism for expressing any idea, and can be extended by word borrowings and new formations in conformity with the spirit of the lan- guage, as has happened in Europe. I remember a Latin teacher of mine, making me write out accounts of the World Series in that tongue. The vocabulary of modern techniques is largely an international one and can be drawn upon, just as modern Greek, Japanese, Hebrew, and Arabic have done. But techniques are not everything. There is a wealth of ma- terial existing - legend, history, poetry, philosophy, medicine, psycholo- gy, etc. - in the vernacular languages. This material must not become tapes and transcripts destined for obscure corners in musty archives, material for the specialist, the research scholar alone. Only the social and political developments of the future will decide the question of national languages in the countries of Africa, but insti- tutes of linguistic research must rapidly be developed at African uni- versities. And it must be remembered that the university is not just a facility for turning out specialists. It is a center of culture. If it is to play a role as an expression of cultural life, it must take the lead in fostering the study of African languages and give its students oppor- tunities for insight into existing raw material. It must encourage the study of literature, both oral and written, in the vernacular, and it must encourage the creation of that literature too, literature of the quality of the work of D. O. Fagunwa and A. C. Jordan, to name only two. African literature in French and English has, of course, been success- ful, but the French critics are baffled by the allusions and the language of a poet such as Senghor, and English critics are equally baffled by the allegory of Wole Soyinka's A Dance of the Forest. African literature written in European tongues is limited to a very restricted African audience. Writers become concerned with satisfying a foreign audience instead. The novel, the story, the play, more and more, is oriented toward Europe and the United States. The author becomes further dissociated from the experiences and the mind set of his own people, and his work begins to take a different form and shape than it would if it were di- rected toward a large African audience. It is a misjudgment, I believe, to assume that all African languages are destined to disappear and that 387</page><page sequence="9">PHYLON in the next century Africa will be thinking, speaking, and writing in imported tongues. The study of African languages by the literary artist will lead him to the discovery of the cultural values, the literary forms and techniques, and the materials of history to be found in the vast store of oral litera- ture. Linguists fluent in African languages are still rare; even more rare is the linguist who is a sensitive literary man, a poet, a playwright, a novelist, a critic of style as well. The translation of oral literature is difficult because of differences in conventions of expressing time and space, of gender and number, or mode and aspect, because of the sym- bolic character of the texts which are full of allusions and enigmatic expressions, because of the function of linguistic tones in the rhythms of words and the music which often accompanies them. To translate these works takes a creative writer, trained in the language involved and steeped in the culture and lore from which the oral literature comes. Traditional literature can suggest new structures, new techniques, and new styles to the writer of the modern world. African literature has a need to transcend the fixed literary patterns imposed by the lit- erary history of the European world. It needs to invent and develop new patterns that correspond to the needs of African life and the his- tory of African peoples. This kind of experimentation is being done in the theater of Ogunmola, in the works of Amos Tutuola, in the Malagasy plays of Jacques Rabemananjara, in the style of Efua Suther- land's story, New Life at Kyerefaso, and in poems like "A Mighty Bell is Six O'clock." Serious modern literature in Africa, regardless of the language in which it is written, is attempting to develop harmonious syntheses between traditional and modern forms of expression, among African, Asian, and European modes and techniques. Camara Laye, Ferdinand Oyono, and Mongo Beti have fused an alien culture with African themes, and have succeeded - with a devastat- ing sense of irony - in producing novels that have no equal in any foreign language in Africa. The poetry of negritude searches intensely for African values and glories in its "Africa-ness." The clash between ancient and modern, father and son, city and village forms the major preoccupation of West African writers such as Achebe, Clark, and Soy- inka. And the range of themes in South African writing covers hunger, poverty, snobbery, violence, the irony of color attitudes, defiance of and submission to oppression, a world of the smells of confetti and night soil, cosmetics and brandy and benzine dope, shantytown and mines, and the smell of heat. African literature is far closer to the realities of African life as they are experienced today than is the subject matter of English literature, for example, concerned as it is with life lived against a background of cold seas and vivid seasonal change, with different conventions of love 388</page><page sequence="10">SOMBRE GREEN CHALLENGE and marriage, justice and retribution and different religious beliefs as well. Studies of African writing must be integrated into existing cur- ricula, specialized programs must be created, and the teaching of Afri- can literature must be introduced into the secondary schools. African writing can form the bridge between the students' experiences of life and their intensive experiences of literature on a wider scale. African books deal with responses to situations that students have some knowl- edge of and further illumines that knowledge for them. At the same time it introduces them vividly to the ways in which the literary artist han- dles human experience, and the creator of African literature ultimately finds himself measured against some degree of international excellence. African writers in a European language stand indeed at the juncture of several worlds. In a sense, their work is not only a part of the body of African literature, but of English literature, - or French, etc. - as well. They need to think without strain in the European tongue, rapidly and easily enough for them not to divert energy from the substance of their thought to its verbal form. It is vital for modern writers in Africa to enter a larger literary tradition, not necessarily English or French alone, where they may learn their trade from master craftsmen. They enter a workshop. They are not being absorbed into a foreign culture, but are simply taking their share of the common inheritance of world culture. But, if they learn their craft from writers whose subject mat- ter is purely European, it will be difficult for them to dissociate that craft from European themes and associate it with life around them. In- volvement fully in that life, and not simply as part of a small elite, is one source of developing that association, for after all, it is the re- sponsibility of writers to present a true expression of the reality of their own people. That association will be strengthened by their knowl- edge of their own heritage, their history, philosophy, oral literature, mu- sic and dance, and the other arts. Something rich and unexpected comes out of the confluence of two or more traditions in one creative mind. Less than fifty years ago, Ireland had the most vigorous literary life in Europe. Its best writers, Synge, Yeats, O'Casey, cast native themes and stories in forms that made them part of the common tradition of Western Europe. African literature, too, will find its links with the ma- jor literary traditions of the world. At a number of African universities - Ibadan, for example, Rho- desia and Malawi, Ife, Haile Selassie I University, and Ghana - literary works in English and French, using African settings, themes, and ex- periences, are material for study in courses in English and French litera- ture. At other universities, courses in African literature have been es- tablished, and some are planning an ambitious program for a final year in the English Honours Course that would include background study of the African experience as embodied in religion, folk art, literature and 389</page><page sequence="11">PHYLON philosophy, a detailed study of one of four literary regions (West Africa, East Africa, etc.), the intensive study of a literary form in Africa, the study of the literature of negritude, and the detailed study of a special author. The courses in African literature, as such, are based upon the idea that whatever language Africans write in, they produce a distinctly African kind of literature, so African in its interpretation and presenta- tion of human experience as to cut across normal boundary marks of lan- guage differences. The closest analogy to this approach can be found, perhaps, in the special African history syllabi that have come into being in recent years. The universities and secondary schools of Africa will help not only to create the artists of tomorrow's Africa, but the audience for those artists as well, not just in the arts programs which they offer in their lib- eral education, but in their extramural and literacy education, their in- volvement in community development, their involvement in radio, televi- sion, and film work, their support for the establishment of popular li- brary systems and for the development of cultural centers such as Mbari and Chemchemi, in the establishment of avenues of cultural interchange from one part of Africa to another as well as between Africa and the rest of the world, the translation of works from the body of world cul- ture into African languages and African works into the languages of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and in the creation of schools of theater, writing, art, music and dance, each oriented toward its parti- cular Africa locale and linked to Africa as a whole. Only those within you who know Their circumscribed plot, And till it well with steady plough Can from that harvest then look up To the vast blue inside Of the enamelled bowl of sky Which covers you and say, "This is my Africa." "The Meaning of Africa" Abioseh Nicol We seem to be at the verge of an African cultural renaissance in the truest sense of the word, a renaissance in which the university and the secondary school should be called upon to play a vital and dynamic role of leadership. 390</page></plain_text>
