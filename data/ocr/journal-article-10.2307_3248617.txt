<plain_text><page sequence="1">FLORANCE WATERBURY: SPECULATIONS ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF A HO IN THE FREER GALLERY IN HIS INTERESTING ARTICLE ENTITLED "AN ANTHROPOMORPHIC DEITY FROM Ancient China" (Oriental Art, III, No. 4, 195I), Dr. Hugo Munsterberg analyses the decor of a ritual vessel in the Freer Gallery. This bronze has been described in the Freer Catalogue of Bronzes; otherwise, as far as the writer knows, Dr. Munsterberg is the first scholar to discuss this curious Ho, which is atypical in almost every respect. It is not shaped like other Ho, being low and squat in form, and resting on a vertical base instead of on legs; the spout is disproportionately small; there is no handle; and the most extraordinary feature is that the cover is in the form of a flattened human face. Two capped horns are placed low on the brow above heavy striated eyebrows, large eyes, a very broad nose, and a wide mouth. Between the horns the forehead is furrowed by three deep lines. The ears are perforated so that the Ho could have been carried by cords passed through the perforations and through holes behind two small rams' heads on the body of the vessel directly below the ears. The rams' heads, curiously, are placed so that they obliterate some of the decor. Two small "dragons" are incised on the top of the head, and beneath them a flat, snake-like form with clawed forelegs in higher relief appears, and winds around the body of the vessel. A bird is behind one foreleg; a "dragon" is behind the other. A small legless " dragon" appears on either side of the spout. The background resembles the so-called lei-wen on the Shang bronzes (Fig. i). Mr. Lodge placed this Ho in the Early Chou period; Mr. Wenley is inclined toward a Shang dating; Dr. Munsterberg seems somewhat non-committal in his text, but uses the Early Chou dating in the captions of the photographs of the Ho. Dr. Munsterberg's premise is that the decor is symbolic in intention and not aesthetic. This attitude is, in the writer's opinion, the only correct one for a scholar to maintain in inter- preting ancient art, which is everywhere the expression of religion. Dr. Munsterberg's conclusions, briefly summarised, are as follows: I14</page><page sequence="2">Fig. i Left side of Ho Courtesy of the Freer Gallery of Art "The dominant element of this bronze is without question the mythical personage with the human head and the snake body". Dr. Munsterberg links this personage with the figures associated with snakes on the Meyer, Sumitomo, and Cernuschi bronzes, on certain neolithic 115</page><page sequence="3">jars, and with Nu Kua on the Wu Liang bas-reliefs. Since the snake is not clearly differen- tiated from the dragon which is associated with fertility and fecundity, the personage with the snake body is therefore connected with fertility and fecundity; this is also indicated by the horns which are phallic in significance. The eyes and eyebrows represent the sun and the moon; they, together with all the other elements-the small "dragons", the bird, the rams' heads, the triangles, lozenges, spirals and cowrie shells-all either signify fertility and fecundity or are associated with them. The large claws on the forelegs are Tiger's claws, which mean power and protection. Since on the oracle bones the Deity most associated with fertility is the Supreme Deity of the Shang rulers, Shang-ti, Dr. Munsterberg concludes that the face on the cover of the Ho represents the God Shang-ti. The writer, starting with the same premise as Dr. Munsterberg's has arrived at some of the same conclusions; the differences are those of certain interpretations. The writer believes that the Ho is definitely Early Chou; the form with its squat silhouette so unlike the forms of Shang; the absence of legs -it being a curious fact that the Chou preferred ritual vessels with bases such as Tsun, Kuang, and Yui, to those with legs; the hybrid combination of the human face and the snake-like body, and its exaggerated scale in relation to the size of the Ho; the coarse, strong technique; the characteristic quality of aggressiveness; all point to an Early Chou date. The writer's first impression of the Ho was that the cover, though certainly Early Chou, was not the original cover. With all the covered vessels, the designs on the body and the lid are a unit; they are so completely integrated that a substituted cover is immediately discernible, as, for instance, in the case of a Yii in the Pillsbury Collection in the Minneapolis Art Museum (Waterbury, Early Chinese Symbols and Literature; Vestiges and Speculations, P1. 65). The unified design is characteristic of Early Chou as well as of Shang covered vessels. On the Freer Ho the cover is an abrupt departure from the design on the vessel, both in subject and treatment; the latter suggests a pottery technique. Furthermore, the lines of the lozenge on the snake-like body, which are carried up on the cover, are carelessly incised, and the lozenge is not even completed (Fig. 2). The effect is that of a few lines hastily incised to make a connection between the body of the Ho and the cover. Dr. Munsterberg considers that the clawed forelegs represent the Tiger; the writer agrees,</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 2 Back of the Ho, showing uncompleted lozenge but also holds that the snake-like body with the forelegs really represents the Tiger, which has a tendency toward elongation. This tendency to assume a serpentine form seems to be due to qualities inherent in the long, lithe curves of the felines. The lions of ancient Uruk, in Sumer, intertwine excessively long, snake-like necks (Frankfort, Cylinder Seals, Pl. IV, d, f); in South America the stylisation of the jaguar- and puma-gods is the same as that of the Chinese Tiger. Sommer speaks of "the hydra tendency" of the jaguar, which appears with a linear head, fangs, clawed forelegs, an elongated body and no hind-legs, in the Argentine and in Andean regions (Sommer, Northwest Argentine Archaeology: The Center, p. 62). In I I7</page><page sequence="5">Wancani, Bolivia, snake-bodies with pumas' heads at both extremities are sculptured on monoliths (Ryden, Archaeological Researches in the Highland of Bolivia, Fig. 34); these are undoubtedly derived from the puma-headed serpents on the pillar-like monoliths of late Tihuanacu (Posnansky, Tibuanacu, Figs. 89, go90). On the Sun Door, which is older than the monoliths, pumas have begun to be snake-like, and the four legs have already disappeared (Posnansky, op. cit., p. 1 14, nos. 5, 6, 7). Serpents with a Tiger-head at each extremity also occur in China; a group of such snakes, intertwined, decorates a Late Chou scabbard in the collection of Mr. Myron Falk, Jr., in New York. The majority of the Tigers on the Shang bronzes have lost their hind-legs, and their bodies have become remnants, ribbon-like in comparison with the heads. On some of the Kuang they begin to be serpentine. These vessels, like the double-Owl Yu, are really double-animal vessels, composed sometimes of a Bull and an Owl addorsed and merged, but more frequently of a Tiger and an Owl. The Owl's presence indicates that these vessels represent a late date in the Shang dynasty. The Tiger is almost invariably on the forepart of the vessel; its head, in the round, is placed above the spout and dominates the cover; its body is often represented incised on either side of the vessel. The Owl's head, flattened and looking upward, like the face on the Ho, lies at the opposite end of the cover; its wings and feet, usually clearly depicted, are on either side of the handle, which consists of a bird with its head in an animal's mouth (Fig. 3). An exception to this rule is an unusually large Kuang in the Freer Gallery where the bird has usurped the animal, the handle and the entire rear part of the Kuang; its head rises above the Owl's head, and its wings and feet appear instead of those of the Owl, which is thus reduced to being a mere mask.' ("'Chinese Bronzes", Catalogue, Freer Gallery of Art, Washington 1946, pl. 5). The Tiger on Fig. 3 has an attenuated serpentine body quite out of proportion to the head. There are other examples of this type of Tiger on Kuang (Waterbury, op. cit., PI 7). The snake-like form continues in Early Chou. Fig. 4 illustrates an exceptional Kuang on which the Owl occupies the forepart of the vessel, its head being directly under the spout. There is no cover. The Tiger, relegated to a place near the handle, stands upright in the same posture as that of the Tiger in Fig. 3. It has large, rounded ears and open jaws, with an upper lip which is greatly elongated and curls backward. This prolongation of the lip or the jaw 118</page><page sequence="6">Fig. 3 Kuang Courtesy of the Fogg Museum of Art begins in Shang (Waterbury, op. cit., Pls. 11, 73). On the forward upper part of the Kuang a smaller Tiger appears. It has no legs, except a remnant, but the head is similar to that of the larger Tiger, except for the ear, which is leaf-shaped. This convention also begins in Shang; the round natural ears of the Tiger become leaf-shaped when the horns of the Bulls, the Rams or the Water-buffalo are worn (op. cit., Pls. 9, II, IS, 45). The theory that the elongated form on the Ho represents the Tiger finds some support lig</page><page sequence="7">in Mr. Davidson's article, "The Flange on Chinese Bronzes" (Atrtibus Aside, XIV, 3). Mr. Davidson considers that the flange represents an animal-backbone, therefore by symbolic extension the entire animal. Since on many Shang vessels the flange is either absent, or so small as to be negligible, the writer feels doubtful as to this interpretation. Moreover, the Shang flange often divides the Tiger's face, which does not suggest a spine; and in other cases is obviously used as a divisional element. It may be a survival of some earlier material used for making ritual vessels. Its extraordinary prominence on the bronzes is a late deve- lopment due to Chou. As far as the writer has discovered, when the flange is associated with an animal in Chou that animal is almost invariably the Tiger. A Bull-kuang of Shang has a very small, low flange on its back; two Early Chou Bull-kuang have no flange (Waterbury, op. cit., Pls. 33, 34, 35). The Tigers on both Kuang (Figs. 3, 4) have the flange; the smaller Tiger on Fig. 4 has it; the snake-like body on the Ho has the flange, also the Tiger's forelegs, which indicates, in the writer's opinion, that it represents the Tiger. Another example is seen in Mr. Karlgren's Catalogue of the Pillsbury Collection, Pl. 47, which shows the top of the cover of a curious Kuang. The Tiger-head in the round has capped horns, and a long snake-like body in low relief. The flange follows the course of a spine along the sinuous body, which is definitely that of a Tiger, as is shown by the clawed forelegs in lower relief beside it. On this body, as on the Tiger's body on the Ho, and the small Tiger on Fig. 4, there is a design of lozenges. The snake with a Tiger's head is represented otherwise. There are no clawed forelegs, and the backbone is represented by a line or a slight ridge. Examples are the Bird-vessel (Water- bury, PI. 67), Mrs. Moore's famous Owl Tsun (Waterbury, PI. 54), and the two snakes with Tiger-heads and capped horns on either side of the spout on the Ho (Munsterberg, op. cit., Fig. 5). The writer, therefore, interpreting the animal on the Ho as a late Tiger-form, would expect to see a Tiger's head, probably with capped horns, on the cover. Since strange combinations of symbols exist on Early Chou bronzes, the present cover may, of course, be the original one. In this case, does the face represent the Deity Shang-ti? There are no representations of an anthropomorphised god on the Shang ritual bronzes, nor, so far as the writer knows, any reference to such a god in the texts. The eccentric Shang 1 20</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4 Owl-kuang Courtesy of the Metr-opolitan Museum of Art Emperor Wu-i, who made an image in human form and called it the Spirit of Heaven, was considered to be ( deraisonnable )) (,e-ma-ts'ien I, p. 198). It does not seem probable to the writer that the face on the Ho represents Shang-ti, nor that it represents T'ien, the Chou version of Shang-ti. It would seem as though the Chou feared to adopt the dynastic god whose descendants they had dispossessed; they therefore borrowed the divine powers and the remoteness of Shang-ti and called the deity T'ien. T'ien becomes even more im- personal than Shang-ti, and, so far as the writer knows, was not represented on the Chou 1 21</page><page sequence="9">ritual vessels. The figures on the Meyer, Sumitomo and Cernuschi bronzes, to which Dr. Munsterberg alludes, are not in the dominant positions of divinities upon these vessels; on the contrary, they are all in positions of being protected. The face on the Ho looks directly upward, which is the attitude of a worshipper rather than that of a deity. Although the symbols on the body and the capped horns on the cover derive from Shang, the do- minating elements-the face and the form of the legless vessel-are Chou; it therefore seems probable to the writer that this strange face, uncouth, clown-like, represents a Chou deity of the pre-conquest period, and that its significance should be sought among the traditions of Chou. The Chou people were agricultural; the supernatural dynastic ancestor, Hou Chi, who taught them agriculture and saved them from famine, was really an agricultural deity, Prince Millet (Creel, Birth of China, p. 225). The Chou also claimed descent from an official in the court of Hsia; they were therefore in contact with Hsia culture. A consistent tradition associates hills with the Hsia, and it seems probable that the Chou borrowed mountain- worship from them, and later introduced it into China. In the books of Hsia (Shu-king) there are numerous references to hills, or to mountain- ranges. Sacrifices were offered to the mountains Zhai and Mang (p. 70); King and Khi received sacrifices, also Kung-nan and Khun-wu, "on to Niao-shu" (p. 7I). "The hills were cleared of their superfluous wood and sacrificed to" (p. 74). Much later, hills are still associat- ed with the Hsia. In the descriptions of the ceremonial vessels and garments of Hsia, Shang and Chou, the Hsia jugs are described as being decorated with clouds and hills (Li Ki II, p. 35); and the ceremonial knee-caps of Hsia as having hills represented on them (op. cit., II, p. 38). In the books of Shang the books of Shang to mountain-worship is in connection with the Hsia. I Yin, the great minister of Tang the Victorious, tells Tang's grandson, who suc- ceeded him, that "the former kings of Hsia cultivated earnestly their virtue, and then there were no calamities from Heaven. The spirits of the hills and rivers likewise were all in tranquillity" (Shu-king, p. 93). Later on, I Yin, referring to the Shang religion, states that Tang "maintained the worship of the spirits of heaven and earth, of those presiding over the land and the grain, and of the ancestral temple" (Op. cit., p. 96). These two speeches by 122</page><page sequence="10">I Yin indicate that mountain-worship was not a part of the official Shang religion; this is further attested by the fact that on the oracle bones mountain-worship is not mentioned. It seems certain that this was introduced by the Chou. In the later books, the Chou rulers announce their plans and their achievements to the ancestral spirits, but in the Shu King, Wu makes his announcements to Heaven, Earth, and the hills and rivers. In his speech to the princes concerning the start of the expedition to Shang, he says, "I announced to great Heaven and the sovereign Earth, to the famous hill and the great river" (op. cit., p. 135). The latter two, Legge says, were probably the Hua Mountain and the Hoang Ho. After the conquest, Wu "presented a burnt-offering to Heaven, and worshipped towards the hills and rivers, solemnly announcing the successful completion of the war" (op. cit., p. 134). The Shi King contains much evidence of the Chou's reverence for the agricultural ancestor- deity, for agriculture, and for mountains. Hou Chi is the "correlate of Heaven" (Sze Wan); the Duke of Chou praises King Wu: "He has attracted and given rest to all spiritual beings even to (the spirits of) the Ho and the highest hills" (Shih Mai). Both the Shu-king and Se-ma-ts'ien state that Wu raised a mound over the grave of Pi-kau. The Shang graves had no mounds; these were continued under the Chou. Se-ma-ts'ien says of Wu, after the conquest, ( Le lendemain il fit deblayer la route et reparer l'(autel du) Dieu de la Terre)) (Se-ma-tsi'en I, p. 235). Considering the Chou attitude toward Hou Chi, with the consequent reverence for agriculture, the care of the altar of the god of the soil, the belief in the divinity of mount- ains-the mounds on the graves probably being an extension of this worship-it seems most probable to the writer that the face on the Ho represents an ancient earth-deity, surrounded by the symbols of Shang. Is there any indication of a particular god? Mr. Davidson's statement that "the mysterious elements of Shang are more clearly stated by literal-minded Chou successors" (Davidson, op. cit., p. 23) is enigmatic to the writer. It is true that the Shang symbols have reached the late stage of composite animals, but some things are clearly demonstrated, as, for instance, the association of the water-buffalo with the water-vessels. But the Chou vessels exhibit elaborations, exaggerations-of which the flange is a notable example -multiplications, misplacements, of Shang symbols and elements, a change which, in the writer's opinion, expresses not the mysterious elements of Shang, 123</page><page sequence="11">but the exuberant bristling vitality of the cruder people of a "border territory", to quote the Duke of Chou. It is as though the Chou considered that these symbols, intensely sacred, apotropaic, charged with divine influences, were enhanced by indiscriminate ex- tension, association and repetition. The principal Shang symbols on the Freer Ho are first the Tiger, basic element of the prehistoric religion, rampant guardian throughout Chinese history; the cowrie shell, which was still in use as money, and which, in its official ritual significance, means "precious", as is shown by the references in the early literature. The Shang ruler, Pan Kang, classes the cowries with jewels; his ministers, he says, think of nothing but hoarding "cowries and gems" (Shu-king, p. I 1 o). In burial rites, uncooked rice and cowrie shells are placed in the mouth of the deceased because they are "fine things" (Li Ki, I, p. i68). Nine cowries were placed in the grave with the emperor; seven with a feudal prince; five with a great officer; three with an ordinary officer (op.cit., II, p. 164). These are obviously precious things awarded in order of rank; it seems most improbable that the cowrie represented a female fecundity symbol in burials or on the ritual bronzes. The capped horns, which appear on the cover, and also on the body of the vessel, are associated with the ancestors. Emphasis was placed on the length of the bulls' horns, which differed for every sacrifice. The calves used for the ancestral sacrifice had horns which were short, only long enough so that they "could be grasped with the hand" (Li Ki, III, Io). The capping, as mentioned in the Ode, is obviously not an ordinary procedure but a ritual act. These calves were the only ones which had capped horns. The face on the cover of the Ho wears the capped horns; does this imply an ancestral connection transferred to the Chou? Is it not possible that the face on the Ho represents the dynastic agricultural deity, Hou Chi, who looks upward to T'ien, the giver of rain? So Dr. Munsterberg and the writer, although accompanied by different gods, meet on the ground of divinely bestowed fertility. 124</page></plain_text>
