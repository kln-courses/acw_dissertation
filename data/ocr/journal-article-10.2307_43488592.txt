<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEAN FLOWER In the Village and Other Stories When which Elizabeth she felt Bishop was her sent best her story long ever story - to "In The the New Village" Yorker - in which she felt was her best story ever - to The New Yorker in July 1952, she wrote to a friend, "they probably still won't like it."1 How right she was. It took almost a year of argument with the editors before they could be persuaded to accept a somewhat revised version of it. Still, after a fallow period in Brazil when she wrote almost no poetry at all, Bishop felt good about the story and about story writing in general. She told her Yaddo friends Ilse and Kit Barker, "To my great surprise - I hadn't finished a story in ten years, I think - I suddenly started writing some and have done three. . . ." The notion that she might think more seriously about the form, and even publish a collection of stories, started to take shape. A week after "In the Village" was accepted, she wrote to the Barkers again: I am really getting interested in what I now think is the Art of story writing. I just wrote off some prose-poetry from time to time before. I am afraid "In the Village" is pretty much that, too - but now I am taking it more seriously and thinking about people , balancing this with that, time etc. - and I'm hoping whatever I write will be a little less precious and 'sensitive,' etc., in the future. Despite the usual Bishop self-deprecation (her best work just tossed off, mere "precious" prose-poetry), this was bold and ambitious. So too was her declaration in a letter to Marianne Moore, a week before "In the Village" was published: ". . . I'll have a book of stories out in another year. (There is to be one, I think, in the Dec. 19th New Yorker ... At first I thought it was my best, so far - now I have doubts . . .)" But when does Bishop ever not have doubts? The story received widespread, richly-justified praise, epitomized by the words of an 1 One Art: Letters of Elizabeth Bishop , ed. by Robert Giroux (New York, 1994).

A similar view - it became the author's favorite - was voiced by the president of a ball-bearing rolling pin company, who told The New Yorker irritably that at last they had published a story that made some sensel Yet within two months Bishop's story-writing ambitions had all but collapsed. She told the Barkers, "I'm not really a story writer, you know - never meant to be at all. Writing stories is just much better for one, when one can't write poems, than dissipation, say." Three weeks later she used the same disclaimer in another letter about "In the Village": "I know I'm not a story writer, really - this is just poetic prose. And completely autobiographical (although not in the usual New Yorker manner). I've just stuck a few years together." When Robert Lowell extracted a poem from the central images of "In the Village," calling it "The Scream," (published in The Kenyon Review, Autumn, 1962), Bishop was not entirely pleased. She wrote to him sardonically, I don't know why I bother to write "Uncle Artie" [her memoir-in- progress that became "Uncle Neddy"], really - I shd. just send you my first notes and you can turn him into a wonderful poem - he is even more your style than the village story was. The Scream really works well, doesn't it - the story is far enough behind me so I can see it as a poem now. The first few stanzas I saw only my story - then the poem took over - and the last stanza is wonderful. It builds up beautifully, and everything of importance is there. But I was very surprised.2 Surprised but not quite offended. It is striking to see how readily Bishop abandoned her story to Lowell's aggressive takeover. Never mind that her story was already a poem, or that she derived her own far more "wonderful poem" "Sestina" from it, as Brett Millier justly argues in her Bishop biography.3 For his part, Lowell felt some "misgivings" when he sent Bishop a copy of "The Scream." He admitted it was "probably a travesty, making some- thing small and literary out [of] something much larger, gayer and more healthy." That decent apology, however, was ruined by what he said next: "Maybe you could use it for raw material for a 2 Words in Air: The Complete Correspondence Between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell, ed. by Thomas Travisano and Saskia Hamilton (New York, 2008). 3 Brett C.

Giving up the idea of a story collection completely, Bishop decided to include "In the Village" in her next poetry collection, Questions of Travel (1965). She explained to Randall Jarrell, "There are three or four poems that go with it, and it is more a prose-poem than a story, anyway." Yet such was her uncertainty about its genre that she omitted it when Questions of Travel was reprinted in her Collected Poems of 1969. Years later this decision had a bizarre consequence. Readers of the Library of America edition, Elizabeth Bishop : Poems , Prose, and Letters , will have a hard time finding "In the Village." It is not included as one of her stories, nor as a personal essay or reminiscence, nor is it indexed as a story or a poem, nor is it listed anywhere under its own title. But it is there, of course, back among the Nova Scotia poems in Questions of Travel where Bishop placed it in 1965. The idea of a story collection still tantalized Bishop in her later years. Her manuscripts at Vassar College include a tentative table of contents page, undated, for just such a volume, to be called "IN THE VILLAGE &amp; OTHER STORIES." After a group of five "Early Stories" come four Nova Scotia stories under the heading "In the Village"- "Gwendolyn," "In the Village," "Uncle Neddy," and "Primer Class" - followed by two more tentative groupings of "Later" and "Personal" narratives. Lloyd Schwartz's definitive edition of Elizabeth Bishop : Prose provides a reproduction of this typed page with its many handwritten corrections and question marks.5 It seems clear that Bishop came to understand "In the Village" as central to all of her stories and memoirs. Yet at any moment (so to speak) she could see it as a prose-poem or even a poem - or dismiss it entirely as not a very good story at all. When in a 1978 interview Elizabeth Spires asked her whether the methods of her stories and poems were connected, Bishop replied, "They're very closely related. I suspect that some of the stories I've written are actually prose poems and not very good stories."6 Some of this ambivalence surely comes from the way "In the Village" was first written and the violent reaction it received at The 4 Thomas Travisano and Saskia Hamilton. 5 Elizabeth Bishop: Prose, ed. by Lloyd Schwartz (New York, 201 1). 6 Conversations with Elizabeth Bishop, ed. by George Monteiro (Jackson, Mississippi, 1996), p. 125.</page><page sequence="4">502 THE HUDSON REVIEW New Yorker in 1952. Sleepless from an overdose of cortisone (which freed her lungs from asthma) , Bishop wrote the story in two nights of prolonged inspiration and sent it off virtually unrevised. The New Yorkers reaction was to find its "poetic quality" all well and good but the narrative inadequate. "Author simply doesn't tell enough," said one editor, who went on (ironically, from Bishop's point of view) to give an accurate account of the entire situation, grumbling that he was forced to "gather" that the woman who screams is the little girl's mother. The imperious Katharine S. White - whom Bishop admired and trusted and who conducted all the magazine's negotiations with her by letter - put it this way: "we are all of us for the story, if we can persuade you to clarify and strengthen the thread of narrative that it is strung on." That thread, she claimed, was "so thin that it seems to break entirely."7 Was the woman having the nervous breakdown at the dress fitting the girl's mother? What is the relation between the little girl and the story's "I"? Why is the little girl being brought up by her grandmother in Nova Scotia, while her mother is alive and has been living elsewhere? Why is the dialogue "unintention- ally difficult," with insufficient identification of who says what? And finally, why does it look wrong? "Your pages 2 and 3 are written like a poem rather than like a piece of prose," White said. "But for us it would still be poetic prose, and really better prose, if these separate single sentences were sometimes run together and written in the form of short paragraphs." (Italics mine.) White put all her authority - which was considerable, speaking for The New Yorker - plus all the personal pressure she could muster behind her summation: I urge you to change ["In the Village"] only because I think it will certainly be a better piece of writing if you do change it, and I'm sure that the poetic quality will not be lost by so doing. The whole piece is evocative and moving and interesting provided one can figure out what is happening. But as the story now reads, the whole thing is too elusive to be understood and truly appreciated. One might take up each of White's objections in order. The "thread of narrative" is frequendy, even routinely, thin or broken in Modernist narrative, especially when subjectivity is intense. 7 Elizabeth Bishop and The New Yorker: The Complete Correspondence, ed. by Joelle Biele (New York, 2011).</page><page sequence="5">DEAN FLOWER 503 Connecting the threads or leaping the gaps, imagining the links that turn fragments into sequences or confusion into plots, is one of the chief demands (and pleasures) of what we learned to do in reading Faulkner and Joyce and a host of others. Surely it is better to "gather" that the woman who screams is the girl's mother - and so to appreciate how confused and distant the child is from this mystifying, disturbed woman. Why indeed is the girl being brought up by her grandmother? That is something she knows and accepts, but she's not old enough to understand it or explain why. Again the reader is left to infer what the child cannot, that her mother's grief and morbidity after her husband's death are driving her insane. Bishop's storytelling instincts, not her poetry, guide her here: she chooses to show, even to confuse, rather than explain. That's what gives the story its narrative power. All we need to know about the situation, in fact, is compressed in the storybook language of the six-year-old. Note how the use of third person keeps the pathos at a distance: First, she had come home, with her child. Then she had gone away again, alone, and left the child. Then she had come home. Then she had gone away again, with her sister, and now she was home again. The rest is left - as it always is in masterful storytelling - to the imagination. White's criticism of the story's unidentified "I" can also be resolved, rather easily, and she did not persist in her objection to its shifting point of view. The story is a memoir, as its first paragraph makes clear. Most of what follows is the child's naïve point of view but, as with so many memoirs, the older and wiser self looks on and comments - not too invasively - or moves into a neutral objectivity from time to time. These are not radical point- of-view shifts, nor even confusing ones. The story's first sentence tells most of what we need to know. "A scream, the echo of a scream, hangs over that Nova Scotia village." Note how this may be parsed: "A scream" [for the child] , an echo of a scream [for the adult]." It comes to the memoirist from the past, but it's still in the present. And that scream is what darkens and colors everything (as the whole first paragraph makes clear) - not just the intense blue Nova Scotia sky but "the rims of the eyes," the writer's very mode of perceiving. On the last page the adult self speaks again, taking up the same images:</page><page sequence="6">504 THE HUDSON REVIEW Now there is no scream. Once there was one and it settled slowly down to earth one hot summer afternoon, or did it float up, into that dark, too dark blue sky? But surely it has gone away, forever. In typical Bishop fashion each assertion is qualified and revised. There is no scream now, it has settled down . Or else it has floated up and - back to the first paragraph - it still makes the sky "too dark." No, it has gone away, forever . End of story? Not quite. "Surely" contains its opposite and turns it all into a question - for which the only answer is yes and no. White's claim that the dialogue is "unintentionally difficult" led to the editors' endless tinkering with the manuscript to explain who each speaker is. Bishop conceded a few pronouns here and there, plus some changes in paragraphing and punctua- tion, but she refused to revise away the mysteries that discomfited The New Yorker so deeply. White's "unintentionally" is particularly revealing, as if Bishop were a beginner at fiction, too unskilled to clarify who says what: surely she did not intend to make it so obscure? But of course she did, to represent the child's incom- prehension. Scornfully Bishop wrote to Pearl Kazin in February 1953, I refuse to put in enough "he saids" and "she saids" and "it was 4 p.m., a very hot summer, August 16, 1917, Great Village, Nova Scotia, and my father's name was William Thomas Bishop"s [sec]. . . . The idea underneath it all seems to be that the New Yorker reader must never have to pause and think for a single second, but be informed and reinformed comfortingly all the time . . . Frustrated and angered by all the editorial dither (the correspon- dence "trailing behind" it had become "fantastic," Bishop said) , she set the story aside for four months. Katharine White's final criticisms cut even more deeply. The story was objectionably like poetry. It would "really be better prose" if all those separate lines were written consecutively. Again White was presuming to be the authority on prose fiction, telling the inexperienced Bishop what her sentences ought to look like, properly connected on the page. Sadly, we will never know what the original pages 2 and 3 looked like, but we can sense it from passages like this one, early in the story:</page><page sequence="7">DEAN FLOWER 505 The wallpaper glinted and the elm trees outside hung heavy and green, and the straw matting smelled like the ghost of hay. Clang. Clang. Oh, beautiful sounds, from the blacksmith's shop at the end of the garden! Or from passages like this one, during the night of the burning barn next door, with all the male commotion outside, while some other commotion goes on among the child's aunts and grand- mother inside the house: "Hurry. For heaven's sake, shut the door.r "Sh !" "Oh, we can't go on like this, we . . ." "It's too dangerous. Remember that ..." "Sh! Don't let her . . A door slams. A door opens. The voices begin again. I am struggling to free myself. Wait. Wait. No one is going to scream. The first passage scans easily, has multiple sensory appeals, and even looks like poetry. But it surely has an equal narrative appeal: it is a sequence of the girl's intense and immediate perceptions, each sharply distinct. And it is mediated by the adult narrator: each perception is an act of her memory, the past given a present chronology. The second passage, equally fragmentary to the eye, is laden with narrative interest. The mystery is not who says what but why all the anxiety and concealment? What cannot go on like this? What is too dangerous, and to whom? The suspenseful drama concludes not with a scream but, far more effectively, with a scream withheld. All the questions are answerable, of course, but they require the reader's willingness to infer the story - narra- tivity it's called, in some quarters - but The New Yorker editors failed to recognize that or wished it away. Both passages, it seems to me, attest to Bishop's skill as a story writer and a poet. Was there any necessity, really, to separate the two? Of course Bishop's publishers and editors have long done that. In his 1984 edition of Bishop's works, Robert Giroux separated The Complete Poems, 1927-1979 from The Collected Prose. Nobody can object to that standard (and useful) distinction. Giroux</page><page sequence="8">506 THE HUDSON REVIEW arranged the prose into two categories, nine more factual works under the heading "Memory: Persons and Places" and eight more fictive titles under the heading "Stories," with "In the Village" placed last. Never mind that Bishop's storytelling gifts are fully deployed in her memoir writing or that most of her best "stories" are memoirs or memoir-like. There are gradations of fictiveness, surely, and Giroux sensed them well. But consider how strongly Bishop felt about the factual truth of "In the Village." She told Ilse and Kit Barker that it was "completely autobiographical," so factual indeed that one of her aunts helped her to correct it. And she was even more emphatic to U. T. and Joseph Summers: "'In the Village' is entirely , not just partly, auto- biographical. I've just compressed the time a little and perhaps put two summers together, or put things a bit out of sequence - but it's all straight fact." That was what prompted Lloyd Schwartz, when he edited Elizabeth Bishop : Prose , to classify her "Stories and Memoirs" together: "she treats what are clearly autobiographical narratives as if they were fiction," Schwartz observes, and "often deliberately blurs the distinction between fiction and memoir." About the distinction between story and poem in works like "In the Village," he has nothing to say, nor does he wonder about the various prose pieces that Bishop included in her poetry collections - "Rainy Season: Sub-Tropics," for example, which includes the fictive monologues of "Giant Toad," "Strayed Crab," and "Giant Snail." The convention is to call these prose poems, but (to sound like Katharine White for a moment) they certainly look like stories and sound like covert autobiography. But Schwartz's categories are relentless. After the narrative prose comes all of Bishop's other prose: essays, reviews and tributes, prose translations, some correspondence with Anne Stevenson, plus an appendix of "Early Prose" from Bishop's school and college days. That gives us 485 pages of prose, dwarfing (yet again) the slim volume of Bishop's poetry, but also insisting all the more heavily that Bishop's stories and memoirs be understood as prose. Rather than preserve that boundary, I would suggest that we cross it, or even ignore it entirely. Where are the best stories and memoirs that Bishop ever wrote? "In the Village" should invite us to look for more of them embedded in her poetry and insepa- rable from it. In fact from the beginning Bishop's poems have</page><page sequence="9">DEAN FLOWER 507 frequently told stories. They have dramatized characters, issued from narrators, mimicked voices, used shifting points of view, depended on chronology, created suspense, invited narrativity, come from other narratives themselves - like "Trollope 's Journal" or "Crusoe in England" - or used forms of narrative poetry (ballads like "Chemin de Fer" and "The Burglar of Babylon") or echoed narrative poems (like "The Gentleman of Shalott" and "Casabianca") or were intrinsically narrative in the first place (memoirs, dramatic monologues). Many of Bishop's later poems - pace Mrs. White! - even look more like meditative prose than rhymed verse or metered stanzas ("At the Fishhouses," for example, or "In the Waiting Room"). Who cannot readily call to mind a Bishop poem that - apart from all its other merits - tells a wonderful story? I think immediately of "The Moose" from Geography III , but there are innumerable others. George Starbuck once told Bishop, who had apologized for saying nothing profound in an interview, "You tell a wonderful story." That was true in more ways than he realized at the time.8 The story of "The Moose" began as an anecdote in a letter Bishop wrote to Marianne Moore in 1946. She had spent a week visiting her relatives in Great Village, where she had spent so many summers, and had just returned to Boston: I came back by bus - a dreadful trip, but it seemed most convenient at the time - we hailed it with a flashlight and a lantern as it went by the farm late at night. Early the next morning, just as it was getting light, the driver had to stop suddenly for a big cow moose who was wandering down the road. She walked away very slowly into the woods, looking at us over her shoulder. The driver said that one foggy night he had to stop while a huge bull moose came right up and smelled the engine. "Very curious beasts," he said.9 Moore was always curious about animals, Bishop knew, and would enjoy hearing that the moose, in return, was curious about the bus. (The seal in "At the Fishhouses" behaves in a similar way.) A few years later, when she began writing intensively about her Nova Scotia memories (and produced "In the Village"), she started a poem about her bus trip in 1946, planning to dedicate it to her aunt, Grace Bulmer Bowers, who still lived in the village. 8 Conversations with Elizabeth Bishop, p. 97. 9 Elizabeth Bishop: Poems , Prose , and Letters, ed. by Lloyd Schwartz and Robert Giroux (New York: Library of America, 2008) .</page><page sequence="10">508 THE HUDSON REVIEW Bishop worked over the moose story for the next twenty years, trying to get it right, and finally forced herself to complete it in 1972, for a Phi Beta Kappa award performance. It had grown from an amusing anecdote, told to Moore who had never seen her Nova Scotia landscape, to a richly-detailed depiction of that landscape, told to her aunt, who knew it well and would appreciate its authentic details. Bishop could claim, as she did for "In the Village," that everything in the poem is autobiographical and based on fact. The "lone traveler" who boards the bus at line 39 is Bishop herself, and the subjective point of view - especially its intense visual images, its suspenseful syntax, its performative rhythms and indirect speech ("Goodbye to the elms, / to the farm, to the dog"), not to mention its later dream sequences - implies her constant narrative presence. Factuality is no less important, for the storyteller wants us to know exactly where we are. Clearly, the "narrow provinces / of fish and bread and tea" designate Maritime Canada. The "long tides / where the bay leaves the sea / twice a day" identify the Bay of Fundy with its immense tidal variations, leaving "the bay not at home" for hours on end. Get out your largest atlas to locate all the little villages along the shore, with their quirky names - "the Economies - Lower, Middle, and Upper, / Five Islands, Five Houses." The "lone traveler" is too reticent to name her own village, and besides the bus is now making other stops. With no warning (time and space are elided; the bus has turned north, night has fallen, many miles have passed) we come to the Tantramar Marshes, having crossed into New Brunswick - "An iron bridge trembles / and a loose plank rattles / but does not give way." The story lingers dramatically on this insecure nighttime crossing, so suggestive of dangers and warnings: "a red light / swims through the dark," but in fact it's stationary, only "a ship's port lantern" seeming to move because the bus does. "Two rubber boots show" - apparently a fisherman standing there on deck, holding a lantern low - and an invisible dog barks. The chiaroscuro tempts us to misconstrue simple facts and demands that we conjecture the literal narrative. In plain fact the bus has crossed a tidal estuary, at the Isthmus of Chignecto, which divides Nova Scotia from New Brunswick. But Bishop has no interest in telling the story that way.</page><page sequence="11">DEAN FLOWER 509 Another documentary motive in the storytelling emerges from the way people speak. There is a great quantity of dialogue in this seemingly lyric poem, but Bishop singles out two particular individuals. At line 73 when a woman boards the bus just after the Tantramar Marshes, carrying two market bags, she is described as "brisk, freckled, elderly," and her speech is distinctive: "A grand night. Yes, sir, all the way to Boston." She regards us amicably. Put this alongside the bus driver who speaks at the end of the story: "Curious creatures," says our quiet driver, rolling his r s. "Look at that, would you." It takes a moment to realize that the rolled / s suggest a Scottish accent, and that idioms like "Look at that, would you" (not a question) and "a grand night" have a brisk Scots-Irish ring to them. Put that together with place names like New Brunswick and (obviously) Nova Scotia, and note that a Scotsman, Robert MacAdam, invented the road surface called "macadam" - a word slipped into the last stanza as if only for the alliteration of "moonlit macadam" - and you realize how craftily Bishop has used vernacular realism and place names to evoke the human history of her region. While moose are certainly "curious crea- tures," aren't the people who stare at them just as curious? They carry with them echoes of far-off places and histories. The unspoken autobiographical plot of "The Moose" goes back, I think, to "In the Village." It is about grief and loss, having to say good-bye again to that place of tears and happiness. The more overt plot concerns the lone traveler, who sits through the night on the bus listening to all the murmuring voices telling of inexorable losses. She begins to lose her sense of isolation; her identity dissolves and merges dreamily with others. Their voices recall her grandparents talking "in the old featherbed, / peacefully, on and on," and it now seems safe to fall asleep.</page><page sequence="12">510 THE HUDSON REVIEW Suddenly everyone is jolted out of this deep reverie by the abrupt appearance of the moose. Nothing could be more story-like than this suddenness, when the momentum of twenty-one stanzas is halted this way. Yet the animal only gets a few quick phrases - it "looms," it sniffs the bus, it is "Towering, antlerless" and "homely." Bishop lets the passengers do most of the rest, surren- dering her point of view to their awed, respectful, lame and fascinated responses. These culminate in the busdriver's sage remark - the punch line of the original anecdote - "Curious creatures." Again, with impeccable craft and wit, Bishop ends with the passengers reciprocating what the moose has done: they sniff "a dim / smell of moose" and what it was curious about - "an acrid / smell of gasoline." Another confrontation with a non-human creature provides the plot of "The Fish" (1940), an early poem that most readers assume has no plot. It begins, "I caught a tremendous fish," and it ends 76 lines later with "I let the fish go," as if what happens in between were static, a prolonged but entirely passive series of observations.10 But the poem's real story lies in the observer's struggle to see the fish and to find adequate words to describe it. The opening lines tell what just happened before the poem starts ("He didn't fight. / He hadn't fought at all."), preparing for the different sort of struggle that will be required to "catch" the fish in words: He hung a grunting weight, battered and venerable and homely. As with any unreliable narrator, ironies abound here. Note the anthropomorphic "He," the transferred epithet of "grunting" (it's really hers, of course), and the instant subjective assumptions of "venerable" (not just old but deserving respect) and "homely" (as was the awesome moose). At least these terms improve a little over the totally inadequate "tremendous" in the first line. After personifications come similes which sharpen and focus the details ("like ancient wallpaper," "like wallpaper" with "shapes like full-blown roses / stained and lost through age"), but the 10 Millier tells us that Bishop caught a 60-pound fish off the coast of Florida in 1938, but that's a different kind of story.</page><page sequence="13">DEAN FLOWER 511 repetition betrays the writer-observer's effort to revise and correct each perception. Such verbal self-correction runs throughout the poem (and throughout Bishop's writing), engaging the reader in a constant process of reflexivity. Are we looking at the fish or at the writer's hesitations and erasures, questionings and approxi- mations, qualifications and re-conceptions, and sudden new discoveries? The latter, of course, since they are the only means to reach the former. And the latter are what make this poem a story. After an imaginary tour of the fish's interior, with its "coarse white flesh / packed in like feathers," its "shiny entrails," and its "pink swim-bladder / like a big peony" - all flagrantly impossible to see, of course - the storyteller at last confronts the fact that the fish (unlike the moose and the seal in poems still to be written) offers no response to the human at all: I looked into his eyes which were far larger than mine but shallower, and yellowed, the irises backed and packed with tarnished tinfoil seen through the lenses of old scratched isinglass. Surely this is one of the most brilliantly exact, resourceful and convincing descriptions in all of Bishop's poetry. Yet the effort gets us no closer to the fish; its eye defeats the viewer's gaze - it "shifted a little, but not / to return my stare." Of course "defeats" is my own invention, imposing intentionality where none exists. But imposing human traits and intentions is exactly what Bishop's storyteller does, most flagrantly of all in the poem's climactic actions. Notice how these discoveries evolve, from very close observation of detail to wholly imagined inferences and conjectures. The "five old pieces of fish-line" she sees hanging from the fish's "grim, wet, and weaponlike" lower lip, still attached to their "five big hooks" in his mouth, include "a green line, frayed at the end / where he broke if and "A fine black thread / still crimped from the strain and snap / when it broke and he got away ." (Italics mine.) In a moment the five hooks become Like medals with their ribbons frayed and wavering,</page><page sequence="14">512 THE HUDSON REVIEW a five-haired beard of wisdom trailing from his aching jaw. Along with imposed story comes a rush of sympathetic personifi- cation. The fish has been made venerable and wise, with his "weaponlike" lip bearing the "medals" of his courage, his "battered" old skin and "aching jaw" now proving him stoic and triumphantly defiant of capture. When "victory filled up / the little rented boat" and everything becomes "rainbow, rainbow, rainbow," the story reaches the apex of its narrativity. Whatever we may think about the actual fish, it's clearly the narrator's feeling of his victory that fills up the little rented boat. If she has caught the fish, it is only by means of figurative language strained and stretched to its limits. Strangely enough, however, by admitting so much fallacy and dubious manipulation in this fish story, Bishop ends by persuad- ing us of its truth. The poem snares us in the story of its own making. That, for me, makes it endlessly fresh and re-readable. And that same quality draws me to other poems like it - "Sea- scape," "Large Bad Picture," "The Map," "Over 200 Illustrations and a Complete Concordance," "The Bight" - all of which inquire into acts of looking. But none of these has the emotional depth that comes in Bishop's later autobiographical poetry, notably in "Poem," where she returns again to the setting of "In the Village." As in "The Fish," the story derives from a prolonged visual investigation. It emerges that Bishop has inherited a small painting done by her great uncle, a once-famous artist elected to the (British) Royal Academy. Its small size and limited palette ("mostly the same whites, gray greens, and steel grays") indicate it's probably only "a sketch" for something larger, and was never meant to be sold. For seventy years it has been "a minor family relic," never receiving any special attention. So much for the dismissive-sounding introduction, which poses the dubious question of whether the painting - "About the size of an old-style dollar bill, / American or Canadian" - has any real value at all. Looking in earnest begins with the second paragraph (or stanza, if you prefer; there are five of them), and immediately - as she begins to discern its tiniest details - the painting becomes surpris- ingly skillful and engrossing. Inference is again required: gabled houses painted "that awful shade of brown" mean the place "must</page><page sequence="15">DEAN FLOWER 513 be" Nova Scotia. Reflexivity is constantly at issue: are we looking at paint "fresh-squiggled from the tube" or at a wild iris? That "gray-blue wisp" might be "a thin church steeple / ... or is it?" Some "tiny cows" are only "two brushstrokes each, but confidently cows." Note the nice ambiguity of confidently : is that the artist's confident skill or the viewer's confidence that she sees what's intended? The shifts between uncertainty and confidence produce drama in every line. Ironically, even a tiny "specklike bird flying to the left" might be "a flyspeck looking like a bird" - such are the perils of investigation. Then, in the first line of the next paragraph, comes the most story-like moment of all, when the narrator bursts out, Heavens, I recognize the place, I know it! Everything changes with this discovery: what had dubious monetary value suddenly acquires immediate personal value; what was a purely aesthetic curiosity suddenly becomes a flood of excited memories. Inferences, guesses, and doubts continue, but her vision of the picture is now dynamic - intertwined with the painter's experience, not just with his brush and colors. If this is not a plot, I don't know what is. Now she can identify a farmer's barn that "backed on that meadow," which before was only "titanium white, one dab." What were only "filaments of brush hairs" before are now (confidently!) a "hint of steeple" identi- fying the Presbyterian church. A formerly anonymous house now becomes, possibly, "Miss Gillespie's." But there are still more layers to this story. In the fourth section two new times are added to its chronology: the "hour" when Great Uncle George made the sketch "in one breath" and the moment years later when the sketch was given to the writer by her aunt: the words in italics tell us exactly what she said - supplying the missing details of the painting's source. Her language, with its conversational informality ("Your Uncle George , no, mine , my Uncle George "), echoes the repetition and self- correction of the narrator, despite the point-of-view shift. The final two layers of the story's chronology emerge in its final paragraph. They consist of two different time periods, at least a generation apart, and two different points of view. The first is (as usual) a matter of conjecture but not of any real doubt: Great</page><page sequence="16">514 THE HUDSON REVIEW Uncle George "knew this place" and "looked at it long enough to memorize it" - as his oil sketch attests - even though he went back to England. Bishop "never knew him" or could have known him, but she too knew this place, in her time, and looked at it long enough to memorize it. "It's still loved," she claims for them both, knowing of her own loving memory and sensing the same in his attentive painting. The co-incidence of their detailed memories prompts a further thought: they both understood the convergence of art ("copying from life" in paint or words) and life itself: life and the memory of it so compressed they've turned into each other. Which is which? Life and the memory of it cramped, dim, on a piece of Bristol board. The art of remembering compresses and preserves, which makes possible some feeling of timelessness, but it also evokes transience and a recognition of impending loss. As the narrator observed so casually in stanza four, "Those particular geese and cows / are naturally before my time." But the tone now is not casual; the story ends with beautiful solemnity. The present tense conveys a poignant sense of "how touching in detail" the memory of this place is. (The pun on "touching" is touching in itself.) All the images are repeated from the painting, or rather from the earlier account of the painting - geese, cows, iris, water meadow, and elms - but they are now slightly revised, made fresher, held in a momentary suspension that is only possible in art: the munching cows, the iris, crisp and shivering, the water still standing from spring freshets, the yet-to-be-dismantled elms, the geese. It is striking that this layered narrative with its carefully arranged and combined chronologies, its dramatic plot, its point-of-view shifts, and its narrativity should still be called "Poem." To me it occupies a realm of Bishop's own, one that fuses story and poetry, a realm she discovered twenty-three years before when she wrote "In the Village."</page></plain_text>
