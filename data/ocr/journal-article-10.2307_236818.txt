<plain_text><page sequence="1">DECEMBER 2000 AN INTERNATIONAL REVIEW DEVOTED TO THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND ITS CULTURAL INFLUENCES Published by The University of Chicago Press for The History of Science Society VOLUME 91 NUMBER 4</page><page sequence="2">History of Science Society The History of Science Society was founded in 1924 to secure the future of Isis, the international review that George Sarton (1884-1956) founded in Belgium in 1912. Since 1984 the publication of Isis has been supported in part by an en- dowment from The Dibner Fund. The Society seeks to foster interest in the history of science and its social and cultural relations, to provide a forum for discussion, and to promote scholarly re- search in the history of science. The So- ciety pursues these objectives by the pub- lication of its journal Isis, by the support and subvention of other forms of schol- arly publication, by the organization of annual meetings and other programs, by the award of medals and prizes for out- standing contributions to the history of science, by the encouragement and spon- sorship of local and regional sections of the Society, and by cooperation with other learned and scientific societies.

(From Jefferys Taylor, A Glance at the Globe, and at Worlds Around Us [London: Houlston &amp; Stoneman, 1848], frontispiece).</page><page sequence="9">SUGGESTIONS FOR CONTRIBUTORS TO ISIS 1. Manuscripts (original plus three copies) should be submitted to the Editor of Isis, Department of Science and Technology Studies, Cornell University, 726 University Av- enue, Ithaca, NY 14850, U.S.A. Please include an abstract of approximately 150 words. Contributors are advised to retain a copy for reference. 2. Manuscripts should be typewritten or processed on a letter-quality printer and double- spaced throughout, including quotations and notes, on paper of standard size and weight. Margins should be wider than usual to allow space for instructions to the typesetter. The right-hand margin should be left ragged (not justified) to maintain even spacing and read- ability. 3. Isis normally uses double-blind refereeing; authors should therefore identify themselves only on a detachable cover sheet. 4. Bibliographic information should be given in footnotes (not parenthetically in the text), typed separately from the main body of the manuscript, double- or even triple-spaced, numbered consecutively throughout the article, and keyed to reference numbers typed above the line in the text. a. References to books should include author's full name; complete title of the book, underlined (italics); place of publication and publisher's name for books published after 1900; date of publication, including the original date when a reprint is being cited; page numbers cited. Example: Joseph Needham, Science and Civilisation in China, 5 vols., Vol. I: Introductory Orientations (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ. Press, 1954), p. 7. b. References to articles in periodicals should include author's name; title of article, in quotes; title of periodical, underlined; year; volume number, Arabic and underlined; number of issue if pagination requires it; page numbers of article; number of particular page cited. Journal titles are spelled out in full on first citation and abbreviated subse- quently. Example: John C. Greene, "Reflections on the Progress of Darwin Studies," Journal of the History of Biology, 1975, 8:243-273, on p. 270; Dov Ospovat, "God and Natural Selection: The Darwinian Idea of Design," J. Hist. Biol., 1980, 13:169-174, on p. 171. c. Succeeding citations of books and periodicals should use an abbreviated version of the title with the author's last name. Example: Greene, "Reflections," p. 250. 5. Please mark clearly for the typesetter all unusual alphabets, special characters, mathe- matics, and chemical formulae, and include all diacritical marks. 6. A small number of figures may be used to illustrate an article. Line drawings should be directly reproducible; glossy prints should be furnished for all halftone illustrations. 7. Manuscripts should be submitted to Isis with the understanding that upon publication copyright will be transferred to the History of Science Society. That understanding pre- cludes Isis from considering material that has been submitted or accepted for publication elsewhere.</page></plain_text>
