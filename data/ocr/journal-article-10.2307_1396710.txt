<plain_text><page sequence="1">Abraham Cohen THEOLOGY AND THEODICY: ON READING HAROLD KUSHNER At the outset of his book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, Harold Kushner notes that his "is a very personal book, written by someone who believes in God and in the goodness of the world.. ." (p. 1). The writing of the book was prompted by the tragedy of Kushner's son, Aaron, who died at age fourteen of progeria, a disease that induces pre- mature aging. As a result of this tragedy Kushner and his wife had to re- think the view of God they had "grown up with ... an image of God as an all-wise, all-powerful parent figure who would treat us as our earthly parents did, or even better." The religious issue underlying tragedies is clear, says Kushner. "There is only one question which really matters: why do bad things happen to good people? All other theological conver- sation is intellectually diverting .. ." (p. 6). In chapter 1 of his book, entitled "Why do the Righteous Suffer?" Kushner outlines the traditional views of evil in the world and offers his rebuttal of these positions. Briefly stated, these positions, and Kushner's objections to them, are as follows: 1. One way of explaining evil is to say that God is a righteous judge and that man gets what he deserves (pp. 9, 10). Kushner cites a number of biblical verses in support of this view. He objects to this view on the classic grounds that we see righteous people who suffer in the absence of any wrong-doing that would justify their plight. Furthermore, viewing all suffering as just, induces a feeling of unwarranted guilt, as a result of which people come to hate both God and themselves (p. 10). 2. A second explanation for evil sees it as part of a divine design that man cannot fully fathom. In this view, suffering not only contributes to the divine "work of art" but can even become a "privilege" (p. 18). Kush- ner demurs that we don't know what the design is, and finds this a hypo- thetical solution to the problem of evil. He rejects condoning "human pain because it supposedly contributes to an overall work of esthetic value" (p. 19). 3. A third position argues that suffering is educational, that it cures men of their faults, and makes them better people (p. 19). Kushner feels that this explanation is a defense of God only. It does not help the suf- ModernJudaism 16 (1996): 229-261 ? 1996 by TheJohns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">230 Abraham Cohen ferer or explain his suffering. Those who take this position "are at a loss to specify just what it is about us we are supposed to change" (p. 23). 4. A fourth explanation of evil highlights its function as a test of man, as in the story of the binding of Isaac. Kushner does not like the "notion of a God who plays such sadistic games with his most faithful follower..." (p. 25). Citing cases where he has seen people "crack under the strain of unbearable tragedy," Kushner argues that God "must know by now that many of us fail the test. If he is only giving us burdens we can bear, I have seen Him miscalculate far too often" (p. 26). 5. A fifth explanation argues that suffering "comes to liberate us from a world of pain and leads us to a better place" (pp. 26-7). When a five-year-old child was killed, his family was told that his soul was un- stained by sin and he was removed from this world of pain. Kushner re- jects this view which turns tragedy into a positive event, worthy of rejoicing (p. 27). 6. A sixth explanation of evil, which Kushner dismisses, argues that "evil is not real, (it is) a condition of not enough goodness." JOB Kushner says that all of the above responses to tragedy have one thing in common. "They all assume that God is the cause of our suffering." Kush- ner suggests that there is another approach. Perhaps we err when we ask "how could God do this to me?" "Maybe God does not cause our suffering?" (pp. 29, 30). With this question in mind, Kushner turns to the Book of Job where he will find support for his views. In his discussion ofJob, Kushner observes that "After three cycles of dialogue in which we alternately witness Job voicing his complaints and the friends defending God, the book comes to its thunderous climax." "In a long and eloquent statement that takes up chapters 29 and 30 of the Biblical book, Job swears to his innocence." "He challenges God to appear with evidence." "Then comes a terrible windstorm ... Job's case is so compelling, his challenge so forceful, that God Himself comes down to earth to answer him" (pp. 35, 36). In order to understand God's response to Job (chaps. 38 and 39), and the book in general, Kushner presents three statements that "every- one in the book, and most of the readers, would like to believe: (A) "God is all powerful and causes everything that happens in the world. (B) God is just and fair, and stands for people getting what they deserve, so that the good prosper and the wicked are punished. (C) Job is a good person" (p. 37). As long as all is well with Job, we can believe all three statements. When his problems begin, Job's friends reject (C) while Job rejects (B). As Kushner explains: "Job sees God as being above notions</page><page sequence="3">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 231 of fairness, being so powerful that no moral rules apply to Him." "There is a God but He is free of the limitations of justice and righteousness" (p. 41). What is the view of the author of Job, as put in God's mouth in the speech from the whirlwind? Kushner maintains that the author's views are contained in what he sees as the most important lines in the Book of Job (40:9-14). God asks Job: "Have you an arm like God? Can you thun- der with a voice like His? You tread down the wicked where they stand, Bury them in the dust together... Then will I acknowledge that your own right hand, can give you victory." Kushner takes these lines to mean: "... if you think that it is so easy to keep the world so straight and true, to keep unfair things from hap- pening to people, you try it. God wants the righteous to live peaceful, happy lives, but sometimes even He can't bring that about. It is too diffi- cult even for God to keep cruelty and chaos from claiming their inno- cent victims. But could man, without God, do it better?" Viewing the Leviathan in chapter 41 to be a symbol of "chaos and evil," Kushner notes that "the author may be saying there too that even God has a hard time keeping chaos in check and limiting the damage that evil can do" (p. 43). In other words, according to Kushner, the author ofJob "believes in God's goodness and in Job's goodness, and is prepared to give up his be- lief in proposition (A) that God is all-powerful. Bad things do happen to good people in this world, but it is not God who wills it" (p. 42). While adopting this position involves the loss of belief in an all-wise and all- powerful God who guarantees fair treatment and happy endings (p. 44), it has several benefits. First, man concludes that God is not doing this to him, and he can maintain his sense of goodness and self-respect. Though God is no longer viewed as a God of Power, He remains a God ofJustice, and so is on our side. Man can be angry at what has happened to him, without being angry at God who is not the cause of his suffering. He can recognize "anger at life's unfairness, our instinctive compassion at seeing people suffer, as coming from God who teaches us to be angry at injustice and to feel compassion for the afflicted. We can feel that our indignation is God's anger at unfairness working through us .. " (p. 45). Kushner's fuller treatment of God's relationship to man and his world will emerge over the coming several chapters of his book, and our assessment of this position will await this broader picture. At this point it is worthwhile examining Kushner's interpretation ofJob. Job is not cru- cial to Kushner, though if he is correct, it is significant that an ancient Biblical author would have voiced a view seemingly in line with his view. Our reason for saying that Job is not crucial to Kushner's case is this: Kushner stands independent of biblical theology. This is a fact evident</page><page sequence="4">232 Abraham Cohen from all of Kushner's writings. In the previous chapter, e.g., Kushner was quick to demur from several biblical texts which declared the opera- tion of strict justice in the world. In discussing the akkedah of Isaac, a text of unsurpassed significance for grasping the Biblical view of faith in God, Kushner did not hesitate to take exception to "the notion of a God who plays such sadistic games with his most faithful follower .. " (p. 25). And, so, we suggest that had Job presented a position antithetical to that of Kushner, he could have comfortably dismissed it, and proceeded to offer his own position. Given Kushner's discussion of Job, is his interpretation correct? Do the verses in chapter 40 mean what Kushner suggests? There is, in fact, no consensus among scholars, ancient and modern, about the meaning of the speech from the whirlwind. Indeed, some scholars, with apparent frustration, feel that the theophany is not intended to respond to Job's specific dilemmas. Its purpose is to make a declaration about God's majesty, power, and transcendence, against which Job's perception of the wrongs done him, pales.' What has been observed by scholars is that the theophany breaks down into two separate declarations from God. The first of these runs from chapter 38, verse 1 and is clearly the primary declaration of God. Here God is described in all His creative power. The second declaration runs from chapter 40, verse 6. The question has been raised as to what this "weaker" declaration adds to the first, leading some scholars to maintain, though it would appear with little substantive basis, that the second statement is a later interpolation into the text which adds little to its overall message.2 The verses cited by Kushner are part of God's second declaration. While these verses are not beset by the broad linguistic difficulties that we encounter in the Book of Job, their meaning remains unclear. Kush- ner understood the verses to mean that God challenges Job by asking him to eradicate all evil, if that were possible. But could God really be saying what Kushner would have us believe, i.e., that He cannot "keep cruelty and chaos from claiming their innocent victims," that in effect He is a God of justice but not a God of power? Such a message flies in the face of the extensive and forceful first declaration of the theophany which celebrates God's creativity and power, and is contradicted by so much of the Book of Job, also celebrating God's transcendence and power, and, by the book's opening position. The God who sends Satan to testJob, and then strips Job of his possessions, is not the removed and powerless Deity Kushner would have us believe emerges in chapter 40. It goes without saying that the view Kushner ascribes to the author of Job, based on the above cited verses, violates the notion of God encountered throughout the Bible. Kushner tries to strengthen his case by suggesting that the Le-</page><page sequence="5">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 233 viathan in chapter 41 represents a "symbol of chaos and evil" which God cannot fully control and limit. In contrast, M. Pope in his Anchor Bible commentary understands the Leviathan account to mean that just as God has vanquished this primordial force of evil, he can vanquish all forces. God's power over the forces of evil, not his lack of it, is the import of the Leviathan account.3 If Kushner were correct in his view that Job suggests that God is a God ofjustice, but not of power, something that requires taking the sev- eral verses he has cited out of the context of the entire book, how could Job declare the following, subsequent to the theophany: "Job said in reply to the Lord. I know that you can do everything, that no plan is impossi- blefor you" (42:1, 2). Kushner's reading ofJob, we must conclude, stands unsubstantiated, and invalid. At the theological level, we would ask Kushner, why he-not the au- thor of Job -would give up the belief that God is all-powerful, and not the belief that God is all-good, with its subsidiary notions of God experi- encing anguish, suffering... ? Classic monotheistic theology has not been able to make this cleavage. Clearly, Kushner is motivated by what he needs to believe. In his own words: "I would like to think that He is the source of my being able to feel sympathy and outrage, and that He and I are on the same side when we stand with the victim against those who would hurt him" (p. 85). CREATION, NATURAL lAW, AND RANDOMNESS Having introduced his notion that God does not fully control events in the world, Kushner proceeds in several chapters to expand on this idea. In chapter 3, entitled, "Sometimes There is No Reason," Kushner intro- duces the idea of randomness in the universe. He illustrates a number of events which most people would view as random. Kushner then un- dertakes to offer biblical underpinning for his view. He turns to the Cre- ation story, where the first two verses read: "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. And the earth was formless and chaotic with darkness covering the deep. . . " Creation, Kushner says, means "not to make something out of nothing, but to make order out of chaos." God begins to impose "order where there had been random- ness" (p. 51). Kushner emphasizes that God "fashion(ed) a world whose overrid- ing principle was orderliness, predictability.. ." But, perhaps, Kushner suggests, the process of Creation, of making order out of chaos, has not ended. Though the world is "mostly an orderly, predictable place," "pockets of chaos remain" "in those corners of the universe where God's creative light has not yet penetrated'." "Randomness is another name for</page><page sequence="6">234 Abraham Cohen chaos... and chaos is evil... because by causing tragedies at random, it prevents people from believing in God's goodness" (p. 53). Kushner concludes chapter 3 with two alternate suggestions. On the one hand, "Our system may not be a system left to itself. There may in fact be a creative impulse acting on it, the Spirit of God hovering over the dark waters, operating over the millennia to bring order out of chaos." In this scenario, evolution moves "toward the Great Sabbath which is the End of days, (when) the impact of random evil will be di- minished." In the alternate possibility, which Kushner appears to favor strongly, "it may be that God finished His work of creating eons ago, and left the rest to us. Residual chaos, chance and mischance, things happening for no reason will continue to be with us .. ." (p. 55). Those things that hap- pen in the realm of chaos/chance do not represent the will of God, but represent that aspect of reality which stands independent of His will, and which angers and saddens God even as it angers and saddens us" (p. 55). In chapter 4, entitled "No Exceptions For Nice People," Kushner discusses a second source of bad happenings, in addition to the effects of chaos/chance. This source is the "laws of nature," which are undis- criminating, "morally blind, without values" (p. 59). On the one hand, these laws are good: ". ..we find proof of God precisely in the fact that laws of nature do not change. God has given us a wonderful, precise, or- derly world. One of the things that makes the world liveable is the fact that the laws of nature are precise and reliable .. ." (p. 57). However, vi- olation of these laws, and their very operation, e.g., in hurricanes and in illness, can create problems and bring tragedy. Up to this point, Kushner has presented us with clear naturalistic grounds for evil, involving the effects of chaos/chance and the laws of nature. Puzzlingly, Kushner now raises anew the question of why there is evil and suffering in the world. He asks repeatedly: "Why did God create a world in which there is sickness and disease? I don't know why people get sick, sometimes fatally" (p. 64). "I don't have a good answer to the question of why our bodies had to be made vulnerable to germs and viruses and malignant tumors in the first place" (p. 64). "But why can- cer? Why blindness and diabetes ... I have no satisfying answer to these questions" (p. 66). After repeatedly saying that he has no answer to these questions, even though he has already offered clear naturalistic answers for them, Kushner ventures a new set of naturalistic responses. "The best answer I know is the reminder that man today is only the latest stage in a long evolutionary process... we retained and inherited some of the weak- nesses of those earlier forms. Like plants, our bodies remain vulnerable to injury and decay" (p. 66). Kushner argues for the necessity for pain,</page><page sequence="7">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 235 noting that "pain is the price we pay for being alive" (p. 64). He dis- cusses the dual character of the laws of nature, e.g., for a bone to be light enough for us to walk, it must be fragile enough to break. He dis- cusses abuse and neglect of health as leading to problems and to suffer- ing. Finally, Kushner briefly discusses the necessity for death, without which the world would be impossibly crowded, and humanity "would be deprived of that sense of a fresh start" (p. 70). At this point, Kushner expands on his view of God's place in the world. He describes God as the author of natural law: "God has given us a wonderful, precise, orderly world." He has set into motion a world in which morally neutral laws of nature operate. But whereas "nature is morally blind," "God is not morally blind. I could not worship Him if I thought He was. God stands for justice, for fairness, for compassion" (p. 60). "The act of God is the courage of people to rebuild their lives .. " (p. 60). "... God... I believe .., .gives strength and courage to those who, unfairly and through no fault of their own, suffer pain and the fear of death." As Kushner noted at the end of the previous chapter, when things go wrong for man, this "angers and saddens God even as it angers and saddens us." God, as described by Kushner, stands with man, and in some manner, He inspires man towards attitudes that allow him to deal with his difficulties. In chapter 5, entitled "God Leaves Us Room To Be Human," Kush- ner discusses man's freedom to choose good or bad as the distinctive quality that differentiates between him and animal, and says that this be- lief is "a cornerstone of my religious outlook .. ." (p. 83). Animals act in- stinctively, and need make no moral choices. Man, however, is created in the "image of God," by which is meant his ability to "say No to instinct on moral grounds" (p. 75). "The whole story of being human is the story of rising above our animal nature, and learning to control our instincts." The freedom God has given man is absolute, and allows for the evil perpetrated by man, says Kushner. God does not intervene to prevent man from doing evil. To do so would be to remove from man that which makes him human. Kushner says that "this line of reasoning helps" him understand "that monstrous eruption of evil we speak of as the Holo- caust.. ." (p. 81). Was God totally absent during the Holocaust? Kush- ner states: "I have to believe that He was with the victims, not the murderers, but that He does not control man's choosing between good and evil. I have to believe that the tears and prayers of the victims aroused God's compassion, but having given man freedom to choose, in- cluding the freedom to hurt his neighbor, there was nothing God could do to prevent it" (p. 84). Kushner finds historical precedent for the idea of God in anguish, both in Christianity, which introduced the idea of a suffering God, and in postbiblical Judaism, which occasionally spoke of a God Who suffers</page><page sequence="8">236 Abraham Cohen and Who goes into exile with His people. Kushner remarks: "But I would like to think that the anguish I feel when I read of the suffering of innocent people, reflects God's anguish and God's compassion, even if His way of feeling pain is different from ours. I would like to think that He is the source of my being able to feel sympathy and outrage, and that He and I are on the same side when we stand with the victim against those who would hurt him" (p. 85). Chapters 3 through 6 of Kushner's book, which we have briefly syn- opsized, present a unified picture. God has created a world with laws of nature, though, with pockets of chaos (randomness). Man is subject to the laws of nature, which are neutral, and to random/chaotic happen- ings. Man is distinct in the world in his freedom of choice to act morally, or otherwise, allowing for his perpetrating evil. In chapter 3 Kushner tells us that the notion of randomness is "perhaps the philosophical idea which is the key to everything else I am suggesting in this book" (p. 46). As he seeks biblical support for this notion in the Book of Job, Kushner attempts to adduce similar support in the critical initial Cre- ation account. Let us look at Kushner's reading of Genesis. The two opening verses read: "And God created ('brh') the heavens and the earth. And the earth was formless and chaotic, with darkness upon the deep, and the Spirit of God hovered upon the waters." Kushner suggests that the term brh does not mean to create out of nothing, but rather to fashion and bring order to that which already existed. This interpretation allows for the possibility of pockets of "chaos" remaining in the world at large. Is this reading of Genesis valid? It is not. As to "pockets of chaos" re- maining in the world, this is a misstatement of the simple Biblical text which has always been understood to maintain that Creation was per- fect, without residues of chaos being left over. This is apparent in the re- peated use of the phrase stating that God looked at what He had done and saw that "it was good," and finally, that "God saw all that He had done, that it was very good" (Genesis, chap. 1). The linguistic basis of Kushner's argument regarding Genesis is equally invalid. Kushner states that the term brh in the first verse of the Bible does not denote creating something out of nothing, but rather de- notes fashioning and bringing order to that which already existed. This statement is arbitrary, unfounded, and in disregard of the approxi- mately fifty uses of the term brh in the Bible. In almost all of these in- stances one immediately intuits the sense of something being brought into being that was not there before. In perhaps not a single instance is there any indication of a prior existing substance which is then fash- ioned in some way. In the many instances where the word brh is used in regard to God and to broad patterns of the universe (e.g., creation of the "heavens'," in Isaiah), there is no question as to the biblical intent.</page><page sequence="9">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 237 The term brh in the Bible, in the sense of bringing into being that which was not there before, as its instructive parallel in English, the word "create," accommodates all uses of the word in the Bible, and bibli- cal theology. This theological position is no more clear, nor necessary, than in the first verse of the Bible.4 Moreover, Kushner's misreading of Genesis violates biblical theology. It posits a pre-existent, chaotic state of reality independent of God, which is the philosophical basis for all idolatrous systems, according to Prof. E. Kaufman of the Hebrew Uni- versity, in his major writings on the Bible.5 Kushner should have known this from his student days at the Jewish Theological Seminary, where Kaufman's teachings on Bible were prominently emphasized. Finally, even a layman reading in the vernacular should be able to find the obvious fault in Kushner's suggestion regarding the first two verses of Genesis. If his interpretation were correct, the verse order would have to be inverted, and read: In the beginning the earth was formless and chaotic with darkness covering everything. And God 'brh,' fashioned and brought order.... For the second time, we find Kush- ner's attempt to define Biblical underpinnings for his basic philosophi- cal position to be unsubstantiated and untrue. Returning to Kushner's argument, he raises two possibilities regard- ing the residual chaos in the world. (1) That a creative impulse, the Spirit of God, acts to diminish, and eventually overcome chaos to the point where the "Great Sabbath ... the End of Days," will eventuate. (2) The possibility that God finished "His work of creating" and "has left the rest to us." This leaves "residual chaos, chance, mischance, things happening for no reason... ." The misfortune wrought by this aspect of reality does not represent ". .. the will of God, but represent(s) that as- pect of reality which stands independent of his will, and which angers and saddens God even as it angers and saddens us" (p. 55). Aside from the internal contradiction in his argument (on the one hand, God has "left" part of creation untouched, which, on the other hand, "is independent of his will"), Kushner's statement opens a theo- logical Pandora's box. What does he mean when he speaks of "that as- pect of reality which stands independent of His will?" What is God's relationship to that aspect of reality? Does God stand above this realm as its Creator, while choosing to limit or curtail His specific activity towards it? In such case, one cannot speak of God being unable to act, but rather of having chosen not to act, through self-limitation. Or, does Kushner have in mind that there is a realm of reality inherently inde- pendent in its very existence of God, upon which He may have no ef- fect? The two positions raised here, and the theological issues that sur- round them, are fundamental religious perspectives which were fully perceived by the ancients, and around which almost all religious systems</page><page sequence="10">238 Abraham Cohen coalesced. To the extent that these questions are raised in regard to Kushner's thinking, we need to look for clear and consistent answers by him. What we find, in fact, are conflicting images of God in Kushner's work. On the one hand, Kushner speaks of God as an actual Creator and "doer" of some kind. He tells us that "God has given us a wonderful, pre- cise, orderly world" in making the laws of nature (p. 57). He speaks of God "fashioning a world" (p. 52). He wonders how God "create(d) a world in which there is sickness .. 7" (p. 64). He expresses uncertainty as to "why, at a certain point in the evolutionary process, He had a new kind of creature emerge, a morally free animal.. "' (p. 80). He says that God has set limits on Himself in not taking away man's freedom of choice, something we assume God had given to man (p. 81). Kushner's explanations for suffering in the chapters, "No Exceptions for Nice Peo- ple" and "God Leaves Us Room To Be Human," assume divine decision. Overall, these statements point in the direction of the classical view of God as full Creator of the Universe. On the other hand, Kushner tells us that there is an aspect of reality independent of God's will. He tells us of laws of nature that are "morally blind" and lead to happenings which God "does not cause ... and can- not stop .. ." (p. 58). Having said that nature is morally blind, he imme- diately tells us that "God is not morally blind," indicating the chasm between God and nature (p. 59). Speaking of misfortune, Kushner says that "Fate, not God sends us the problem" (p. 139). In his discussion of Job, Kushner refers to things that are too hard for God to control (p. 43). In his comments on Genesis, Kushner tells us that God's creativity lies in bringing order to chaos, not in creating ex nihilo. These latter statements sharply support the impression that Kushner posits a realm whose existence and workings are independent of God. As well, using traditional anthropomorphic language, Kushner speaks of a God who "wills," has a moral sense, and, divine "feelings":' The latter qualities abound in Kushner's writing, and stand out particu- larly in remarks about the "suffering" God, who experiences "anguish" when man is wronged, and inspires and supports man to moral behavior and strength in moments of difficulty. These qualities of God appear to apply equally to Kushner's two explanations of the relationship between God and the world. Given the first proposition, where God is Creator and sets limits on Himself, one cannot state simply that (a) nature is morally blind, but God is not; (b) that "there are no exceptions for nice people"; (c) and, that "pockets of chaos" were left over in the universe, without recogniz- ing the serious moral difficulty which these propositions raise. If God is the full Author of Reality, is He not accountable for pockets of chaos/evil? Should there be no exceptions for "nice" (i.e., moral, needy,</page><page sequence="11">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 239 and deserving) people? And, should He have made the laws of nature "morally blind?" Given the second line of reasoning, what moral issues need be ad- dressed? If there is an aspect of Reality which is impervious to God's workings, and whose mechanistic, random/chaotic nature is cause for suffering, there is no "blame," no "One" accountable for what "blind" Nature has wrought. What then are all of Kushner's queries regarding illness and death? Why need he tell us there are no exceptions for nice people, as if God had made this decision? God has nothing to do with nature's blind workings! Man lives in a matrix of physical reality where events take place that have neither meaning nor moral value. In his discussion Kushner emphasizes two elements of his belief in God: (a) that "we find proof of God precisely in the fact that laws of na- ture do not change.. ." (b) that God is all-good. The first of these propositions can only be argued by Kushner if he maintains that God is responsible for the laws of nature. If, however, Kushner believes that Na- ture and its workings are totally independent of God, the laws of nature say nothing to us, nor to Kushner, about God. In addition, the first proposition, as stated by Kushner, is incompat- ible with biblical and historical Judaism, and one assumes, Christianity and Mohammedanism, as well. Judaism has viewed Nature and its laws as a supreme manifestation of an intelligent Creator. But it maintains that God-the-Creator stands above Nature, cannot be absolutely con- strained by its laws, and works in or through Nature for His ends. The second proposition, that God is all-good, as we have seen, is maintained by Kushner even as he abandons the idea of an all-powerful God. If, however, as we have argued before, one is led to abandon the idea of God as all-powerful, because of the reality of evil, why not aban- don the idea of God as all-good, as well? Here, we find Kushner neatly engaging in "I would like to think" ratiocination. The logic of Kushner's argument concerning God's goodness should have led him to a different and less sanguine conclusion. Kush- ner notes that chaos = evil, and remarks that "by causing tragedies at random, it (chaos) prevents people from believing in God's goodness." Not so. Rather, if chaos = evil, and is God's doing (He decided to leave pockets of chaos) it leads people to question and deny God's goodness. If Kushner would follow his assumptions honestly, he would come to this conclusion, and would not find repose in what he "would like to think." What are we to make of the two mutually exclusive images of the God-world relationship, portrayed by Kushner? In Kushner's defense, it might be argued that he speaks in flexible terms that would be accept- able to his varied readers. Our view of the sophistication of Kushner's approach is less generous. Kushner is endeavoring to present a specific</page><page sequence="12">240 Abraham Cohen view, and he cannot operate within two systems whose moral implica- tions are antithetical. To achieve some clarification of our question, we need to ask: when Kushner speaks of the World which God has created, with specific refer- ence to the laws of nature, does he really mean that God formulated and "physically" imposed the laws of nature? Does he not believe that such laws are the ordered and self-evolving workings of the material world it- self? Furthermore, what theological benefits accrue to Kushner's system by suggesting that God is the author of morally blind forces that churn along with no inherent value? How could Kushner state that the laws of nature are "good," on the heels of a statement that they are morally neutral? A close reading of Kushner may bring us near to answering which of the two alternate positions he favors. When Kushner tells us that Na- ture, and its laws, "is morally blind... churns along, following its own laws, not caring who and what gets in its way," it does not seem that he has in mind the handiwork of a God who anguishes over man's suffer- ing. It very much sounds like Nature is fully self-operating and indepen- dent, something we would expect a self-declared modern man like Kushner to believe. And it seems that, in fact, he does believe just this. Beyond the sev- eral key chapters that we have been dealing with, relating to the God- world relationship, there is little that Kushner writes that has bearing on this issue before the end of his book. There, Kushner makes this com- ment concerning God: "I recognize His limitations. He is limited by laws of nature and by the evolution of human nature and human moral free- dom" (p. 134). Several pages earlier, in discussing the source of man's problems, Kushner writes: "Fate, not God, sends us the problem" (p. 129). Kushner's intention in this discussion, as in his reading of Job, seems unmistakable. Nature and its laws are not God's doing. God neither keeps these laws going, nor is He their author. But can God act at all upon the world? It doesn't seem that He can in any physical ways. This is really the best explanation from a Kushner point of view as to why there are no miracles, nor changing of nature in response to prayer. Not the "reasons" given by Kushner, as if God had chosen not to act, but be- cause God cannot change natural law; it is beyond Him. Not because He has limited Himself, but because physical reality and God are not of the same order, and God cannot alter the physical domain. Kushner, I suggest, maintains that Nature represents a realm whose existence is fully independent of God, and upon which God has no di- rect effect. Where, then, is God? Kushner, with anthropomorphic aban- don, speaks broadly of an existent Spiritual Being Who is morally inspiring and supportive. He is a suffering God who shares man's an- guish. These are Kushner's comments towards the end of his book: God</page><page sequence="13">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 241 "gives us strength and patience and hope, renewing our spiritual re- sources when they run dry. How else do sick people manage to find more strength and more humor over the course of prolonged illness ... unless God was constantly replenishing their souls? How else do widows find courage ... How else do the parents of a retarded or brain-injured youngster wake up every morning and turn again to their responsibili- ties unless they are able to lean on God when they grow up?" "We only need to turn to Him, admit that we can't do this on our own. .... One of the things that constantly reassures me that God is real, and not just an idea that religious leaders made up, is the fact that people who pray for strength, hope and courage so often find resources of strength, hope and courage that they did not have before they prayed" (pp. 127-128). God, it seems, is a supreme, spiritual, personal, and mysterious Being of reality at large, to whom man, living in the matrix of an inde- pendent natural domain, must turn to find hope, direction, and self- realization. Just how these benefits accrue to man is not explained by Kushner. In a similar model, Christianity speaks of God's Spirit entering man. The Christian view is clearer than Kushner's. It moves from a Ju- daic theistic basis in which God is Supreme over Nature and is its Au- thor. God acts in the world, and so, when it is suggested that He enters the spirit of man, it is meant in a real sense. We look in vain in Kushner's writing for the realness of his pronouncements regarding God's influ- ence on man. If God is a spiritual Being with no effect on the material world, why has Kushner spoken of Him as Creator, as a shaper of Nature's laws? Why has he suggested in one proposed view that God is all-powerful, while leaving over pockets of chaos in the created order? The answer would appear to lie in literary freedoms that Kushner should not have allowed himself. Obviously, we feel better when hearing that God is the Creator, the One Who established nature's laws. We relate better to Him when we hear this because this is what we have been taught about God. But this is not Kushner's God, and he should not have borrowed this God, to make his own more acceptable. There is a striking example that illustrates the literary license which Kushner allows himself. Kushner opens his work by stating that he be- lieves in God and in the goodness of the world. Obviously, now, we would have him correct this to say that he believes in God and the neu- trality of the world. At the end of his book Kushner continues to insist on the goodness of the world, striving to dispel the opposite view. "If the death of an elderly woman in Auschwitz or a child in a hospital ward leaves us doubting God and less able to affirm the world's goodness, then that woman and that child become the "devil's martyrs.. ." (p. 137). Pages later, Kushner asks that we remain strong and hopeful in the face of difficulties: "Are you capable of forgiving and accepting in love a</page><page sequence="14">242 Abraham Cohen world which has disappointed you by not being perfect, a world in which there is so much unfairness and cruelty, disease and crime, earthquake and acci- dent?" (p. 147). What became of the world's goodness, which Kushner has defended in the very face of Auschwitz itself? Clearly, writing in dif- ferent contexts, though only ten pages apart, Kushner freely pens two strikingly contradictory views of the nature of the world that cannot co- exist in the same system of thought. Our understanding of Kushner's view of God and the world, for the moment, is this. The world is not of God's making, nor are its blind laws His doing. God, however, does exist, as a supreme spiritual Being/Real- ity, from whom man draws the strength and purpose he lacks as an indi- vidual. Such strength may come to man simply from the recognition of what God stands for, which is freedom to choose good in the face of bad, and to maintain a sense of the goodness of the world. Because the world is not under God's sway, all that He can offer, or represent for man, is the faith to persevere, and attempt to overcome difficulty when it confronts him; to act morally, and to be resigned that when he does not defeat evil, it need not be seen as a failure in him. All of Kushner's talk of the creative God lends an aura to what God represents to man, but ultimately, for Kushner, has no basis in fact. The use of such termi- nology, it now seems to us, more than involving simply literary freedom, is misleading in the extreme. It makes statements about God that are false from Kushner's point of view. It is clear that Kushner's discussion up to this point does not satisfy the theist's quest for an answer to evil. In fact, while the theist has a moral problem with evil, Kusher should have none. For him, much of the world's evil is an inherent component of a neutral world which is in- dependent of God. Theists, for their part, have not denied the opera- tion of laws of nature, nor the place of pain and misfortune in life. Their question is this: If God is supremely just, how can "righteous" people suffer and perish "randomly," without countervailing redemption. Un- just suffering and death in the absence of redemption, represent triumphant and absolute evil. For the theist, if God wants the world to operate as viewed by Kushner, then He is notjust, and, would, for man, not be God. Either God would have to guarantee the ultimate redemption of the righteous man, as Abraham understood (Genesis, chap. 18), or He would have had to make a different world in which suffering would not take place. In his attempt to explain the possibility of the Holocaust from a the- istic point of view, which is a position he assumed disingenuously, Kush- ner fails disturbingly. Kushner argues that God has given man absolute freedom of will, and with such freedom, evil, the Holocaust included, becomes possible. Freedom of will, we know, is not an innovation of Kushner's system; it is a historical cornerstone of the Jewish religion. But, if God has given this potentially malevolent force into man's hands,</page><page sequence="15">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 243 can He just walk away from responsibility for its effects, ones He surely would have envisaged from the outset? To state that God has given man absolute freedom of will is only to beg the age-old question of God's role in the problem of evil. It is not the answer to the problem of God's relationship to evil. Kushner's claim that God gave man freedom is itself troubling, since Kushner very likely believes that man's freedom is something he has come by naturally. When Kushner introduces the notion of the "suf- fering" God Who becomes a co-victim of evil, it seems that he would have us quickly forget that his would-be Creator has empowered man to do evil. Can a God who facilitates evil claim to be its innocent victim? Having told us that we err in blaming God for bad happenings which He cannot deter, Kushner turns to the self-defeating reactions of individuals to their experience of misfortune and suffering. In a chapter entitled "God Helps Those Who Stop Hurting Themselves," Kushner deals with the feelings of guilt, anger, and jealousy that often follow on the heels of misfortune. As Kushner puts it: "One of the worst things that happens to a person who has been hurt by life is that he tends to compound the damage by hurting himself a second time" (p. 87). In discussing guilt, Kushner suggests that the two elements that lead to this feeling are (a) "our strenuous need to believe that the world makes sense, that there is a cause for every effect and a reason for every- thing that happens"; and (b) the belief that "we are the cause of what happens, especially the bad things that happen." Recognizing that "our egos are so vulnerable" (p. 97), Kushner suggests that it is "unworthy of religion to manipulate" people into feeling that they are "bad" when things have gone wrong for them. Feelings of anger arise when people feel that a misfortune might have been prevented, and consider other individuals to be responsible for their problems, directly, or otherwise (p. 103). Jealousy is aroused when the injured person feels wronged, since others who are not better than him/her, have not experienced similar difficulties (p. 109). Kushner's discussion of man's reaction to misfortune is edifying and psychologically well-informed, and presents a challenge to those views that hold man accountable for all events that happen to him. It is this discussion, perhaps more than any other in the book, which is responsi- ble for the popularity and merit of Kushner's work, since it speaks di- rectly to its readers' psychological needs and entanglements. Kushner's general position is to have the individual view bad events as "neutral" happenings which he must address and courageously attempt to deal with, while ridding oneself of self-harming feelings of guilt, anger, and jealousy. Our concern with Kushner's thinking can be surmised from our earlier discussion of his views. Where is God in the picture? Though God takes little space in this discussion, Kushner argues that anger at</page><page sequence="16">244 Abraham Cohen God for bad events is misdirected. God is not their cause, and anger at Him "erects a barrier between us and all the sustaining, comforting re- sources that are there to help us.. ." (p. 109). Kushner would have the person see the bad event as neutral and turn to God for His support in overcoming or coping with the difficulty. God's place, and that of religion in our lives, are the focus of greater attention in the two final chapters of Kushner's work entitled, respec- tively, "God Can't Do Everything, But He Can Do Some Important Things," and "What Good, Then, Is Religion?" The first part of "God Can't Do Everything.. ." is devoted to the multi-purpose nature of prayer. Prayer "puts us in touch with other people, people who share the same concerns, values, dreams and pains that we do" (p. 119). Con- sequently, it "redeems people from isolation. It assures them that they need not feel alone and abandoned. It lets them know that they are part of a greater reality, with more depth, more hope, more courage, and more of a future than any individual could have by himself" (p. 121). Prayer also puts us in touch with God, but not as people understand this, in terms of His fulfilling our requests (p. 122). Rather, with the re- alization that "God is at the side of the afflicted and the downcast" (p. 125), "people pray for courage, for strength to bear the unbearable ... Their prayers help(ed) them tap hidden reserves of faith and courage.. ." (p. 125). God "does not send us the problem; He gives us the strength to cope with the problem" (p. 127). How does God give us the strength we lack? We read of God Who is "constantly replenishing [the] souls," of people who are sick. We are told that when we reach our own limits "We find reinforcement coming from a source outside of ourselves" (pp. 128-129). These statements, to- gether with Kushner's remark that he is sure God is real because people discover resources they did not have before, suggest an almost tangible influence that God brings to bear on man. To illustrate the benefits of prayer, Kushner tells of a young widow whose husband died of cancer. Though many people prayed for her husband's recovery, the illness went unchecked, and he died. Kushner spoke to the young woman and told her that her prayers did not go un- heard and, subsequently, she "found the resilience to go on living." Kushner remarked to her: "You didn't get a miracle to avert a tragedy. But you discovered people around you, and God beside you, and strength within you to survive the tragedy. I offer that as an example of prayer being answered" (p. 131). In this discussion on prayer, Kushner reminds us of some of its facets that we are apt to forget, if indeed, we recognize them at all. When we pray with others, "togetherness" is a benefit we reap from the experience. When we pray, we ask that God be with us and help us find</page><page sequence="17">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 245 resources in ourselves to overcome our difficulties. At such times, we may indeed "find reinforcement coming from a source outside of our- selves," to use Kushner's language. But what if, we ask Kushner, "rein- forcement coming from a source outside ourselves" is an encouraging thought, but is substantively untrue, as his theology suggests? Confident that he has presented the various elements of his case on the question of why bad things happen to good people, both theologi- cally and psychologically, Kushner offers a summary statement in his final chapter, entitled "What Good, Then, Is Religion?" Kushner begins by reminding us that he believes in God, but one Who is limited "by laws of nature and by the evolution of human nature and human moral freedom." Given God's limitations, tragedies happen that are not His doing. At this point Kushner introduces a new and far-reaching element in his discussion of evil, in which he implicitly acknowledges that, hereto- fore, he has failed to solve the problem. Kushner asks: "Does that mean that my suffering has no meaning?" (p. 134). "That is the most significant challenge that can be offered to the point of view I have been advocating in this book. We could bear nearly any pain or disappointment if we thought there was a reason behind it, a purpose to it" (p. 135). THE PURPOSE OF SUFFERING To this critical question, Kushner suggests that when bad things happen to people they do not have "meaning":' "But we can give them a mean- ing. We can redeem these tragedies from senselessness by imposing meaning on them" (p. 136). We can accomplish this by asking, not "why did this happen to me," but rather, "Now that this has happened to me, what am I going to do about it" (p. 136). Kushner quotes the German theologian Dorothy Soelle, who in her book Suffering says that the most important question we can ask about suffering is whom it serves. "Does our suffering serve God or the devil, the cause of being alive or morally paralyzed." Not "where does the tragedy come from," but "where does it lead?" (p. 137). In a quote cited above, "if the death of an elderly woman in Auschwitz or of a child in a hospital ward leaves us doubting God and less able to affirm the world's goodness, then that woman and that child become the "devil's martyrs, witnesses against God. .. ." In Kushner's words: "The facts of life and death are neutral. We, by our responses, give suffering either a positive or a negative meaning." "If suf- fering and death in someone close to us bring us to explore the limits of our capacity for strength and love and cheerfulness, if it leads us to dis- cover sources of consolation we never knew before, then we make the</page><page sequence="18">246 Abraham Cohen person into a witness for the affirmation of life rather than its rejection." If we make the deceased loved ones witnesses for God, we act on behalf of their "redemption and their immortality"' (p. 138). Kushner now returns to the question of God's relevance for us, given that He does not cause bad events and cannot prevent them. He answers, first, that "God has created a world in which many more good things than bad things happen" (p. 138). Furthermore, "When we are stunned by some tragedy we can only see and feel the tragedy. Only with time and distance can we see the tragedy in the context of a whole life and a whole world." In the Jewish tradition, the special prayer known as the Mourners' Kaddish is not about death, but about life, and it praises God for having created a basically good and liveable world" (p. 139). Moreover, God "inspires people to help other people... makes some people to want to become doctors and nurses.. . medical researchers" (p. 139). He "gives us the strength and perseverance to overcome diffi- culty.., .stand(s) for self-discipline and being part of a family, etc.. . (p. 141). The facts are these, says Kushner: "Life is not fair. The wrong people get sick and the wrong people get robbed and the wrong people get killed in wars and in accidents. Some people see life's unfairness and de- cide, "There is no God; the world is nothing but chaos" (p. 142). Others see the same unfairness and ask themselves, "Where did I get my sense of what is fair and what is unfair.., .my sense of outrage and indigna- tion, my instinctive response of sympathy ... Don't I get these things from God?' (p. 142). Quoting Archibald MacLeish, the author of the playJ.B., "We do not love God because He is perfect, . . because He protects us from all harm and keeps evil things from happening to us. We love Him because He is God, because He is the author of all the beauty and the order around us, the source of our strength and the hope and courage within us. We love Him because He is the best part of ourselves and of our world. This is what it means to love. Love is not the admiration of perfection, but the acceptance of an imperfect person with all his im- perfections, because loving and accepting him makes us better and stronger" (p. 146). Is there an answer to the question of why bad things happen to good people? Kushner asks at the end of his book. If by answer we mean justi- fication of all bad events, the answer is "no." If, instead, by answer we mean response then we can offer an answer, says Kushner. The response is to forgive the world for not being perfect, to forgive God for not making a better world, to reach out to the people... to go on living despite it all. Are you capable of forgiving and accepting in love a world which has disap- pointed you by not being perfect, a world in which there is so much un- fairness and cruelty, disease and crime, earthquake and accident" "Are you capable of forgiving and even loving God even when you have</page><page sequence="19">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 247 found out that He is not perfect, even when He has let you down and disappointed you by permitting bad luck and sickness and cruelty in His world, and permitting some of those things to happen to you?" "And if you can do these things, will you be able to recognize that the ability to forgive and the ability to love are the weapons God has given us to en- able us to live fully, bravely, and meaningfully in this less than perfect world?" (pp. 147-148). What are we to make of Kushner's final statement on the problem of evil? There is much that is wholesome in his case, incorporating as it does, by modern standards, almost unassailable, affirmative notions. Why dwell on the past if one can look to the future? Why look for the "whys" of wrongs that have happened, rather than focusing on what one can do, with hope and affirmation, in the future? Why look at a tragedy in its narrow and immediate time framework, when one can look at it in the framework of "a whole life and a whole world?" Why be a witness for the devil, if one can be a witness for God and for life? Why look at God as the source of evil, when He represents and inspires moral strength in response to evil, and affirmation of life? Presented as such, Kushner's case appears strong and convincing. What better prescription for the individual looking for a weltanschauung in the face of life's travails? In the light of such a positive position, and well aware of the aching needs of individuals for an acceptable religious perspective in times of trouble, our purpose is not to engage in polemics in an effort to best Kushner on this very critical life-issue. The issue is, indeed, so important, that Kushner's views cannot go unexam- ined. After all, Kushner himself tells us that "the most significant chal- lenge that can be offered to the position" he presents in the book, concerns the question of whether suffering has meaning, and he sets out to make a case for just such meaning. Kushner's final statement on the problem of evil appears to be founded entirely on the views of German theologian Dorothy Soelle and playwright Archibald MacLeish. Soelle maintains that we need to ask not where tragedy comes from, but where it leads. Through our actions, we determine whether the tragedy serves God or the devil. Inherent in Soelle's position is the neutrality of happenings. This leads Kushner to remark, similarly, that "the facts of life and death are neutral," and have no meaning at the time of occurrence, but can be given positive mean- ing through our redemptive actions. Archibald MacLeish argues for loving and accepting an imperfect God since love is "acceptance of an imperfect person with all his imper- fections .. ." In the case of God, we love Him because He is the author of all of the beauty and order around us, and the source of our strength, hope and courage." We have encountered this idea, in similar words, in Kushner. When Kushner states that "The response is to forgive the</page><page sequence="20">248 Abraham Cohen world for not being perfect, to forgive God for not making a better world," to forgive and to love, he simply rephrases MacLeish's position. In retrospect, it seems that the views of Soelle and MacLeish inform the basic premises of Kushner's entire work, not merely his final statement on the problem of evil. In assessing Kushner's views, we find ourselves drawn back to the classical explanations for evil which he had outlined and rejected at the outset of the book. Explanations two and three claimed, respectively, that (a) evil is part of a divine design that man cannot fully fathom, and (b) suffering is educational, cures men of their faults, and makes them better people. As we examine Kushner's final statement on the problem of evil we find that he has fully adopted these very positions which he had rejected at the outset of his book. As for the first of these positions, Kushner now tells us that "Only with time and distance can we see the tragedy in the context of a whole life and a whole world." As a matter of fact, we know that no such deter- mination is possible in most, if not all, cases of tragedy. As for the sec- ond position, which sees evil as educational, curing people of their faults, and making them better people, Kushner now broadly paints this very picture. We find this in Kushner's (Soelle-MacLeish's) full position regarding man's response as the answer to the question of evil. To quote Kushner: "If suffering and death in someone close to us brings us to ex- plore the limits of our capacity for strength and love and cheerfulness, if it leads us to discover sources of consolation we never knew before, then we make the person into a witness for the affirmation of life rather than its rejection." We then act on behalf of their "redemption and their im- mortality" (p. 138). The highest educational-curative, and ennobling di- mension of our response to evil is apparently achieved when we forgive, accept and love God and His world, in spite of their imperfections, and the cruelty, disease, unfairness, and tragedy that beset man. Reflecting further on the classic explanations for evil cited by Kush- ner at the beginning of his book, we find him to be as dogmatic about God's goodness, in spite of the evidence he cites to the contrary, as is the traditionalist who insists that God is a righteous Judge (explanation 1). Ironically, however, we observed an erosion of God's goodness, in Kushner's view. God, we learn, has permitted evil to occur in His world, and is therefore a facilitator of evil who needs our forgiveness. In closely examining Kushner's final statements, one finds affirma- tion of almost all of the classical explanations for evil which he felt com- pelled to reject at the outset of the book, linked as they were to traditional theistic notions of God. Kushner, we find, now maintains that there is (a) a larger context which lends meaning to tragedies, though we do not see it fully; (b) tragedies are educational, and en-</page><page sequence="21">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 249 hance our moral vision; and (c) God is unquestionably moral, even though He has "permitted" tragedy to befall man. Now, having offered us a seemingly traditional framework in which to address evil, Kushner proposes that we "redeem these tragedies from senselessness by imposing meaning on them?" What are we to make of this position? Our question must be answered at the theological level, and in application to actual tragedy. By way of illustration, we will speak of the tragedies of a child dying of cancer, and of the Holocaust. In the case of the child, we would ask Kushner to explain how any of his categories can "impose" meaning on the event. A child has suffered and perished. In the case of the Holocaust, we recall that Kushner ven- tured to explain it in terms of man's absolute freedom to act for good or bad. In fact, Kushner's answer was nothing but a central ingredient of the classic religious question concerning evil. Now, we would ask Kush- ner to explain how we impose meaning on the Holocaust. What "affir- mation of life" can we derive from it? Did we need it to happen in order to know, in the middle of the 20th century, that men should not do such things to others and to know the level of evil to which man can descend? What re-dedication of human purpose and goodwill can "redeem" and give immortality to those who were starved to death, who were de- graded, suffered horrible torture, suffocated in cattle cars, died in hor- rific medical experiments, died in excruciating pain in gas chambers, and whose flesh went up in smoke? Who would not "doubt" Kushner's God and be "less able to affirm the world's goodness" in light of the Holocaust? Can Kushner himself look at the Holocaust and remain no "less able to affirm the world's goodness"?! Recall that Kushner has told us that he gave up the historical Jewish notion of God all because of the suffering of his son. Was he the first person in all these millennia to suffer such a per- sonal loss? Now, after six million people perished, each with no less suffering and degradation than his son, he argues that we should not doubt his God, nor be less able to affirm the world's goodness! Following Soelle, Kushner would have us respond to tragedy in ways that serve God and not the devil. Let us ask: when undeserved suffering and death occur, whom does it serve? If it comes from the realm of chaos/evil, and if the devil, figuratively, is the patron of that realm, then suffering and death, in fact, serve the devil! Though we try to neutralize and explain away evil, as Kushner would have us do, the reality is there: the Holocaust victims are gone and the child has perished. Those who are close to the child have seen evil cruelly destroy life and are told to deny it. Who is right? Those who look at life's "unfairness" and say there is "nothing but chaos," who look at the Holocaust and deny the "world's goodness," or Kushner? In response to this question, Kushner has argued for "redeeming"</page><page sequence="22">250 Abraham Cohen bad events through our subsequent actions. Obviously, in line with the "educational" explanation for evil which is now so important to Kush- ner, there are instances where we are strengthened by our experience with tragedy. Such behavior, we have noted earlier, is not an answer to the full problem of evil. No action on our part can give meaning to the suffering and fate of the Holocaust victims, and to the individual who succumbs to cancer. No pretension to affirmation of life can overcome the affirmation of death that such events entail, nor bring "redemption and... immortality" to the victims. Redemption in the Bible means to save the individual or group. Immortality in religion means that which survives, or is above, death. Recall that when the young woman lost her husband to cancer, Kushner told her that her prayers had been answered: ".... You discov- ered people around you, and God beside you, and strength within you to survive the tragedy. I offer that as an example of prayer being an- swered." But the prayers had nothing to do with the woman surviving the tragedy. If she was young and healthy, somewhere down the road healing could take place, and a new partner could be found, with the road to a full life ahead of her. The prayer and the tragedy were about the suffering and extinguishing of the young husband's life. The distor- tion Kushner introduces here is the same as that which permeates his discussion of the redemption of evil through our response. The tragedies of the young husband, of the death of the young child to can- cer, and of the fate of the six million Holocaust victims are not alterable or redeemable by anything we do; we, who do not suffer the evil. What Kushner is actually doing in his discussion of the meaning and response to evil involves a semantic blurring and emotional embell- ishing of the issue. Recall how Kushner formulates his summary state- ment. He raises the question of whether there is an answer to the problem of bad things happening to good people. He then states that if what is intended is an "explanation," the answer is "no." If instead, by an- swer we mean "response," then an answer can be offered, and that re- sponse is "to forgive the world for not being perfect, to forgive God for not making a better world. .. ." Kushner confuses us momentarily, since the terms answer and re- sponse are synonyms. Not entirely, however, and here lies the key to what Kushner is doing. The word "response" can mean either an answer, or a reaction in behavior or thought. Kushner blends the two meanings of the word, giving us the impression that we are getting an answer to our question when we respond or behave in a given way subsequent to the bad event. In fact, however, our reaction and activity in no way answers the question of why bad things happen to people. It merely addresses how we might best act, in our own interest, given that a bad event has happened. Kushner's suggestion, through a play on words, that we can</page><page sequence="23">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 251 resolve the question of evil, "if by answer we mean response," is mislead- ing and untrue. In retrospect, Kushner posits the neutrality of bad events at the time of their occurrence, and the "redeeming" of these events through our subsequent actions. We paid little attention to the suggestion that bad events are neutral at the time of their happening, and that we should subsequently relate to them as such. The formulation appears to be innocent enough, if not reassuring. But it is untenable. We all know of events where tragedy and its human consequences are not neutral at the time of their occurrence and cannot be accepted as such. The Holo- caust was not a neutral event when it happened, nor is it a neutral past event today for any moral individual who studies and relives the day-to- day horrors that made it up. Having slipped this notion of the neutrality of evil past us, Kushner, aided by his mentors Soelle and MacLeish and operating within Mordechai Kaplan's naturalistic system of thought, presents his multi- faceted notion of the response to evil. At the heart of the formulation is an affirmative, rehabilitative notion which argues that we cannot redo the past, but must move ahead with optimism, as best as possible. To this notion, Kushner incorporates the ideas of forgiveness, the absence of resentment, and a cosmic statement of God's goodness and love-the source of our sense of goodness and love-even as God is the ultimate source of the conditions of evil. In flowery terms, and an almost tri- umphant moral tone in his final message in the book, Kushner carries the reader aloft to the finale where we are told that our ultimate self- healing gesture, is love for God, though He has "permitted" evil to be- fall us. In considering the final thoughts in Kushner's book, for the second time we need to ask why he re-opens the central question of his work when he seems already to have fully answered it. We recall that Kushner made his case for residual pockets of chaos in the universe, random- chance events, and impartial laws of nature, over which God has no con- trol. He invoked both Genesis and the Book of Job as support for this view. This overall position, if accepted, clearly explains how catastro- phes can befall man without reference to God. However, after he sets this position out in detail, we find Kushner still troubled by the question of evil, and stating anew: "I don't know why people get sick .. " Kushner then presents a second group of naturalistic reasons for evil, among which are, the fact that man has retained weaknesses present in the chain of evolution, the necessity for pain, the dual character of natural law, and the necessity for death. In this second context, Kushner intro- duces the idea that bad happenings be seen as part of a broad design, and not merely as random events, as he argued initially. As Kushner approaches the end of his book, he obviously remains</page><page sequence="24">252 Abraham Cohen unsatisfied with his previous arguments. Clearly, Kushner recognizes that purely naturalistic grounds for evil are without religious meaning, and call religion itself into question. The age-old question of how bad things can happen to good people is indeed a challenge to basic reli- gious belief and requires a religious response. To rescue both religion and God, Kushner introduces the Soelle-MacLeish view of affirming life and God in the face of evil. On the groundsjust set out, we find that Kushner has failed for the third time to answer the question of evil. Some of his ideas, which are rooted in the views of others, and fall back on traditional beliefs which he had disavowed at the outset of his book, are inspiring and have psy- chological and, perhaps, theological merit. But altogether Kushner fails to resolve the theological conundrum that unredeemed evil raises, and his God still troubles us. At the outset of Kushner's summary chapter, God is the supreme force of Good, counteracting the effects of evil, and inspiring man to moral behavior in the face of cruel realities. God stands opposite the devil, to use the words of Soelle. But as we come to the closing lines of Kushner's work, we are taken aback when we read that God has "permit(ted) bad luck and sickness and cruelty in His world" and permitted them "to happen to you." What we find is that Kushner has left for the end of his work a short and startling piece of personal theologizing. We recall the alternating images of God we encountered in Kushner's earlier discussions of God, and can only wonder why he would muddy this already troubling pic- ture with his final remarks, in which the onus of evil is placed squarely on God Himself. We resist being taken in by the beguiling, absurd, and supremely masochistic "love-and-forgive-all" imagery in Kushner's final statement, where God and the world are to be forgiven for the evil they make possible. The god-image presented at the end of the book is not deserving of unqualified love nor of emulation. And so, we arrive at the end of When Bad Things Happen to Good Peo- ple troubled by ambiguities and inconsistencies in Kushner's view of God. While Kushner's book needs to stand on its own merits, it turns out that an earlier, largely unknown work by Kushner sheds light on the questions raised by the reading of When Bad Things Happen to Good Peo- pie. Fully ten years before the appearance of this book in 1980, Kushner wrote a sophisticated work that set out his views on God and the prob- lem of evil, of which the present work, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, appears to be an offshoot. Our assumption that the earlier book authentically represents Kushner's views is borne out both by the nature of the work itself, and the fact that Kushner was commissioned to write it on behalf of the Reconstructionist movement. This is testimony to Kushner's standing in the movement, which saw him as a spokesman on behalf of its views.</page><page sequence="25">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 253 Kushner's 1970 work is entitled When Children Ask about God.' Writ- ten for parents, the title of the book belies the sophistication of the work, which is a notable text in defining the Reconstructionist view of God. In the introduction to the work, Kushner acknowledges develop- mental psychologists who shaped his approach towards children and their needs. He also acknowledges his indebtedness to Rabbi R. Gittle- sohn "who has taught me much about the areas with which this book is concerned*" Gittlesohn's book, We Have Reason to Hope, predated Kush- ner's by a little less than a decade, and provided him with a rich body of naturalistic Jewish religious thought. The more seminal encounter with such thinking was imbibed by Kushner as a student of Mordechai Kap- lan. Kushner states that Kaplan's "program of Reconstructionism and naturalistic theology have provided me with a framework for under- standing and explaining Judaism since my first days as his student at the Jewish Theological Seminary in 1955." We can make an immediate bridge between Kushner's two books by first turning to chapter 6 of When Children Ask about God. This chapter, entitled "Don't Blame God For 'Acts Of God,"' essentially represents a precis of the book, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, which Kush- ner wrote a decade later. Kushner states: "Things happen for natural reasons" (p. 82) and "God does not inter- vene in this world" (p. 93). There are immutable laws of Nature which God cannot violate; indeed, one of the manifestations of God in the world "resides in the immutability of'" these laws (p. 76). "Residual chaos" and "random- ness" are realities of our world (p. 78). As a result of the laws of Nature and random happenings, of "acts of blind, inflexible Nature," "tragic and undeserved fates befall people" (p. 78). It is a "fact" that "the most de- serving people aren't always rewarded, nor are the immoral ones al- ways punished," "if we measure reward and punishment in terms of health, wealth, comfort and length of days .. " (p. 94). Kushner mocks the "childish" idea of "God-as-Heavenly-Puppeteer Who determines what happens to us .. ." (p. 77), and he rejects the idea that God directly rewards or punishes man. "In the world of God and man there is no punishment; there are only consequences." "Punish- ment always involves another party's disapproval and deliberate in- tervention; consequences flow impersonally from the nature of an act itself." Notwithstanding the immutable laws of Nature, and the tragic ef- fects they can have on man, Kushner affirms the 'fundamental goodness of the world" (p. 80). He recommends that when a child sees a crippled peer or loses a parent, one acknowledge to the child that such events can happen, though they are unusual, and do not represent God's dis- pleasure with the individuals involved. Such a message affirms the basic</page><page sequence="26">254 Abraham Cohen goodness, trustworthiness, and reliability of the world at large, while preserving the youngster's sense of worth. In positing a fundamentally good world that is usually, though not al- ways, kind to man, and a notion of a good and helping God, Kushner al- lows for man to confidently live a basically good and need-fulfilling life. Misfortune can disrupt this pattern, however, given man's freedom to choose either good or evil, and the presence of chance and residual chaos in the world (p. 76). In positing a fundamentally good world, Kushner also asserts that "essentially there is divine justice, however imprecise, in the world. No good deed is ever wasted; it always leaves you a better person. No transgression is ever really escaped from; its punishment in one form or another, always follows" (p. 99). Where is God in this picture? Here, Kushner states ideas that we have met in his later work. God gives us a stable and orderly world whose laws we can learn to understand and deal with. "To the extent that man uses his intelligence and develops his conscience, he turns to God.in order to reduce chaos and misfortune" (p. 78). God has established jus- tice in the world, "however imprecise." God also "gives man the intelli- gence and the desire to help others" (p. 82). And in a world where "misfortune occurs so frequently" God "gives men the power to over- come tragedy and find reasons for going on with life" (p. 79). "The re- solve of men to rebuild their lives after disaster is the true act of God " (p. 79). "Does this mean that God gets credit for the good, and is never to blame for the bad that happens?" (p. 98). Kushner argues that to understand God we should not start with a definition of Him, but rather with the realities of the world. "We recognize that there are certain goals of self-realization toward which the human soul aspires, and that there are certain divine qualities the soul must use to reach that goal. It is not arbitrary... to identify these qualities ... to join them together under the label divine or godly, and to understand the word God to mean the Power that fash- ioned the world and the human soul so that these qualities were both pos- sible and necessary." "We say that when man exerts himself to be honest, loving and truthful, he calls upon the Power we know as God to help him grow stronger. When man chooses to be selfish, he does not call on any demonic Power of Evil nor does he call on God's 'bad aspects: He simply lives without God and so lives a restricted and far less satisfying life" (p. 99). Regarding the purpose of prayer in a world where God can- not breach the natural order, Kushner presents grounds met in his other work. Prayer affirms the essential goodness of the world. In prayer we acknowledge that God has given us the tools to deal with illness. God "answers" people by giving them the strength to bear their burdens. Prayer conveys the community's support for the sufferer, and thereby strengthens his spirits. Prayer conveys to the individual the godly resolve that if everything has been tried, and "you are strong enough to accept</page><page sequence="27">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 255 the worst and be humbly grateful for anything better, then your prayers will have been answered." If the worst happens, in prayer we seek to "find within ourselves the strength to live with that result too." This is the message of the Kaddish, in which the living, those "who have been hurt by life, proclaim publicly that they can still believe in God and in his world" (pp. 102-106). On the question of death, Kushner does not believe that children "are concerned with the subtle concept of their own non-existence." He reassures children that with rare exceptions they will live a normal, full life. In explaining death to them, Kushner remarks that the soul disap- pears just as does light when a switch is turned off. The recollection of the individual by others is for Kushner "the answer to where (the) soul went." What is absent in the chapter under discussion, in contrast to the end of When Bad Things Happen to Good People, is the notion of redeem- ing bad events, neutral at the time of their occurrence, by giving them meaning. As observed, in the chapter "Don't Blame God for Acts of God," in Kushner's 1970 work, we find the main ingredients of his later work, When Bad Things Happen to Good People. Kushner leaves no doubts about his basic naturalistic religious stance. There are laws of nature, and God, whatever His exact nature, does not intervene in the natural process. Good people do suffer unjustly as a result of "blind, inflexible Nature" chaos, and random happenings. To think otherwise is a child- ish view, which Kushner mocks. Still, there is "fundamental goodness" in the world, and "essentially... divine justice;' though they are built into the natural fabric of reality, and operate as "consequences" that fol- low largely on the heels of adherence to natural law and moral behavior by man. Ultimately, whatever redeeming features one finds in Kushner's ear- lier work, his views involve major theological difficulties, similiar to those encountered in his later book. If God is responsible for the im- mutable laws of Nature (one of God's manifestations, says Kushner), is He not responsible for their harmful effects? If, on the other hand, the laws of Nature are independent of God (Are we to believe that He is the Author of "blind, inflexible Nature... resulting in tragic and unde- served fates"?) why speak of the natural order as if God had a formative part in its working? Kushner asserts that the world is essentially good, that there is es- sential justice in the world, and that "no transgression is ever really es- caped from ... [as] punishment ... always follows .. "-all which clearly suggest Divine involvement and direction. However, when Kushner states as a "fact" that "the most deserving people aren't always rewarded, nor are the immoral ones always punished,:' he flagrantly contradicts his assertion that punishment always follows transgression, and he calls into</page><page sequence="28">256 Abraham Cohen question his other assertions regarding justice and the goodness of the world. Kushner's assertions are problematic on several grounds: Aside from the question of their validity, what is meant by essential justice and goodness? Is this a statistical notion whereby the world is mostly good, and justice applies in most instances? How would such a formulation sat- isfy the individual or group who suffer? Is the problem of theodicy less- ened when only a few children in a group suffer from cancer? Since most Jews survived the Holocaust, is the essential goodness and justice of the world preserved? And what of Job? His friends were well. Why should he, the odd man out, complain? Furthermore, is the essential sanguine nature of reality, as claimed by Kushner, planned by God, or did it emerge on its own? If planned by God, are we to believe that God maintains a statistical view of morality? Is "essential" goodness/justice, true divine goodness/justice? Kushner's position raises major ethical problems, and leaves the basic nature of his God in question. To achieve some clarification of his view of God we need to turn to other parts of his earlier book, When Children Ask about God. Running across several dozen pages of this work, Kushner broadly delineates his view of God, though at times we find ourselves lost in his ideological rhetoric about all of the things that God represents. In Kushner's favor, it must be pointed out that he presents a rich piece of modern theological thought. Someone trying to integrate a traditional theistic notion of God with modern views of nature and re- ality, could find aspects of Kushner's work challenging and inspiring. The theist's main problem with Kushner's thesis, concerns its essential (to borrow a term from Kushner) view of God. In his view, Kushner proposes that we no longer view God as a per- sonal Being separate from the physical world, but as a real Force which is part of the world known to us. The idea of God as a Force, following the physical model, assumes that all happenings, phenomena, and reali- ties in the world, are accounted for by underlying forces. Looking at man and the world in which we live, Kushner finds the following: The world is essentially hospitable to man. It allows for, and inspires ideals and creativity that enhance man's life. These ideals, like truth, justice, mercy, love, reflect what Kushner sees as a divine, Godly quality. There- fore, when we speak about God, for Kushner, we have in mind not a Being in- dependent of the world, but rather the nature of the world itself as it relates to man. God, therefore, "stands for all those qualities in the world and in ourselves which our religious tradition labels as divine, that is, as com- prising full human spiritual development..." (p. 16). And, "'God' will come to mean that impulse in the human collective and in the universe as a whole corresponding to conscience in the individual, the name</page><page sequence="29">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 257 given to that force in the cosmos and in every one of us which helps us to identify that which is good and true and worthwhile and which moves us to pledge ourselves to live up to it" (p. 23). What Kushner's view of God shares in common with the average be- liever is the notion that God is the "Power that creates life, and gives it meaning... the Ultimate Guarantor of our aspirations, the power that calls upon us to be moral" (p. 8). Kushner maintains this traditional way of speaking of God because it is "so rich in emotional connotation and evocative power" and reflects realities that Kushner affirms, albeit in a non-theistic framework. For Kushner, God is as real and provable as other forces we observe in nature, such as electricity and gravity: "... He is not imaginary, not a bit of wishful thinking or a figment of our imagination" (p. 6). In ad- dressing the question, "Can I be absolutely sure that there is a God,' Kushner maintains that we can be sure "that the qualities we associate with God are real, that they truly exist in the world" (p. 56). "We cannot prove or disprove whether there is an old man with a long beard dwelling in Heaven, but we can definitely prove that God, the Source of Love, growth and truth, does exist" (p. 56). Ours is a "vastly complex, or- derly world, a world too intricately put together and too closely geared to human needs and fulfillment to be an accident," a world which "seems to say that God shapes it" (p. 40). Believing in God "means be- lieving that the universe has order and direction," that it encourages human goodness and moral growth and that the impulse each of us feels to be a good person is a reflection of the purposefulness existing in the cosmos at large" (pp. 16-17). Furthermore, for Kushner, God is the Creator, but not in the sense in which the term is commonly understood. Creator does not denote bringing into existence, as Kushner's interpretation of Genesis suggests, but is a metaphor which conveys the view that the world, in its develop- ment, turned out in a given way (p. 61). In fact, God, per se, came into being only at a given point in the unfolding of our world. "When there was no world or anything, God wasn't anywhere. . . then the world came into being.., .and certain things started happening in this world.., .the things we associate with God. And then God came into the world." "Later on when there were people in the world ... God was even more in the world." As to the notion of a Personal God, Kushner rejects all of those characteristics attributed anthropomorphically to God in Biblical and Rabbinic Judaism. Most significantly, and by Kushner's definition, the God Force is not aware of man. Says Kushner: we need "to give up the idea that God knows each of us and cares about each of us personally," even though He is personal, in that "He affects people personally" (p. 25).</page><page sequence="30">258 Abraham Cohen God, rather than Father, should be viewed, with R. Gittlesohn, as "the Source of life, the Power that makes it possible for us and other living things to be alive" (p. 59). We must keep in mind that for Kushner the term God is a metaphor, a figure of speech. Metaphorically speaking, "God is just" means "that justice is one of the qualities human beings need to be fully and satisfy- ingly human" (p. 16). "The 'will of God' would mean those laws of Na- ture, both physical and spiritual nature, which govern our becoming real and fully developed human beings" (p. 63). "The unity of God will mean the integrating of all facets of the human soul and all elements of society to work for these goals, so that all men and all nations will know what is good and will work wholeheartedly for it .. :' (p. 24). How does this view of God translate into ethical terms? Are there ethical guidelines and certainties that man must follow, and how does the God-Force convey such standards to man? Kushner maintains that the idea of a God Who commands man to act in given ways, and en- forces His Law, is a stage in man's religious development, as its counter- part in the moral development of the child, which we have surpassed. As in the development of the young adult, there is a point where moral val- ues are internalized and must come from within the individual himself. The values we ascribe to God are ones we experience as being affirmed by our own needs and higher selves, and by our reciprocal interaction with the world at large. Such values, it is maintained, are not subjective. Following Professor Edmond Cahn, Kushner states that our "sense of in- justice'" our "apparently instinctive capacity to say ... 'that's not fair'" reflects on "universal rule(s)." Our "instinctive" "sense of injustice" indi- cates that some things, e.g., murder, "are so self-evidently wrong that no society has the right to legalize them;' and reveals a "built-in conviction that Right and Wrong are not entirely man-made concepts, but that they exist independently of our ratification or consent. Crying "unfair" is an emotional vote in favor of the existence of absolutes, and "God" is the name we give to the fact that these absolute standards, in conformity with which our spirits flourish, do indeed exist in the world" (p. 68). How- ever, in terms of the practical implications of this position, Kushner offers this qualification. "Saying that there are absolute rights and wrongs is not quite the same as saying that we know exactly what they are .. :' (p. 69). In summary, Kushner's views on God, enunciated in his 1970 work on behalf of the Reconstructionist movement, offer us the material with which to resolve the difficulties we encountered in Kushner's 1980 work When Bad Things Happen to Good People. The world has no Creator, as nor- matively understood. God is a metaphor for an assumed process in the cosmos that expresses the world's hospitableness to, and, in a sense, "en- couragement of" man's fullest physical and spiritual nature. Paradoxi- cally, however, we are told that the process need not have happened,</page><page sequence="31">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 259 and yet, it did not happen by accident, reflecting on "purposefulness in the universe at large." Our world turned out in a given way, supportive of man. Had the world not come into being, nor developed as it did, God would not have emerged. Or, better put, we could not speak metaphori- cally of a hypothetical process to which we attach the traditional term of "God." We have here Kushner's core conception of God. Adhering to it are "evocative" notions and language loosely carried over from traditional, theistic, God-phraseology. Consequently, the God Force is spoken of as the Power that creates life... He is the Ultimate Guarantor... He in- spires and validates our "sense of injustice," and sense of the good. He is the source of life and love, gives us tools to deal with adversity, answers prayers, and is in anguish when man suffers. When we strip away the rhetorical film that covers Kushner's core view of God, we more sharply call into question the very foundations of his non-Judaic religious system. God is no more than a metaphor for a hypothetical, personified process, reflecting on reciprocal realties be- tween man and his environment, that need not have happened. God is a metaphor for a process, not a personal Being of some kind. The Process is not the Creator. It did not leave over pockets of chaos. It did not "pur- posefully" impose "order," "essential" goodness and justice in the world, and did not bestow free will on man, all which Kushner had said of God! God the Force, unlike electricity, which is physical in nature, and verifi- able, is not provable. Strictly speaking, Kushner's metaphor (God) is just that, a way of talking, and a product of his imagination. All of Kushner's language regarding God could apply to a personal God, but does not apply to an inanimate process that, by definition, is unaware of the very object, man, for which it is supposedly responsible, and to which it is said to relate. In all such statements, Kushner speaks anthropomorphically of his "God" as the very same personal Being he mockingly dismisses. Consequently, the entire question of "why bad things happen to good people" has no meaning in Kushner's world-picture. Kush- ner's entire best-seller, as its readers well know, addresses the role of a Personal- God in the problem of evil, when, in fact, no such Personal God exists for Kushner We recall that Kushner tells us that God suffers anguish when man suffers. This represents a major component of Kushner's God thesis. Kushner's portrayal of the utter goodness and helplessness of the God- Force, allowed him to finish his work with the paradoxical appeal that we forgive this all-good God, who Himself had allowed for the condi- tions of evil. As painted by Kushner, it seems that his God has commit- ted the ultimate wrongdoing in setting the conditions for unredeemed evil, in order to paradoxically elicit the ultimate act of goodness by man, the forgiving of God.</page><page sequence="32">260 Abraham Cohen In fact, Kushner, spokesman for the Reconstructionist movement, believes none of this to be true, as his 1970 work attests. There is no Being-God who is aware of man. Consequently, during the Holocaust, God did not care, and was not in anguish. When an individual suffers, God does not care, and is not in anguish. Taking this position to its logi- cal conclusion, the metaphorical God-process is no more aware or car- ing of man the species, than of man the individual, and has never intended anything regarding man as a species or as an individual. For Kushner, the man/world relationship, denoted by the term God, is, strictly speaking, an accident, and is without purpose. In the absence of a real God, Kushner's impressionistic argument for absolute standards of right and wrong is absurd. Aside from the sheer audacity of the idea, if Kushner were right, absolute right and wrong would operate in the universe, and Kushner acknowledges that they do not. Furthermore, stating himself that we cannot determine such standards, on what grounds can Kushner claim they exist? In retrospect: Kushner begins his work, When Bad Things Happen to Good People, with a critique of the traditional theistic grounds for evil. He dismisses these views, only to adopt them, in large part, towards the end of his book. Kushner invokes a view of reality independent of God, which God cannot alter. He seeks support for this view in his reading of the first verses of Genesis and of the Book of Job. Both of his read- ings were found to be unsubstantiated and in contradiction of basic Bib- lical theology. Throughout his discourse Kushner presents two images of God's relationship to the independent world of physical reality; as a Creator who chose to free that reality from Himself, or, as a co-existent Being Who was not the Creator of this physical realm. It is vital to deter- mine which view Kushner really holds, and this question is pursued herein in light of Kushner's full work. In terms of God's relationship to man, Kushner paints a sharp image of a personal God, caring and in an- guish when man suffers. Kushner proposes various naturalistic grounds for evil, but alto- gether, finds that such grounds do not satisfy the religious quest for jus- tifying and accepting the reality of evil. Kushner, therefore, invokes the notion that we can redeem evil by investing it with meaning and making it serve God, and not the devil. Even while respecting the value of this position, I argue that it does not offer a way of redeeming the evil that has occurred. At the end of his work Kushner states that God is the One who has made evil possible, but we need to forgive Him. Indeed? Forgive the God who set the conditions for unredeemed evil? Unsatisfied that I un- derstand Kushner's God, I turn to an earlier work that Kushner wrote. Here, one sees in clear terms that for Kushner the material world is in- dependent of God, and, in fact, the term God is only a "metaphor"</page><page sequence="33">Theology and Theodicy: On Reading Harold Kushner 261 which describes this world's relationship to man. This God is not a Being, however understood, nor the intelligent Creator of the physical world, and its Overseer, as historical Judaism has described Him. Rather, God is only a metaphor for describing the physical world's non- inevitable, seemingly moral, and man-related character. Seen as such, Kushner's full portrayal in his best-seller of a Supreme Personal God, in anguish with man, is, in his own view, untrue. There is no such God. Kushner's friends have rightfully told him (p. 18) that he is an a-theist, a man without a God. Kushner's elaborate use of the lan- guage of theism is misappropriated, and glaringly misleading, given that he denies its underlying core personal-theistic belief. Ultimately, we see that Kushner replaced what he considered a "childish" view of a Person-God, with a "childish," Person-like natural process which does not exist. Though it may be naive to deny natural law and the operation of chance in our world, to deny God a place in the events of our world is to nullify religion, and, specifically, to aban- don Judaism. Having entered the innermost chambers of Harold Kushner's theol- ogy, we find in it no trace of the God known to Judaism, and we leave this chamber, uncomforted. TORONTO, CANADA NOTES 1.
