<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARY BETH HESTON Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio ICONOGRAPHIC THEMES OF THE GOPURA OF THE KAILASANATHA TEMPLE AT ELLORA T he rock-cut Kaildsandtha Temple at Ellord in Mahdrashtra is an early example of the Dravidian temple in Indian art, and as a characteristic example of that type, includes a monumental gopura or temple gateway. It is well-known that thegopura developed into the most prominent element of the Dravidian temple, eventually dwarfing the likhara or tower over the shrine of the temple that the gopura and its attached cloister wall surrounded. However, it was not until James Harle's 1963 Temple Gateways in South India1 that such structures received scholarly attention and analysis as monuments in their own right. This study examines the gopura of the Kaildsandtha Temple at Ellord, generally conceded to be a Rdshtrakita creation, and in particular is concerned with the figural carving of the gopura. The monolithic entrance of the Kaildsandtha Temple, demarcating the transition from the secular world to the abode of the deity, is actually composed of two parts: the gateway proper, and an attached screen-wall, which flanks the gateway on both sides (see Figs. I and 2; in Fig. i, the area marked C represents the outer limits of the gateway. Niches 7 and zo20 and the sections marked A and B represent the screen-wall). James Burgess first described the temple and its gateway in the late 19th century;2 the next author to give a detailed description of the monument was Ramesh Shankar Gupte, in 1962.3 However, it was not until Stanislaw J.Czuma's 1968 doctoral dissertation, "The Brahmanical Rishtrakfita Monuments at Ellord",4 that the distinc- tion between gateway and screen-wall was made clear. As he indicates, the screen-wall has only one story, while the gateway has two.s The facade in its entirety is articulated by a series of shallow rectangular niches separated by plain pilasters; it is these niches that contain the figural carvings to be examined. Similar niches are carved on the gateway's second level, but these contain no sculpture (Fig. 2). It is the imagery of these carvings which forms the focus of this study.6 While no previous authors have seemed to consider the possibility of an iconographic program for the carvings on I James C.Harle, Temple Gateways in South India: The Architecture and Iconography of the Cidambaram Gopuras (Oxford: Bruno Cassirer, 1963).

An abbre- zig</page><page sequence="2">the gateway, this study will attempt to demonstrate that certain themes recur on the entrance; the prominence of these motifs suggests they were intended to prepare the devotee for his en- counter with the deity enshrined within the temple, appearing as they do at the point of entry into the temple complex. One of the major problems of Indian art has been the attempt to arrive at an understanding of what a monument might have been intended to communicate to those who worshipped there. The fact that figural carving is so integral a part of Hindu religious architecture, and that the imagery of the figures decorating such monuments is derived from a rich literary /mythological tradition, suggests that there is more to Hindu iconography than identifying specific forms of various deities that appear on a given monument. The particular choice of images and their possible relation to one another may provide some key to the under- standing of the role of such sculpture in its architectural context. The Texts: The few writers who discuss the meaning and purpose of the multitude of Hindu deities in their variety of forms draw upon a large number of sacred Hindu texts, and their observations have been very important in this study.7 The Purdnic literature has played a particularly impor- tant role in their work, as it reflects the sectarian development of the Hindu religious systems from an early period. Since the lihiga in the main shrine of the Kaildsandtha temple indicates this monument to be of Saiva dedication, the Saiva Purdnas which are believed to have been com- piled about the time the temple was carved, and which may have served as the basis for an iconographic program, have likewise been primary sources for this study. Of course, the question of which texts might have been current is in itself problematic, since it is well-known that Purdnas characteristically are composed of diverse materials fre- quently dating from different periods, and thus tend to defy definite dating. On the other hand, in the case of many of these texts, scholars have been able to determine rough dates for the compilation of sections from diverse time periods into basically unified works. This is a knotty problem indeed, and not all scholars are in agreement on the dates for the Purdnas. Farquhar in- dicates the Siva, Linga and KDrma Purnas to be Saiva texts dating to the period ca. A.D. 550-900.8 Ramaswami Aiyar's dates for these works fall within a similar range, though he places the Litiga Purdna between 600oo and 0ooo A.D.; he believes the Kfrma Purdna received its final form in the eighth century, and that the original version of the Siva Purdna may be dated to the same century.9 Because the Kaildsanitha temple at Ellord was excavated within this period, with the majority of the building activity probably taking place in the second half of the eighth viated version was presented at the American Committee for South Asian Art Symposium on the Kailisandtha Temple at Ellord in January, 1977- 7 T.A.Gopinatha Rao, Elements of Hindu Iconography, 2 vols.

L. Sastri, translator of the Litiga Purna, estimates its final compilation to ca. A.D. D oo, i.e., earlier than both Farquhar's and Ramaswami Aiyar's earliest possible dates and well over two centuries prior to the excavation of the Kaildsa. The editor of the Krrma Purna, A. S. Gupta, places its final Padupdta recasting in the eighth century; 13 this date agrees with Ramas- wami Aiyar, and would make this text roughly contemporary with the Kaildsa. The final and complete version of the Siva Purna has not been assigned such a specific time frame by its translators. Obviously, the final form of these Siva Purnas represents a range in date of some centuries, yet the question of the contemporaneity of texts involves more than establishing definite dates for their completion. Such dates merely indicate the terminus ad quem after which no new sections were added, but do not preclude the very likely possibility that on the one hand some sections were much older and had been in use for some time, and, on the other, that a text might be used for some centuries after having received its final form. Therefore the apparent range in the dates of the Purdnas examined for this study does not imply they could not have been in use at the same time. Indeed, what is interesting for our purposes is that all three repeat certain themes that also seem to be particularly relevant to the Kailisandtha temple gateway. While it is difficult to clearly define the precise relationship between texts and monument, I believe that certain parallels between them can be pointed out, as I will attempt to demonstrate. With regard to the content of the texts, satisfactory scholarly analyses have yet to be conducted, and in fact, some of the main authorities on the subject are still nineteenth-century works, as, for example, that of Wilson; 14 even this is incomplete, in that it does not treat all eighteen major Purdnas. Surendranath Dasgupta's monumental A History of Indian Philosophy is one of the few 1o While the actual date of the monument is still uncertain, the second half of the eighth century seems the most likely date for the carving of the Kailisa. Hermann Goetz, in a lengthy argument, has attempted to prove that the carving of the temple continued over five centuries ("The Kaildsa at Ellord and the Chronology of Rashtrakuta Art", Artibus Asiae 15, 1952, 84-Io7), and, indeed, the variation in style of the carving within the monument does suggest that either the work was produced in several phases or by groups of artisans from different regions. However, Stanislaw Czuma suggests a more likely history for this enormously complex monument, ranging in date from late in the reign of Dantidurga to perhaps as late as the reign of Krsna II, or ca. 750-914, with most of the work taking place before the accession of Amoghavarsha I in ca. 814 A.D. (See the Table in the Appendix to Chapter IV, p. 377). I believe it is unlikely to have been begun before Dantidurga waged war on his Cdlukyan overlord in the early 750's (Ghulam Yazdani, The Early History of the Deccan, Vol. I, London, Bombay, New York, 1 96o, pp. 254-57), for it seems improbable that Kirttivarman II would have permitted his Rdshtrakaita feudatory to excavate a temple on a scale so much more grand than his father Vikramiditya II's Virupaksa Temple at Pattadakal. Because the Rishtrakita capital was probably moved from some- where near Ellord to Mdnyakheta/Malkhed early in the ninth century (Yazdani, p.257), this seems a likely date for most of the work on the monument to have ended.

In terms of the subject matter of the Purinas, the recurrence of certain themes within any given text and among a number of texts indicates that these ideas were certainly current in religious belief and practice at the time the texts were being compiled and used. When these themes appear within the imagery of contemporary monuments as well, we may infer that the art reflects the contemporary sectarian literature. I believe that the choice and arrangement of images appearing on the Kaildsanitha gopura can be interpreted as stressing certain motifs that are prevalent in the rele- vant Saiva Purdnas, suggesting that these texts, or portions of them, may have been important in formulating an iconographic program for this temple entrance. The Monument: The distinction between the gateway proper and its attached screen-wall is made clear not only formally, i. e., in plan and in the articulation of the facade, as previously indicated, but also in terms of subject matter. The imagery of the gateway is confined to guardian figures (the Dikpdlas, niches 8 to i i and 16 to 19) and creatures who inhabit the waters (the River Goddesses, niches 13 and 14; and nagas, niches i2 and 1 5), while the niches of the screen-wall contain images of the various forms of the chief Hindu deities, Siva, Visnu and Brahmd (niches I to 7, 20 to 26). The relative importance of these deities seems to be indicated visually, in that the figures of Siva, Visnu and Brahmd fill the entire height of the niche (Fig. 3), while the Dikplas are gener- ally only about two-thirds the height of the space (cf. Figs.4 and 5). It also appears that, for the Dikpdlas, the addition of a lintel between the brackets in the upper part of the niche was intended to create the illusion that these figures are set into their niches as if at a greater distance from the viewer than the deities who appear on the screen-wall (again, see Figs.4 and 5); perhaps their small size relative to the major deities is intended to reinforce this. It is interesting to note that in the fully-developed Cola gopuras at Cidambaram, Dikpadlas, River Goddesses and ndgas ordinarily appear only on the lower level of the gopura,I6 while the niches of the second level are reserved for the various mirtis of Siva and Visnu; 7 a similar hierarchic distinction may be intended on the Kaildsa with its division into gateway and screen-wall. The Screen-wall: The initial niche (niche i) at the north end of the north (left) wall contains no image (see Fig. 3); Czuma remarks that the omission appears to be intentional, particularly since the corresponding niche on the south (or right) wall (niche 26) is likewise uncarved.8 The first figure in the initial group on the left wall represents Giva; Czuma correctly identifies the figure in this niche (niche 2) as Giva in the Lalita Tilakam dance mode.,9 The most characteristic feature of this form is the one leg lifted as if to touch the forehead,zo as can be seen to be the case with 1s Surendranath Dasgupta, A History of Indian Philosophy, 2nd ed. (195 5; rpt. Cambridge: University Press, 1969), vol. V.

Banarjea explains all images of Siva in his various dancing modes as also representing Siva as a teacher, associated with the concept ofjnana (knowledge), because as king or lord of the dance, Giva was "the greatest exponent of the science and art of dancing".21 The next image of this group is Brahma (niche 3), recognizable by his three visible faces. Brahma, the deity of birth and creation,2 is also often associated with knowledge,'3 especially knowledge of the sacred Vedic texts.24 Around the corner is another series of three images in niches (niches 4 to 6, Fig.4), all of which seem related in theme. Lifigodbhavam-rti, seen in the first niche, is a deity from Saiva mythology. Banarjea sees a sectarian basis for this story,2s in which Visnu and Brahma attempt to find the beginning and end of a flaming lirga; both must recognize the superiority of Siva when they are unable to fulfill their aim, and subsequently come to realize that the lifga is Siva in his Ultimate and Infinite form. The main elements of the story can be seen in niche 4 in the central column, representing the liiga, and the figures in a-jalimudrad to either side. The three visible heads of the worshipping figure on the liiga's proper right confirm its identity as Brahma; presumably the other figure, whose identifying attributes are damaged, would be Visnu. As a possible metaphor for sectarian differences, the story seems to suggest the resolution of such differences in the ultimate unity (and superiority) of Siva. The Siva and Kirma Purinas explain that it was their ignorance and Siva's illusion which caused Visnu and Brahma to be deceived into thinking that they might be superior deities; in both versions the story is also used to expound on the importance of Siva's phallic emblem, the lihga.26 Harihara, the composite form of Siva and Visnu, appearing in the next niche (niche 5), is an image which states in graphic form the ultimate union of possible sectarian differences in Siva-in that the two major deities of Brahmanical worship are united into a single entity-and various authors have interpreted Harihara in this way..7 As in the previous image, Siva's superiority is indicated, as he is always represented on the proper right and thus as the dominant aspect of this image. The Kirma Purana, which describes this image as an object of meditation, calls the dual Siva/Visnu "the source of the universe" and the "ultimate reality".28 We will see elsewhere that ultimate unity is sometimes manifested or expressed in terms of apparent duality. The Ardhandrisvara image, in the third niche of this group, can be identified by the swaying hip of the female aspect on the figure's proper left, which contrasts with the masculine form on its right. Here too, in a composite male/female image representing the union of Siva and his divine consort, authors have remarked on the apparently implicit reference to sectarian differ- ences.29 The theme of union which the image depicts is explained as the symbolic union of the 21 Banarjea, p.470. 22 Danielou, p.235- 23 Ibid., and Kfrma, 11.6.11-12, p. 317.

See legendary account for this explanation in Rao II. 1, pp. 322-23, which recounts the story of a Siva worshipper's dilemma when he was determined to pay devotion only to the male aspect of this image.

When we look beyond the images themselves to the texts that describe them, the sense of all three images as a source, or aspect, of creation, also seems to exist. For example, in the Liniga Purina, the emergence of the liriga in the Linigodbhdvamiirti account signals the origin of the universe, for out of the lihiga came the seed which was im- planted in the womb and became the golden egg that in Hindu mythology is the source of all life.a" The Harihara image is called the "source of the universe" in the Kirma Purina;33aa it is described as the "Primal Person" from which all creation springs.34 The Ardhaniridvara image is even more strongly linked to creation.as Giva's role in the context of all of these images is that of a beneficent deity, whose life-giving qualities energize creation. He assumes the duties of Creator and Preserver that are usually associated with Brahmi and Visnu, indicating the absolute power embodied in his being, and stressing Siva as the source of all the universe. The next niche, number 7, is destroyed beyond recognition (Fig. 5). It is unfortunate that we cannot identify what was carved here, but it seems certain that it would have contained an image, because the corresponding niche on the south or right wall (number 20) contains a very fine representation of Vardha, or Visnu in his boar incarnation, in which he rescued the earth goddess from the primordial waters (Fig. 6). This form is treated in all the Saiva Purdnas exam- ined here. In the Siva Purd .a, Vardha kills the demon Hiranyaksa, who had dragged the earth to the depths of the ocean.36 The Kfrma Purdna presents a similar account.3 Variha appears twice in the Litiga Purdna; in the first instance an abbreviated story is told, but the second account is detailed.38 His act frees the earth from the suppression suffered at the hands of Hiranyaksa, father of Andhaka, a demon who appears in another panel on this wall. The three images that follow (niches 21 to 23) correspond to the Lifigodbhdvamarti- Harihara-Ardhandrisvara group on the left wall (Fig.7), and authors generally agree on their identification. In niche 2 1 Visnu appears atop the shoulders of his mount, the bird-man Garuda.a9 The adjacent panel depicts Visnu in his Trivikrama form, recognizable here by the eight arms and the left leg lifted up to the heavens.40 It was in his incarnation as Trivikrama/Vdmana that Visnu reclaimed the universe for the gods. This took place after a disagreement between the devas and asuras over their universal hegemony, when the demon Bali agreed to allow the gods whatever territory the dwarf Vamana could cover in three strides. No sooner had Bali made his 30 Siva, vol.4, p. 1919, fn. 214. 31 Liaga I.5.27-29, p.18; 41.7-20, pp.164-65 and 43-48, P. 167. Ktirma I.

Czuma notes that he holds a damaru (drum) and a small demon.43 Of the panels examined so far on this wall, two specifically depict deities in the act of defeating a demon, while the third carries the suggestion of defeat in that Visnu can be seen as having overcome Garuda, who then became his mount. A similar motif was reflected in Va- raha's conquest of Hiranyaksa. The final group of images on this wall appears to follow a similar theme of righteous victory. In niche 24 is a representation of Nrsitiha, the man-lion incarnation of Visnu (Fig. 8), in which he destroyed the demon Hiranyakasipu. The fierce image is seated, triumphant over the demon. The final image is usually identified as Siva dancing in the tindava form;44 I believe, however, that the violently twisting pose corresponds more closely to that of Siva killing the elephant demon, Gajisura,4s thereby appropriately completing the demon sequence of this wall. It is interesting to note that in the Kfrma, Linga and Siva Purdnas, the Variha, Nrsirhiha and Andhakdsura narratives occur together, just as they appear together here on the right screen- wall. In the Kfrma Purna, for example, all three events are narrated in the same chapter, while in the Liiga and Siva Puranas the episodes are related in successive chapters.46 The Andhakdsura story most clearly specifies the intent of these fierce images. In this episode in the Siva Purn a, in which not only all the gods but also their laktis appeared to aid Siva in his battle with the demon, Siva pins Andhaka on the end of his trident, causing the demon to achieve real knowl- edge. Realizing that what he had done was a result of his ignorance, Andhaka promises devo- tion to Siva.47 In the same Purd .a, the Gajdsura narrative also relates a conversion to Siva worship; the elephant demon, when fixed on the end of Siva's trident, decides to become a devotee of Siva.48 The defeat of a demon is clearly intended as a metaphor for the difficulty of attaining the religious goal; a successful conquest results in devotion to the deity. The demon personifies ignorance or illusion which stands in the way of religious knowledge. The deity is the vanquisher, but the vanquished demon also becomes the recipient of the act, for the destruc- tion of illusion allows even the demon to see clearly, resulting in his realization of Siva as the Ultimate Reality. It is also noteworthy that the recurrent themes of this wall are expressed pre- dominantly in terms of icons representing narratives where Visnu is the chief character. While this might at first seem puzzling in a Siva temple, it is not unusual to find Vissnu icons in a Siva temple, and in fact Visnu plays a prominent role in many Siva Purd nas, though he is ultimately subservient to or an aspect of Giva in such a context. 41 Rao I.

The religious goal, i.e., knowledge, which is the realization of Giva as the Universal, is the same in the images depicted on both the left and right walls; what differs is the expression of the means to that end. In the saumya/pacific forms on the left wall, knowledge is a boon freely given by the deity, an aspect of his life-giving qualities. In the fiercely active forms on the right wall, religious knowl- edge is an achievement resulting from arduous dedication to the task of overcoming the evil of ignorance, presumably the ignorance within one's self, which is represented in anthropomorphic form. Devotion to the deity may be at least implicitly an element of this undertaking. As we shall see in the following group of images, the panels of the gateway seem to reinforce the themes of their respective sides of the screen-wall. The Gateway: Even in their damaged state, all but one of the screen-wall images can be identified. The images on the gateway present certain problems, yet there seems to be little doubt that these represent the Dikpalas, the Guardians of the Directions. Two of the panels have been destroyed beyond recognition (18 and 19), and in addition, Karttikeya, who appears among the group, is quite unusual as a guardian. On the other hand, Harle has demonstrated that the Dikpadlas do appear on the lower level of the Cidambaram gopuras,49 gateways which represent the fully- developed type of the Cola period, and indeed, their protective function is particularly appro- priate to the point of entry into the temple complex, just as guardians often appear flanking the entrance to Hindu temples and are particularly prominent flanking shrine entrances. As Clifford Jones has pointed out in his discussion of the Dikpadlas and their symbolism, the concept of the guardians of the eight directions, which are "calculated devices meant to build a symbolic structure of potency and protection for the rite of worship" is "of great antiquity in the Hindu tradition";5so however, it was not until the age of the Early Western Calukyas, who preceded the Rashtrakitas in hegemony of the Deccan, that the Guardians began to appear regularly in art.s5 Thus, even through three of the Kaildsa gateway panels are problematic, the fact that five images can be positively identified as Dikpadlas, and that the Dikpdlas became important in art under the previous rulers of the area and are prominent on later gopuras, suggests that the identification of the gateway figures as the Astadikpdlas is probably correct. The presence of Krtttikeya (niche 8 and Fig. 5) among the Guardians of the Eight Directions is at once puzzling and interesting, yet an argument might be made to explain him as appro- priate both to the group and to the meaning of the screen-wall. It would be difficult to say which of the Dikpalas he might replace, since two niches are destroyed. Generally considered to be a son of Siva,s, Kirttikeya has numerous functions, but one of his main roles is that of the leader 49Harle, pp. 103-38. so Clifford Reis Jones, "The Temple Theatre of Kerala and Its Description", Diss., Univ. of Pa., 1967, pp. 89-90o. s1 George Michell, "The Regents of the Directions of Space: A Set of Sculptural Panels from Alampur",Art andArchae- ology Research Papers 4 (Dec., I973), p. 8I. s2 John Dowson, A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Religion, Geography, History and Literature, I2th ed.

His place at the entrance to the temple would seem to suggest such a guardian role. Another interesting aspect of Kdrttikeya, particularly in relation to this image and its context, is his importance in the acquisition of reli- gious knowledge. The Kirma Purina names Kdrttikeya as an important deity on the path to religious knowledge and the greatest of all persons knowing Brahman.54 In the Siva Purdna Kdrttikeya is called the knower of the Vedas,ss while in the Litiga Purona he is considered con- versant with the reality of teaching as in the Vedas and Sastras.s56 In fact, two particular forms of Kdrttikeya which appear in art and are described in the texts attest to his role as a deity of knowledge. As Brahma-Sdstd, Kdrttikeya exposed Brahmd's ignorance of the Vedas; Kdrtti- keya's attributes in this form include the aksamdld (rosary) and kamandalu (water pot).57 In his Defika-Subrahmanya form, Kdrttikeya was the teacher of Siva; in that form his attributes are the lakti (spear) and kamandalu.s8 Whether this image can be identified as either of these is uncertain, but it is interesting to note that its attributes are the saktz and kaman.dalu, and that one of the earliest representations of the Defika-Subrahmanya icon appears at Ellora, in the nearby Rameivara Cave.s9 Thus, his protective function as a leader of the army of the gods makes him a fitting companion to the Dikp la contingent, and his importance as a deity associated with knowledge, particularly Vedic knowledge, makes his appearance on the left half of the gateway in keeping with the panels on the left side of the screen-wall. To the right of Kdtttikeya is a niche with a figure of Agni, deity of the sacrificial fire, who can be recognized by his goat vehicle. Next to him is Vdyu, god of air and wind, mounted on his deer. The final Dikpila on the wall, Varuna, regent of the west, god of rain and water, and of knowledge,60 sits atop his makara and bears, instead of his pdTa or noose, a padma or lotus.6' Varuna's location and attributes are especially interesting when we note that in the correspond- ing panel on the south or right wall we find Indra (niche I6), regent of the east, wielder of the thunderbolt, god of power and might, seated on an elephant (Fig.6); in the damaged niche beyond Indra, Yama's bull vehicle indicates the appropriate identification of this Dikp la. The apparent pairing of Varuna and Indra as regents of west and east, flanking an entrance and bearing as their respective attributes padma and vajra (thunderbolt), is particularly noteworthy for its parallels with Buddhist art, where Avalokite'vara/Padmapdni (the lotus-bearer) and Vajrapini (the vajra-bearer) or else unspecific bodhisattvas with the same attributes, often appear as attendants to the Buddha; their presence has been interpreted as signifying updya (approach or means) and prajild (knowledge), or the means of enlightenment and the knowledge of en- lightenment, i.e., the component or dual aspects of religious endeavor that make up the final 53 Prithvi Kumar Agrawala, Skanda-Kirttikeya (A Study In the Origin and Development) (Monographs of the Department of Ancient Indian History, Culture and Archaeology, no. 3, Varanasi: Banaras Hindu University, 1967), pp.17-18. 54 Kzrma II.6. 29, p. 317. 55ss iva, vol. 2.

Ellord is, of course, a site where both Buddhist and Brahmanical caves occur side by side, so it is possible that the earlier Buddhist excavations may have exerted an influence upon the imagery of the Brahmanical caves that followed. The apparent emphasis on Varuna's role as a personification of religious knowledge or the means to religious knowledge assumes greater credibility when we consider the repetition of this theme in the other images on the left wall, just as the image of the powerful and mighty vajra-bearer, Indra, king of the gods, seems appropriate to the right wall, where we have seen an emphasis upon a more aggressive path to the religious goal. Thus, the images of the gate- way which actually flank the entryway seem to reinforce the themes which we have seen re- peated on the screen-wall. The apparent dichotomy in the types of images that appear on the right versus the left sections of the entrance suggests that the choice and arrangement of these images was deliberate and specific. We have seen the emphasis upon knowledge of the Ultimate Reality of Siva as a religious goal in the carved images of the Kaildsa gateway and in particular narratives and passages from the Purdnic literature, but it should be stressed that this is a repeated theme throughout the Saiva Purdnas of the period. As J. L. Sastri notes in the Introduction to the Liga Purinaa, "The major portion of this Purina is concerned with the suppression of illusion through the attainment of knowledge." 63 The importance of knowledge is stated most clearly and eloquently in the 37th chapter of the Vydsa Gitd section of the Kfrma Purdna, when the sages ask Siva how he should be worshipped, whether "through active exertion or through knowledge or through yoga."64 Siva replies that although there are indeed various means, "knowledge only can prop- erly give the fruit of salvation",6s and that "therefore, the pure knowledge, leading men straight to salvation, should be known, heard and seen by you with all efforts", since "many means for success have been told in the world", but "knowledge of mine is superior to them".66 Perhaps the message of the Kirma Purdna most clearly reflects what is seen in the gateway, for Wilson characterizes the second part of this text as follows: It is divided into two parts, the Ilvara Gita and the Vy1sa Git. In the former, knowledge of god, that is, of Siva, through contemplative devotion is taught. In the latter the same object is enjoined through works, or the observance of ceremonies and precepts of the Vedas.67 Indeed, just as the second part of this text is divided into two sections which suggest alter- nate means, Dhydnayoga and Kirmayoga, of achieving the same goal of union or identification 62 John C.Huntington has been the interpreter of this idea in modern times. He has discussed it in classes I have attended at Ohio State University, and has presented it at numerous conferences. A concise presentation of this iconography in the context of the Western Caves is given in Chapter II of the forthcoming History of Indian Art by Susan L. and John C. Huntington. 63 Li-ga, Introduction, pp.xxiii-xxiv. 64 Kfirma 11.37.125, p. 5Io0. 65 Ibid., verse I29. 66 Ibid., verses 132 and I37. 67 Wilson, Analysis of the Purdnas, Preface, p. xlix. 234</page><page sequence="17">with the deity through knowledge, so is the Kaildsa entrance divided into two halves, left and right, each side stressing, through the repetition of images that deal in related motifs, a different aspect of religious endeavor. We have seen how the images of the left wall suggest that know- ledge can be attained as a boon conferred by a benevolent (saumya) teacher, the deity, while those on the right wall suggest that the path must be relentlessly and actively pursued until the demons of ignorance or illusion are finally destroyed. There can be no doubt that the ultimate goal is essentially the same, just as "Brahmd, Visnu, Agni, Varuna--all (these) gods and simili- arly the sages are described as the modifications of only one Rudra (i.e., Siva)."68 None other than Siva states, in the Kfrma Purdna, "Though I am devoid of stain and attributes yet for the purpose of creation, preservation and dissolution I am ... divided into three, named as Brahmd, Visnu and Hara.... This is the highest knowledge, unrevealed and termed as 'Siva' through which the wise can perceive that subtle and incomprehensible reality."69 Since few early gopuras or proto-gopuras survive in stone, and even fewer survive intact, it is difficult to say whether the Kaildsandtha gopura is representative of its type in the manner in which order has been imposed upon the images by their formal organization within the monu- ment. However, the similarity in the basic organization of the monument--i. e., gateway versus screen-wall--to the fully-developed Cola gopura has been discussed above. The rare occurrence of a gopura from any period surviving from the time of its initial construction without repairs or alterations makes comparative examination of most later gopuras likewise difficult. Yet the point of entry into the temple complex seems a particularly appropriate location to indicate to the person who will worship within, the themes he should consider as he prepares himself for the encounter with the mystery of Siva, the subtle and incomprehensible reality. 235 68 Kurma II.44.37, P. 547. 69 Ibid., I.25.98-1I04, p. 190.</page></plain_text>
