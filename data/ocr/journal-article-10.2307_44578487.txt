<plain_text><page sequence="1">AUTOCHTHONY, MISOGYNY, AND HARMONY: MEDEA 824-45 STEPHEN NIMIS In Euripides' Medea, the formidable heroine is onstage nearly the entire drama, and her powerful presence dominates all the other figures in the play. We see her engage and manipulate other characters; we witness with sympathy her treatment at the hands of Jason; and we recoil in horror at the savagery with which she takes revenge on the royal family in Corinth as well as her own children. It is thus no surprise that critics view the play primarily in terms of her status as a woman and as a foreigner, as a "wife" and mother, as a heroine espousing the masculine code of revenge, as a purveyor of magic, and, finally, as a semi-divine character lofted away in her wondrous chariot, apparently never to be called to account for her crimes.1 No matter how one reads the play, it seems clear that the role of women in Greek society is one of its major concerns. However, it is debatable whether women were even in the original audience; and if they were not, it is unclear how the men in the audience would respond to the display of gender conflict.2 Meanwhile, 1 On Medea's espousal of heroic values, see Knox 1977, Bongie 1977, Foley 2001.243-68, McDermott 1989, Galis 1992, Rehm 1989, Harder 1993, Katz 1994, Segal 1996, Boede- ker 1997, Allan 2002.81-99.

That ode opens with a clear reference to the autochthonous origin of Athens (824-26): From ancient times, the sons of Erechtheus are favored; they are children of the blessed gods sprung from a land holy and unconquered.3 Nicole Loraux and others have shown that the theme of autochthony is a crucial linchpin connecting issues of gender and citizenship in the Athe- nian democracy, a theme that is central to Euripides' Ion and his fragmen- tary Erechtheus. 4 In what follows, I would like to explore this theme in the Medea , where the powerful figure of its heroine has caused its importance to be overlooked. To anticipate my conclusion, I will argue that the Utopian image of the ode in praise of Athens is simultaneously a distillation of the central conflicts of the drama and an attempt to produce an aesthetically satisfying resolution to those very issues. By celebrating the homogeneous male citi- zenry through the discourse of autochthony, while also making provision for the positive aspects of heterosexual reproduction, the choral ode provides a Utopian vision of Athens bereft of the conflicts that the rest of the play dra- matizes so powerfully. Moreover, Euripides exploits the dramatic possibili- ties of the stage to blur distinctions of time, place, and gender in a way that contributes to the production of that Utopian vision, revealing art's general inclination towards "transcending in fictive unreality the social limitations and historical conditions of its own production."5 1 will begin with a brief account of the tragic discourse of autochthony as laid out by Loraux and others and then use that discourse as a context for reading key passages in the play, especially the first two stanzas of the third stasimon. The topic of autochthony became a key ideological motif of demo- cratic Athens. The original meaning of the word, as its etymology suggests, must be something like "residing in the same land"; but in the fifth century, 3 Translations of the Medea are from Kovacs 1994, slightly modified. 4 Loraux 1986, 1993, 2000; Saxonhouse 1986, 1992; Tyrrell 1989; Zacharias 2003. 5 Hall 1997.125.

This becomes translated into the doctrine that all Athenians are united into a homogeneous collectivity by their common autochthonous birth. The discourse of autochthony was inflected in different ways in different contexts. For example, in the wartime funeral speeches delivered in the kerameikos , the official cemetery at the foot of the Acropolis, Athe- nian orators praised the dead sons of the fatherland (patris) as they were buried in the civic soil (chora) from which they had sprung in terms that emphasized their equality to each other (Loraux 1993.43^14): The kerameikos is a heroic site, but also an isonomic one, where citizen-soldiers, rich and poor, residents of the city and the countryside, the agathoi and the nameless, are all buried side by side, tribe by tribe, in the same monument, not known either by patronym or by deme. In the kerameikos , democratic discourse has incorporated autochthony and translated it into an ideal devoid of any mention of Erechtheus or Athena. On the Acropolis, however, the myth of the earth-born son and his protec- tive female deity Athena is remembered, and Erechtheus is celebrated as the forefather of all the Athenian people. There the city "chooses to remember that its cohesiveness is wholly collective, and the Panathenaic procession 'enumerates' the diversity of the democratic polis: sexes, age groups and social classes all mingled together" (Loraux 1993.45). The Panathenaic festival celebrated the special character of the city of Athens in opposition to all other Greek cities (whose inhabitants were 6 Rosivach 1987, Shapiro 1998. 7 Aristotle Ath. Pol. 26.4. For the meaning of the wording in Aristotle, see Patterson 1986, who takes a broader view of women's role in the city than Loraux.</page><page sequence="4">400 Stephen Nimis immigrants), and this idea played a key role in the Athenian justification of their empire. Even here on the Acropolis, however, the inclusion of a repre- sentation of Pandora at the feet of Athena in the Parthenon is a reminder of the myth complementary to autochthony: the "tribe of women" are a separate race descended from Pandora, who was "fashioned" from the earth (i.e., not "born" of the earth: Loraux 1993.72-110). For there can be no ques- tion that the discourse of autochthony also entails the exclusion of women and denigrates their role in the reproduction of the city. Between these two extremities of the city's symbolic landscape, Acropolis and kerameikos , is the space of tragedy, where mythic and civic discourse met in another format in order to confront the difficulties encountered by the exclusion of women.8 Here in the theatre of Dionysus, as Loraux points out, the issues of gender tend to be foregrounded most strongly, and the dark side of the myth of autochthony is given expression (1993.220-47). In the case of Euripides, the Ion and the fragmentary Erechtheus have been the focus of attention with regard to autochthony. But the Medea is one of two plays by Euripides in which a male character expresses the wish that there were some way for men to reproduce without the media- tion of women, a wish that Loraux argues (1993.72-110, 2000.83-94) is reflected in the Athenian myth of autochthony {Medea 573-75): Xpīļv yàp aÀÀoGév rcoOev ßpoxoix; 7taîôaç TEKvoûaOai, 0iļX/u ó' ouk eivai yevoç* %ouxcoç äv ouK f)v ouôèv àvOpcímon; micóv. Mortals should produce children from some other source, and there ought to be no female kind. Then mankind would have no trouble.9 This remark by Jason, of course, and the one similar to it in the Hippolytus , take for granted that humans of both genders are, in fact, born of women 8 This is not to say that women were, in fact, completely excluded from the city's life, only that for Athenians their politeia was increasingly thought of in abstract and primarily male terms. Patterson 1986 surveys the range of participation of women in the traditional com- munity of Athens as opposed to this more narrowly male sovereign body. For women's legal status, see Foxhall 1996. 9 Cf. Hippolytus 616-19: "O Zeus, why have you settled women in the light of the sun, women, this bane mankind find counterfeit? If you wished to propagate the human race (ßpoxeiov yevoç), it was not from women that you should have given us this."</page><page sequence="5">Autochthony, Misogyny, and Harmony: Medea 824-45 401 and not from the earth, and tragedy is one of the places where the myth of autochthony faces up to the fact of this dual heritage. The conflicts that arise from the inescapability of women's presence in the city and from the role of women in the reproduction of its citizenry make up a normal tragic scenario. The Medea certainly centralizes this theme and the various insti- tutions that deal with it, so it will be convenient to give a brief survey of these issues in the play. Most readers observe that Medea undergoes a change in the eyes of the audience in the course of the play. She is initially made to be quite sympathetic, a sympathy that is foregrounded in the response of the cho- rus - whose collusion she secures in her scheme to punish Jason - and also in the condemnation of Jason by the nurse and by Aegeus. However, many things contribute to the sense that Medea's revenge is excessive and reprehensible, such as the graphic account by the messenger of the piteous death of Creon and his daughter, and the chorus' revulsion at Medea's plans to kill her children. Moreover, it is often noted that the earlier and more sympathetic Medea articulates her complaints as the general grievances of her gender, making her a kind of representative woman. As such, the final negative judgment that the play seems to cast on her actions intimates that women as a whole are capable of terrible deeds and not worthy of the sympathy evoked earlier in the play for them.10 Indeed, Medea's protesta- tions that she is a woman without any choices, whose infanticide spares her children a fate worse than death, seem to be refuted by the surprise revela- tion at the end that she has the power to prevent Jason or anyone else from touching the children. At the same time, Medea, as a representative of her gender, is char- acterized as essentially "other" in regard to the male community of citizens, whose masculine values were celebrated and confirmed in civic events such as tragic competitions (Goldhill 1990, 1997). She is a foreigner, incapable of producing legitimate male heirs; she is a woman, who is thus "outside" an exclusively male sovereign body. Finally, at the end of the play, she is revealed to be semi-divine, so that in her final appearance ex machina , Medea "will have appeared not only as female, but as emphatically barbarian, and quasi-divine rather than mortal, triply distanced from the self-definition of the mortal, male, Athenian audience."11 10 McDermott 1989.51, Rabinowitz 1993.132. 11 Bowman 2002.161. See Rabinowitz 1993. 131- 41 . O'Higgins 1997 and Graf 1997 show this overdetermined "otherness" is part of Medea's character in other contexts.</page><page sequence="6">402 Stephen Nimis There are many dimensions of the Medea that complicate and enrich this basic narrative trajectory, and I do not mean to dismiss their importance for the meaning of the play to its original audience. But there is good rea- son to focus on the meaning of the play for the problematic relationship between the exclusively male community of Athenian citizens and the "tribe of women," who are simultaneously insiders and outsiders. When the Athe- nian hero Aegeus arrives on stage and Medea proposes to help him with his problem, childlessness, in exchange for being allowed to enter his city and find safety there - the very devil's bargain that Jason has just lamented earlier in the play - what was going through the minds of the Athenian men in the audience? Did they, knowing what they did about Medea, begin yell- ing to Aegeus like a child in a scary movie: "Don't do it, Aegeus! She's a witch!" Indeed, this whole scenario - a play set in Corinth, but taking place at a festival in the very heart of Athens whose surrounding monuments were clearly visible to the audience, in which an Athenian hero enters the fictive Corinth and promises to bring Medea "home" to Athens so she can settle there and help him produce children - this whole scenario must have made the audience, in Knox's words, "a trifle uneasy" (1977.201). Producing this uneasiness must have been one of the aims of Euripides in this play, since it can be observed at many levels. The fictive temporal and spatial setting of the play, for example, would have created a certain distance between the audience and the performers, but this distance is violated numerous times in the play by the introduction of contemporary issues.12 With her insistence on oaths and revenge, Medea seems to be a creature from the heroic past, while Jason seems to live in the present world of Athens. Indeed, his reasoning about having legitimate heirs and the sta- tus of his relationship with Medea would not have sounded unfamiliar or illogical to the men in the audience. Meanwhile, the complaint of Medea about the lives of women seems to be drawn from the experiences of con- temporary Athenian wives, while the issues of citizenship and foreigners echo those of Athenian politics. Finally, the fact that Medea, a representa- tive of women in general, who transcends her role as a woman in part by taking on characteristics of the masculine heroic code, was being played by a cross-dressing male actor might have been a factor in the audience's reactions to the display of gender issues in the play. Although Froma Zeit- 12 On this fictive distance in tragedy in general and its ambiguities, see Vernant and Vidal- Naquet 1988.29-48. For the Medea in particular, see the works cited in note 1 above.</page><page sequence="7">Autochthony, Misogyny , and Harmony: Medea 824-45 403 lin argues that this is a potentially significant aspect of any dramatization of women in Attic tragedy, Nancy Rabinowitz argues persuasively that the cross-dressing conventions may have had a special impact in the Medea.13 Moreover, Helene Foley shows that the great monologue of Medea pits a heroic male self against a maternal self. How would such a juxtaposition of gendered values have made the male members of the audience feel about themselves ?14 Which side of Medea's "divided self' would have seemed more admirable and noble to these men: the masculine or the feminine? The chorus of Corinthian women are also cross-dressing males, and their vacillating support of Medea contributes to the sense that right does not lie completely with either Jason or Medea. Medea's passion for Jason sets her apart from typical Athenian wives who, unlike Medea, are given in marriage by their fathers, passing from the authority of one man to that of another. Although Medea frequently speaks of the oaths that bind her and Jason, their relationship is never called a gamos , and the audi- ence may have considered Medea comparable to a concubine who would be ineligible to produce male heirs (Bowman 2002). Somewhere between Jason, who in typical male fashion treats relationships as economic con- tracts, and Medea, who is willing to sacrifice everything for her passion, the communal voice of the chorus suggests that a middle ground is pos- sible and desirable. Although the non-verbal part of the performance of the chorus is one of the least documented dimensions of Greek tragedy, we can imagine that the audience must have had a strong emotional response to the chorus, whose elaborate movements and beautiful voices must have been a source of pleasure that went beyond the mere meaning of the words they sang. Homogeneous, coordinated, visually and aurally beautiful, they must have also been a source of enormous civic pride to the men in the audience whom they represented in the dramatic competition.15 With these ideas in mind, let us turn to the text of the first strophe and antistrophe of the third stasimon {Medea 824-45): 'Ep£%0£iôai xò rcaÀmòv ö^ßioi Kai 0£(öv rcaîÔ£ç pampcov, mpaç Xcopaç árcopOrjxou t' arco, cp£pßop£voi 13 Zeitlin 1990a; Rabinowitz 1995, 1998. 14 Foley 2001.257-68.

From ancient times, the sons of Erechtheus are favored; they are children of the blessed gods sprung from a land holy and unconquered. Feeding on wisdom most glorious, and ever through the bright air stepping gracefully, where once the holy nine Pierian Muses, they say, brought forth fair-haired Harmony. At the streams of beautiful flowing Cephisus, they say that Aphrodite, having drawn out water, blew down upon the land temperate and sweetly blowing breezes. And ever dressing her hair with a fragrant chaplet of roses, she sends the Loves to sit at Wisdom's side, joint workers in every kind of excellence. These lines are a remarkable hymn-like praise of Athens, com- parable to the ode in praise of Athens in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus (668-719). Discussions of this example in the Medea emphasize the con- trast between these first two stanzas, which portray Athens as a place of light, beauty, and poetry, populated by primarily feminine figures (Harmo- nia, the Muses, Aphrodite),16 with the last two stanzas that urge Medea not to kill her children ("How could such a city receive a murderess?"). How- 16 Pucci 1980.116-27, Rehm 2002.263-67.</page><page sequence="9">Autochthony, Misogyny ; and Harmony: Medea 824-45 405 ever, these first two stanzas can be seen to set up a contrast between each other as well, something highlighted by the structure and balance between them.17 Besides the significant repetition in identical metrical position of %cí&gt;paç and aiei, there is a parallel contrast in each stanza between tenses of continuous action and aorist tenses: tpepßopevoi and ßaivovteq versus cpuTEÛaai; then àtpuooapévav and Kaxarcveuoat versus ercißaAAopivav and rcéprceiv. The present tenses describe a continuous state of affairs; the aorist tenses describe two obscure events in the past. Against the background of these parallels, an important contrast emerges. The strophe refers to the Athenians as "Children of Erechtheus," a poetic term that calls attention to their autochthonous heritage through the traditional king "born of the earth," Erechtheus/Erichthonius.18 The autoch- thony topos is reiterated with the assertion that the Athenians are "sprung from" (arco) a land that is "unconquered" (arcop0f|Ton) or "never invaded" by foreigners, which we could translate as "unpenetrated" to underline the way military and political domination was often cast in sexual terms in Athe- nian visual and verbal discourse.19 The idealized Athenian community in the strophe derives its special character from its peculiar origin as "children of the gods" and "sprung from the earth." Moreover, this origin seems to translate into a perpetual state of affairs, emphasized by the verbs of con- tinuous action: the Athenians are "feeding themselves ((pepßo|Lievoi) on wis- dom" and "ever stepping (aíeí ßaivovxeq) through the air." The word aiei, which is repeated in exactly the same position in the antistrophe, stresses the description of a perpetual state of affairs that transcends and survives the coming and going of individuals, who are interchangeable and equal to each other, one of the key elements in the ideal of autochthony. Indeed, Loraux notes the importance of the word aiei in institutional decrees to express this permanence within transience: Referring to the rotation of public duties, with every year seeing new magistrates presiding over the political life of the polis, the institutional language of the decrees used an "always" (aiei) in which the perpetual commencement of 17 See the commentaries of Page 1938 and Mastronarde 2002 ad loc. 18 Erechtheus seems to be the name of the adult king, Erichthonius the name most often associated with the earth-born child, although the sources are inconsistent. See Loraux 1993.46-52. 19 Henderson 1991.44-^45, although he does not cite this word.</page><page sequence="10">406 Stephen Nimis the same was expressed, and, with its "magistrates always in office" [xcov ociel ev ap%iļ övxcov] the city confirmed its own identity, preserved above and beyond the diver- sity of individuals.20 Indeed, these first few lines of the strophe show the way autochthony is often implied to be an inherited trait, something that all Athenians share in equally, so that "through the celebration of autochthony, time is annulled in a perpetual recreation of origin."21 The underlying vision here of an abstract and homogeneous community is clearly the version of Athenian identity that is celebrated in the kerameikos in the annual funeral oration, and it is this community of male citizens that is imagined to sustain itself and reproduce itself without the mediation of women. This is, of course, a piece of mythic thinking. It does not represent the day-to-day beliefs of Athenians about their actual births and parentage, but rather it is a discourse that is allowed to operate and circulate under specific circumstances. Females do enter the picture at the very end of the strophe, in the first of two obscure events reported in indirect discourse with aorist tenses. Whereas the preceding lines describe an ongoing state of affairs (the Athe- nians are blessed, they are feeding, they are stepping), there is now a pointed change to a particular event: "where once (ev0oc rcoxe), they say, the nine Muses brought forth ((puxebooci) fair-haired Harmony." These lines contain a puzzling catachresis that has produced a second interpretation of the line: "fair-haired Harmony begat the nine Muses." For the anthropomorphism of Harmonia implicit in the adjective Í;otv0òcv seems to suggest the idea of organic birth for the verb tpuxeuco,22 and it makes more sense that the single female figure Harmony would "beget" nine sisters rather than nine sisters 20 Loraux 2000.17. For the expression "magistrates always in office" (xcov airi év apxp övxcov), see, for example, Pericles' funeral oration (Thuc. 2.37). 21 Loraux 2000.17. See again Pericles' funeral oration (Thuc. 2.36): XTļv yap x«&gt;pav oi aòxoì aid oíkowxeç ôiaôoxfi xcov £7iiyiyvofjivcov péxpi xoûôe èXeuOépav ôi' apetīļv rcapéÔoaav, "For the same people, ever inhabiting this land, by a succession of generations up to the present, handed it down free through their valor." The funeral oration's task is to link the dead in this endless chain of generations, the Athenian aion, which is "transitory and per- manent, exhausting itself in the course of generations, disappearing in its very renewal, and surviving forever through its ever-renewed plenitude" (Loraux 1986.125, citing the definition of aion from Benveniste). 22 As it does a few lines later: maiyvfiTooç xekvoiç époîç cpuxEÚcov, "begetting brothers for my children" (Med. 872-73), and in all other occurrences in Euripides.</page><page sequence="11">Autochthony, Misogyny , and Harmony: Medea 824-45 407 somehow "begetting" an individual "Harmony."23 However, (puxeuco regu- larly refers to a male "begetting" children, as opposed to tíkteiv, "to bear." In fact, all the other sixteen occurrences of the word in Euripides refer to male "begetting,"24 which makes the application of the word either to the Muses or Harmonia a catachresis. Moreover, the Muses are the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, nor were they traditionally born in Athens. In fact, the adjective niepíôocç, usually interpreted as a toponym, "daughters of Pieria," indicates their association with northern Greece. Thus the meta- phorical "bringing forth" of Harmony by the Muses is the more sensible reading, celebrating the power of song to produce literal and figurative harmony. Nevertheless, in a passage that is already focused on peculiar forms of "bringing forth," the grammatical and lexical ambiguity in this line seems designed to blur distinctions of gender and agency, especially since the literal meaning of (puxeuco is to "plant something in the ground." In fact, Gilbert Murray (1912.91-92) interprets the line to mean that the Muses allegorically "planted" Harmony in the soil of Athens. Besides being an abstraction, of course, Harmonia is also a mythi- cal figure, the "fair-haired" daughter of Aphrodite and Ares. Traditionally, she is given in marriage to Cadmus, in a wedding that is celebrated by all the gods (including the Muses25), and she joins Cadmus as the ancestor of the Theban royal house. Her children include Semeie, Ino, and Agave, all mothers who, in different ways, cause, or nearly cause, the death of their own children. In fact, Ino's story is recalled by the chorus of the Medea in lines 1282-90, the only other woman they can think of who laid hands on her own children. But Cadmus's marriage to Harmonia is only one of the two systems of reproduction focused around that famous Phoenician immigrant, for Thebes has an autochthonous myth of its own. According to that story, Cadmus slays a dragon, the child of Ares, and sows its teeth in the ground, whence the Spartoi emerge from the earth, who immediately set about killing each other. Most of our sources for this Theban autoch- thony are Athenian and implicitly contrast it negatively with the "good" 23 This is the argument of Pucci 1980.217 n.40 and Most 1999.20 n.l, rejected by Mastro- narde 2002.309. 24 Suppl. 980, 1092; Iph.

The antistrophe presents a contrast in tenses similar to the one in the strophe, but in reverse order, beginning with an obscure event that is reported in indirect discourse and aorist tenses: "They say (K^fiÇouai) that Aphrodite drew water (àqnxjoapévav) from the river Cephisus and breathed upon (KaT0C7W£uaai) the earth." There does not seem to be any specific mythological incident to which Euripides is referring,28 but the erotic asso- ciations of flowers, fragrances, and hair identify Aphrodite as the goddess of love and sexual desire. Rush Rehm notes a number of specific echoes of Sappho in these few verses.29 In the second half of the antistrophe, marked off clearly by the repetition of the adverb aiei, there is a switch to pres- ent tenses that represent the perpetual activity of Aphrodite: she causes the Erotes, personified agents of erotic desire, to team up with "Wisdom" as allies and coworkers in every kind of excellence (apexri). This unusual evocation of Aphrodite's role in assisting with the successful production of Athenian excellence and community leaves no doubt about her specifically erotic connotations, and this is all the more striking because of the contrast it sets up with the asexual autochthonic community envisioned in the first strophe.30 Moreover, the particular formulation of Erotes teaming up with 26 Zeitlin 1990b. 148-50, Loraux 2000.14, 56-57. On Theban sources, see Mastronarde 1994.17-30 and Vian 1963. See the choruses in Euripides' Phoenissae , especially Phoen. 818-33, where Harmonia and the Spartoi are juxtaposed in an ode that is a companion piece to this ode in the Medea. For discussion of these choral odes, see Arthur 1977. 27 For Thebes as a kind of "anti- Athens" in Greek drama, see Zeitlin 1990b. On Cadmus as a barbarian in Euripides, see Saïd 2002.87-100. The two ideas are connected in Morris 1992.378-83. 28 I therefore cannot agree with Pucci 1980.217 when he says that "already" the association of Aphrodite and the Muses with Athens was traditional, citing as evidence only the chorus for Oedipus at Colonus , a play produced many years after Medea. Shapiro 1998.142 notes an example of Aphrodite at the scene of the birth of Erichthonius on a late fifth-century calyx-krater. 29 Rehm 1989.87. Pucci 1980.117, on the contrary, sees Aphrodite as standing for art and poetry, rather than for the sexual drive. 30 Pucci 1980.122-25; Rehm 2002.264: "The audience ... is carried upstream in a poetic river, finding at its source an idealized and poetically 'feminized' Athens."</page><page sequence="13">Autochthony, Misogyny ; and Harmony: Medea 824-45 409 Wisdom is itself a Utopian formulation of one of the major conflicts of the play, that between reason and passion.31 Indeed, in the second stasimon, the destructive force of Aphrodite herself and her Erotes had been empha- sized (627-35): Loves (epcoieç) that come to us in excess bring no good name (euSo^iav) or goodness (àpexav) to men. If Aphrodite comes in moderation, no other goddess brings such happiness. Never, O goddess, may you smear with desire one of your ineluctable arrows and let it fly against my heart from your golden bow! The river god Cephisus also plays a role in Athenian myths of origins, since traditionally he is the source of a kind of "feminine autoch- thony" as the sole parent of Praxithea, the wife of Erechtheus.32 Her story is most famously presented in Euripides' fragmentary Erechtheus , where her sacrifice of her daughter helps to "restore the city's foundations" (é^avcópGcoaaç ßa0pa, frag. 370.95) after a foreign invasion, and she sub- sequently becomes Athena's first priestess.33 Although sources about her are scant, Praxithea seems to be the motherless daughter of the river god. The expression used to describe how Aphrodite "drew" water from the river Cephisus has a vaguely sexual overtone to it, which one translator augments by rendering the phrase as she "filled her pail." This strikes me as a subtle parallel to the numerous euphemisms for masculine penetra- tion, chief among which are the terms for "plowing" or "sowing" a field.34 31 Newman 2001.65 notes the following instances in the tragedy: 190, 285, 295ff., 320, 409, 485, 580, 600, 1225. See Foley 2001.246-57. 32 On Praxithea and "feminine autochthony," see Sissa and Detienne 2000.210-22. Loraux 1993.248-49 disputes the possibility of "feminine autochthony," just as she claims there is no such things as a female Athenian; but if there was ever an exception to prove the rule, the parthenogenetically produced daughter of Cephisus would be it. Later accounts (Apollodorus 3.15.1) make Praxithea the granddaughter of Cephisus. 33 For Praxithea in Euripides, see Harder 1993.336-42, Collard et al. 1995.148-94. Praxithea is twice called the daughter of Cephisus in Lycurgus (partially cited below) and in the restored reading of line 63 of frag. 370 (Collard et al. 1995.191). She is also the mother of the Kreousa of Euripides' Ion (cf. Ion 277-80). 34 I can find no specifically erotic use of &lt;x&lt;p'&gt;aao), which is used primarily of drawing liq- uid from a larger vessel with a smaller one (LSJ s.v.), but duBois notes that an analogical</page><page sequence="14">410 Stephen Nimis It seems that Aphrodite is being delicately evoked as a maternal figure in the production of Praxithea by "receiving" the "waters" of Cephisus. Such an oblique participation in procreation would find a parallel in the unusual story in which Hephaestus, Athena, and Ge each contribute to the engender- ing of Erichthonius/Erechtheus. In that story, Hephaestus pursues Athena unsuccessfully, but his premature ejaculation lands on the thigh of Athena, who then brushes it off onto the earth. Erichthonius/Erechtheus, the earth- born hero, is thus the "offspring" of Athena, Hephaestus, and Ge.35 In the antistrophe, we can observe a parallel sequence, in which Aphrodite "drew from" the river Cephisus and then "breathed upon the land" (koctoc7W£')G(xi). The verb KocTocTweúco can refer to divine inspiration,36 and in this context, could connote some oblique form of insemination. The exact repetition of the word %copccç in the antistrophe thus serves to make a parallel between the autochthony of Athenian males in the first strophe and this "reproduc- tive event" of Aphrodite in the second, while simultaneously drawing a contrast. For the first instance of %cópocç is an example of what we could call a "genitive of origin" with the preposition arcó, while the second is the direct object of KaTaKveuco,37 setting up a contrast in agency. The "children of Erechtheus" are spontaneously "of the earth" and "feeding themselves" on wisdom in the first strophe, but in the second, Aphrodite breathed "on the land" and "sends" the Erotes to sit with Wisdom.38 Although Praxithea is not named in the ode, her presence is evoked indirectly by the mention of her parallel in Theban myth: Harmonia. Just system links ceramic vessels, earth, and women's bodies, since "all are seen as hiding, containing, producing, and giving up substances that permit the continuation of human existence" (duBois 1988.49). Obscene references to household bowls and implements are catalogued by Henderson 1991.142-44, although no exact parallel in comedy can be found to this passage (not surprisingly). 35 Loraux 1993.57-64. The multiplication of parthenogenetically born agents: Hephaestus, Athena, Ge, Aphrodite, perhaps helps to evoke the "motherless" Praxithea. 36 As in Aeschylus Ag. 105. Cf. Eur. Rh. 387. It is used in an erotic context in Aristophanes Lys. 552. Another extraordinary parallel in Euripides' Phoenissae occurs when Ares, who is called mp(X|j.o')aoę (785), is said "to inspire the Argive army with a lust for Theban blood" (789-90: ax parò v 'Apyeíwv ájiutveúaaç aipaxi 0r|ßa&lt;;), and a few lines later (794-95): "inspiring the Argives against the race of the Spartoi" ('Apyeíoiç £7U7iveiL&gt;o(xç Impxœv yévvav). 37 Actually, the manuscripts have xó&gt;pav in line 837 and xcopaç is a restoration. See Mastro- narde 2002.310. 38 The middle participle describing Aphrodite in the antistrophe as "helping herself' to the water of Cephisus (àípuaaapivav) also contrasts with the middle participle describing the Athenians (pepßopevoi ("feeding themselves" on wisdom) in the strophe.</page><page sequence="15">Autochthony, Misogyny , and Harmony: Medea 824^15 411 as Harmonia is the wife of the Theban founder Cadmus, Praxithea, as the wife of Erechtheus, is a key figure in one of the two reproduction systems that center around that mythical ancestor of the Athenians. In the context of Euripides' play, Praxithea makes a good contrast to the figure of Medea, for she is famous for being a "good Athenian mother," willing to sacrifice her female children for the good of the male state, an episode in Athenian history that is dramatized in Euripides' fragmentary Erechtheus. Praxithea's speech from that play is quoted at length by Lycurgus in the fourth cen- tury to illustrate how a good wife puts the welfare of the state ahead of the welfare of her own children (Lyc. Against Leocrates 98-101, trans. J. O. Burtt, Loeb ed. 1954): You will find in [the speech of Praxithea from Euripides' Erechtheus ] a greatness of spirit and a nobility worthy of Athens and of a daughter of Cephisus: "I shall give my child to die for many reasons: first, there is no state I count more worthy to accept my gift than Athens, peopled by no alien race. For we are of this soil (a')TÓ%0ov£ç 8' ëcpujiev), while other towns, formed as by hazard in a game of draughts, take their inhabitants from diverse parts . . . And secondly, it is that we may guard our country and the altars of the gods that we bear children at all. There is one name for this whole city, but many inhabit it. How can I destroy all these, when I can give one girl to die for all?" On these verses, gentlemen, your fathers were brought up. All women are by nature fond of children, but this one Euripides portrayed as loving her country more than her offspring. Giulia Sissa and Marcel Detienne (2000.215-19) call Praxithea an "Anti- Clytemnestra"; but Euripides' Medea is also an appropriate inverse of this defender of male values. It may be objected that the allusion to Praxithea here is so subtle as to be non-existent, but such an elision of female partici- pation in the procreation of the Athenian citizenry is not inconsistent with the discourse of autochthony that permeates this ode. So, too, in Pericles' funeral oration, the greatest glory for women is not to be spoken of for good or bad (Thuc. 2.45).</page><page sequence="16">412 Stephen Nimis Also noteworthy is the Utopian state of affairs in Athens produced by the continuous erotic activity of Aphrodite (ercißocÄAopivav, rcéprceiv). These verbs of continuous action, reinforced by the significant repetition of aiei, correspond to the present tense verbs of the strophe. But they are also a contrast to the metaphorical production of "harmony" at the end of that strophe. Whereas there the multiple Muses produced (once) the single Har- monia, here Aphrodite continuously produces a specifically heterogeneous and multiple unity: she sends the plural Erotes to be "partners" (Tcapébpouç) and "co-workers" (^Dvepycroç) with Wisdom. In contrast to the first strophe, the ideal community here is not homogenous but a heterogeneous multiplic- ity, presided over by the queen of heterosexuality. In the subsequent two stanzas, the chorus wonders: "How could such a city receive a murderess?" Since it is known by the Athenian audi- ence that Aegeus does welcome Medea and that she is destined to pose a threat to his children as well, there is a tendency to see the question of the chorus as ironic.39 But Athens was proud of her tradition of allowing sup- pliants and foreigners to have a place in the city, even though there were severe restrictions on their participation in the city's life. This policy regularly appears in the funeral orations alongside the claims to autochthony,40 and it is also the subject of a number of tragedies, such as Euripides' Suppliants and Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus. But this provision for foreigners is analogous to the role of Athenian wives, who are also in a sense "outsiders" who have an essential, albeit restricted, role "inside." The chorus' question is therefore not necessarily ironic but paradoxical. Just as Athenians must allow women into their city in order to reproduce the community - despite the dangers of female subjectivity - so also Athenians must allow outsid- ers a limited role in their city in order for it to be the vital city that it is, despite the dangers particular aliens might pose.41 Medea, the problematic "wife" who is also a foreigner in the strict sense, embodies all the danger- ous necessities and necessary dangers associated with "otherness." 39 McDermott 1989.102-06, Sfyroeras 1994-95, Rehm 1994.106, Mastronarde 2002.305, Allan 2002.77. 40 In Pericles' funeral oration (Thuc. 2.39), for example, Athenian openness is contrasted to the Spartan tradition of expulsion of foreigners ( xenelasia ). See Loraux 1986.67-69, Saxonhouse 1992.88, Strauss 1994, Loraux 2000.128-34, Patterson 2007.163. Also see Zeitlin 1990b. 148 on the "closed" character of Thebes, marked by incest and internecine conflict. 41 Lueck's emendation of the problematic pei' âXfaov to péxauAov (= péxoiKoç) in line 850 helps draw the parallel between wives and foreigners. For discussion of this textual prob- lem, see Most 1999 and Mastronarde 2002.311.</page><page sequence="17">Autochthony, Misogyny ; and Harmony: Medea 824-45 413 The Medea is remarkable in the way various oppositions become famously blurred in it: male and female, mortal and divine, oikos and polis , foreign and native, past and contemporary, Corinth and Athens.42 One effect of this blurring is the uncanny sensation that things are not as they seem - a kind of cognitive dissonance. Another effect of this blurring can be a sense that, after all, these contradictions and oppositions can be mediated and pal- liated. Everything in the first two stanzas of the third stasimon seems to be aimed at producing two contrasting and contradictory versions of the repro- duction of the Athenian community - one homogeneous, male, autochtho- nous, without any kind of "invasion"; the other heterogeneous and effected by the participation of women - while at the same time insisting that they are somehow both just the one Athens. It is a classic case of mythic think- ing: Athens is both homogeneous and heterogeneous, simultaneously "born from one and born from two."43 Part of what makes this illusion possible and plausible in the context of the Medea is the harmonizing power of song, invoked in the words of the chorus at the end of the first strophe, but, equally importantly, enacted by the chorus in their physical presence and perform- ance. This performance, ostensibly by Corinthian women, but in reality by cross-dressing Athenian boys or men, must have had a powerful effect on the males in the audience who could see and hear in their performance an enactment of a communal ideal. Athens has been called the "choral state" (Kowalzig 2004), and a number of scholars have suggested ways in which the tragic chorus reflects or refracts some aspect of the Athenian civic com- munity.44 As such, their physical presence and performance serve to enact the very Utopian vision the words they sing articulate. The idea that song has some sort of a transforming function is a theme that is sounded several times in the play. It comes up first, nega- tively, in the Nurse's complaint that singers have failed to produce songs that heal (195-200): "No man has found a way to allay hated grief by music and the minstrel's varied strain, whence arise slaughters and fell strokes of fate to overthrow the homes of men. And yet this were surely a gain, to heal men's wounds by music's spell." Donald Mastronarde notes 42 Newman 2001, Boedeker 1997, Sfyroeras 1994-95. 43 The phrase is borrowed from the structural analysis of Theban autochthony in Lévi-Strauss 1967.216. For a structuralist reading of Athenian autochthony, see Peradotto 1977. 44 Vernant and Vidal-Naquet 1988.29-48, Longo 1990, Winkler 1990, Bacon 1994-95, Nagy 1994-95, Calarne 1994-95, Henrichs 1994-95, Gould 1996, Goldhill 1996, Segal 1997, Calarne 1999, Mastronarde 1999.</page><page sequence="18">414 Stephen Nimis that these words have a "metatheatrical or metapoetic thrust," since tragedy itself "is a musical performance conducted amid festivities, and audience enjoyment is one of its effects and goals."45 This "metapoetic" call for a new and better song is reprised in the most famous choral ode of the play, the first stasimon (410-45): Backward to their sources flow the streams of holy rivers, and the order of all things is reversed: men's thoughts have become deceitful and their oaths by the gods do not hold fast. The common talk will so alter that women's ways will enjoy good repute. Honor is coming to the female sex (yuvaiiceícp yévva): no more will women be maligned by slanderous rumor. The poetry of ancient bards will cease to hymn our faithlessness. Phoebus lord of song never endowed our minds with the glorious strains of the lyre. Else I could have sounded a hymn in reply to the male sex (àpoévcov yévva). The long expanse of time can say many things of men's lot as well as of women's. This extraordinary counterclaim to the slanders against women is, accord- ing to Loraux (1993.107), the first instance of the expression "male genos ." Indeed, the passage is exceptional in intimating a symmetry between men and women, and it is tempting to see in this ode, shorn of its context, a "proto-feminist" Euripides reviling his male audience for their chauvinism, but this is perhaps wishful thinking.46 There is a parallel passage in the third stasimon of Euripides' Ion where the theme of autochthony is also sounded, 45 Mastronarde 2002.201-02. Cf. Segal 1996.42, Pucci 1977. 46 For a proto-feminist Euripides, see Castellani 1989, March 1990. Rabinowitz 1993, among others, argues against such a position for the author.</page><page sequence="19">Autochthony, Misogyny, and Harmony: Medea 824-45 415 so the opposition between the two "races" in the Medea should perhaps be seen in this context.47 Loraux argues that there is, strictly speaking, no such thing as a "female Athenian," a claim that is based on her strong reading of the discourse of autochthony (1993.111-23). This paradoxical claim, however, gives an incomplete idea of the actual position of women in Periclean Athens.48 Autoch- thony is itself a divided and incoherent ideology, insisting on the cohesion of a community by insisting on its difference from the "other." But insofar as the male citizenry of the sovereign politeia is also part of the larger entity of Athens, its "other" (women) is also part of the "same": the "same" to which all non- Athenians are contrasted. Thus one of the consequences of the discourse of autochthony is that women, who are notoriously heterogeneous and variable, acquire a parallel homogeneity of their own over against male homogeneity. If the unity of the female genos is often used against them in a broad damna- tion of the "whole tribe of women,"49 there is still a sense in which that unity reflects the larger and more heterogeneous tribe of all Athenians celebrated in the Panathenaic festival. Misogyny and harmony are both consequences of the claim of autochthony, springing from the same Athenian soil. Between the sympathetic Medea of the first part of the play, aligned as she is there with women as a whole, and the increasingly savage Medea of the second half, in every way becoming more and more alien to the values of Athenian males, Euripides has placed a striking celebration of a Utopian harmony. It echoes both the Utopian myths of the pan- Athenian Acropolis as well as the ideals of the more narrowly male discourse found in the kerameikos but makes use of the special resources of tragedy to make provision for both.50 Miami University nimissa @ muohio. edu 47 Ion 1090-99: "You who sing in discordant hymns of our beds and of the unsanctioned, unholy loves of Cypris, see how much we surpass in reverence the unrighteous race of men (cxpoxov ccvÔpéov). Let a counter-song (TtaAipcpocpoç) ring out against men, harshly indicting their loves." 48 See Patterson 2007 for a broader interpretation of women's "sharing" in the city of Athens. 49 See the discussion of Hesiod and Semonides in Loraux 1993.72-110. For women as a "discordant harmony," see the discussion at Zeitlin 1996.236-44 of the phrase dry stropos harmonia at Eur. Hippolytus 161. 50 Many thanks to the anonymous referees and to Peter Rose and Nancy Rabinowitz, who read an earlier version of this paper and made many useful suggestions.
