<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> CHAPTER FOUR How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in  Southeast Asia? At the rhetorical level, India’s commitment to engagement with South- east Asia is impressive. On the ground, however, intentions generally  have not been translated into concrete reality. As one Southeast Asian  ambassador put it, “There is no substance behind the rhetoric, and  little prospect of substance materializing in the foreseeable future.”1  One of the recurring themes of this report is the disparity between  India’s strategic interests in Southeast Asia, and the nation’s slow pace  in pursuing these interests. From a “glass half-full” standpoint, India  is more deeply engaged than at any time in its modern history, and the  rate of involvement has been increasing by almost every metric since  the announcement of the Look East policy in 1992. From a “glass half- empty” standpoint, however, the developments of the past two decades  are only impressive when compared with the nearly static relationships  of the Cold War era. In the view of many observers inside Southeast  Asia itself, India is shuffling forward at a stately elephantine pace, with  none of the speed or agility of an “Asian Tiger.” While India prefers to  focus on a narrative of “Look at how far we’ve come,” many interlocu- tors in the region see the more important storyline as “Look at how far  we have yet to go.” When Prime Minister Rao unveiled the Look East policy, South- east Asian leaders warmly welcomed the development. Singapore’s  founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, encouraged ASEAN to admit  India as a dialogue partner and described traditional Indian cultural  1 Interview with from Southeast Asian ambassador, Washington, D.C., March 1, 2013. 79 </page> <page sequence="2"> 80    Look East, Cross Black Waters: India’s Interest in Southeast Asia values as akin to the Confucian values that he saw as the glue binding  much of Asia together.2 In 1996, at the keynote address to the seventh  Southeast Asian Forum, Malaysia’s foreign minister (and future prime  minister) Abdullah Badawi suggested that India might be admitted as  a full member of ASEAN “very soon.”3 A quarter century (and five prime ministers) after the introduction  of the Look East policy, India is no closer to membership in ASEAN.  The Singapore-based scholar Long Shi Ruey Joey notes that while Delhi  continues to seek a role in the region, “Its inward-looking policies,  and the fixation with Kashmir and Pakistan .  .  . have circumscribed  India’s influence in Southeast Asia.”4 In interviews conducted for this  report in Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, and Myanmar, the opinion  of Southeast Asian sources was nearly universal: Indian engagement  was welcomed, but viewed as disappointingly modest. This trend was  widely seen as having become more pronounced in recent years (that is,  during the second term of Prime Minister Singh, from 2009 to 2014),  although the prevailing sentiment was that India had not decelerated  so much as failed to accelerate at a pace appropriate to its stated goals. Kishore Mahbubani, whose long tenure in Singapore’s foreign  service included a term as president of the UN Security Council, said,  “India has been talking a good game, but hasn’t actually followed  through.”5 A scholar based in Southeast Asia admitted, “I don’t see a  clear Indian strategy, other than the amorphous seeking of a ‘seat at the  table.’”6 An Asian diplomat based in Myanmar expressed disappoint- 2 Encouraging ASEAN to accept India as dialogue partner: Saint-Mezard, 2006, pp. 221– 222; Indian values as akin to Confucian values: Saint-Mezard, 2006, p. 272. 3 Abdullah Badawi, unpublished remarks at address delivered on March 5, 1996.

This chapter examines India’s bilateral relationships in the  region to provide a more granular look at one of the report’s main find- ings: While India seeks closer ties with Southeast Asia in all of the  areas discussed in Chapter Three, progress in achieving this goal has  proceeded only slowly.  The nations of Southeast Asia may be considered as falling into  three tiers in their engagement with India. The first-tier nations are  of primary importance, each for different reasons: Singapore is India’s  closest regional partner across a full security, economic, and political  Figure 4.1 India’s Engagement with Southeast Asia at a Glance Diplomacy, Security HA/DR, China  Nation Connectivity Trade Energy Institutions Cooperation Development Balancer Singapore Vietnam Myanmar Thailand Malaysia Indonesia Philippines Brunei Cambodia Laos NOTE: This chart portrays the analytical findings discussed in this report in a single image.

The second-tier nations, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, are  those with which India enjoys positive and expanding economic and  security relationships. The ordering of these three relationships on the  basis of security ties is roughly the inverse of an ordering on economic  ones: India has the most trade with Indonesia and the least with Thai- land, but the reverse is true in military exchanges, exercises, and other  security metrics; Malaysia is in the middle by both economic and secu- rity measurements. The third-tier nations, Philippines, Brunei, Cambodia, and Laos,  are those with which India has relatively modest engagement on all fronts.  India has no particular points of conflict with any of these states, but  they do not figure prominently in Indian security or strategic planning. Singapore The city-state of Singapore represents India’s most mature and well- rounded security partnership in Southeast Asia—indeed, one of its  deepest security relationships anywhere (see Figure 4.2). Singapore is  the only nation that routinely trains its own armed forces on Indian  soil. India’s relationship with Singapore, moreover, stretches into every  facet of engagement. The two nations are significant trading and invest- ment partners, and they generally see eye-to-eye on diplomatic issues.  Singapore is the home of the region’s third-largest Indian diaspora,  and largely for that reason is a major destination for Indian tourists.8  8 Malaysia’s diaspora population is much larger than Singapore’s (more than 2 million, versus  700,000), but represents a smaller percentage of society (7.2 percent versus 13 percent). Myan- mar has perhaps 2 million persons of Indian origin, but ties between this community and its  Indian relatives are largely cut off and relatively few Indians travel to Myanmar for any reason  (see Figures 3.1 and 6.4 for more detail). </page> <page sequence="5"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    83 Figure 4.2 Summary of India’s Engagement with Singapore Diplomacy, Security HA/DR, China  Nation Connectivity Trade Energy Institutions Cooperation Development Balancer Singapore NOTE: Color coding is on a spectrum where red indicates a low level of engagement; yellow, moderate  engagement; and dark green, a significant level of engagement. RAND RR1021-4.2 Singapore’s strategic ties to India predate independence: As part of the  Strait Settlements, Singapore was placed under British administrators  in India from 1826 until 1867, and retained close links to India during  the British colonial period.  In brief: Singapore is India’s strongest and most straightforwardly  positive relationship in Southeast Asia.  Connectivity Singapore sits astride the Strait of Malacca, a natural bottleneck for mari- time trade between India and East Asia. A large portion of India’s mari- time trade, valued at about $800 billion annually, transits the Strait.9  India has better air connectivity with Singapore than with  any other nation in Southeast Asia. The city-state has direct flights  to at least four Indian cities—Mumbai, New Delhi, Kolkata, and  Chennai—at the time of writing, more than any other nation in South- east Asia. Sea connectivity is robust, with the ports of Chennai and  Kolkata handling the largest volume of cargo. Trade Economic ties between India and Singapore have expanded at a rapid  pace since the early 1990s. Although trade has declined by nearly one- third from its high point in 2011 (see Figure 4.3), Singapore remains  India’s largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN and an essen- tial offshore logistics and financial hub for many Indian corporations.

From 2007 to 2011, bilateral trade  almost doubled, from $15.85 billion to $28.19 billion. (Amitendu Palit, “India-Singapore  Trade Relations,” Singapore: Institute of South Asian Studies, ISAS Working Paper No. 46,  June 16, 2008; United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics database, undated.) According  to FICCI, Singapore is the second-largest source of FDI into India, with investments inflows  of $15.9 billion from 2000 to 2011, or 10 percent of the total FDI inflow.

Merchandise  trade between India and Singapore doubled in the five-year period fol- lowing the signing of the agreement.13 Energy Since India is a net exporter of petroleum products to Singapore, the  city-state helps advance India’s energy goals by providing a base of  financial and technical operations for potential resource development  in sites such as the South China Sea, Malaysia, and Indonesia. Institutions/Diplomacy Singaporean-Indian relations were somewhat strained during the Cold  War, but have improved rapidly since. Singapore played a leading role  in ensuring India’s inclusion in ASEAN dialogue mechanisms, includ- ing annual ASEAN-India summits, the ASEAN Regional Forum, the  East Asia Summit and the APEC Working Groups.14 It is likely that India’s diplomatic relationship with Singapore will  continue to grow stronger under the Modi administration. During his  tenure as chief minister of Gujarat, Modi established a cordial relation- ship with Singapore’s then–Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong; a domes- tically oriented politician with relatively little international experience,  Modi forged a closer personal bond with Goh than with perhaps any  other foreign leader.

The two countries signed a Defense  Cooperation Agreement in 2003, providing for an annual Defense  Policy Dialogue to discuss security cooperation and strategic develop- ments of mutual concern.16 Both countries have a common interest in maintaining the security  of the regional sea lines of communication. Since 1994, the two coun- tries have conducted annual naval training exercises, the Singapore- India Maritime Bilateral Exercise. The naval exercise alternates each  year in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, and has expanded  from an anti-submarine warfare exercise to more complex simulations  and deployment of major surface vessels. The Singaporean and Indian  armies also conduct an annual armor exercise (Bold Kurukshetra), and  artillery exercise (Agni Warrior), both of them on Indian soil.17  Under a 2007 agreement, Republic of Singapore Air Force person- nel train at the Kalaikunda Indian Air Force Base in West Bengal, and  station Singaporean military aircraft there.

In addition, the Indian Navy trains Singaporean  submarine crews,20 India provides ranges for Singapore’s artillery,21 and  Singapore’s army trains at the brigade level on Indian soil.22  Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief Singapore has not been a recipient of HA/DR assistance from India,  but it has served as a staging area for international HA/DR efforts in  which India took part. The most noteworthy recent instance of this  was during the 2004 Asian tsunami, in which Singapore served as a  vital staging area for relief efforts. Balancer for China Although its population is predominantly ethnic Chinese, the city- state has never fallen under China’s political dominance as a result of  its pro-American security orientation. This does not imply antagonism:  Between 2008 and 2013, China had four fleet visits to Singapore, and  two combined military exercises.23 Singapore—like India—is proud  of its status as a multiethnic and multilinguistic state.

Lee is widely (if perhaps apocryphally) believed to have  crafted the metaphor of ASEAN as a jet airplane, needing an Indian  wing to balance its Chinese one to ensure a safe flight.26 Vietnam In the view of at least one former top-level Indian policymaker, Viet- nam is the single most important Southeast Asian nation for India’s  security interests.27 Vietnam is India’s longest-running security part- ner of substance, and this relationship remains robust (see Figure 4.4).

Many  Indian sources interviewed for this project articulated the belief that the metaphor was  crafted by Lee Kuan Yew. There does not, however, appear to be a well-documented instance  of Lee having articulated this metaphor in public. It appears to have been first expressed in  public by Lee’s successor, Goh Chok Tong. There are several formulations, but the earliest  appears to be: “The ASEAN jumbo jet has one wing in the making in the East, through  agreements with China and Japan. India’s proposal provides the second wing. With this,  we can take off.” Cited in Lee Hoong Chua, “India Makes Trade Offer to ASEAN,” Straits  Times, November 6, 2002. 27 This was a minority opinion: The two states cited by this former policymaker as the  second- and third-ranked countries (Singapore and Indonesia) were more commonly ranked  above Vietnam. Among both military and civilians interviewed, Myanmar was described as  belonging to a different category altogether: a field of opportunity, rather than an established  partner nation. </page> <page sequence="11"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    89 platforms, and India’s future role in the Southeast Asian security struc- ture may rest largely on a model similar to its relationship with Viet- nam: India’s unique capabilities to operate, repair, and perhaps manu- facture military hardware compatible with Soviet or Russian models.28 India has strong historical connections to the southern part of  Vietnam, but weaker cultural links to the northern parts of the coun- try that traditionally fell under China’s sphere of influence. From the  7th century into the 19th century, the Kingdom of Champa controlled  such sites as modern Hue, My Son, Da Nang, Hoi An, and Cam Ranh.  This civilization, however, was ethnically, linguistically, and religiously  distinct from the Vietnamese mainstream. It was administered by the  ancestors of the modern-day Cham, a tiny group quite separate from  the majority Kinh.29 When the Champa Kingdom fell to the Viet- namese emperor Minh Mang in 1832, what remained of Indian cul- tural linkage was severed. The modern relationship is based on Cold  War politics and post–Cold War realpolitik more than on longstanding  bonds of culture.

Interview  with retired Indian naval flag officer and MoD official, 2013. 29 Today, the Cham comprise less than 0.2 percent of Vietnam’s population (162,000 out of  90 million), and are predominantly Hindu. In Cambodia, the Cham form about 1.5 percent  of the population (217,000 out of 14 million), and are predominantly Muslim. The Cham  in modern Vietnam speak a language in the Malayo-Polynesian family that has virtually no  connection to Vietnamese. The Kinh, who comprise 85 percent of the population of Viet- nam, are traditionally Buddhist, with a significant Christian minority. </page> <page sequence="12"> 90    Look East, Cross Black Waters: India’s Interest in Southeast Asia Connectivity The endpoints of India’s dual land-based connectivity plans to South- east Asia lie in Vietnam. One is a proposed superhighway stretching  from Kolkata to Ho Chi Minh City,30 the other a railway extend- ing from New Delhi to Hanoi.31 Both projects have a beginning and  an end—the existing road and rail networks in India and Vietnam,  respectively—but lack a middle: The infrastructure in Myanmar  remains virtually unbuilt. Trade Straining against domestic restraints that include limited human  capacity, poor infrastructure, and bureaucratic hurdles, Indian out- sourcing and information technology firms have started to shift some  operations to Vietnam in search of educated, low-cost labor. This shift,  however, remains a work in progress: Trade linkages were not a signifi- cant part of the relationship until Vietnam’s introduction of the eco- nomic liberalization policy known as doi moi (renovation) in 1986, and  over the past 15 years have grown modestly from a negligible baseline  (see Figure 4.5). Vietnam’s economic growth has been hugely trade- dependent since the introduction of doi moi, with exports account- ing for approximately two-thirds of the Vietnamese GDP.32 India and  Vietnam recognized each other as equal World Trade Organization  trading partners in 2009,33 and both countries are part of the 2010  ASEAN-India Free Trade Agreement.34  30 Nelson, 2012. 31 “New Delhi-Hanoi Rail Link Likely: PM,” Economic Times, September 4, 2003.  32 Globaltrade.net, International Trade in Vietnam, undated.

Indian Prime Min- ister Nehru was the first head of government to visit Hanoi, barely a  week after the Viet Minh took over from the French in 1954. India  supported the Hanoi government during the Vietnam War, souring  relations with the United States. Both countries fought border wars  with China: India in 1962 (when Vietnam sided with its then-patron  in Beijing) and Vietnam in 1979 (when India, deciding not to hold a  grudge, sided with Vietnam). Throughout the Cold War period, both  India and Vietnam maintained close ties with the Soviet Union—and  their shared reliance on Warsaw Pact military hardware remains a  powerful bond two decades after the dissolution of the USSR.  37 Interview with retired Indian diplomat who served as chief of mission in mainland South- east Asia, 2013. 38 Harsh V.

When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and displaced the  genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, the action was fiercely opposed by  the United States, China, and ASEAN. India’s diplomatic support for  Vietnam caused friction with most other Southeast Asian states for  over a decade. For its part, Vietnam was one of the only countries in  the world to support India’s 1998 nuclear tests.40 Vietnam was an early  supporter of India’s candidacy for a permanent seat at the UN Security  Council, advocated for India’s inclusion in the East Asia Summit in  2005, and for a time helped block Pakistan’s inclusion in the ASEAN  Regional Forum.41 India supported Vietnam’s accession to the World  Trade Organization, and helped Vietnam secure a temporary seat in  the UN Security Council in 2007.42  Security Cooperation Defense cooperation between India and Vietnam long predates India’s  Look East policy and was based on a congruent geopolitical outlook  during the Cold War. Indian military delegations visited Vietnam after  the Sino-Vietnam War of 1979 to study how Vietnamese border troops  defeated attacks by China’s regular army formations.

The fact that both countries use similar Soviet and Russian mili- tary equipment has allowed India to undertake servicing and mainte- nance of Vietnam’s military hardware (especially MiG21s) and naval  ports. India also supplies spare parts to Vietnam’s warships, subma- rines, and missile boats. In September 2011, India agreed to provide  intensive training in submarine operations to Vietnam: Vietnam has  ordered six Kilo-class submarines from Russia, and India has been  operating Kilo-class submarines since 1986. In July 2013, India fur- ther offered Vietnam a $100 million credit line to purchase military  equipment, the first such offer by India to a country outside India’s tra- ditional sphere of influence.44 There have been media reports of mutual  interest in a sale to Vietnam of the supersonic Brahmos cruise missiles,  manufactured by an Indian-Russian joint venture.45 Vietnam, in turn, agreed to provide berthing facilities to Indian  naval ships at Nha Trang.

Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief India’s HA/DR cooperation with Vietnam has been extremely lim- ited to date. During 2013’s Typhoon Haiyan, however, India offered  disaster assistance to Vietnam, while providing HA/DR to the hard-hit  Philippines.47 Balancer for China Strategically placed on the eastern fringe of Southeast Asia with a  3,260-kilometer coastline, stretching along almost the entire length  of the South China Sea, Vietnam is regarded by India as a barrier to  the expansion of Chinese influence. Much as China has attempted to  constrain India by partnering with Pakistan, India has sought to bal- ance China by bolstering defense cooperation with Vietnam.48 Hanoi,  for its part, seeks Indian support for its wide-ranging maritime dis- putes with China; the most significant of these are in the South China  Sea (including the Spratly and Paracel Islands), the maritime boundary  along Vietnam’s coastline, territories north of Borneo, and other areas  within the “Nine-Dash Line.”49 Vietnam has been eager to move from  a largely military relationship to a broader engagement with India.50 It  46 Interview with retired Indian naval flag officer and MoD official, 2013. 47 “India to Send Relief to Super Typhoon-Hit Philippines,” Times of India, November 13,  2013.  48 Rehman, 2009a.  49 The “Nine-Dash Line” refers to the territory, demarcated by nine dashes on Chinese maps  dating to 1947, encompassing the 3.5 million square kilometers in the South China Sea and  surrounding waters that are claimed by China.

Despite friction in the relationship, China  provided more than one-fifth of Vietnam’s FDI inflow in 2010, and has  had an average of one fleet visit annually between 2008–2013.51 Myanmar/Burma India’s engagement with Myanmar is perhaps the clearest example of  a core theme of this report: the gap between India’s own perceptions  of its relationship with Southeast Asia and the perceptions of South- east Asian players themselves (see Figure 4.6). From India’s perspective,  the relationship with Myanmar is a vital national interest, founded on  millennia-old ties of culture and history, bolstered by political moves  of the past two decades, and growing at an impressive rate. From the  perspective of Myanmar, however, India has been long on rhetoric but  short on delivery, has repeatedly failed to take advantage of opportu- nities for engagement, is constantly being shown up by China, the  United States, and other players, and doesn’t really seem interested in  changing the dynamic. From the standpoint of the United States, this  gap between India’s perception of its engagement and ground reali- ties presents an opportunity: Given the harmony between Indian and  American goals vis-à-vis Myanmar, U.S. policymakers can advance  their own strategic interests by persuading and enabling India to  increase its bilateral engagement there.

Indian policymakers often speak of Myanmar as a “near-neighbor,”  sometimes in terms similar to those used for South Asian states that  India considers to fall within its sphere of influence.53 Myanmar repre- sents great opportunity for India: All hopes of land connectivity run  through Myanmar, and after long seclusion the country is finally open  for engagement. In the view of Indian policymakers interviewed, Myanmar is  India’s most significant success story in Southeast Asia. India has sup- ported the democracy movement since the late 1980s, and reached out  to the military junta while virtually all Western nations shunned it and  helped usher in the Saffron Revolution. “We were ahead of the curve,”  one former top-level Indian official said proudly.54 Several sources men- tioned the fact that Aung San Suu Kyi’s mother Khin Kyi served as  ambassador to India, and that in her girlhood, the future Burmese  leader was friends with the teen-age Rajiv Gandhi. This narrative, however, is not the one heard in Myanmar. In  interviews conducted for this report, both Burmese citizens and foreign  observers told a narrative that was almost precisely the opposite: India  alienated the military junta by supporting Aung San Suu Kyi for nearly  52 Singapore and Malaysia, then known as the Straits Settlement, were administered from  Calcutta during the later East India Company years and for the first years after transfer of  administration to the Crown following the 1857 Revolt (i.e., administered from Calcutta  1826–1867), but were not formally part of the Indian Raj.

To date, the border is as far as  they have gotten. The Kolkata-to-Ho Chi Minh City highway reaches  only as far as the town of Moreh in the Indian state of Manipur. The  Delhi-to-Hanoi railway now terminates at Dimapur in the Indian state  of Nagaland. The most significant connectivity project India is cur- rently undertaking is the development of the port of Sittwe in Myan- mar’s Rakhine State, and that is proceeding far more slowly than a  rival Chinese port project slightly to the south at Kyaukphyu. Another  prospective Indian infrastructure project is the proposed $120 mil- lion Kaladan Multi-Modal Project, involving the development of the  Kaladan River (in Chin State, bordering on India and Bangladesh) as  a bilateral highway. (For a more extensive discussion of India’s connec- tivity ambitions in Myanmar, see Chapter Three.) India’s air connectivity to Myanmar remains woefully underde- veloped. As of January 2013, India’s national carrier ranked only 20th  in weekly capacity to Yangon airport, with a single weekly flight to  Kolkata bearing a capacity of 836 passengers; by contrast, two Thai  carriers had a weekly capacity of more than 27,500  passengers, five  Chinese airlines had a combined capacity of 9,100, two Malaysian  carriers had 7,000, and Singapore’s flights carried 6,500  passengers  weekly; other nations with greater air connectivity than India included  Australia (2,500 passengers per week), Vietnam (2,200), Qatar (1,500),  and Taiwan (1,100).56 55 Interview with official involved with development in Southeast Asia, 2013. 56 “Myanmar Poised for More Rapid Growth in 2013 as Foreign Carriers Expand and Local  LCC launches,” Centre for Aviation, January 10, 2013.  </page> <page sequence="21"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    99 Trade India was Myanmar’s third-largest export market in 2010 ($958 mil- lion), after Thailand ($3.18  billion) and China ($2.08  billion).57 In  the same year, India was Myanmar’s seventh-largest source of imports  ($164 million).58 Myanmar’s exports to India are largely agricultural  products; India sends Myanmar steel products and pharmaceuticals— about half of the pharmaceuticals in Myanmar come from India.59  Trade has grown slowly since the Myanmar began its reform program  in 2011—in contrast to Myanmar’s trade with China, which has grown  explosively (see Figure 4.7).  India is not a prominent source of FDI in Myanmar, although  in recent years there has been at least rhetorical support for increased  Indian investment through government credit lines. India is the 13th- largest investor in Myanmar, with an estimated $189 million. By con- trast, China’s share of Myanmar’s FDI flow in 2010 was an implau- sible, yet accurate, 116 percent.60 Much of India’s trade with Myanmar is not reflected in official  figures, however. The border between the countries is a transit point for  the trafficking of narcotics, small arms, illegally harvested timber, and  illicitly mined gemstones. Energy India sees Myanmar as a material part of the solution to its energy  conundrum, but Myanmar’s oil reserves are largely unexplored and its  57 China’s trade figures show the huge value of illicit sectors of the economy. Officially,  Hong Kong (which shares no land border with Myanmar, and therefore is not the prime  smuggling destination) accounts for $1.6 billion; the rest of China—including Yunnan prov- ince, which shares a largely unpoliced land border with Myanmar—has less than one-third  of this sum: $476 million.  58 Countries ranked ahead of India in exports to Myanmar were China, Singapore, Thai- land, South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia: United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Data- base, undated. 59 Government of India, Embassy of India to Myanmar, “India-Myanmar Commercial and  Economic Relations,” November 14, 2012. 60 The mathematical paradox stems from a net withdrawal of FDI by other nations in that  year.

Agreements signed during the 2011 visit by President Thein Sein to  New Delhi include the extension by India of a concessional $500 mil- lion line of credit for development projects and cooperation in the area  of oil and natural gas. The two sides reiterated their commitment to  cooperate in the implementation of the Tamanthi and Shwezaye proj- ects on the Chindwin River Basin in Myanmar.64 Institutions/Diplomacy India and Burma gained their independence from Britain within six  months of each other, and shared a common Non-Aligned, postco- lonial outlook during the subsequent decade. Relations soured with  Burma’s increased discrimination against its ethnic Indian minority  and the large-scale expulsion of Indians ordered by General Ne Win  in 1962. The low point of government-to-government relations may  have been the high point in people-to-people sentiment: After Bur- ma’s “8888 Revolt”—the August 8, 1988 prodemocracy uprising led  by Aung San Suu Kyi followed by a military crackdown—India sup- ported the democracy movement and gave shelter to many activists. In  1992, India was a sponsor of a UN resolution condemning the junta  for human rights violations.65 India maintained its prodemocracy stance throughout the early  1990s, gradually shifting gears later in the decade. When India’s Look  East policy was announced in 1992, Myanmar was far from joining the  pack of Asian Tigers, and therefore did not factor prominently in the  economic aspirations of Prime Minister Rao.

In the later years of the decade, however,  India helped Myanmar take small steps to end its diplomatic isolation.  For example, Indian sponsorship enabled Myanmar to join the Bay of  Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Coop- eration (BIMSTEC) and the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation Initiative.66 In the 2000s, India shifted to a policy of noninterference in Myan- mar’s domestic affairs—just at the point when Myanmar’s internal  politics shifted away from continued rule by the junta. Delhi offered  little criticism during the “Saffron Revolution”—the 2007 antigovern- ment protests and violent crackdown that many believe demonstrated  the inevitability of political reform. On a government-to-government  level, India’s position yielded some benefits: In 2010, days after Myan- mar announced the suspension of construction of a controversial dam  being built by a Chinese company at Myitsone, junta leader Than Shwe  made a state visit to India and signed five treaties with Prime Minister  Singh. The Treaty on Mutual Assistance on Criminal Matters pledged  both governments to keep their respective territory from being used  for training, sanctuary, and other operations by terrorist or insurgent  organizations.67  Political transition in Myanmar began the following year, and  relations between the two nations is also in transition. In the view of  some observers, India is paying a diplomatic price for what many Bur- mese see as Delhi’s abandonment of Aung San Suu Kyi and the democ- racy movement during the Saffron Revolution.68 Myanmar’s reformist  president, former junta leader Thein Sein, visited New Delhi in Octo- ber 2011.

India and Myanmar signed a dozen pacts, including establishment of  a Border Area Development Program and a joint trade and investment  forum. India has offered to help Myanmar improve democratic prac- tices through parliamentary- and electoral-process training and the  strengthening of human rights institutions.70 In November 2014, Nar- endra Modi visited Naypidaw to attend the East Asia Summit—his  first visit to a Southeast Asian nation as prime minister.  Despite these steps, close observers of Myanmar’s politics report  that Suu Kyi and her supporters have not forgiven India for what  they regard as a deep betrayal.71 Moreover, continuing attacks on the  Rohingya and other Muslim communities in Myanmar have often  been cast by the majority population in ethnic as well as religious  terms, with anti–South Asian sentiment becoming increasingly vocal  in recent years.72 Security Cooperation An important driver for security cooperation between India and Myan- mar is the presence of insurgent groups and transnational criminal  networks in both countries.

Both Thein Sein and Aung San Suu Kyi have been ambivalent about whether this commu- nity deserves the protections and rights of other citizens. They are often described as Bengali  migrants rather than “true” Burmese, despite the fact that most Rohingya families have  lived in Rakhine state since the era preceding independence: Many, perhaps most, migrated  when Burma was governed as part of the British Raj in India. A nativist movement centered  around the Buddhist monk Ashin Wirathu, called “969” in reference to three sets of Bud- dhist principles, increasingly targets both Rohingyas and other Muslims—as well as any  other Burmese citizens regarded as ethnically South Asian rather than Burman. </page> <page sequence="26"> 104    Look East, Cross Black Waters: India’s Interest in Southeast Asia states, particularly Manipur and Nagaland, have often enjoyed safe  haven in Burmese territory. Groups such as the Nationalist Socialist  Council of Nagaland-Khaplang and the People’s Revolutionary Party  of Kangleipak have maintained semipermanent camps in Myanmar.  Ever since its independence, Myanmar has likewise been con- fronted with armed insurgencies by ethnic minorities—in some cases,  groups with ethnic or cultural linkages across the Indian border. More- over, Myanmar was a major source of poppy cultivation throughout  the 1980s and 1990s, and from the mid-1990s onward has been a sig- nificant site of methamphetamine production; India is a transit coun- try for narcotics and a source for precursor chemicals for processing  methamphetamine. Transborder strategic alliances among traffickers  in drugs and persons have funded insurgents and criminal networks in  both nations.73 The Tatmadaw (the name of the Myanmar military) has  repeatedly assured Indian authorities that it would take action against  Indian insurgent groups in Myanmar, while India has been accom- modating to the Myanmar army’s hot pursuit of insurgents across the  border with India.74  Despite objections from the United Kingdom, the Indian Navy  transferred four British-origin BN-2 Defender Islander maritime patrol  aircraft to Myanmar in 2006 and 2007 and is in the process of trans- ferring two more; New Delhi said the aircraft would be stripped of all  armaments and deployed “exclusively on relief and humanitarian mis- sions.” The Indian Navy also plans to help establish a naval aviation  training center in Myanmar.75 The Myanmar Navy has participated in  India’s MILAN naval exercises.76 The Indian Army has transferred light artillery guns and armored  personnel carriers to Myanmar.

Also in 2006, the  Indian Army offered special warfare training for Myanmar military  personnel, repeating the offer during the August 2012 visit to India of  the Myanmar armed forces commander, General Min Aung Hlaing.78 Depending on developments within Myanmar, security could  become a source of friction between the two nations. One of the most  significant uncertainties of Myanmar’s reform program is the regime’s  willingness to reach political accommodation with the wide range of  ethnically based local insurgencies. If Naypyidaw proves unwilling or  unable to forge a political settlement, it risks tarnishing the reformist  image it has worked hard to craft. That could set back security coopera- tion with democratic nations, including India. Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief Sharing a long land border and coastlines along the Bay of Bengal,  India and Myanmar are subject to many of same weather patterns  and potential natural disasters: therefore, it is likely that whenever  Myanmar faces the prospect of a weather-related humanitarian crisis,  India will be facing the very same threat. This may impede India’s  ability to provide resources in a crisis, but it may also permit the two  nations to coordinate a combined response. India’s proximity to Myan- mar, and particularly the proximity of India’s Andaman and Nicobar  Island bases, provides a geographical foundation for closer HA/DR  cooperation.  The most noteworthy example of New Delhi’s provision of HA/ DR to Myanmar was Operation Sahayata, when India was one of the  77 “India Rejects Amnesty Report on Copter Sale to Myanmar,” Indian Express, July 17,  2007.  78 Vijay Sakhuja, “India and Myanmar: Choices for Military Cooperation,” Indian Council  of World Affairs, September 11, 2012.  </page> <page sequence="28"> 106    Look East, Cross Black Waters: India’s Interest in Southeast Asia first countries permitted to send assistance during Cyclone Nargis. Two  IAF aircraft brought tents and medical supplies to Yangon on May 8,  2008, at a time when the junta was denying access to the United States  and almost all other prospective donors. Two Indian naval vessels, the  INS Rana and the INS Kirpan, were also granted permission to dock  near Yangon and unload additional relief supplies.79 India was one of  only two nations (the other was Thailand) whose nationals were ini- tially permitted to operate in-country on relief efforts: During a period  of approximately two weeks, a team of Indian military doctors treated  roughly 15,000 cyclone victims.80  Balancer for China After supporting an array of Communist insurgencies in Burma during  the Maoist period, China became the regime’s main international  patron in the late 1980s and maintained that position throughout  the 1990s and 2000s. During this period, Beijing supplied enormous  amounts of arms to Myanmar, and provided much-needed diplomatic  support. But this has always been an uneasy alliance, with tensions  arising over China’s dominant role in Myanmar’s economy, exploita- tion of Myanmar’s natural resources, and border security issues.81  As an integral part of its post-2011 reform efforts, and drawing on  tentative efforts beginning in the 1990s, Myanmar has sought to rein- tegrate itself to the world community. Myanmar’s rapprochement with  the United States is particularly noteworthy, but Naypyidaw has seen a  similar warming of ties with the nations of the European Union, with  fellow ASEAN members, and with economically potent states such as  Japan and South Korea.  79 India’s HA/DR: “‘Operation Sahayata’ to Help Myanmar,” The Hindu, March 8, 2008;  denial of access: “U.N.

The role that India will play in such balancing,  however, remains an open question. From Myanmar’s perspective, closer engagement with India has  the advantage of providing additional security in its volatile north- ern border areas—for reasons of geography and ethnic ties, India’s  northeastern states can prove helpful (or harmful) to Myanmar’s goal  of ending a variety of long-running ethnic-based insurgencies. Also  helpful from Myanmar’s standpoint is India’s stated desire to improve  land and sea connectivity through infrastructure projects. From India’s  perspective, Myanmar provides mirroring benefits—aid in combat- ing insurgency and instability in its northeast, as well as land/sea  connectivity—while also providing a valuable asset in its rivalry with  China: Closer ties may have persuaded Naypyidaw to revoke per- mission for suspected Chinese electronic listening posts on its Bay of  Bengal coastline.82  Despite the optimistic rhetoric from New Delhi and the built-in  advantages of geography, history, and demographics, the relationship  between India and Myanmar has yet to take off. India certainly seems  to be a less significant player in Myanmar than China, the United  States, Thailand, Japan, South Korea, or Singapore. Even Vietnam is  a more visible economic presence in Yangon than India. Trade and  development are moving very slowly, as are infrastructure projects.  Despite India’s claim to having softened up the Burmese military for  political change, India provided far less security assistance in the years  immediately preceding the democratic reforms than China, Russia,  Ukraine, Serbia, or North Korea—each of these nations gave more aid  than India, and none of them are noted champions of democracy.83  82 Donovan C.

Unlike the Western and ASEAN  states, however, India’s lack of security engagement has not been offset  by corresponding trade or investment. “Nobody here takes India seri- ously,” said one senior foreign observer in Yangon.85 Thailand India and Thailand enjoy a mature security partnership, and a grow- ing economic partnership as well. There are few significant stumbling  blocks on the horizon, and the ties do not appear to be threatened by  Thailand’s military coup of May 2014. But the relationship remains  underdeveloped, particularly when compared with the booming ties  between Thailand and China (see Figure 4.9). The modern relationship between India and Thailand grows  out of historical and cultural ties rooted in centuries of continuous  interaction. Thai culture and society fall well within the Indian cul- tural sphere: Buddhism, the religion of perhaps 95 percent of the Thai  population,86 had its origin in India; the Thai alphabet is derived from  Sanskrit’s devanagari script; Thailand’s national epic, the Ramakien,  Institute [SIPRI], Arms Transfer Database, undated.)

Given both the rhetorical warmth of the Indo-Thai relationship  and Indian ambitions to extend both highway and railway linkages  through Thailand to the rest of mainland Southeast Asia, the lack of  on-the-ground action is somewhat jarring. The two countries have dis- cussed cooperation on a variety of infrastructure projects, including the  Thailand-Myanmar-India Trilateral Highway and the Chennai-Dawei  corridor project.89 None of these plans has made significant progress.  A Western diplomatic official in Bangkok interviewed for this project  struggled to think of concrete manifestations of Indian presence in the  country: “They come here for shopping,” he offered.90 Trade Thailand and India signed a free-trade agreement framework in 2004,  and both are part of the India-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement in  Goods.

There is discussion of joint Thai-Indian development  of Myanmar’s energy resources, but to date little has come of such  talks. Institutions/Diplomacy Five years after India adopted its Look East policy, Thailand announced  a parallel “Look West” program in 1997. Both countries share the goal  of ensuring that political reforms are solidified in Myanmar—a nation  with which both countries share borders—and that Myanmar does  not retreat into China’s sphere of dominance. India and Thailand are  engaged in bilateral cooperation against terrorism and transnational  criminal networks through intelligence-sharing and law enforcement  cooperation. Thailand has followed the lead of Singapore in seeking to  proactively incorporate India more deeply into the diplomatic frame- work of Southeast Asia. Thai prime ministers have made six visits to  India since 2001: three by Thaksin Shinawatra between 2001 and  2005, and one each by Surayud Chulanont, Abhisit Vejjajiva, and Yin- gluck Shinawatra.95 In addition to ASEAN-related regional mechanisms, India and  Thailand work together on the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation Initiative,  along with Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Laos. If Thailand’s  deepening internal civil-military schism creates a rift with the United  States and other Western democracies, India may play an increasingly  significant role as diplomatic intermediary.

The Thai government now regards security coop- eration as a top policy priority in its relationship with India. A Joint  Working Group on Security Cooperation was established in 2003 to  provide a framework for cooperation in the areas of counterterrorism,  military cooperation, maritime security, international economic and  cybercrimes, antinarcotics, and money laundering.96  Since 1995, Thailand has participated in India’s biannual MILAN  naval exercise. On a biannual basis, India and Thailand conduct coor- dinated patrols in the areas adjacent to their international maritime  boundary and a joint counterinsurgency and counterterrorism exer- cise.97 A protocol signed in 2007 established procedures for coordi- nated maritime patrols between the Indian and the Royal Thai navies.  During Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra’s visit to India in  January 2012, the two sides signed a Memorandum of Understanding  (MoU) on Defense Cooperation to further streamline and enhance  bilateral defense cooperation. Besides joint maritime patrols, Thailand- India defense cooperation includes regular joint exercises, officers’  training at their respective military training institutions, exchange of  visits at various levels, regular Joint Working Group Meetings, and  Staff Talks.98  Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief Like Myanmar, Thailand shares many weather patterns with the east- ern coastal states of India. Both nations were severely hit by the 2004  tsunami, and both face the prospect of similar natural disasters in the  Bay of Bengal.

Balancer for China Although Thailand conducted more military exercises with India than  it did with China in 2012, during the five years between 2008 and 2013  the picture was different: The Chinese navy has made eight port visits  in Thailand and conducted six combined military exercises. As Hegin- botham, Rabasa, and Harold note, Thailand is “China’s longest stand- ing and most important security partner in Southeast Asia.”99 In 2007,  Thailand became the first country in the world to conduct combined  training exercises with the PLA, beginning with special forces and  extending to marine corps.100 Thailand also was the first Southeast  Asian nation to undertake licensed production of Chinese military sys- tems: an army-focused multiple rocket launcher systems.101 Thailand does not regard China as a particular threat to its own core  interests. Unlike smaller states in the region, or states whose relationship  with the United States do not approach the level of ally, Thailand does  not feel a particularly strong need for India to serve as a balancer against  China. This raises the question: Why does Thailand place such a high  value on engagement with India, particularly in the security sphere? The  answer may lie not to Thailand’s north, but to its east, west, and south:  Thailand has had periodic border clashes with Myanmar, Cambodia,  and Laos over the past three decades, and faces a long-running insur- gency in its four southernmost provinces fueled by discontent among the  ethnic Malay population.102 Thailand’s interest in bringing India into the  99 Heginbotham, Rabasa, and Harold, 2013, p. 15.

While many Southeast Asian states seek closer engagement with India as  a balancer for China, that is not necessarily the case for Thailand. From  a U.S. standpoint, one of the most significant advantages of a growing  India-Thailand security relationship may be a side benefit not intended  by either New Delhi or Bangkok: the Indian military’s increased interop- erability with U.S. military hardware and familiarity with Western mili- tary procedures. Given Thailand’s strong U.S. tilt in its hardware and  training methods, every time India exercises with Thai military units it  grows more comfortable with American gear and practices.

Connectivity Malaysia straddles the sea lines of communication along the Strait  of Malacca, making it a nation of great concern to India’s maritime  connectivity plans. Given that secure navigation of the Strait is a goal  shared with every other major trading nation, however, India’s ambi- tions here do not require a particular set of policy actions. From India’s  standpoint, the connectivity goal boils down to maintenance of the  status quo. Trade Malaysia has one of Southeast Asia’s most developed economies, and  India’s trade relationship with Malaysia is in some ways a downsized  version of its relationship with Singapore (see Figure 4.12). Malaysia  and India signed a CECA in February 2011, with terms similar to  those of a trade agreement between India and Singapore. The India- Malaysia agreement envisages liberalization of trade in goods and ser- vices, investment protection, and economic cooperation. In the area of  services, Malaysia and India agreed to facilitate the temporary entry of  service suppliers, professionals, and business visitors that would allow  nationals of each country to perform contract work in the other.107 Malaysia is India’s third-largest trade partner within ASEAN,  after Singapore and Indonesia.

Energy Malaysia is India’s largest supplier of both oil and gas, and therefore  tops India’s priority list for current energy interests. This situation may  not continue far into the future, however: India may soon find itself  squeezed out of the market for much of Malaysia’s energy resources. While Malaysia has Asia’s third-largest proven oil reserves, nearly  half of its production goes for domestic consumption, and domestic  needs have been rising even as production has been falling.112 Malaysia  is the world’s third-largest exporter of LNG and has 83 trillion cubic feet  of proven reserves, but the competition for it is brisk: 42 percent of pro- duction goes for domestic use and Malaysia’s four top LNG customers—  Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, and China—are better positioned than  India to bid for and transport whatever gas enters the market.113  Institutions/Diplomacy After a Cold War estrangement mirroring what India experienced with  other Southeast Asian partners of the United States, India and Malay- sia have been rediscovering connections that were largely left to the  diaspora for decades.114 Relations between the two nations were peri- odically complicated in the 1990s by Malaysia’s support for Pakistani  positions in diplomatic forums.

Malay- sian Prime Minister Najib visited India in January 2010, followed by  Indian Prime Minister Singh’s visit to Kuala Lumpur in October 2010.  During Singh’s visit to Malaysia, the two governments set a date for  signing the trade agreement and established a joint working group on  terrorism.117 Security Cooperation If India’s trade relationship with Malaysia resembles a downscale version  of its relationship with Singapore, so too does its security relationship.  In the security sphere, as in the economic one, the two neighboring  Southeast Asian states appeal to India for similar reasons: They share a  strategic caution about the potential for Chinese regional dominance,  they are toward the high end of technical capacity among Southeast  Asian nations, and they share a British colonial legacy that carries over  in language, political structures, and a familiarity of outlook among  the elite segments of society. Malaysia has traditionally relied heavily on Russian arms,118 so  India’s expertise in servicing Soviet or Russian systems is a powerful  incentive to security cooperation. Since 1993, Delhi and Kuala Lumpur  have held periodic sessions of the Malaysia-India Defense Cooperation  the long tenure of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who remains a senior behind-the- scenes political player in Malaysia. 116 Amit Singh, “India-Malaysia Strategic Relations,” Maritime Affairs: Journal of the National  Maritime Foundation of India, Vol. 7, No. 1, July 22, 2011.  117 “Joint Statement on the Framework for the India-Malaysia Strategic Partnership,” The  Hindu, October 27, 2010. 118 Heginbotham, Rabasa, and Harold, 2013, p. 24.  </page> <page sequence="43"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    121 Meeting, the first such arrangement Malaysia has made with a nation  outside of Southeast Asia. The primary area of cooperation is the train- ing of Malaysian military personnel, in particular those tasked with  maintenance and operation of such Russian aircraft as the MiG-29  Fulcrum and Su30 MKM. Malaysia has also explored Indian training  of its Scorpene submarine crews and maintenance of the French/Span- ish submarines, acquired in 2008.119 Indian defense companies and military personnel have regularly  participated in the Malaysian Defense Exhibitions and Langkawi Inter- national Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition, and Malaysia regularly  sends high-level delegations to the DEF EXPOs and Aerospace Exposi- tions shows in India.120 The first joint exercise between the Indian and  Malaysian militaries was held in Malaysia in October 2012: “Harimau  Shakti” focused on counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, and urban  warfare.121 India is sensitive to Malaysia’s identity as a Muslim-majority  nation, but one in which Islamist parties have traditionally not played  a major role in policy formation. Malaysia has not been an incubator  of terrorist groups, but it has on occasion served as a logistics node  and fundraising site for groups such as the Indonesia-based al Qaeda  affiliate Jemaah Islamiyah. New Delhi and Kuala Lumpur share a con- cern that Malaysian territory not be used by such groups, and that the  Malaysian national identity remain tolerant of non-Muslim citizens;  India’s concern is particularly focused on the Tamil Hindu diaspora  community. Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief Like Myanmar and Thailand, Malaysia shares many weather patterns  with the eastern coastal states of India.

Disaster relief has not played a signifi- cant role in the India-Malaysia relationship to date, but could be a part  of future military exercises. Balancer for China India’s potential role as a balancer for China is a leading factor in  Malaysia’s outreach on security matters. Like Singapore—and much  more so than Thailand—Malaysia regards the rise of China as a pos- sible strategic challenge. While Singapore’s governing elite is predom- inantly of ethnic Chinese origin, Malaysia’s sizable ethnic Chinese  community has been largely excluded from governing circles. From  the perspective of Malaysia’s bumiputra political elite, the threat posed  by Beijing is a matter not of alarmist speculation, but clear history:  From 1948 to 1960, Maoist China supported a Communist insurgency  against both the colonial state of Malaya and the newly independent  nation of Malaysia; the insurgency was relaunched in 1967, and did  not formally end until the surrender of Malayan Communist Party  leader Chin Peng in 1989.122 And the prospect for armed conflict is not  entirely a thing of the past: Malaysia has maritime claims in the Spratly  Islands and other parts of the South China Sea, as well as in maritime  areas north of Borneo and in other parts of the “Nine-Dash Line” that  overlap with Chinese claims. Malaysia’s leadership, therefore, sees the need for India to play  a balancing role vis-à-vis China in starker terms than do the leaders  of perhaps any Southeast Asian nation except Vietnam. For Kuala  Lumpur, the threat posed by China is a material fact rather than a  theoretical possibility. This does not prevent Malaysia from engaging  in security cooperation with China: During the five years through  2013, it received three Chinese port visits and participated in one com- bined exercise.123 But the relative strength and high funding priority  of Malaysia’s armed forces suggest an ongoing, top-level desire to be  122 Douglas Martin, “Chin Peng, Malaysian Rebel, Dies at 88,” New York Times,  September 16, 2003. 123 Heginbotham, Rabasa, and Harold, 2013, p. 12.  </page> <page sequence="45"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    123 prepared for conflict with a peer or superior adversary. Compared with  neighboring Indonesia, for example, Malaysia spends 80  percent as  much on its military (despite having only one-third as many troops in  uniform), and its air force is considered superior to that of Indonesia.124  The fact that Malaysia has active South China Sea claims is likely a  factor in the decision to prioritize military funding, and particularly  funding of the air force. Indonesia The largest nation in Southeast Asia is, in the view of some Indian  strategists, also the most important long-term partner for India in the  region. For maritime issues including transit of the Straits of Malacca  and piracy, Indonesia will continue to loom large. For energy and  trade, Indonesia represents enormous untapped potential—albeit in  the energy sector, a potential unlikely to be realized. As a whole, Indo- nesia is another good example of the disconnect between rhetoric and  action in India’s engagement with Southeast Asia: Delhi sees a healthy  relationship founded on ancient and modern bonds of culture and  outlook, while the regional power sees a somewhat hollow relation- ship lacking solid foundations of robust trade, security ties, or closely  aligned national interests. India and Indonesia do have long historical and cultural linkages.  Prior to the arrival of Islam in the Indonesian archipelago, pre-Islamic  Indianized kingdoms such as the Sanjaya dynasty (best known for the  Prambanan temple complex in Java) adopted Hindu beliefs, practices,  and architectural styles. The island of Bali preserves Hindu religion  and culture to this day, and Hinduism is one of the five officially rec- ognized religions in Indonesia. The national airline of Indonesia takes  its name, Garuda, from the anthropomorphic bird that serves as the  sacred vehicle for the Hindu deity Vishnu. These two nations have many similarities.

HA/DR is one exception: India has been more involved with disaster  relief in Indonesia than in perhaps any other country outside its immedi- ate neighborhood. The inauguration of new leaders in both nations may  provide a basis for closer cooperation: India’s Prime Minister Narendra  Modi and Indonesia’s President Joko Widodo both began five-year terms  in 2014, both rose from very modest family backgrounds through the  democratic process, and both enjoy a popular mandate to reinvigorate  economies that have been too sclerotic and inward-looking to support  their countries’ growth and ambitions.

Trade India and Indonesia both entered the new century after painful eco- nomic crises in the 1990s.126 Compared with the stagnation of the past,  India and Indonesia are expanding their economic relationship at a  furious pace: Between 2006 and 2011, bilateral trade nearly tripled,  going from $6.2 billion to $17.7 billion; through 2014, it experienced a  small decline (see Figure 4.14).

India is not among  Indonesia’s nine largest sources of imports, and in 2011 ranked behind  Japan, China, Singapore, the United States, and South Korea as an  export destination for Indonesia.  Both emerging market economies have been slowly liberalizing  their trade and investment policies, and the two nations established  a joint study group in 2010 to examine the feasibility of a CECA  between the two countries; the study suggested significant economic  complementary issues between the two countries with potential for  expanded economic ties that could be enhanced by fostering outward  investment flows.128 During Indonesian President Susilo Bambang  Yudhoyono’s first visit to India in 2005, he and Indian Prime Minis- ter Singh initiated a strategic partnership. The two countries agreed in  2012 to fast-track the talks, and India asked for an upward revision of  the bilateral trade target to $25 billion by 2014; the actual figure fell  short by 32 percent.129 India has investments in Indonesia in the textiles, steel, automo- tive, banking, and natural resources sectors.

This may be a misguided hope: Indonesia has  significant energy resources, but even more significant domestic energy  needs. Indonesia has proven reserves of 3.9 billion barrels of oil and  141 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, but for a nation of 237 million,  these resources are insufficient to meet domestic need. Indonesia has  been a net importer of both crude oil and refined products since 2004,  and suspended its OPEC membership in January 2009 to concentrate  on meeting demand at home.131 Despite far larger gas reserves, a com- bination of protectionism, economic nationalism, and other foreign  competitors likely impede Indonesia’s potential to become a significant  supplier of LNG to India. More than 40  Indian companies are mining or exploring coal  blocks in Indonesia. India’s Adani group signed an agreement with  Bukit Asam, an Indonesian state coal company, for a $1.6 billion proj- ect to build and operate a 200-kilometer (km) railway line and port in  South Sumatra.132 Institutions/Diplomacy India and Indonesia shared an institutional kinship in the early years of  independence, but have only recently begun rebuilding ties that were  severed during the Cold War. In the 1950s, Jawaharlal Nehru and Indo- nesian leader Sukarno worked together to create the Non-Aligned Move- ment, culminating in the Bandung Conference held in the Indonesian  city of that name in 1955. Both countries drifted into de facto alignment,  on opposite sides of the U.S.-Soviet divide: Anti-Communist purges in  Indonesia following the failed 1965 coup, and the ouster of Sukarno fol- lowed by the ascension of the anti-Communist general Suharto, shifted  Indonesia closer to the United States and further from both India and  the rest of the Soviet-leaning Non-Aligned nations. India and Indonesia are respectively the world’s largest and third- largest democracies today, a new source of political congruence that  131 EIA, “Indonesia,” January 9, 2013a.  132 Indian Ministry of External Affairs, 2012b. </page> <page sequence="50"> 128    Look East, Cross Black Waters: India’s Interest in Southeast Asia has gained increasing significance since the fall of the military-domi- nated Suharto regime in 1998. While nonalignment formed an institu- tional bond between the nations in the 1950s, democracy is beginning  to do so more than half a century later. Both nations regard themselves  as proof that democracy need not be viewed as a Western construct. In  the joint statement during President Yudhoyono’s 2011 visit to India,  he and Indian Prime Minister Singh noted, “Indonesia and India are  natural partners as two developing democratic countries in the region.”  The two leaders underlined their shared commitment to “multicultur- alism, pluralism and diversity,” and affirmed their desire to “play an  active role in the promotion of democracy, peace and stability in Asia  Pacific region and the world at large.”133 Whether future years will  bring substantial progress in translating these words to action remains  to be seen. Security Cooperation Like Malaysia and Vietnam, Indonesia is heavily reliant on Russian  military hardware134—hence a rationale for the Tentara Nasional Indo- nesia, Indonesia’s military, to seek out Indian expertise and security  cooperation. From the standpoint of risk, Indian planners are wary of  the possibility that a nation with the world’s largest Muslim popula- tion could take a turn toward radicalism and international terrorism.135  133 C.

The most dangerous terrorist  group based in Indonesia, Jemaah Islamiyah, maintained operational  contact with al Qaeda and other groups headquartered in the terri- tory of India’s rival Pakistan.136 The success of the Indonesian state in  combatting Jemaah Islamiyah, including the prosecution of the group’s  founder Abu Bakr Basyir in 2010, has changed the dynamic of the  India-Indonesian relationship—instead of viewing Indonesia largely  through the prism of counterterrorism, India now takes a more holistic  approach. One of its aspirations for Indonesia, as for Malaysia, is to  see these majority-Muslim states continue on their current course of  self-identifying as tolerant, multireligious states, with radical Islamist  groups playing no policy role. India and Indonesia signed a Defense Cooperation Agreement in  2001 and hold regular military exchanges, including high-level visits,  ship visits, and the assignment of military personnel to each other’s  staff colleges. In 2007, the two sides established a Joint Defense Coop- eration Committee.137 Speaking in 2010 of Indonesia’s priorities in  defense cooperation with India, Defense Minister Purnomo Yusgiant- oro named human resource development in the defense sector, India’s  expertise in training of Su-class aircraft pilots, counterinsurgency  operations, and network-centric warfare, as well as training in UN  peacekeeping operations and humanitarian disaster relief.138 During  President Yudhoyono’s second visit to India in 2011, the two countries  136 The most noteworthy Jemaah Islamiyah operative publicly reported as having spent time  with al Qaeda leadership figures in Pakistan was Ridwan Issamuddin, a.k.a. Hambali, who  was captured in Thailand in 2003 (Blank, 2013); Hambali’s brother, Rusman Gunawan, was  arrested in Karachi a few weeks after Hambali’s capture. 137 Pankaj Jha, “India’s Defence Diplomacy in Southeast Asia,” 2011, pp. 55–56. 138 P.

The two  navies conduct annual India-Indonesia Coordinated Patrols in the Six  Degree Channel in the Andaman Sea, and have a longstanding work- ing relationship fostered through exercises and regular coordinated  patrols conducted twice a year for two to three weeks. The two navies  also engage in intelligence sharing on matters pertaining to maritime  security, particularly with regard to antipiracy operations.140  Counterterrorism remains a security priority for both countries,  with a weakened Jemaah Islamiyah far from the only potential threat.  India and Indonesia signed an MoU establishing a joint working group  on counterterrorism in 2004. The two armies have conducted joint  counterinsurgency training exercises called Garuda Shakti. In April  2012, Indonesian army personnel participated in a platoon-level joint  training exercise conducted at the Indian Army’s elite Counter Insur- gency and Jungle Warfare School in Mizoram, northeastern India.141  Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief Indonesia has been the recipient of more Indian disaster efforts than  perhaps any nation outside of South Asia. The provision of HA/DR  by Indian military aircraft and naval vessels began with the 2004 tsu- nami, which wreaked its greatest damage on the Indonesian province  of Aceh. Despite having itself suffered from the tsunami, India sent  two ships: the 45-bed hospital ship INS Nirupak and the INS Khukri.  An Indian medical team and 250 troops were deployed at Meulaboh  beginning January 5, 2005; they distributed more than 35 tons of relief  supplies, including tents, blankets, food, and medical equipment.142  Indian sources tend to recall this operation with great pride, while  139 Rajeev Sharma, “Closer Defense Ties Between India and Indonesia a Win-Win Scenario,”  Jakarta Globe, October 17, 2012. 140 “India, Indonesia to Boost Anti-Piracy Cooperation,” Sify News, January 10, 2011. 141 Indian Ministry of External Affairs, 2012b.  142 “India Sends 250 Troops, Medical Team to Aceh,” Jakarta Post, January 13, 2005.  </page> <page sequence="53"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    131 Indonesian sources are more likely to view India as merely one among  dozens of nations providing assistance.143 The following year, India launched Operation Marham to pro- vide HA/DR to victims of an earthquake near Yogyakarta. The effort  included the Indian naval vessels INS Rajput and INS Tabar and at least  two IAF transport aircraft with more than 35 tons of relief supplies.144 Balancer for China Just as India’s security and economic relationship with Malaysia can  be viewed as a downsized version of its relationship with Singapore,  India’s engagement with Indonesia can look a bit like a downsized ver- sion of its ties to Malaysia. This is particularly true in the triangular  strategic balance among India, China, and Southeast Asian states. Like Malaysia, Indonesia sees Beijing’s hand in the most traumatic  event of its postcolonial history: a 1965 coup attempt attributed to the  Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), which Indonesia’s military elite  blamed on Maoist China. The facts of the coup—and of the subse- quent crackdown in which hundreds of thousands of suspected Com- munists were killed—remain poorly understood, and are still seldom  openly discussed in Indonesia. The fact that so many of the PKI cadres  were ethnic Chinese, and that the PKI’s predecessor group received  funding and supplies from Maoist China, led many Indonesians to see  the entire movement as a Beijing-led Fifth Column. Estimates of the  143 One of the authors of this report visited Aceh several times in the aftermath of disaster  (once while rescue missions were still under way in the week following the tsunami, once  eight months later when relief efforts were in transition to reconstruction, and once several  years later when reconstruction had been completed); in no case did he observe India’s con- tribution singled out by local interlocutors—but the efforts of the United States, European  states, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and other nations were all duly noted.

The most significant of these involves  the waters north of the Natuna Islands, disputed among Indonesia,  China, and Taiwan. These claims are not currently a source of as much  active dispute as those put forward by Vietnam or the Philippines,  however, and Indonesia has strengthened its security ties to China in  recent years: Between 2008 and 2013, China had four fleet visits to  Indonesia and two combined exercises. In 2011, the Indonesian mili- tary conducted a combined training exercise with the PLA focused on  special operations forces. Jakarta has bought Chinese C-802 anti-ship  missiles and signed an MoU to license C-705 missiles.146 Jakarta recognizes the importance of accommodating the stra- tegic rise of China, but seeks to maintain a balance of power among  regional players. From Indonesia’s perspective, India is one of a number  of potential “balancers” to help offset Beijing’s huge military and eco- nomic advantages. It has sought strategic independence by deepening  its relationships not only with India but to an even greater extent with  the United States, Japan, and Australia.147  145 While the 1965–1966 purge unquestionably represents the most serious and widespread  instance of political violence in modern Indonesian history, the basic facts—let alone a con- sensus on the full extent of the killings and detentions—remains elusive.

There had been little direct contact prior  to the Cold War, and nearly as little during it. Even after the closure  of U.S. bases in the Philippines in 1992, Manila’s foreign policy ori- entation continued to be shaped by the defense relationship with the  United States and its membership in ASEAN.

Both  countries have suffered from insurgency and terrorism, sometimes from  associated groups.

The two nations have agreed to work together on counterterrorist  operations and intelligence sharing.160 Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief The Philippines is not a first-tier HA/DR partner for India: Unlike  Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia, it does not share Indian  Ocean weather patterns, and it is too far distant for India to serve as a  convenient launching point for first international response. India did,  however, deploy a military aircraft to assist the Philippines in recovery  efforts following severe mudslides on the island of Leyte in February  2006. An IAF Illyushin-76 carried 34 tons of relief supplies, including  tents, blankets, food, and medicine.161  Balancer for China The Philippines has a closer economic relationship with China than  do other maritime Southeast Asian states: Chinese FDI flows repre- sent 14 percent of inflow to the Philippines, compared with 1.5 percent  for Indonesia and 1.8 percent for Malaysia and 2.9 percent for Sin- gapore.162 At the same time, the Philippines has a larger range of ter- ritorial disputes with China than any nation in Southeast Asia except  for Vietnam.

There are no significant points of friction, but nei- ther country figures very prominently into the other’s calculations. The two small nations of Cambodia and Laos have a historical  cultural bond with India; the Hindu Khmer empire, which lasted  from the ninth through the 14th century, was centered in Cambo- dia’s sacred city of Angkor and extended well into Laos. These two  modern states, however, remain more closely linked to China than any  other members of ASEAN: In 2010, for example, China accounted for  60 percent of the FDI inflow to Cambodia and 89 percent to Laos.165  These states have only very limited security interaction with India,166  and hardly more extensive economic relations. Connectivity plans are a  distant dream. But India’s small-scale engagement provides the United  States with a free, if modest, benefit: New Delhi has funded English-  language education programs in both countries.  Conclusion India’s bilateral relations with the nations of Southeast Asia are illustra- tive of one of this report’s main observations: India’s bold rhetoric and  ambitious goals for engagement with Southeast Asia have generally not  yet been matched by concrete action. A country-by-country examina- tion provides granular detail (as shown in Figure 4.1), showing where  India has had relatively more or less success in meeting its goals. This brief overview of India’s bilateral relationships in Southeast  Asia suggests certain areas in which Washington and New Delhi might  cooperate to their mutual advantage. In geographical terms, these  include: Vietnam: India’s longstanding security relationship can comple- ment U.S. efforts to deepen ties with its former adversary.

New Delhi and Washington would  like to boost their respective trade with Vietnam (and hence share an  interest in facilitating the improvement of Vietnam’s rule of law and  transportation infrastructure), and both support Vietnam’s desire to  improve its capacity for self-defense and protection of maritime trade  routes. If India’s dream of a Kolkata-to-Hanoi road and rail connection  were realized, Vietnam’s additional economic and logistical options  would be increased (i.e., the country would be less reliant on Chinese  goodwill), and U.S. trade and security interests would be enhanced. Myanmar: The United States and India likewise share comple- mentary economic and security interests in Myanmar: China’s influ- ence here is far heavier than in Vietnam, and both the government  and the population of this fragile nation are seeking alternate sources  of support. Here, perhaps more than in any other nation, the United  States could benefit from significantly increased Indian engagement.  As a neighboring state, a potential geostrategic counterweight to  China, and a country with considerable shared history and culture,  India is well positioned to join the international rush into a populous,  resource-rich nation that has been largely cut off from foreign engage- ment since 1962. Unlike the United States, India does not prompt sus- picions of superpower encroachment. China remains the primary eco- nomic and military sponsor of the Burmese regime, and North Korea  is still an interested player: U.S. interests are well served by greater  Indian involvement. Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia: In these three nations,  India’s interests are largely shared by the United States, so either nation’s  engagement can serve as a force multiplier for the other. More so than  in Vietnam and Myanmar, however, the two nations’ strengths (and  weaknesses) replicate rather than complement each other. Muslim- majority Malaysia and Indonesia (and, to a lesser extent, Brunei) may  be affected by events in the Middle East: If a U.S.-led campaign against  the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Iraq and Syria is seen in the  same light as the 2003 U.S. campaign against Saddam Hussain or U.S.  support for Israel in its 2008, 2012, or 2014 invasions of Gaza, rela- tions could take a negative turn. In such a case, however, India under  </page> <page sequence="63"> How Is India’s Strategy Being Implemented in Southeast Asia?    141 the leadership of Narendra Modi would be poorly placed to pick up  the slack. India is not bound by the legal strictures that could limit  U.S. security cooperation with Thailand if the military regime proves  unwilling to return power to a freely elected civilian government, but  the May 2014 coup has done little to disrupt the relationship at the  time of writing. </page> <page sequence="64">  </page> </plain_text>
