This de-reification is seen in light of meme-theory and the idea of language being a virus. Keywords ascetic, asceticism, cognitive psychology, comparative methods, conceptual blending theory, evolutionary psychology, meme-theory, metaphor, metaphor theory, mysticism, Mi la ras pa, Nietzsche, socio-biology, Übertragung Introduction In the article "Asceticism, Religion and Biological Evolution" Johannes Bronk horst points out a new direction for comparative research in asceticism by help of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology. Bronkhorst addresses the ques tion of how asceticism can exist in face of natural selection. In many instances the pattern of human behaviour called "asceticism" includes sexual continence, which renders it counter-reproductive. The persistence of asceticism therefore constitutes a challenge to the theory of Darwinian evolution (2001: 375). In an attempt to follow and add to Bronkhorst's work I am - like Bronkhorst himself — answering the call for a "theoretical framework for the comparative AKNOWLEDGEMENTS The original impulse to write this article cannot be separated from the continuous flow of inspiration I receive from Erik Kjrgaard Larsen and Toke Sellner Reunert.

Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 73 study of asceticism" put forth by Wimbush and Valantasis (Bronkhorst 2001:374; Wimbush and Valantasis 2002: xxv). According to Bronkhorst, explanations of asceticism by "culturalists" can apply only to specific cultures and therefore cannot produce such a comparative framework. Nor can theories of dissemi nation or borrowing account for the widespread practice of asceticism. Instead, Bronkhorst suggests that "a human universal" (2001: 377), namely "a shared disinclination to identify with body and mind" (387), or "the attitude of being different from body and mind" (402), may serve as the foundation of the desired comparative framework. According to Bronkhorst: "Varied related religious phenomena do not call for an explanation in terms of a theory about what the world is like, but rather in terms of a shared human predisposition" (387). Sexuality is an obvious "innate predisposition" that may be connected to the practice of asceticism but as sexuality is not confined to humans, and since asceticism and its view of the nature of the soul is "essentially dissociated from emotion" (including sexual emotion), it "does not make sense to see in these practices and beliefs the expression of a universal, an instinct, that has much in common with sexuality, its enemy" (397). Instead, the "ascetic instinct" must be viewed in connection with language, since "human language has an innate component" (396), and thus may be viewed as an instinct too (cf. Pinker). There is a parallel between the language instinct and the ascetic instinct: Both are confined to human beings, and both regulate... the interaction between individual humans and pre-existing cultural complexes—language and religion respec tively. Both individual languages and individual religions evolve, and in doing so will adapt to the predispositions of their users. Both are therefore likely to evolve common features, something like U[niversal] G[rammar] in the case of language, something like the features inscribed... in religion (Bronkhorst 2001: 408). It is by means of language, and the resulting ability to think symbolically, "that human beings construct ideas of reality that are beyond immediate evidence, ideas that can then be shared with other language users. Shared, but unverifiable, ideas about reality characterize many if not all religions" and thus "the appear ance of religion has some connection with the appearance of symbolic think ing" (411). Bronkhorst hypothesizes that the "ascetic instinct" is inseparable from symbolic thinking (even to the effect of being "two sides of the same coin"). Symbolic thinking drastically increased humans' survival chances but had as a "side effect" the practices and ideas connected with asceticism. Ascet icism "was a handicap... because it saddled those capable of it with certain</page><page sequence="3">74 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 attitudes, perhaps ideas, which would lead a small minority from among them to renounce sexuality, or to inflict damage to their own bodies" (413). This article will take as its point of departure the connection between ascet icism and "symbolic thinking." This connection will form the basis of the arti cle's theory of asceticism. The conclusions reached, however, will be somewhat different from Bronkhorst's. Though I agree with the idea that asceticism is in some ways a by-product of symbolic thinking's "virtual" representation of real ity and the self, I do not see it as a more or less accidental "handicap." Rather, I shall describe it as a practical set of methods for deconstructing the human mind's virtual representations. In addition to the theory of symbolic thinking developed by Terrence Dea con (Deacon 1997) I will focus on the explanation of how the mind and lan guage works through the lenses of the "domain interaction theory" of metaphor, and the theory of blending propounded by Fauconnier and Turner. Nietzsche's views on metaphor will be drawn into the ensuing discussion of metaphors and asceticism and on this background the central thesis will be developed. Furthermore, asceticism will be viewed in its "mystical aspect," that is, as having as its goal altered states of consciousness—or, whatever can be seen as "mystic revelation" in the specific traditions. Forms of asceticism having other more "modest" goals will therefore not play a significant role in this article. And, as the eremitic kind of asceticism brings out the most extreme aspects of asceticism I have deemed it advantageous to focus on this rather than the cenobitic. As mentioned, it should be said that the thesis presented here may gra ciously be viewed as an answer to Wimbush and Valantalis' cry for "more cross-fertilization and daring methodological experimentation" in the study of asceticism (Wimbush and Valantalis 2002: xxi). They state: "There have been very few works that have argued for or provided a model for a consistently comparative, multicultural or multitraditional perspective in the study of asceticism" and so they advertise for a "cross-cultural theoretical framework" (xxiii). In truth, the present study is experimental and is an attempt to provide a "cross-cultural theoretical framework" in which asceticism may be studied. The explanation of mystically oriented, eremitic asceticism that I am going to offer is neither meant to be exhaustive, nor to replace already existing expla nations. Rather, the point is to place those already existing explanations in a new perspective that may form a descriptive pattern within which the multi tude of explanations may be fitted—and perhaps, to a certain extent, united. The theory of asceticism that I suggest attempts to describe and explain some of the reasons for the very existence of asceticism in different human</page><page sequence="4">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 75 populations. I do not, however, consider it viable to set out what motivates all people at all times to engage in the practice of asceticism. In my judgment, there are as many motivations for asceticism as there are ascetics. Still, a theory that does not try to explain why its object exists is, in my opinion, not much of a theory. Scientific explanation can be divided into three categories: causal, functional, and intentional explanation. As we shall see, the present study offers a mixture of causal and functional explanations. These may correspond to the intentions of ascetics "themselves," to the extent anyone is able to decide what ascetics' intentions with practicing asceticism may be.1 This correspondence, however, cannot be established without doing quite a bit of "translation." When, for example, the Tibetan ascetic Mi la ras pa decides to seek out the loneliness of the mountain in order to practice the Dharma and cleanse himself of former evil acts, it is a far cry to say that what he "really" wants is to suspend the "metaphoric" activity going on in his brain. In conse quence, it is difficult to decide if the suspension of metaphoric activity is the intention of Mi la ras pa. Whether intentional or not, this suspension may still be the consequence. A Definition and Theory of Asceticism When looking at different interpretations of what "asceticism" is and means, what first strikes one is the focus on asceticism as a praxis of dissociation from ordinary, or "natural," human life-forms, behaviours, practices, ways of think ing and perceiving, social norms, etc. The character traits of the ascetic are interpreted in accord with the respective perspectives in which they are seen, and the conclusions drawn from them differ in degrees accordingly. They are not the same in each perspective—but seem to bear a family resemblance to each other. On a backdrop of a representative selection2 of interpretations of asceticism a definition of asceticism can be ventured: A systematic restriction on, abnegation 1 The function of ascetic mysticism may be to alleviate suffering, sublime sexual drives, be invested with social prestige, etc., and the results of these diverse functions may, respectively, be what the ascetic intends to obtain. Likewise, the cause for practicing asceticism may be the suffering of the individual and as the goal of the ascetic may be to alleviate suffering, the cause of asceticism can be construed to be part and parcel of the ascetics intention for practicing asceticism. 2 For the definition I draw mainly on entries on asceticism in various encyclopedias (Hall, Kaelber, Kariyawasam, Perera, Tamura) and monographs and articles representing different</page><page sequence="5">76 T. Bjornvig/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 or reversal of, basic human needs and "natural" inclinations in anticipation of achieving religious insights, virtues, magical abilities, and!or "salvation" (that is, "liberation; " "enlightenment; " "awakening; " "visions; " "illumination; " etc.)— in short: that which for each respective religion represents the highest obtainable goal. In addition to this definition a list of typical characteristics of asceti cism might prove useful. This list may be presented provisionally in the fol lowing way: 1. Practice, or circumstances of asceticism: a. Systematic and/or prolonged restrictions on, or dissociation from, "natural" human needs and inclinations, such as sleep, food, sex, rest, movement; use of senses; speech, social interactions, etc. b. Systematic and/or prolonged application of techniques of ecstasy/enstasis, i.e. contemplation/meditation, prayer, mantra, yoga, in short: different ways of sys tematically manipulating body and mind. c. Reversal (apparent) of social norms and etiquettes; breaking taboos; committing crimes; insulting/criticizing established institutions and figures of authority; eating and drinking abominable substances; acting like the insane (the "divine madman," the "crazy yogi," religious "idiots").3 d. Inflicting pain or extreme discomfort on own body: i.e. sitting or lying on beds of nails, whipping oneself, obtaining stigmatisation, etc. Elements of l.a. may, when severe—or in all cases according to one's liking (or disliking)—figure under l.d. 2. Cultivation of: a. supernatural/occult abilities such as precognition, clairvoyance, telepathy, lévi tation, invisibility, power to appear in a multitude of forms, communicating with otherworldly entities, etc. b. objectivity and neutrality that results in impartial abilities of judgement and condemnation. c. "virtues," that is, "humanly obtainable" virtues (though in extreme degree), such as speaking the truth, being kind, patient, compassionate, unselfish, helpful, etc. perspectives on asceticism, such as (social) history (Brown 1982 and 1988), sociobiology (Bronk horst 2001), comparativism (Eliade 1990), postmodern literary criticism (Harpham), decon struction (Nietzsche 1998), Freudian psychoanalysis (Schjelderup), and sociology (Weber 1963 and 1973; Silber 1988). This selection is not meant to be exhaustive. Rather, it should be con ceived of as a more or less random selection meant to exemplify the great variety of interpreta tions of asceticism. 3 See Graarup (1998), for example, for a characterization of a "religious idiot" in the Russian Orthodox tradition.</page><page sequence="6">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 77 d. revelations and visions; hallucinations (depending on viewpoint), numinous or clairvoyant dreams; prophetic abilites, etc. e. status of being otherworldly; beyond the human condition; a celestial being (angel, demigod, goddess, god, Buddha, etc.); "being dead to this world," etc. f. superhuman endurance; high threshold of pain; unusual abilities of concentra tion, etc. The distinction between "practice" and "circumstances" above in (1.) is an important one, as it signals the difference between conscious volition and acci dental situation when undergoing a period of abnegation or dissociation. That is, whether the person suffering deprivations or dissociations of some sort is doing it out of his or her own free will or experience it involuntarily (because of imprisonment, shipwreck, etc.). When undergoing long periods of disso ciation it is of importance whether the ascetic is following instructions bearing on the direction of mental development and the danger of various pitfalls met with in isolation, or not. The "positive" effects may be the same but the a person having such experiences without instructions is in greater danger of suffering only the "negative" effects of ascetic isolation, perhaps even going insane. Furthermore, it brings into focus that an ascetic may achieve results through his or her practice that she or he does not necessarily wish to obtain (e.g. the occult powers of the meditating Buddhist practitioner) or, some of the results are considered more or less wanted side effects of the main process of dissocia tion and isolation. Thus, a differentiation between ethical and mystical (aspects of) asceticism seems appropriate here.4 Some forms of asceticism are more aimed at obtaining "virtues," i.e. to reach ethical superiority or virtuosity rather than gaining mystical insights, visions, or experiences of non-duality. Often, though, the ascetic seeks to achieve both ethical and mystical qualities and abilities by means of asceticism. Now that we have a definition and a list of characteristics of asceticism we need an explanation of why it is as the definition says it is. That is, why would otherwise perfectly humanely human beings set out on an adventure that will utterly estrange them from humanity? Why would they suffer severe depriva tion of food, sleep, sex, shelter, and human company; undergo torturous exer cises; inflict short or long term damage on their bodies; engage themselves in overt and degrading actions; isolate themselves from all kinds of social interac tion, even sensory stimulation? Why this choice of going against, even to the 4 See Robert A. F. Thurmans distinction between "relative" and "ultimate" asceticism, as well as the subcategories "mundane" and "spiritual" (Thurman: 108-109).</page><page sequence="7">78 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 extent of utter abnegation, all that provide a person with joy, pride, comfort, security, nourishment of all sorts; in short, all that it is human to do and enjoy?5 This is the fundamental question: how has it come about at all that the mammal homo sapiens, with its behavioural patterns firmly rooted in simian group-behavior, have produced members that choose to go against the most basic instincts of their species? Many explanations have been ventured, some tilting heavily towards exegesis, others drastically towards scientism and anti religiosity. The theory of eremitic asceticism I want to present may be stated as follows: Asceticism is a practice which (1) is aimed at the ultimate removal from social ties and conventional ways of living in order to reach the highest obtainable goal of the specific religion, (2) in its final conclusion involves a suspension of metaphoric activity, and (3) results in a state of consciousness in which "reality" is "experienced" unmediated by metaphoric interpretation.6 Self-Shrinkage and the Metaphorical Origins of Culture and Cognition Theorizing on the occurrence of hallucinations during sensory deprivation, Charles Brownfield states: "Hallucinary activity may only be an attempt by the particular individual to differentiate and to structure the input [which is of a monotonous nature due to e.g. isolation] so that it has content and meaningfulness, even if the resulting organization is bizarre because of reliance on internal frames of reference in the absence of external ones (Brownfield: 120)." Brownfield touches upon the importance of bodily perceptions for our abil ity to orientate ourselves and maintain a stable psyche: [I]t would appear that bodily perceptions are our anchors to reality and our sense of existence in the psychical world; without these anchors it appears to be extremely 5 I am, of course, aware of the commonsensical and biased assumptions underlying the ques tion when put in this specific way; nevertheless it seems to me to make up a fair point of depar ture. If for nothing else then because it seems to represent the dominant view on asceticism shared by "most people in our present-day world" (Ware: 4). 6 As will be noticed the theory of asceticism differs from the definition in that the perspective in which the former are given are more of an etic kind than the perspective of the latter. That is, the explanation draws on theory not immediately present inside any tradition of asceticism, whereas the definition draws on theoretical elements of an emic kind easily found in many tradi tions of asceticism.</page><page sequence="8">T. Bjernvig t Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 79 difficult to maintain our orientation in space both real and psychological. The key to the mystery of skizophrenia, with its body-image distortions and perceptual disorganization, may well be in some impairment of propriceptive, kinesthetic or tactile mechanism. If drugs which produce physical anesthesia can have, as side effects, symptoms similar to psychotic distortions, then reduction of physical sensation, or some change in its char acteristic qualities, may account for the dramatic corresponding behavioral changes observed (142, italics added). A constant and varied sensory input is needed to uphold a "normal" perception and interpretation of the world. Otherwise, behavioural changes, perceptual disorganization, and psychotic distortions might ensue. Absolute deprivation of sensory stimulation is not possible to obtain—"sensory deprivation" being, then, mainly a monotonizing of sensory input—whatever senses involved. In connection with victims of "brainwashing" Brownfield states that they "are, in a special sense, isolated from those sources of consensual valida tion which normally reinforce their value standards and, consequently, their behavior. The result is to create a kind of hypersuggestibility and receptivity" (32, italics added). Wondering about future space-farers he asks: "What degrees of psychological stress will they be able to tolerate when they are cut off from all stabilizing cues of a familiar perceptual world?" (135, italics added). Brownfield suggests that " [i] t would seem that a kind of dissociative process is required to arrive at the desired state of stillness—a process which ultimately entails disengagement of physical sense perception from interaction with the external world of stimulation" (27, italics added). Brownfield concludes: We have constructed an elaborate, complex, and intricate system of social existence [i.e. civilization] which makes life more convenient and comfortable than in the prim itive state; and this system, together with the physical world within which it exists, provides us with a perceptual frame of reference to interpret the data of our senses... but we give up some of our uniqueness of thought and perception in the process of conforming to expected standards... the natural concomitants of artificially imposed controls on our behaviour, express themselves in confused, conflicting, and often neu rotic interpretations of reality (30, italics added). Thus, Brownfield draws attention to the importance of "sources of consensual validitation," "stabilizing cues of a familiar perceptual world," "a perceptual frame of reference" derived from the social and physical world, and "bodily perceptions" for upholding a "sense of existence in the physical world," (stay ing anchored to reality, maintaining a stable and organized perception, and keeping ego-boundaries from disintegrating).</page><page sequence="9">80 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 In a similar line of thought, K. C. Forman who talks about the "Pure Con sciousness Event" (PCE) and its purported "forgetting" or "un-knowing" of any "mental content," suggests that scientifically verified phenomenons like the "Troxler effect," the "Ditchburn-Riggs effect," and "Ganzfeld" "may be viewed as techniques [i.e. in religious practice] that bring about something like a complete forgetting of occular imput and function" (Forman 1997: 36). The same may apply to "other forms of steady or unchanging sensory input" where "senses and sensations are commonly forgotten." Forman states that "the procedure typically incorporates repetition of a 'mental subroutine,' " and that "the object of one's concentration may be in any sense-modality: verbal like mantras, dervish calls, or short prayers; visual (a y antra, candle or guru's picture); or the concentration may be on a regular bodily process like the heartbeat or the breath." The recycled stimuli subside in the process and "there is a complete disappearance of any sense of thinking, perceiving, and so on" (37). Forman is attacking the position of constructivism taken by Steven Katz (and others) who purports that all mystical experiences are constructed (and experienced) in accordance with the concepts and ideas (i.e. the dogmatics) provided by the respective traditions and that the mystical experiences there fore cannot be universally equal. Instead, Forman insists, what characterizes mystical experience—in this case the PCE—is exactly the opposite, namely that it is un-constructed: "Rather than constructing, we should say that the subject [i.e. the mystic] has ceased constructing visual images" and, Forman concludes, that if "to think is to construct thoughts, and to construct is to think, to cease thinking is to cease constructing" (38). To gain further understanding of what exactly is de-stabilized by the mono tonization of sensory input, and the mystical-ascetic dissociation from con ventional structures, the following quotation from Bruce J. Malina (who defines asceticism as "the shrinkage of the self motivated by avoidance or attainment of goals" (Malina: 162)) is helpful: The self can... be understood as a socialized individual psychophysical entity inter twined with culturally specific meanings. The culturally specific meanings typical of a self include: social identity, social roles (rights and obligations), social statuses, and individual goals, aspirations, possibilities. Self-shrinkage involves the dissociation and elimination of the social self, with its identity, roles, statuses, skills and attributes, from individual self-awareness— a self is always a culturally defined member of a human group [and] its awareness remain [s] culturally moored and socially coproduced. From this perspective, the self is an individualized socially meaningful interpretation of human experience (163).</page><page sequence="10">T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 81 One way of theoretically conceptualising the construction of the social self is to view it as a metaphoric process wherein the self is continually constructed through the entrenchment of metaphoric transfers and stabilizing connections between different metaphoric domains. In Metaphors We Live By Lakoff and Johnson state that "[t]he essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one thing in terms of another" (5) and the gist of their theory of metaphor is that all languages are largely metaphorical in nature, built up of metaphors, whereas formerly the tendency was to see metaphor as a "decoration" of literal language. According to Lakoff and Johnson metaphor is basic to human understanding and interpretation of experience—even to the degree that experience in itself is metaphorically structured. Indeed, the very thought processes of human beings are meta phorical in nature. Human beings categorize things in the world and these categorizations are a result of the way we interact with the world. Therefore, the properties ascribed to objects by the "natural dimensions of categories" are not properties inherent in the objects themselves but rather interac tional properties, based on human perceptions and conceptions (Lakoff and Johnson: 163-64). The way human beings perceive, interpret and understand their world is conditioned by the way their culture and society has structured basic metaphors and metaphoric connections. These, in turn, condition the interaction with this world. In The Literary Mind Mark Turner develops this theme and anchors the "literariness" of human thinking in basic cognitive, that is, neurobiological structures in the brain. In The Way We Think Giles Fauconnier and Mark Turner develops the idea of blending as one of the fundamental ways in which human beings perceive, structure experience, solve problems, create new meaning, interpret and understand the inner and outer, that is, the psycho logical and physical world. The key term "blending" is applied to explain the way we think, perceive and create—from how we bind the discrete sensory perceptions into a coherent whole to how we create works of art. The domains interaction theory, or "conceptual metaphor theory" as it is also called, mainly busy itself with finding and describing already entrenched metaphors not metaphorical linguistic expressions, whereas blending theory is more interested in the online process of—among other things—conceptual integration. In this perspective, conceptual metaphors constitute the stable linguistic structures from which the blending process can then draw its material (Grady et al.: 110). Thus, the domains interaction theory of metaphor and blending theory can be seen as complementary and be combined into one unified stream of research: "By treating all sorts of mappings as formally identical</page><page sequence="11">82 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 at a certain level we can understand the transfer of structure in metaphor as fundamentally similar to the transfer of structure in non-metaphoric instances" (Grady et ah: 120). When we understand one thing in terms of another—and that is, in all probability, the only way we can "understand" anything at all—we project the known onto the unknown (or the understood onto what is not understood), thereby highlighting some things on behalf of others. How human beings interpret the world is therefore dependent on what kind of metaphors struc ture their experience and these again are dependent on how their society and culture has structured metaphors over time. The metaphoric structures namely become entrenched in thought and language and become transparent in the sense that we see by them but do not see them. In all important ways (at least with regard to the present study) the current theories of metaphor and blending are anticipated in the philosophy of Nietzsche and his analysis of language and metaphor. Nietzsche is only men tioned briefly in Johnson's introduction to Philosophical Perspectives on Meta phor (cf. Johnson) and Lakoff states, in his contribution to the revised second edition of Metaphor and Thought, that "Nietzsche... held that all language is metaphorical, a theory at odds with those results indicating that a significant amount of everyday language is not metaphorical..." (Lakoff: 248). But as Tim Murphy has shown in Nietzsche, Metaphor, Religion, Nietzsche's theory of metaphor has much in common with the domains interaction theory of meta phor and the latter may in fact clarify aspects of the former: Nietzsche redefines metaphor in terms very different form the tropology of traditional rhetoric, radicalizing metaphor to encompass nearly all human cognition and cultural activity. This radical extension of metaphor is affected by his use of he German verb übertragen, and the noun, Ubertragung. As Daniel Breazeale has explained: The operative word in Nietzsche's discussion of this [metaphor] is Übertragen, which means "to carry over," "transfer," "translate," "transmit," etc. A contempo rary instance of the process designated by the term is the "transference" of sound waves into electromagnetic signals. Translated literally into Greek, Übertragen becomes pera-tpepeiv. Recondite as this etymological excursus might appear, it provides us with an essential clue for interpreting Nietzsche's notorious claim that all words are "metaphors" (Murphy: 1-2). In addition, Murphy explains that in the Nietzschean understanding of Uber tragung, "the structure of metaphor is a carrying over of one thing to some where else." What is meant by this in a linguistic context, Murphy says, the</page><page sequence="12">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 83 "domains interaction theory" of metaphor can provide ample answer for "in its theoretical elaboration of the basic structure of metaphor in a way sympa thetic to, and clarifying of, Nietzsche's view of metaphor" (37). This view of the role metaphor—conceived of as Ühertragung—plays in human percep tion, conceptualisation and interpretation of the world is more radical than Lakoff and Johnson's, though not more radical than the theory of blending. Some of the meanings Nietzsche attributes to metaphor can be substituted with (aspects of) the term "blending." In On truth and lie in an extra-moral sense Nietzsche postulates one meta phoric Ubertragung between "nerve stimulus" and "image," a second between "image" and "metaphor" and—by implication—a third between "metaphor" and "concept." For Nietzsche it is—as Murphy states—"metaphors all the way down" (xvii). It is this assumption that makes Nietzsche famously exclaim: What is truth? a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, anthropomorphisms, in short, a sum of human relations which were poetically and rhetorically heightened, trans ferred, and adorned, and after long use seem solid, canonical, and binding to a nation. Truths are illusions about which it has been forgotten that they are illusions, worn-out metaphors without sensory impact, coins which have lost their image and now can be used only as metal, and no longer as coins (Nietzsche 1989: 250). A main property of metaphor for both Nietzsche, and Lakoff and Johnson, is their ability to create similarities, or identity, between disparate things or (con ceptual) domains of experience/perception. This property motivates Nietzsche's main criticism of metaphors: they make equal what inherently, or in their "true essence" is absolutely unique: The only way to subdue the manifold is by constructing classes, e.g. by calling a large number of ways of acting "bold." We explain them to ourselves when we bring them under the category "bold." All explaining and knowing is actually nothing but catego rizing. With a bold leap, the multiplicity of things is now brought under a single head ing when we treat them as though they were so many countless actions of a single quality.... Here we have a transference: an abstraction holds together innumerable actions and is taken to be their cause Metonymy. A false inference. A predicate is confused with a sum of predicates (definition) (Nietzsche 1999: 47-48). This process of metaphorization is completed in concepts (dead metaphors) that reifies metaphors and homogenizes a host of unique entities into abstract categories that transforms the infinite variety of experience into rows of identi cal manifestations, or examples, of the "same" thing:</page><page sequence="13">84 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 Imitation is the opposite of knowing, to the extent that knowing certainly does not want to admit any transference, but wishes instead to cling to the impression without metaphor and apart from the consequences. The impression is petrified for this pur pose; it is captured and stamped by means of concept. But there is no "real" expression and no real knowing apart from metaphor.... The most accustomed metaphors, the usual ones, now pass for truths and as standards for measuring the rarer ones (50). [He states further:] Knowledge, strictly speaking, has only the form of tautology and is empty. All the knowledge which is of assistance to us involves the identification of things which are not the same, of things which are only similar.... The omitting of what is individual provides us with the concept, and with this our knowledge begins: in cate gorization, in the establishment of classes (51). To Nietzsche, the conviction that this identity is a property of the things themselves, an objective truth discovered by human beings, is an atrocity. A sign of the human race's megalomaniac anthropomorphic projections of the earth, world, and universe. But what is of real importance in this connection is that these classifications, these metaphors, concepts, Übertragungen—which in their turn also constitute the basis of narrativity and interpretation (cf. e.g. Murphy: 70)—are what creates the hierarchy of valuations and structurations of experience and the "reality" of (a) culture: The systems of meaning that interact to produce interpretation in Nietzsche's sense are precisely what in domains interaction theory is meant by the term "domains." Domains of meaning preexist any individual speech act or act of interpretation. They are the conditions for the possibility of such acts. Consequently, neither metaphor nor inter pretation, on this theory, are subjective, preferential, supplements to meaning. Insofar as meaning is produced by the interaction of various objectively given, even if contin gently, arbitrarily, and conventionally figured, domains of cultural meanings (dis courses, taxonomies, symbols, religions, etc.), then the activity of transport between these domains is the basis of culture (Murphy: 66-67). We may gain further insight into the connection between metaphors and cul ture by turning to David Owen's rendering of Nietzsche's theory of culture: Culture begins with the establishment of customs, for Nietzsche, simply because the transformation of metaphors into concepts, that is, entrenchment, is dependent on making communal life regular and calculable, and this is achieved through the reification of communal life as custom. The 'morality of mores' precisely in so far as it is a hindrance of new experiences'... renders behaviour regular and calculable, thus enabling the entrenchment of the metaphors constitutive of customs, that is, their transformation into concepts and, eventually, synthetic a priori judgements (Owen: 36). [And, again:] it is the reification of metaphors into concepts which constitutes the condition of possibility for the belief in causality and the generation of causal</page><page sequence="14">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 85 explanation What is involved in the reification of a metaphor into a concept? The notion of reification refers here to the process of entrenchment that indicates the con stitution of a specific form of life, that is, a culture. It is, it seems, through the activity of culture formation that the aesthetic status of a metaphor is forgotten and it is trans formed into a concept (34). The process of metaphorization, then, artistically creates identity between things that actually are discrete individual entities, actions, situations, and through concepts metaphors are entrenched and become the "material" from which society and culture is built. Thus, the layers of entrenched metaphors are embedded in the individual and they condition her or his conceptualiza tions and experiences of reality; much as in the "fundamental dialectic process of society" consisting in the three "moments" of externalization, objectivation, and internalization described by Peter L. Berger: Externalization is the ongoing outpouring of human being into the world, both in the physical and the mental activity of men. Objectivation is the attainment by the prod ucts of this activity (again both physical and mental) of a reality that confronts its original producers as a facticity external to and other than themselves. Internalization is the reappropriation by men of this same reality, transforming it once again from structures of the objective world into structures of the subjective consciousness (Berger: 13-14).7 It is important to keep in mind, though, that the metaphoric activity, whether linguistic or cultural, is as an expression of underlying thought processes that are at their base probably more or less innate (cf. Turner 1998). That is, the "dialectic process of society" must be considered a feedback process between innate structures and culturally instigated metaphoric transfers, or, as it is, culturally entrenched associations between things, situations, ideas, etc. With Jeppe Sinding Jensen we can talk of a "downward causation perspective:" Humans are conditioned by what they work on, because cultural models and motiva tions are transformed into cognitive models and motivations. Powerful semantic met aphors condition the way we think, and a discourse—even fictitious—may strongly determine (within a range of cognitive boundary conditions, of course) our concep tions of how things are and how we feel about them. Hence the power of religion, or of any other explanatory system, to govern the lives of humans Basic-level schémas are in all probability primary in an evolutionary perspective but, once produced, it is 7 Throughout the rest of the article I shall return frequently to Berger, and I shall do so because Berger—in a, perhaps, more systematized form than Nietzsche—presents us with a highly useful theory for connecting culture and cognition.</page><page sequence="15">86 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 quite likely that higher-level organizations of semantic principles, e.g. in syntaxes, may take on their 'own existence' and feed-back upon the lower-level representations. This is the 'downward causation perspective. It accounts for our ability to learn from the experience of interacting with our environments... by means of the plasticity of our brains and minds (Jensen 2002: 219-220). Even though Lakoff finds Nietzsche's theory of metaphor at odds with his own, both agree that metaphors can have serious implications for reality and people's experience of it. Under the heading "Physical symptoms" Lakoff explains that the system of conventional metaphor—which functions on an unconscious level—can be the course of psychological states expressing them selves as physical symptoms. For example, a special case of the submapping DIFFICULTIES ARE IMPEDIMENTS TO MOTION, namely DIFFI CULTIES ARE BURDENS, may cause a person encountering difficulties to walk with his shoulders stooped, as if carrying a heavy burden (Lakoff: 242-43). Likewise, e.g. the metaphor TIME IS MONEY has had grave consequences, in the form of the budgeting of time existing throughout American culture (243). And laws, as well as a country's foreign policy, may be real results of metaphors. Lakoff concludes: [M]uch of what is real in a society or in the experience of an individual is structured and made sense of via conventional metaphor Experiential bases and realizations of metaphors are two sides of the same coin: they are both correlations in real experience that have the same structure as the correlations in metaphors. The difference is that experiential bases precede, ground, and make sense of conventional metaphorical mappings, whereas realizations follow, and are made sense of, via the conventional metaphors. And... one generations realizations of metaphor can become part of the next generations experiential basis for that metaphor (244). As will be recalled, the thesis of this article is that asceticism in its final conclu sion involves a suspension of metaphoric activity, and results in a state of con sciousness in which "reality" is "experienced" unmediated by metaphoric interpretation. This entails that the methods and techniques applied by ascet ics can bring the metaphoric transfers ( Ubertragungen) to a halt, or de-reify those already entrenched and reified through cultural and social influences, in order to appreciate their originally aesthetic quality and to—as a result—reach or undergo the mystical event: the "experience" of non-duality, the feeling of being at one with the world/the godhead etc. In this view all that characterize the mystically oriented ascetic, and all the methods he applies, seem directed at deconstructing and loosening the hard ened entrenchments, and physical manifestations, of metaphoric transfers.</page><page sequence="16">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 87 The traces of this de-constructing (for the claim of the ascetical mystic is that these entrenchments and manifestations are constructed things without true value or essence) activity can be found on most, if not all, levels of ascetic expression, from geographical setting to textual expression. To appreciate this we will now turn to some sources for asceticism. Apophatic Narratives of Asceticism and the Dialectic of Structure and Anti-Structure The Mi la ras pa'i rnam thar8 (" The Liberation of Mi la ras pa") tells the story of the aspiration of the great Tibetan ascetic saint Mi la ras pa to obtain enlight enment and the fulfilment of this endeavour. The text referred to here is the version written by gTsang smyon he ru ka, the "madman he ru ka (wrathful deity) from gTsang," who compiled and wrote the biography in 1488. gTsang smyon he ru ka was in the lineage of Ras chung pa, a close disciple of Mi la (Tiso 1996: 10). Mi la ras pa himself lived from 1040-1123 and the biography is thus written some 350 years after the death of Mi la ras pa. To what extent can a text like this be used as a source for asceticism? To answer this question one must divide the matter into two issues. The first issue is whether the Mi la ras pa'i rnam thar can be considered a source to the actual life of the historical individual Mi la ras pa. The answer to this is quite obvious: there may or may not be parts of the narrative that have survived three and a half century's oral tradition and thus, some of these may reflect more or less realisti cally Mi las life and work. In all probability it is not much though, and the rnam thar cannot stand as a viable source to the actual life of Mi la ras pa. Rather, it must be apprehended as a result of a long, creative tradition, both oral and liter ary, of which gTsang smyon he ru ka's version is an example (Tiso 1996: 14). The second issue is whether the biography of Mi la can be said to reflect real ascetic practices and experiences, accumulated and compiled throughout time and, in this instance, condensed around the historical figure of Mi la ras pa. Often, hagiographies—no matter to what degree they may or may not be factual—embody ideals (of practice) that subsequently become recipes or a "source of inspiration" for ascetic life (cf. Tiso 1997: 989). Or, the hagiography may simply reflect already established practices. In whatever way one views the 8 I shall follow the—perhaps dubious—habit of writing names of persons and places, and titles with initial capita] letters in transliterated Tibetan. The Wylie method for transliteration is applied.</page><page sequence="17">88 T. Bjemvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 matter, the hagiography will in many instances function as a discursive center from which action is generated. The hagiography may have its political and social agenda, be polemical or satirical, and is surely anchored in the present of the hagiographer (cf. Tiso 1997: 989). At the same time the hagiographer is often a person who emulates the saintly, in this case ascetical, life himself or herself. And thus, the biographer will often be a person well versed in ascetical and mystical practices (Tiso 1996: 15-16). When young, Mi la ras pa avenges wrongs imposed on him and his mother and sister. His uncle and aunt have usurped the household of Mi la and his family following the death of Mi la ras pa's father. Mi la's mother is a strong, vengeful and cunning woman and she urges Mi la to take action against the usurpers. By means of magic Mi la ras pa kills a large party of visitors attending the wedding of the uncle's son (the uncle and aunt escapes) and later he destroys his home valley's harvest by means of magically invoked hailstorms. Mi la "repented the evil deeds of magic and hailstorms" (de Jong: 51, 3-4) out of fear of the karmic consequences and decides to follow the way of true religion, the Buddhist Dharma. He becomes the disciple of the famous Mar pa lo tsa ba (Mar pa the Translator), and undergoes a number of terrible ordeals in order to obtain his guru's treasured instructions: a task in which he finally succeeds. After having gained considerable insight into tantric practices he leaves Mar pa to visit his home village, motivated by an ominous dream. He finds his paternal house in ruins and spends seven days sitting in meditation on the bones of his dead mother in order to liberate her—and his dead father—from the cycle of samsara. Then, contemplating the transience of all samsaric things, he renews his resolve to seek solitude in the desolate moun tains in order to gain enlightenment. As Mar pa providently sings to Mi la before his departure: In the house and field of [your] cherished native place [you will find] a teacher of impermanent illusion. In the company of [your] aunt and sister [you will find] a teacher who destroys illusion. In the rock cavern of the desolate valley there is a market where samsara can be bartered with nirvana, (de Jong: 106, 17-22)' 9 [All of my subsequent translations are from de Jong's Tibetan text. The Tibetan has been omitted but page references are given throughout for readers who want to exam the source mate rials in Tibetan.] Mar pa, perhaps clairvoyantly, has access to knowledge of the current situation in Mi la's home valley, and foresees what will happen when Mi la himself gains knowledge of this</page><page sequence="18">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 89 From then on Mi la ras pa meditates and practices tantric teachings in the solitary confinement of Tibet's mountainous wilderness: Native place, home, field and the like are samsaric phenomena without essence; let sentient beings who rejoice in [these things] without essence take [them]. As a hermit, I go to obtain liberation. Gracious father, Mar pa the Translator, bless [this] beggar [that he may] complete the retreat, (de Jong: 113, 7-12) Mi la ends up completely emaciated and naked, his skin having become green due to his sole diet: nettles, boiled into soup. Mi la has vowed not to visit inhabited valleys to satisfy his bodily and material needs: "[I] made a commit ment not to descend to any inhabited place: As long as I have not become one who is endowed with superior experience and realization—not even if I die of starvation in this mountain retreat will I descend to cram into the mouth the dust of alms-food and food offered to the dead."10 Singing of all the things he will not descend to attain, he states: "The valley the scene of which [you] desire to see is empty. No conditioned object of desire can do away with weariness."11 Pe ta, who has found out the whereabouts of Mi la, brings food and drink to him. The sudden intake of nourishment jeopardizes his spiritual practice. When Mi la left Mar pa to go to his village, Mar pa gave him a sealed message containing instructions on how to cope with this very situation clairvoyantly foreseen by Mar pa. Mi la reads the message and, following the instructions, bypasses the danger. Because of having been thus nourished his practice is strengthened to the point of enlightenment: In general [I] understood that all dharmas related to samsara and nirvana are interde pendent and, furthermore, [that the] the ground of all is ones own consciousness free of polarization (phyogs lhung dang bral ba). Samsara results from the circumstance of adhering to the way of wrong views. Nirvana results from the circumstance of adher ing to the way of [verified] certainty. The essence of those two [i.e. samsara and nirvana] is determined (kho thag gchod) emptiness and clear light. In particular, [I] understood that the qualities which now had arisen in [my] continuum of being were caused by [my] earlier meditation [and also] had arisen from [the] interdependent conditions of having assimilated food and the profound instructions [of Mar pa]. Due to (... snas) 10 (de Jong: 124, 29-31). As Jáschke brings attention to, "rung" can have the same meaning as "yang" which I think is the case here (Jáschke: 532). 11 (de Jong: 126, 19-20).</page><page sequence="19">90 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 [that I] was lead to a special definite understanding with regard to the path of esoteric means which is carrying pleasure into the path.12 Then Mi la ras pa breaks out into the kind of song for which he is so famous, in this case a "song of the Essence of Interdependence" (rten 'brel snying po'i glu), stating, among other things: Both the rock cavern in a desolate landscape and the sincere spiritual virtuousness are the interdependent conditions for accomplishing what is intended. The essence of the interdependent conditions is emptiness."13 At the time of this spiritual breakthrough Mi la gains miraculous abilities: "During the day, the experience arose that [I] was able to perform immeasur able, incredible miracles such as transforming my body at will and float in the sky, etc. At night in [my] dreams [I] was able, without obstacles, to render vis ible and examine all [forms] of existence from top to bottom."14 He then actu ally (dngos su)15 flies through the air and visits a former place of meditation. After having seen a rich and popular lama the role of whom she would like Mi la to adopt, Pe ta decides that Mi la must come to his senses and start tak ing care of his family. In response Mi la sings a song that reveals monastic life for what it (according to Mi la) is: the direct way into the "Eight Worldly Principles".16 Still, Pe ta instructs Mi la to make some clothes for himself: "Please sew of this woollen blanket some trousers; 1 will be back quickly [...]," and then she departs. On her return she discovers to her great regret that instead of trousers Mi la has produced some very strange clothing indeed. In the words of Mi la: "From my sisters woolen blanket I made a hat which cov ered my entire head, a sheath for each and every finger of my hands, boots for [my] feet, and a holster for my private parts and put them on."17 Pe ta acknowl 12 de Jong: 136,21-29. 13 de Jong: 137, 16-19. 14 de Jong: 138, 5-8. 15 de Jong: 138, 12. 16 de Jong: 146-147. "The Eight Worldly Principles:" '"jig rten chos brgyad:" according to Das (428) they comprise: nyedpa: pain, profit; ma rnyedpa: loss; snyen pa: fame, reputation; mi rnyen pa: bad name, notoriety; smadpa: scandal, slander; bstodpa: praise; bde ba: happiness; sdug bsngal ba: misery or unhappiness. In short: all the things that one come to worry about, strive after, or wishes to avoid when one is engaged in the world of structure; i.e. the 'worldly life.' 17 de Jong: 148, 19-24. This episode testifies to the droll wittiness the story displays in quite a few places. In this case the baroque behavior of Mi la is underscored by the way in which Pe ta asks him to produce some proper clothes: "'tshem drags mdzod," in which "drags" signals a</page><page sequence="20">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 91 edges her defeat, and with an "angry face"18 gives him food, saying: "Whatever proper [thing I] said, [my] elder brother is not acting in accordance with my instructions."19 In Mi la ras pa'i rnam thar, Mi la ras pa undergoes a sustained period of liminality (from his religious conversion until death) and exhibits almost exemplary the characteristics of asceticism sketched out above, as well as Victor Turner's analytical term "anti-structure." Elaborating on Van Gennep, Victor Turner presents a valuable interpreta tion of the liminal personae in The Ritual Process. Turner's main focus is the liminal phase in rituals but he expands the theoretical framework to embrace more permanent liminalities. One such permanent figure of liminality is the ascetic. In Turner's designation the liminal phase is rendered "communitas," or anti-structure.20 Ritual liminality is typical of tribal societies and Turner sees a connection between the degree of social specialization and the duration of liminality: What appears to have happened is that with the increasing specialization of society and culture, with progressive complexity in the social division of labor, what was in tribal society principally a set of transitional qualities "betwixt and between" defined states of culture and society has become itself an institutionalized state. [...] Transition has become a permanent condition. Nowhere has this institutionalization of liminality been more clearly marked and defined than in the monastic and mendicant states in the great world religions (Turner: 107). The ascetic with his "long drawn-out, solemn ritual of dissociation" (Brown 1982: 131) can be apprehended as standing in the ancient "tradition" of the shaman, assuming "a statusless status external to the secular social structure" polite request and "mdzod" is the imperative of the respectful form of"byed pa," namely "mdzad pa." Pe ta is trying to flatter Mi la into behaving like a normal person. On the backdrop of this elaborated request Mi la's solution to the sewing-task stands out in all its splendid craziness. 18 Tib. "ngo nag," lit. "black face." 15 de Jong: 150, 11-12. 20 A distinction between "structure" and "anti-structure" may, of course, be seen as problem atic. Does, for example, "structure" and "anti-structure," when combined in an opposition, together constitute a (binary) structure? And what is "anti-structure" at all? The way I see it—and I think that this is what Turner meant by this dichotomy—the answer to these questions is quite simple: by "structure" he means the socially, culturally, architecturally, linguistically (etc.) struc tured world humans normally inhabit. The designation "anti-structure" simply implies whatever can be construed as an opposite to this conventional world; i.e. anything that turns the structures of the "normal" world up-side down, and thereby constitutes a subversive threat (or exciting allure) to this world.</page><page sequence="21">92 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 (116) through initiation, symbolic death and birth (107) endowing the shaman/ascetic with "magica-religious properties" that "liminal situations and roles are almost everywhere attributed with" (108). Liminal "personae" are "being reduced or ground down to a uniform condition to be fashioned anew and endowed with additional powers" (95) and Turner highlights their anti rank, anti-hierarchical, and socially anti-distinctive stance. "The neophyte," Turner states, "must be a tabula rasa, a blank slate, on which is inscribed the knowledge and wisdom of the group The ordeals and humiliations... to which neophytes are submitted represent... a destruc tion of the previous status" (103). It is reasonable that we may substitute "the knowledge and wisdom of the group" with the techniques and dogmas of a religious and/or mystical tradition. As representational of the "structure" side of the binary oppositions of structure and anti-structure, Turner enlists, among other things: state (as opposed to transition), partiality, heterogeneity, structure, inequality; systems of nomenclature, property, status, distinctions of clothing, sexuality, rank, wealth; selfishness, secularity, speech, kinship rights and obligations, sagacity, and complexity (106-107). All these things are exactly the things that the ascetic wishes to avoid, or does not care about. Mi la ras pa adequately expresses this when Dze ses dis creetly suggests that they marry: Because I am one who in accordance with ascetic practice is getting food like birds and mice, there is no need for a field. Because [I] am dwelling in a desolate rock cavern as my abode there is no need of a house. Because someone capable (rung) of having power [over all of] India will have to leave it behind at the time of death, therefore, if one mentally renounces [all of that already] from now on, then henceforth [one] will become utterly happy. So, having turned [my] back on all people and their practice, do not place [your] hopes for a man upon me!21 A useful "textually oriented" parallel to Victor Turners theory ofliminality can be found in Michael A. Sells' Mystical Language of Unsaying. In the introduction Sells develops a novel approach to the study of mysticism. He identifies a genre of mystical literature as being "apophatic discourse," that is, a discourse 21 de Jong: 120, 10-15. "khang pas" is probably an error of the copyist of the text and should have been "khang pa'i" (they sound the same), even though de Jong has no alternatives listed here. In this passage Mi la is explaining to Dze ses why he cannot fulfill any worldly obligations to her (and anyone else). But he is also trying to persuade her to follow him on the religious path. His description of his own situation is at the same time a sermon meant to convert her.</page><page sequence="22">T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 93 of "un-saying or speaking-away" (apo phasis), "commonly paired with kata phasis (affirmation, saying, speaking-with)" (Sells: 2-3). The apophatic dis course is a solution of the "aporia (unresolvable dilemma) of transcendence" (2). The apophatic discourse that Sells has made the object of his study is "those writings in which unameability is not only asserted but performed. In those writings, the effort to affirm transcendence leads to a continuing series of retractions, a propositionally unstable and dynamic discourse in which no single statement can rest on its own as true or false, or even as meaningful" (3). These may, following Sells, be for example, Eckehart's sermons, the Taoist Tao Te Ching, and the Mahàyàna Buddhist Vïmalakirtinirdesasûtra. Apophatic discourse results in "an open-ended dynamic that strains against its own reifications and ontologies—a language of ¿feontology" in which "the hierar chical levels of being that are posited are unsaid from within. At the heart of this unsaying is a radical dialectic of transcendence and immanence" (7). This process "yields a semiotic spiral motion ever deeper into the prereferential ground (or groundlessness) of the discourse" and produces, momentarily throughout the text, "the distinctive semantic event" which Sells labels "the meaning event" (9). This event reproduces the mystical "experience" on the textual level as it "displaces the grammatical object, affirms a moment of ontological pre-construction," thereby "evok[ing] in the reader an event that is—in its movement beyond structures of self and other, subject and object— structurally analogous to the event of mystical union" (10). In contrast to apophatic discourse Sells posits apophatic theory, which "affirms the ultimate ineffability of the transcendent; but... affirms ineffability without turning back upon the naming used in its own affirmation of ineffability" (3). That is, it does not perform the "meaning event" but propounds or, so to speak, preaches it. Thus, the exclamation of Mi la ras pa at the point of enlightenment cited above should be labelled "apophatic theory." Mi la ras pa's statement does not concern itself with any "ineffability" with regard to the enlightened "experi ence" but it still outplays the aporia, the paradox of transcendence, in that it postulates the "interdependence" of the ontological opposites of samsara and nirvana (and thereby those of structure and anti-structure) and that the essence of both are "reconciled in luminous emptiness"—that is, in ¿/«ontology. It is a kataphatic statement but one that dissolves a fundamental dualism (i.e. that between samsara and nirvana). It explains the insight in the non-duality of existence gained by Mi la ras pa without, however, exactly performing it discursively. But, adding what may be called "apophatic narrative" can extend Sells' typology of apophasis.</page><page sequence="23">94 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 When dealing with asceticism one must also deal with narrative, in that an important source of ascetic practice—as opposed to (dogmatic, emic) theory about asceticism—is often found in hagiographies. In the instance of Mi la ras pa i mam thar not only the theoretical statement by Mi la ras pa cited above is apophatic: the very structure of the story as such can be read as being apophatic too. Metaphors exist not only as a property of a few words, but also on the level of sentence, and even on the level of whole narratives, e.g. in the form of the parable (cf. Turner 1998). In Mi la ras pa'i mam thar there are two major themes, or metaphoric domains, namely those of anti-structure represented (mainly) by Mi la ras pa, and structure (the conventional) represented (mainly) by Mi la ras pas betrothed, Dzes se, his sister Pe ta, and various people "of the world" that come across Mi la in the wilderness. The whole story can be seen to revolve around these meetings, illustrating situations of conflict, negotia tion, submission, animosity, appreciation, understanding, and so forth, between the ascetic and the worldly life. John Powers writes much the same, when describing the binary pairs figuring in the story of Mi la ras pa: We see a distinction and evaluation of opposites, such as: home life/life in a cave; fam ily obligations/religious practice; prepared food/scraps and nettles; samsàra/nirvàna. The fundamental opposition on which all the others are based is the dichotomy of ignorance/enlightenment, the main dichotomy underlying all Buddhist doctrine and practice. There is also an implied valuation of the latter parts of these dichotomies and a devaluation of the former ones. Things like the comforts of home life, a loving and close-knit family, good food, and continued existence have an intuitive appeal for most people, but the story indicates that these pleasures are transitory and eventu ally lead to pain. Only a life of religious practice, which involves renunciation of the pleasures of the world and going against its ways, leads to final peace and happiness (Powers: 72). Mi la himself moves from structure to anti-structure motivated by repen tance. He becomes the anti-structure par excellence: utterly enervated and green, eating only nettles, owning nothing, not caring about "the eyes of the world" at all. Pe ta, most clearly when suggesting that Mi la ras pa become a decent lama endowed with wealth and servants, tries in vain to project the conventional onto Mi la, to metaphorize him with the properties of "struc ture." This projection is manifested in the concrete token of the woollen blan ket meant for Mi la's trousers. But Mi la rejects both the role of luxuriant lama and the monastic life. The concrete manifestation of this projection, the woollen blanket, is not just rejected by Mi la ras pa—it is, in a similar con</page><page sequence="24">T. Bjornvigl Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 95 crete way, deconstructed by Mi la ras pa; literally cut into pieces and applied in an opposite, anti-structural fashion of how it is meant to be applied (i.e. cases for fingers instead of sleeves for arms, no trousers but holster for private parts). Mi la ras pa is out of reach of the projections of conventionality—he has become proof against any kind of metaphorical projection. He has taken beer and meat—perhaps an acknowledgement of the Middle Way of Buddhism—and reached enlightenment. Now he is endlessly free to become anything: the laws of nature no longer assert any power over him. At this crucial point in the nar rative samsara—the essence of "structure"—is perceived to result from the cir cumstance of adhering to the way of wrong views. "That is, samsara is nothing substantial, ontological—and neither is nirvana for that matter. And their common source is hardly substantial either as something that is "empty" can not be "substantial." This is an apophatic moment, a "meaning event" in the narrative in which "the hierarchical levels of being are unsaid from within" and demonstrates "a radical dialectic of transcendence and immanence" (cf. Sells above). In apophasis metaphors of "overflowing" or "emanation" is often found and Sells states: In nonapophatic uses of the emanation metaphor, a defined and stable hierarchy is constructed, from the source of emanation through descending levels of distance to the final, furthest level. In apophatic discourse, the overflow devolves into a series of logical and semantic dilemmas. The dualisms upon which language of "flowing out" is based, such as the distinction between the vessel that receives the flow and the content it receives, are ultimately fused into paradoxes (the vessel is the content) as the apopha sis unravels its initial premise about the source of emanation. That initial premise is that the source of emanation is not a supreme being, not a being or entity at all. In the words of Eriugena, it is nothing, or no-thing (6-7). Substituting "metaphors of emanation, or overflowing" and the apophatic moment with, respectively, the "metaphoric domains" of structure (e.g. Pe ta) and anti-structure (e.g. Mi la ras pa) the whole movement of the narrative can be perceived as the constant dialectic of one metaphoric domain turning back upon another. Mi la ras pa—as a "predication" of the narrative—constantly turns back on the kataphatic statements of conventionality. Up until the point of enlightenment this dialectic is in the form of a sustained tension. At the moment of enlightenment this tension collapses, as "the metaphor turns back upon itself in the hard version of the paradox: The emanation [i.e. samsara] is the return [i.e. nirvana]" (208). Mi la ras pa is then capable of freely accepting and rejecting metaphoric projections; and can project himself freely into and onto anything—he</page><page sequence="25">96 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 becomes, so to speak, Master of Metaphor, and the interdependence of samsara and nirvana the Blend to End All Blends—as they negate each other and dis solve into "emptiness and clear light." Mi la ras pa also states: "Having been released from obstacles, [I] under stood [spiritual] defects as qualities. [And I] grasped discursive thought [as] the rise of the dharmakaya."22 From this point on the metaphoric projections of language, society, culture, and even those basic projections forming his very perception, has become de-reified; transparent in the sense that they are no longer substantial. The virtual, illusory nature of perception—and by implica tion that which is perceived—has been revealed. And yet there is not an oppo site to this "experience" of the world as an illusion. It cannot be seen in light of anything else. The mystic—in this case Mi la—have no choice than to be it. In the end, "the object of meditation, the act of meditating, and the one who meditates; those three have merged into one. Therefore [I] presently do not know [how to] meditate."23 At the end of the story, many years after the events described here, Mi la ras pa dies and is "absorbed into radiant light,"24 follow ing which numerous ominous miracles occur, signifying Mi la's final entrance into the Buddha state. "Emptiness and clear light" (cf. above) is reminiscent of Forman's Pure Consciousness Event (PCE) and Forman himself perceives the PCE as a "rudi mentary" mystical experience and suggests that more advanced states may be reached in which the mystical union is perpetuated in daily life (Forman: 8). From the point of view of mystical literature it seems to be possible to reclaim the conventional world of metaphoric projections and entrenchments without getting caught up in their transfers, to live the knowledge that e.g. structure and anti-structure is an illusive dualism without substance. What makes the transition between the unenlightened and the enlightened view of existence possible is, of course, the practice and teachings of the Dharma. As Mar pa puts it, addressing Mi la: "The boundary dividing samsara and nirvana is [found] in the holy Dharma which is the vital essence of the dàkinls" (de Jong: 107, 7-8). Thus, the Dharma is a teaching that on one level takes the duality of samsara and nirvana for granted, thereby affirming it, but at the same time constitutes the very medium through which one can transgress this duality. And thus, the Dharma practiced by Mi la is what makes the collapse of the dichotomy of 22 de Jong: 136,20-21. 23 de Jong: 156,21-22. 24 de Jong: 192, 12.</page><page sequence="26">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 97 structure and anti-structure possible. It is, so to speak, a remedy not only for the conditioning of the individual by the conventional world but also for the conditioning of the individual by a life in liminality. Solely living the anti-structure is, in the end, to let oneself be conditioned by yet another illusive metaphor; it is only a means to negate conventionally entrenched metaphors, not a goal in it self. This is implied in the beginning of the Mi la raspa'i mam thar where Mi la, before seeking the instructions of Mar pa, tries to practice the teachings of rdzogs pa chen po (the Great Perfection) which is for the especially well-disposed practitioners. Promised that one can gain liberation by this practice in almost no time, and without almost any effort, Mi la simply lies down and waits for the miracle to happen: The lama said: "This, my true teaching, the Great Perfection, [is like this:] if [one] meditates for a day [one becomes] Buddha in one day [and] if [one] meditates for a night [one becomes] Buddha in one night. For those lucky ones with karmic merit, it is a fortunate, most powerful Dharma practice [which just by] hearing [it leads them to] liberation without [them] having to contemplate [it]. Therefore [I] give [it to you]." After [the lama] had initiated [me] and given [me] instructions, I thought: "[When I] first practised magic great signs [of my ability] showed in fourteen days. Seven days for hail was enough. Now there is a Dharma practice, which is even easier than [produc ing] magic and hails; by [just] hearing [the teaching] those who have karmic merit does not need to contemplate [it]. Because I have met with [a method] like this I am also one who has karmic merit," [and] proudly I lay down to sleep, without meditat ing. (de Jong: 52, 15-26.) Realizing that Mi la is a hard case and not fit for this particular practice, the lama urges him to seek out Mar pa and obtain his instructions. But the very fact that Mar pa himself is a householder means that the ascetic way of life is not the only possible way to free oneself of conditioning metaphors. In the Mi la ras pa'i mam thar it is never professed that someone living a worldly life as a householder cannot possibly be liberated. The main thing is one's attitude: the extent to which one is able to dwell in the world without being ensnared by its dangers (Powers: 73). And, as Mi la himself states when pondering whether to get married like Mar pa: "A hare, deeming it fit to jump about, adopting the style of a lion, would fall into an abyss and surely die."25 So, even though Mi la ras pa attains liberation and becomes "Master of metaphor" as described above, he does not descend from his lonely mountain 25 de Jong: 114, 2-3. The implication being that Mar pa is the lion, which is strong enough to lead a worldly, conventional life without being drawn into the snares that this sort of life repre sents. If Mi la were to try to live like Mar pa he would be like a hare trying to follow a lion.</page><page sequence="27">98 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 to marry or take up the life of a householder. His way of living remains in liminality, in the reigns of anti-structure. But his consciousness and his cogni tive apparatus is freed and able to move fluidly beyond the borders of structure and anti-structure, immanence and transcendence, samsara and nirvana; indeed, beyond the borders of the universe. As described above, Michael A. Sells has analysed apophatic discourse, the writings of mystics who try to express the inexpressible, i.e. that which cannot be metaphorized or, as it is, likened to anything else, and it is the claim of this article that the narrative of asceticism can be seen as apophatic too. Not all that undergoes the hardships of mystical asceticism reaches the apophatic "meaning event" or the absolute, momentary or long lasting, halt ing of metaphoric activity. The ascetic may as well reach levels of aesthetic metaphoric creativity beneath the hardened layers of concepts.26 Nietzsche talks about how language (and thereby, by implication, cognition as such) cre ates identity by "inherently" discrete "things," and so does Berger and in a way that more than merely echoes Nietzsche: The fact of language... can readily be seen as the imposition of order upon experience. Language nomizes by imposing differentiation and structure upon the ongoing flux of experience. As an item of experience is named, it is ipso facto, taken out of this flux and given stability as the entity so named. Language further provides a fundamental order of relationships by the addition of syntax and grammar to vocabulary.... Every empir ical language may be said to constitute a nomos in the making The original nomi zing act is to say that an item is this, and thus not that. As this original incorporation of the item into an order that includes other items is followed by sharper linguistic designations... the nomizing act intends a comprehensive order of all items that may be linguistically objectivated, that is, intends a totalizing nomos (Berger: 29-30). If Nietzsche (and Berger) are right about the metaphoric tendency to create identity between distinct things, it leaves one speculating if the ascetical mys tic (having stopped all metaphorizing activity) does not experience the utterly unique (the thing as it stands alone). If what the mystic experiences is the 26 Nietzsche's ambivalent relationship to asceticism may stem from this situation: Nietzsche resented the life-quenching, anti-human side of asceticism, its halting of metaphoric activity— but loved its creative potentials. In numerous places Nietzsche praises solitude and denigrates the crowd and its consensual hegemony over individual originality. He wanted to blow up the mil lennium-thick crust of entrenched metaphors (the généalogie method being his main explo sive)—not to wipe out the creation of metaphors as such. Rather, he wanted to create new ones—and did so, with a vengeance. Yet, he bore a grudge towards metaphors' tendency to make the unique uniform in the form of categorization.</page><page sequence="28">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 99 utterly unique, then the thing "experienced" can stand in relation to nothing else. The ability to compare is dismantled and nothing can be "understood," in so far as to "understand" is to experience one thing in terms of another. This goes well with the familiar predication of mystical literature that the thing of which it wishes to speak cannot be spoken of, grasped in any way, or compared to anything at all. The cognitive apparatus breaks down, and as a result it can no longer supply a context from which to draw comparisons. Consequently, the subject and the object can be likened to each other only. They become—in the (lack of) perspective of the mystic—one.27 Perceived in this way the discussion between "constructivists" (or "plural ists"—that is, the position taken by Katz and others) and "essentialists" can, finally, be put to an end, as Sells also points out: In the recent debate over the "core" mystical experience, both positions can be seen as essentializing. Those advocating a common "core" of mystical experience have been attacked for their attempts to describe such a core and have been accused of reducing the distinctiveness and variety of traditions to a homogenized "essence." Yet, the plu ralists can fall into an immediate essentializing, as in the statement [...] referring to the experience of "nothingness" as an experience of "something." Thus the grammati cal object, which the entire effort of apophasis is directed toward displacing, is imme diately reinserted at the begin [n]ing of the secondary discussion (Sells: 303-304, note 6). It simply does not make sense to speak of the mystical event as either con structed (i.e. determined by cultural notions), or being in essence the "same" in numerable instances across time and space. The mystical event in its radical form cannot be "constructed," as it is no thing, and cannot be the "same," as there is nothing to which it can be likened. In the final meltdown of metaphoric activity, in the collapse of transference, in the apophatic "meaning event," there is no semantic meaning at all.28 There could not be for it would, as Nietzsche aptly phrases it, be a "knowing without knowledge." The Life of Antony is another example of ascetic hagiography and provides an additional case for testing this theory of asceticism. Although there has been much discussion regarding the authorship of The Life of Antony, Athanasius is, in all probability, the author of this seminal hagiography (cf. Hàgg and 27 Speaking of mysticism in connection with Nietzsche may not be as far fetched as it may seem, cf. Guing 1996, Martini 996, and Stambaugh 1996. 28 It is therefore, arguably, a mistake on the part of Michael Sells to call the mystical event "meaningful." It is hard to think of "meaning" outside a semantic context.</page><page sequence="29">100 77 Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 Rubinson: 15). Written in the first decennium after the death of Antony (prob. 251-356), it tells the story of Antonys escape into the Egyptian desert, and his battles against the Devil and his host of demons (14). If any narrative of ascet icism can be said to have become a model of emulation, it is The Life of Antony. Whether Antony lived, or did exactly as described in the story is—as in the case of Mi la ras pa—perhaps a question. That thousands of people imitated Antony is beyond any doubt (cf. eg. Hágg and Rubenson: 10-11). Athanasius' The Life of Antony can also be read as an example of apophatic narrative. Antony turns apophatically back on the conventional domains of structure and rejects its manifestations, ranging from the "physical" (social interaction, kinship obligations, food, wealth, etc.) to the "mental" (desire, lust, worldly ambition, etc.). Rather than succumbing to the lures of the world Antony prefers the death of the desert. Through utter abnegation he becomes "initiated in the mysteries and filled with the spirit of God" and gains super natural, clairvoyant abilities (healing, speaking with animals, journeying through the air, perceiving immaterial beings, etc.). Antony abides in the "natural state" and "when the soul hath its spiritual faculty in a natural state virtue is formed. And it is in a natural state when it remains as it came into existence. And when it came into existence it was fair and exceeding honest" (Robertson: 201). This "natural state" indicates a return to the state of Adam before the fall, before sin and death entered the world (Brown 1988: 223; Bushell: 554). That is, to a situation where the fallen state had not yet become the normal and given. Which means that all what 'the world' considers to be normal is in fact apprehended as negative and an oppo site to what is in fact the truly normal' state: "it is the fallen nature that has become normal, and the prefallen one that must be sought through a radical commitment to asceticism..." (Bushell: 558). Foul thoughts are countered by prayer, lust by fortifying the body with Christ, the ease of pleasure by thinking of the "threatened fire" and the "gnawing worm." The return to the "natural state" is perhaps what comes closest to the apophatic "meaning event" in the narrative of The Life of Antony. He is created and earthly, in history and time, yet his soul is "as it came into existence." There is, though, no "radical dialectic of transcendence and immanence" in The Life of Antony. Though the Christian outlook on existence is non-dual in the sense that the world is created (and created good) by God, its ontology is still radically dualistic. God is not in the world but abides apart from it. Man is created in his image but turns away from Him in sin. Mystics like e.g. Meister Eckehart have often got themselves into trouble with their postulates of divine immanence in the context of the Christian</page><page sequence="30">T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 101 church. Destabilizing the hierarchy of the church by claiming access to the divine outside official channels is a dangerous venture. As Bruce J. Malina has stated: "When religion is the focal social institution, and the structure of the meaning determining the world is the topside organizing structure, then the proclamation of untested visions is the most significant form of deviance" (Malina: 174, n. 7). Likewise—and in difference to Mi la raspa'i mam thar—the Devil and his host of demons are not accepted as an integral or interdependent part of exis tence, as "just" resulting from a "wrong view." Antony emerges not only as "initiated into the mysteries" but also as an expert in demonology. The dichot omy of structure and anti-structure are upheld—even if the "natural state" may be seen, in a sense, as transcending this dualism. Still, the "apophatic narrative" pertains to The Life of Antony as a suspended dialectic, and the story demonstrates many of the effects of sensory deprivation that comes from being subjected to eremitic life in the desert. Stabilizing cues are destabilized and the sensory input monotonized through seclusion and exposure to the barren landscape of the desert. Antony does not walk about naked—but in a sheepskin the hairs of which are turned against his skin. The projections of conventionality are accepted, endured, suffered. And through this suffering liberation—the return to the natural state—is obtained. When Antony dies, Athanasius reports no miracles. But "he, as though sail ing, from a foreign city to his own, spoke joyously" (Robertson: 219-220), exhorting his brethren to "[1]ive as though dying daily" (220). And, Athana sius points out, Antony's life is to be read that it may be learned "what the life of monks ought to be" (221). Language, the Centre of Narrative Gravity, and the Virtuality of Reality Up till now I have mainly looked on cultural and social aspects of metaphoric construction. In the following I will focus more intently on how the construc tion of the self and a symbolic "I" operating in a metaphorically constructed space is connected to social and cultural reifications of metaphoric transfers. With the rise of language came not only the ability to create linguistic metaphors but also in all probability the ability to perceive a speck of the workings of one's own mind. Stephen Mithen argues this point convincingly. In his account of the human mind, based on the study of prehistoric archaeo logical findings, he renders intelligible the gradual integration of separate cog nitive modules from our early simian ancestors through australopithecines,</page><page sequence="31">102 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 homo habilis, erectus and neanderthalensis until a state of "cognitive fluidity" is reached by modern humans, homo sapiens sapiens. This cognitive fluidity is defined by the ability to map across the domains (or modules) of social, technical and natural history intelligence.29 That is, by the ability to think by analog)'; metaphorically.30 According to Mithen, full modern human (reflexive) consciousness—that is, self-awareness—was reached only when the different domains of intelligence became fully inte grated. Chimpanzees, for example, have a highly developed social intelligence imbued with self-awareness. But "they have no mental awareness of their own knowledge and cognition concerning [e.g.] making and using tools. These are not part of their conscious awareness" (Mithen: 100). We modern human beings, too, "have many complex cognitive processes going on inside our minds about which we have no awareness. Indeed, we are probably aware of only a tiny fraction of what goes on inside our minds. For example, we have no conscious awareness of those processes we use to comprehend and generate linguistic utterances (168)." However, "the change to a cognitively fluid mind [constituted] a change in the nature of consciousness" (217). Mithen surmises that: The new role for consciousness in the human mind is likely to have been the one identified by the psychologist Daniel Schachter.... he argued that, in addition to cre ating the subjective feelings of 'knowing', 'remembering' and 'perceiving', conscious ness should be viewed as 'a global database that integrates the output of modular processes.'... In the Early Human mind, general intelligence was the only device avail able to play this integrating role, and it hardly played it at all. But because language acted as the vehicle for delivering non-social thoughts and knowledge into the chapel of social intelligence, consciousness could start to play this new integrating role within the cathedral of the mind (218). With the more or less simultaneous occurrence of language and a global con sciousness arose in all probability also a sense of an inner space in which sensory stimulation is transformed into a virtual representation of the outer world, and the sense of "being"—and being in—this space. In The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind Julian Jaynes presents some valuable clues concerning the connection between virtual representa 25 Mithen's division of intelligence is only tentative and rudimentary, as he himself points out. Other classifications have been put forth and may reflect the workings of the mind just as well. 30 And, it should be noted, Mithen's "cognitive fluidity" corresponds well to Fauconniers and Turner's "double-scope blending."</page><page sequence="32">T. Bjornvig/ Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 103 tions of the mental and physical world and metaphoric projections. According to Jaynes consciousness evolved on the basis of language and language's meta phoric quality: [Qonsciousness is an operation rather than a thing, a repository, or a function. It operates by way of analogy, by way of constructing an analog space with an analog 'I' that can observe that space, and move metaphorically in it. It operates on any reactiv ity, excerpts relevant aspects, narratizes and conciliates them together in a metaphori cal space where such meanings can be manipulated like things in space. Conscious mind is a spatial analog of the world and mental acts are analogs of bodily acts consciousness [is] a metaphor-generated model of the world... consciousness is this invention of an analog world on the basis of language... consciousness comes after language (66-67)! What Jaynes purports, then, is that the very experience of being (and being in) a mental space, or as Jaynes puts it: mind-space, is metaphorically produced. When we think about it most of us have the feeling of "being" "in" our heads and "looking out" through the eyes. We speak of the body as if though it is "ours" (that is, as a thing apart from us), and can actually loose an arm or a leg and still feel (more or less) the "same" "person." But where are we in the head? We know the head is solid, stuffed with brains, and that there is in fact no "space" in it. Still, our thoughts "take place" in the head and when we visualize and narrate events or images we—or most of us—have the sensation that these "go on" in some sort of "mind-space." We do not feel that our thoughts are electric impulses transmitted throughout a massive brain. No matter how much neuroscience tells us that this is so, it is still not what we sense or feel. This sensation is surely an illusion: although an illusion with profound implications. Whether viewed phenomenological or heterophemonenological (cf. Dennett) it is what we experience as individual persons and collectively, with margins of variation (cf. e.g. Dennett: 422). And it is narrowly connected with the construction of a self: a self in which all sorts of things take place. Simulations are experimentally tried out; introspection is cultivated; and expectations regarding the future struggle with memories of things past. This "place" has been aptly termed a "center of narrative gravity" by Dennett (418). Here we spin a "web of discourse:" "Our tales are spun, but for the most part we don't spin them; they spin us. Our human consciousness, and our narrative selfhood, is their product, not their source" (416; 418). This narrative of selfhood is to a very large degree a collective project as we are "constantly engaged in presenting ourselves to others, and to ourselves, and</page><page sequence="33">104 77 Bjornvig/Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 hence representing ourselves—in language and gesture, external and internal" (417). Language is the all important medium for this ongoing representation: "words are potent elements of our environment that we readily incorporate, ingesting and extruding them, weaving them like spiderwebs into self-protec tive strings of narrative" (417). Peter L. Bergers The Social Reality of Religion and its theory of a collectively constructed nomos, through which the self is constructed and stabilized, fits well into Dennetts deliberations: the individual appropriates the world in conversation with others and... both identity and world remain real to himself only as long as he can continue the conversation (26) radical separation from the social world, or anomy, constitutes... a powerful threat to the individual. It is not only that the individual loses emotionally satisfying ties in such cases. He loses his orientation in experience. In extreme cases, he loses his sense of reality and identity. He becomes anomic in the sense of becoming world less The world begins to shake in the very instant that its sustaining conversation begins to falter (31). Thus, render as narrativization of the self is inextricably bound up with the cultural and social milieu in which one lives. Following Jaynes, the sensation of a mind-space where thoughts take place is a metaphorically generated space online with the experiential physical world. Moreover, Jaynes states that " [i] t is by metaphor that language grows" (49) and that " [i] n early times, language and its referents climbed up from the concrete to the abstract on the steps of metaphors, even, we may say, created the abstract on the bases of metaphors" (51), thus "echoing" both Lakoff and Johnson, and Nietzsche.31 Also, Jaynes is in agreement with Lakoff and Johnson's predica tion that "to understand is to perceive one thing in terms of another" when he says that "the feeling of familiarity is the feeling of understanding" (52). In The Symbolic Species Terrence Deacon also points to language's decisive import as regards consciousness. Elaborating on Charles Sanders Pierce Deacon isolates three forms of representation or categories of referential associations: iconic, indexical and symbolic. These describe formal relationships between 31 It is interesting that (to my knowledge) neither Lakoff and Johnson, nor Fauconnier and Turner, mention Jaynes anywhere. This may be because of Jaynes' far fetched theories of the breakdown of the "bicameral mind" and the implications for human consciousness. These theo ries are not exactly drawing-room in the academic world (though e.g. Dennett is not afraid of referring to Jaynes). Jaynes wants to place the origin of consciousness as late as during the com position of the Odyssey, an idea I do not subscribe to. Jaynes' theory of metaphor is quite a different matter though.</page><page sequence="34">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 105 characteristics of "sign tokens" and the physical objects represented. According to Deacon, "icons are mediated by a similarity between sign and object, indi ces are mediated by some physical or temporal connection between sign and object, and symbols are mediated by some formal or merely agreed-upon link irrespective of any physical characteristics of either sign or object (70)." Icons make the experience of resemblance possible, indices causality, and symbols the establishment through social convention of the relationship that links one thing symbolically to another (a wedding ring to marriage, the letter "e" the sound "e," etc.) (71). Iconic and indexical representation, or associa tion, may in some form be available to a wide range of animals. Symbolic association, though, is exclusively confined to human beings, although certain primates have been shown to be able to acquire a rudimentary symbolic ability through intense training. These modes of reference do not exclude each other and "the same signs can be icons, indices, and symbols depending on the inter pretive process" (72). They are not qualities in things themselves but the result of an interpretive response by a subject to sensory stimulation. They form a hierarchy in which icons are needed for indices and both for symbols. Symbolic relationships are not mere correlation as in the case of iconic and indexical relationships. Iconic and indexical associations are in a one-to-one relationship to what is referred to. This means that these associations are inflexible and needs repeated correlation with something in the physical world to persist. Words are symbols, and words can refer not only to (existing or non-existing) things but also to each other—words are indexically associated with each other and this forms the basis for stable meaning in language, and the crucial step into another mode of consciousness, if not consciousness per se: "This referential relationship between the words—words systematically indicating other words—forms a system of higher-order relationships that allows words to be about indexical relationships, and not just indices in them selves" (83). And "[tjhis makes a new kind of generalization possible: logical or categorical generalization, as opposed to stimulus generalization or learning set generalization" (88). This "system of higher-order relationships" is basically what makes language possible: and language in its turn elaborates and stabi lizes the system, according to Deacon. In this process individual correlations/ associations of the iconic and indexical type are downplayed, if not forgotten. Symbolic thinking—for it to exist—tears itself loose of the one-to-one repre sentational mode and floats into a sphere of abstraction, categorization, imag ination, contra factuality and creativity. By force of symbolic representation human beings came to live in a virtual reality: a world virtually represented by means of a higher-order symbolic</page><page sequence="35">106 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 system of reference. From this we gained the ability to contemplate our own end, to represent the minds of others to ourselves, thereby facilitating "under standing," and, indeed, the ability to represent ourselves to "ourselves." The self that is the source of one's experience of intentionality, the self that is judged by itself as well as by others for its moral choices, the self that worries about its impend ing departure from the world, this self is a symbolic self. It is a final irony that it is the virtual, not actual, reference that symbols provide, which give rise to this experience of self. [...] Its virtual nature notwithstanding, it is the symbolic realm of consciousness that we most identify with and from which our sense of agency and self-control origi nate (452). In a similar vein, Dennett says: "Like the biological self, [the] psychological or narrative self is yet another abstraction, not a thing in the brain, but still a remarkably robust and almost tangible attractor of properties, the "owner of record" of whatever items and features are lying about unclaimed" (Dennett: 418). This leads us to the highly idiosyncratic nature of self-consciousness and sym bolic, virtual representation. As Deacon brings into focus this self-consciousness and virtual representation of the inner and outer world has imbued the human psyche with a certain amount of fragility and paradox. It makes us more sus ceptible to mental disorders and creates a tension in us between competing virtual representations: [The] ability to let our emotions be activated by the virtual experiences constructed with the aid of symbols probably makes us the only species in which there can be a genuine conflict of simultaneous emotional states We can easily become over loaded and confused by our ability to generate and respond to multiple what-if worlds (Deacon: 431). And, it should be added, not only do self-consciousness entail knowledge of one's own impending death—it also creates an inherent 'friction' between the symbolic T and the biological body, between what is and what is not (but can be imagined), between will and instinct, moral and sexual drives, in short: it creates suffering—or, in a slightly more modern choice of words: psychological problems. As Dennett phrases it: "the capacity to suffer is a function of the capacity to have articulated, wide-ranging, highly discriminative desire, expec tations, and other sophisticated mental states" (449). It is the claim of this article that a result of asceticism—in its extreme mys tically oriented and eremitic aspect—can be that this friction, this fundamen</page><page sequence="36">T. Bjemvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 107 tal and specifically human source for dualisms, is destroyed and that the practice yielding this result can be explained in terms of current theories of metaphor and conceptual blending (and symbolic representation). Ascetic mysticism deconstructs the symbolically constructed self and its virtual repre sentation of reality, thereby suspending the metaphoric transfers of sensory perception and thought. I therefore agree with Johannes Bronkhorst's fundamental intuition of a profound connection between the phenomenon of asceticism and the human language ability. But I believe that the connection is somewhat different from what Bronkhorst imagines. In a crucial passage Bronkhorst asks: The ascetic instinct... has a clear effect on the evolutionary fitness of its bearers, namely a negative one. If the ascetic instinct... predisposes to asceticism and sexual abstinence, among other things, then such a counter-productive instinct should have been weeded out long ago by natural selection. How has it been able to stay with us (Bronkhorst: 411)? As described in the introduction, Bronkhorst's theory is that the ascetic instinct has been able to do just that because it is a side effect of language and symbolic thinking, the latter of which increased our chances of survival. One of the ways in which Bronkhorst argues this point is by purporting that the ascetic instinct is dissociated from emotion, and therefore should not be compared with sexu ality (also an instinct) in an attempt to understand the implications of it better (cf. e.g. 397, 409). Asceticism, Bronkhorst asserts, is not to be found in any collection of genes. If connected to any genes it must be those responsible for symbolic thinking. As these were selected for, the disadvantage of ascetic sexual abnegation could not in it self be seriously subjected to selection pressure. There fore, the ascetic instinct survived in face of being counter reproductive (413). In my view, Bronkhorst's line of argument is problematic. The fundamental trouble is that Bronkhorst conceives asceticism as crucially defined by the abnegation of sexuality. If this definition is accepted, then one may be intrigued by the persistence of asceticism in spite of natural selection. But then a phe nomenon like (for example) suicide would need an explanation as much as asceticism. The genes of people who have committed suicide do not spread easily, or, at least the act of suicide as such is counter reproductive (just as well as being a soldier, an astronaut, a race driver, a drug abuser, etc. is counter reproductive). Yet people who commit suicide may have had children prior to their suicide, and so may ascetics prior to entering into asceticism (the Bud dha, of course, being an emblematic example).</page><page sequence="37">108 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 To renounce sexuality is, arguably, a central characteristic of "asceticism" but not its sole defining mark. Many ideas, practices and much behaviour that accompanies "asceticism" can be found outside of "asceticism," as Bronkhorst himself puts into focus by pointing to ideas of an immobile soul in tribal soci eties (402-408). All this is not to say that sexual abnegation cannot be con nected to (for example) an idea of an immobile self or soul, or that it does not call for an explanation specific to this aspect of asceticism. But, as I see it, it is a question whether it is fertile at all to study asceticism—not to mention explaining it—in the perspective of genetic evolutionary theory. What I propose is, in a sense, exactly the opposite of Bronkhorst: asceticism is, indeed, connected to language and symbolic thinking (and metaphors and blending) but not as an accidental side effect or handicap. Rather, asceticism should be viewed as the antidote to language and symbolic thinking, as a prac tice actively engaged in countering all the (other) "negative" by-products of language and metaphoric activity of the human mind. Memes and the Ascetic "Anti-Virus Program" This may be seen more clearly if we allow ourselves to use a metaphor employed by Terrence Deacon (and others), namely projecting "virus," or "parasite" onto language, that is, by perceiving language as a virus. A virus that lives symbi otically in its human host, co-evolving with it, reproducing itself by means of words, sentences, and narratives; rituals and religions and all sorts of "ideas," by speech and writing, by laws and institutions, in short: by means of memes. Deacon: In some ways it is helpful to imagine language as an independent life form that colonizes and parasitizes human brains, using them to reproduce By imagining language as a parasitic organism, we can come to appreciate the potential for conflict ing reproductive interests, where some language features might occur at the expense of the hosts adaptions, and the possibility that many features may have more to do with getting passed on from generation to generation than with conveying infor mation They might better be compared to viruses The parasitic model is almost certainly too extreme, for the relationship between language and people are symbiotic (112). Deacon develops this idea in order to explain the dynamic between language and the human brain, and the interdependence between biological and social evolutionary processes:</page><page sequence="38">T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 109 [OJnly recently have researchers begun to conceive of this relationship as though arti facts, techniques, customs, and even ideas and beliefs were separate organisms. This is more than just a metaphor. There is an important sense in which artifacts and social practices evolve in parallel with their living hosts, and are not just epiphenomena. They must be reproduced from one generation to the next and replicated as each new person learns them, copies them, emulates them, or is forced to conform to them (114-15). The "language virus," then, establishes social and material "reservoirs" or "meme-pools" outside of their residential organisms—thereby ensuring a cer tain degree of autonomy from their fragile hosts (memes can survive in thou sands of years, whether chiselled in stone or scribed on a piece of parchment, until an unsuspecting potential host downloads them through his or her eyes, or ears). Dennett states (rephrasing Samuel Butler's famous dictum): "A scholar is just a library's way of making another library" (202). Perhaps one should consider the human mind's metaphoric activity, its ongoing conceptual blend ing, as the way in which memes reproduce, constantly splicing, mixing, mutat ing, and blending various meme-domains. That would lend even greater impetus to the evolutionary meme-parable and establish a viable connection between this theory and the theory of metaphor and blending. As discussed at length earlier, metaphoric transfers or associations get entrenched in the individual due to upbringing and cultural and social influence, and are enhanced by the material manifestations of the entrenched connections in the form of institutions, buildings, writing, elaborated social distinctions; i.e. the hierarchy of 'evolved' societies with their bureaucratic organizations, written laws, specialization of classes of people not needing to uphold their own existence directly by manual labor, etc. Writing about "representational stabil ity" in connection with conceptual blending theory, Edwin Hutchins states: There are two principal ways to achieve stability in conceptual models. First, the con ceptual models that anthropologists call "cultural" models achieve representational stability via a combination of intrapersonal and interpersonal processes. Second, pro jecting material structure into a blended space can stabilize the conceptual blend— The term material anchor is meant to emphasize the stabilizing role of the material structure (Hutchins: 1). Although Hutchins, like Fauconnier and Turner, is more preoccupied with all the positive results of conceptual blending than with eventual negative effects some of his statements bear on the present thesis. Cultural models play a cru cial role in stabilizing and freezing conceptual blending:</page><page sequence="39">110 T. Bjornvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 Because they are shared, cultural models tend to be supported and reinforced by the behavior and thinking of others. [...] Most cultural models are closely related to many other models. This interlinking contributes to the conservatism of cultural beliefs over time and to the stability of cultural models as resources for individual and group rea soning processes (4). Using material anchors for conceptual blends is an integral part of human cognition. Hutchins gives examples of elaborated material anchors for blends, such as the Japanese hand calendar (where the hand serves as material input space for blends) (10-13) and the medieval tide computer (where the compass rose serves as material input space for blends) (15-18). He also brings up other more simple kinds of material anchors such as queuing given as "a mun dane example of mapping sequence onto space" (9). He says, "[t]he parti cipants use their own bodies and the locations of their bodies in space to encode order relations The practice of standing in line fits into an ecology of other practices that make up a "first-come-first-served" cultural model of service" (9). The key point is that material anchors, like cultural models, serve as stabilizers of conceptual blends: "The stability of more complex conceptual models is sometimes provided by their being embedded in conven tional (culturally shared) well-learned and automatically applied internal men tal structure Other conceptual models achieve stability by virtue of being embodied in an external physical medium (23)." There is no doubt that these different kinds of material anchors for concep tual blending have enhanced the survival chances of humankind tremendously. But as we have become increasingly dependent on such material anchors they also dictate the directions of our thoughts: "The cultural process of crystallizing conceptual models in material structure and saving those up through time puts modern humans in a world where thinking depends in significant measure on the availability of a set of physical structures that can be manipulated..." (25). Cultural models and material anchors for metaphoric connections and con ceptual blends constitute the ever-rising horizon of conventional interpretations, categorizations, structurations and value standards that threaten to hermeti cally enclose the individual. They are the "stabilizing cues" (cf. Brownfield above) that the ascetic tries to escape by isolating herself or himself from all that is human, normal and conventional. This "process of crystallizing" can also be viewed as a process of reification of Übertragungen, and this process in turn considered a process of "alienation" which is: the process whereby the dialectical relationship between the individual and his world is lost to consciousness. The individual 'forgets' that this world was and continues to</page><page sequence="40">T. Bjornvig/ Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 111 be co-produced by him alienation is an overextension of the process of objectiva tion, whereby the human ('living') objectivity of the social world is transformed in consciousness into the non-human ('dead') objectivity of nature. Typically, the repre sentations of human, meaningful activity that constitute the reality of the social world are transformed in consciousness into non-human, meaningless, inert 'things'. That is, they are reified. The social world... becomes... a closed aggregate of reifications divorced from present or future activity (Berger: 92). Elaborating on and pressing the "language is a virus" metaphor to the limit (and perhaps past it) one could say that though this virus lives in a symbiotic relationship with its host it continually threatens to break equilibrium and take control. The language virus has conferred vast and innumerable advan tages on humanity, but not without considerable costs for its human hosts in terms of loss of spontaneity, that is, immediacy; loss of individuality, freedom, uniqueness (both of one self and one's perceptions and sensations); knowledge of one's own upcoming death and general worries about the future; memory of past (mis-) deeds, the notion of a deed being bad at all; in short, the often frustrating and painful friction between virtual representation and symbolic "I," and the bleak facts of biology and history. As Dennett puts it: "What memes provide in return to the organisms in which they reside is an incalcu lable store of advantages—with some Trojan horses thrown in for good mea sure, no doubt" (207). And humans are caught in their own symbolic representations: We are not just a species that uses symbols. The symbolic universe has ensnared us in an inescapable web. Like a "mind virus," the symbolic adaptation has infected us, and now by virtue of the irresistible urge it has instilled in us to turn everything we encoun ter and everyone we meet into symbols, we have become the means by which it uncer emoniously propagates itself throughout the world (Deacon: 436). Memes are socially and culturally conditioned software that rearranges and reconfigures the human cognitive (hardware) apparatus and as such has "the potential to contribute remarkable design-enhancements to the underlying machinery of the brain—at great speed, compared to the slow pace of genetic Research] and Development]" (Dennett: 208).32 But it is at the same time exactly the socially and culturally conditioned aspects of memes that threaten to weigh down human beings, burying them alive in a con-sensual avalanche of dead and entrenched metaphors. Of course (pushing, perhaps, the meta phor over the edge) the final victory of the language virus will be the creation 32 Cf. Jensen's "downward causation perspective" above.</page><page sequence="41">112 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 of artificial intelligence; intelligent and sentient robots of some sort—whereby the virus would finally become independent of its troublesome host.33 Elaborating on Susan Blackmore's talk about religions as "meme-plexes" Bronkhorst, in his article, wonders if memes influence the genetic evolution of humans but decides that it must be the other way around: religion (as a meme plex) adjusts itself to human beings. He concludes: "[t]he ascetic instinct, then, has not been created by religion but, on the contrary, has played and still plays a role in the formation and replication of existing religions" (2001: 411). But I would rather say that asceticism can be construed as an anti-virus pro gram designed to hunt down and destroy the meme-induced language virus with all it entails. Mystical asceticism's radical decompression of blends, or its cancelling out of juxtaposed metaphoric domains, its deconstruction of entrenched and socially conditioned metaphoric transfers, the social body and socially determined self; and the ascetic removal from "sources of consensual validitation" and "stabilizing cues of a familiar perceptual world" (cf. Brownfield above) can thus all be viewed as features of the ascetic anti-virus program. The eremitic ascetic chooses the desert or the lonely mountain, shuts himself up in a cave or secluded building, opts out of social obligations and influences, refuses to speak, eat, have sex in order to eradicate the negative aspects of the meme-complex. The eremitic ascetic suspends the ongoing conversation—the circle of externalization, objectivation and internalization—through which the self and its cognitive structures are produced and reproduced, whether through actual speech or all the other ways through which the individual "speaks" with his fellow men. "Our very biology locks us into perceptual integrations [and w]e know when we look at writing that we are living directly in the blend and cannot escape it," says Fauconnier and Turner (2002: 390-391). And they continue: The capacity for double-scope integration confers several related aptitudes. Humans can build new integration networks that are not biologically given. We can operate by directly manipulating the blends of those networks. We can also focus attention on escaping the blends, investigating the connections, changing the network, and rebuilding the blend (391). The child is considered immature for not seeing that the mobile is not alive, but the adult is considered smart for using metaphor to create intentionality where it is not. The culture requires the child to achieve the right coor dinated complex blends. Only then will the child be able to live in the blend as a member of the culture. But, paradoxically, it is also essential for the culture to support 33 A prospect (that is, of creating artificial intelligence) that Dennett finds entirely possible; cf. e.g. Dennett; 431 ; and a theme which the film "The Matrix" has developed to its full implica tions. Cf. also Blackmore: 204-218, esp. 218.</page><page sequence="42">T. Bjcrnvig/ Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 113 decompression, so that the child can learn further skills and achieve greater overall flexibility" (392). Radical, eremitic asceticism is one such locus of (radical) decompression of (cultural) blends and perhaps that is one reason why ascetic practices (if we allow shamanism to be included in this term) always have been an inseparable part of human culture. In the practice of mysticism and asceticism blends are radically decompressed, even utterly destroyed.34 From this entirely new blends may emerge, visionary blends with highly emergent properties that will change a culture's entrenched transfers, old and revered traditional values may be imprinted on the mind and the entire faculty for blending and metaphorizing may (for various periods of time) be dismantled. The apophatic mystical text is in itself an example of an anti-virus program as it constantly negates given and possible metaphoric transfers, and the ascetic apophatic narrative likewise, in a dialectical movement, outplays and collapses the dichotomy of structure and anti-structure. Or, perhaps, one should not speak of the ascetic anti-virus programme as "destroying" but rather "conquering," or "subduing" the meme-complex. For in a sense (as in the case of Mi la ras pa) the ascetic-mystic becomes the virus, or, alternatively, becomes its master and gains the ability to use it to whatever purpose he or she wishes. The ascetic then masters reality itself in so far that reality is a meme-produced construction, a symbolic and metaphoric repre sentation of whatever is "out there." This representation is, needless to say, very well adopted to the physical world and the needs of human beings (or else humanity would surely not have been selected to not just survive but become the conquerors of the entire planet with all its life forms). But it is, surely, not the only possible representation and neither necessarily the most beneficial for the integrity of the individual and the survival of the human race in the long run. The Ascetic Field of Transit Some have pointed out the similarities between shamans and ascetics (cf. e.g. Eliade 1990, Brown 1982, and Victor Turner above). Some have vouched for long-term asceticism and total disregard for the body on behalf of the soul as being the decisive prerequisite to label something "asceticism," as opposed to 34 Perhaps the ascetic's mind (re-) gains the flexibility and plasticity of a child during this process. That would account for the ascetical behavior needed to accomplish most learning pro cesses, at least as regards isolation.</page><page sequence="43">114 T. Bjernvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 e.g. the North American Indian "Vision Quest" or the regular short termed fasting of e.g. the Muslim Ramadan (Hall et al.: 64-65, 110). The Lakota Vision Quest, as related by George Sword, entails short termed abnegation (of speech, food, drink and social interaction) and seclusion, and show anti-structural character traits: If a man is alone and speaks to no one and neither eats nor drinks anything and thinks continually about the superior beings, he may have a vision. The usual way to seek a vision is to purify the body in an Initi [sweat hut] by pouring water on hot stones and then go naked, only wrapped in a robe, to the top of a hill, and stay there without speaking to anyone of mankind or eating, or drinking, and thinking continually about the vision he wishes. If one goes to [a] hill in this manner, he should remain there until he receives a vision or until he is nearly perished (Walker: 85). It may or may not be sound to label practices such as this "asceticism." Again, this depends on whether one takes sexual abnegation as being a necessary pre requisite for calling something "asceticism," or not. But clearly, these practices bear a strong resemblance to many of the distinctive marks of asceticism as lined out in section two of this article. The result of such practices is far from always the "mystical union," "experi ence" or "event." It may also simply have the effect of opening in the individual creative sources (of metaphors) and a visionary imagination buried under lay ers of conventional and entrenched Übertragungen. This may in turn explain the abundance of (aesthetic) metaphors found in much mystical literature. Asceticism—isolation and self-abnegation, long or short termed—may bring the individual closer to the sources of metaphoric creativity, to the sources of the aesthetic metaphors before the abstraction of concepts sets in. This may relativize—and partially deconstruct—conventional metaphors normally lived by but does not necessarily eradicate them all together. Writing about Indian religious traditions and mysticism, Peter L. Berger states: [T]he relativization inherent in the category of maya makes the socio-cultural world appear once more as a contingent, historical construction of men—a humanizing and thus at least potentially de-alienating effect Mystical religion, with its radical depre ciation not only of the value but the reality-status of the empirical world, has a similar de-alienating potential. To the mystic this world and all its works, including those of ordinary' religious practice, are relativized (104). In light of this, I suggest that asceticism as such should be considered a field of transit in which the ascetic moves on a graded scale from the entrenched to the</page><page sequence="44">T. Bj0rnvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 115 transparent, from reification to de(re)ification, from substantiality to empti ness, ontology to disontology. The ascetic can merge back into the conven tionally structured from any point on the scale and can, along the way, to a varying degree and in a variety of ways gain access to the practices, states of consciousness, abilities and qualities sketched out as the characteristics of asceticism above. This graded scale can be illustrated in the following rudimentary way: Socially and Loosening up Creativity and Suspension of Culturally of entrenched relativizing. metaphoric entrenched metaphors. Maturity. activity. metaphors. The Destabilization. Visions. De-reification "structured." and transparency (Anti-structure). The point is that "asceticism" as a general typology should not be considered a fixed line of development with more or less pre-determined goals and results. Rather, it is a continuum of certain characteristic practices and actions (or lack of the same). Anyone engaging in any sort of project that requires concentra tion, learning and the requisition of new skills and abilities will to some degree enter into the (more or less momentarily) isolation and dissociation of the ascetic field of transit (cf. e.g. Ware: 3). And as mentioned earlier, perhaps a certain degree of destabilization of entrenched metaphoric transfers is needed to (re-)gain the plasticity of the learning mind. During this process unexpected things can happen, e.g. the gaining of novel insights, that is, novel metaphoric connections. But the field of ascetic transit may also serve as an instrument for the continuation of traditional values and valuations, for the impression of culturally accepted and endorsed ideas and ideals. Richard Valantasis enters this line of argument in his outline of a social theory of asceticism: Until a person or a group of people is equipped or empowered to perform within a culture, the culture remains an esoteric system into which the person or group has not been initiated. Asceticism initiates a person or group into the cultural systems that enable communication; that equip the person or group for productive living within the culture; and that empower them to live within the culture. As the primary system</page><page sequence="45">116 T. Bj0rnvig / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 19 (2007) 72-120 of formation within a culture, asceticism unlocks the otherwise closed or invisible systems of communication and rhetorical production in a culture, and hence intersects all the operative systems: larger cultural systems, social systems, and individual psycho logical systems Asceticism may be defined as performances designed to inaugurate an alternative culture, to enable different social relations, and to create a new identity (Valantasis: 547-548). This brings into focus the many-facetted nature of asceticism. Much can be said on this subject but I will restrict myself to the following observations. Ascetic life can in some historical and cultural contexts be said to encompass salient values and ideals of a given society or culture. One can say that culture "writes" upon the ascetic, that the ascetic himself becomes a sort of writing (cf. Harpham). In this view, asceticism can be considered the very vehicle for entrenchment of metaphoric transfers. It is, however, important to keep in mind that some narratives of asceti cism, though being extensions of the structured, may lead to negations of their own predications—and en fin to a dismantling of their very point of departure (much like a space shuttle built in gravity becomes weightless as it enters orbit). To fully comprehend this one must be ready to closely follow the sud den shifts of perspective that (apophatic) discourses and narratives produce along the way: "The meaning of narrative, philosophical, mythological, and poetic language (the kataphatic aspect) is not negated, but 'what' is meant becomes one with the event of the perspective shift" (Sells: 215). And if the ascetic can be construed as writing the same goes for the practice of asceticism. This paper presents a theory of mystical, radical, and eremitic asceticism that I hope will serve as a "cross-cultural theoretical framework" and "a model for a consistently comparative, multicultural or multitraditional perspective in the study of asceticism". Other, less radical, forms of asceticism may well be placed on the graded scale depicted above. As such, the scale may serve as a framework for a broad range of ascetic phenomena. The theory of asceticism presented here pertains only to the far right of the scale. Also, ways of connect ing the frequently opposed perspectives of cultural and cognitive explanation has been presented. Through the lens of the study of eremitic asceticism, with its radical renunciation of society and culture, these possible connections stand out in a somewhat clearer light.
