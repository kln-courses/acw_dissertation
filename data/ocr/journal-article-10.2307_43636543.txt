<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN (SATIRE 4)* ALEX HARDE I: The Time of Writing In his study of Juvenal as a poet of the 'establishment', Edwin Ramage documented the satirist's deployment of denigration of earlier emperors as a foil for praise of the reigning emperor.1 He suggested that the fourth satire reflects the anti-Domitianic propaganda of the reign of Trajan, and that the poem will have acted as a reminder of the 'far different atmosphere that prevailed in Trajan's councils'.2 Ramage's insights into Juvenal's techniques of praise by implicit contrast with imperial predecessors are of great value.3 But while bringing a strong historical and political perspective to the Satires , he attempted no new study of chronology and dating. He accepted the consensus view whereby Juvenal's first two books {Satires 1-6) are assigned to the reign of Trajan and books three to five {Satires 7-16) to that of Hadrian.4 Yet the consensus had already been challenged by Syme, who suggested (but did not argue) that the entire output might be Hadrianic, with the publication of the first book falling in or after AD 1 17. 5 More recently, some evidence has been presented for a Hadrianic date for the sixth satire (i.e. book 2).6 Connections can be adduced between satires 3 and 7 which would be consistent with a Hadrianic date for the former.7 As for the fourth satire, there has been some critical speculation as to whether barbato regi (103) might contain a reference to Hadrian's * It is a pleasure to acknowledge the help of Professors Susanna Morton Braund and Tony Woodman, their biblio- graphical advice and suggestions for improvement; also the helpful critique of the BICS referee.

For convenience, let an unguarded hypothesis be propounded: fifteen years for the period of composition, from 1 17 to 132. In other words, from the accession of Hadrian to the outbreak of war in Palestine/; also 277-78 (= Syme 1984, 1156-57). Waters (1970) 67, who cites Syme, actually assumes it to be orthodoxy that 'the first ten years of Hadrian covered both the publication and probably the composition of nearly all of the satires'. 6 Braund 1992, 82; see now her comments in Braund 1996, 16, suggesting publication of Books I and II 'towards the end of Trajan's reign, or, possibly, soon after Hadrian's accession in 1 17.' 7 Hardie 1990, 186-89.

The (Ovidian?) intertext (Hal. 125) Hadriaco mirandus litore rhombus would not seriously detract from such a personal and contemporary allusion, for Hadrian and the Adriatic Sea were associated elswhere (thus Orac. Syb. 12.163-64: jueť avrò v ô'aÂÂoç áváÇeil ápyvpÓKpavoç ávrjp, rov ó' sacrerai ovvoļia nó vrou, 'after him another shall rule, a man with silver helmet; and his name shall be that of a sea');10 and a Hadrianic reader's alertness to imperial name allusion would have been sharpened by the appearance in preceding lines of an earlier emperor (Neroní), and of the Flavian dynasty (Flavius). It might be argued that these hints are less than explicit; but then it could reasonably be replied that if Syme's instincts were correct, and the first book were Hadrianic, the hints would have been unmistakable and unmissable. Moreover, Trajanic dating of the fourth satire might itself involve difficulty or implausibility, hitherto unremarked. This lies in playful intertextual allusion to Pliny's Panegyricus , cardinal ideological text for the Trajanic era: what might Trajan have made of nihil est quod credere de selnon possit cum laudatur dis aequa pote stas (70-7 1) were he to have recalled the consul's praise of himself as a princeps graced by dis immortalibus aequata potestas (Pan. 4.4)? The plain fact is that no internal dating criterion has been adduced to confirm Trajanic dating for the first two books, or indeed to refute Hadrianic dating.11 It has been suggested that the overt praise of Hadrian in the seventh satire, and the expression of hope (spes, 7.1) in his patronage of letters signals his recent accession.12 But, aside from the fact that Juvenal goes on to acknowledge some act of patronage which Hadrian has already carried through (Camenas/ respexit, 7.2-3), 'hope' was a topical feature of poets' reflections on their own condition in relation to prospects of patronage, and it carries only limited significance for 'Caesar'/ Hadrian's time in office. The absence of explicit praise of Hadrian in books 1-2 may in fact be no more, or less, significant for our understanding of Juvenal's approach to his period than Octavian' s near-absence from the first book of Horace's Satires (for Octavian and his interests were arguably in the satirist's thoughts throughout that book, as also, 8 Green 1974, 1 13-14. Cf. Goodyear 1982, 55; Anderson 1955; Waters 1970, 75-76. Hadrian adopted the beard before his accession, but it is not known when (a bearded Hadrian may have featured in the Trajanic exstipicium relief: Ryberg 1955, 130). The beard appears on coinage from the very start of his reign: Birley 1997, 8 1 . For a statue type showing the beard dating from the early years of the reign (around AD 120), see Rolley and Salviat 1963 (dating at 566), with excellent photographs. 9 Crook 1965, 56-65. 10 For possible name play between sea and emperor in Dionysius of Alexandria, Birley 1997, 253. 1 1 On the lack of Trajanic material, Waters 1970. 12 Pepe 1961, 166; Courtney 1980, 349.</page><page sequence="3">ALEX HARDIE: JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN 1 19 explicitly, at the outset of the second).13 The fourth satire's time of writing - Trajanic or Hadrianic - is thus an open question, and a legitimate, indeed necessary, area of enquiry. II: Dramatic Date What dramatic date does Juvenal indicate for the fourth satire, and what bearing might his selection have on the date of composition? The action evidently falls somewhere between Domitian 's accession in September 81 and his departure for the first frontier campaign of the new reign, the war with the Chatti for which he celebrated a triumph in mid-83.14 Juvenal suggests (145-49) that in summoning the consilium , Domitian acts as if some momentous news had arrived by imperial messenger from some distant part of the world; 'as if he wished to make some statement about the Chatti or grim Sygambri'. From this, since Domitian personally commanded the campaign, it can be inferred that the dramatic date falls before his departure. Valla's information that the satire is indebted to a consilium scene in Statius' de Bello Germanico supplies a further connection with the pre-campaign period.15 Syme suggested that Juvenal parodies the opening scene of that poem, and that it described 'the council antecedent to Domitian's expedition'.16 The time of year is late autumn (56-57, cited below), so that Juvenal's action falls around October-November 81 or 82. It is usually assigned to 82, following the usual dating of the entire Chatti campaign to 83. 17 A counter- suggestion that Domitian's departure fell in 82 would, if correct, bring our dramatic date forward to late 81, that is, to the period immediately following Domitian's accession.18 Juvenal does not refer explicitly to that accession. But he implies that it lies in the recent past (37-38): cum iam semianimum lacerarei Flavius orbemlultimus et calvo servirei Roma Neroni/incidit... ( 4 when the last Flavian was now mangling the half- dead world, and Rome was in slavery to the bald Nero, there fell into the net...'). Flavius... ultimus stresses Domitian's dynastic succession, and iam suggests the point at which a 'certain stage in a process of development' has been reached ( OLD s.v. Idi: i.e. the process of imperial succession).19 lacerarei and servirei echo, but reverse, the kind of encomiastic adulation which conventionally greeted a new reign, for Juvenal is not saying 'when Domitian's reign had descended to bestiality...': he is suggesting that Domitian's rule was literally synonymous with savagery and slavery, the inception of which characterised the accession itself.20 This 13 Courtney 1980, 349 is wrong to suggest that 'hope' signifies a new emperor: on the conventional topic of spes in the seventh satire, Hardie 1990, 155.

Sic. 15-17: vere novo cum iam tinnire volucres/incipient.../...pecus omne movebis...). iam might also colour semianimum ('already half-dead'), suggesting inheritance of the orbis in this condition from father and brother: this too implies a 'process of development'. 20 Deroux 1983, 286 wrongly suggests that the turbot was caught 'at a time when the emperor had finally enslaved Rome' (my emphasis).</page><page sequence="4">120 BICS-42- 1997-98 formulation represents the extreme exaggeration of rhetorical vituperado, a feature which will be considered below (III, IV). That Juvenal has a post-accession period in mind is further suggested by reminiscences of passages in Seneca's Apocolocyntosis dealing with the death of Claudian and the accession of Nero: At 4.27-32, Apollo is made to exclaim qualis.../ ...Sol aspicit orbem/.../ talis Caesar adest, talem iam Roma Neronem! aspiciet. flagrai., ./...adfuso cervix formosa capillo ('like the.. .sun.. .as he gazes on the world.. .such a Nero will Rome now gaze upon.. ..His shapely neck [blazes] with flowing hair'). The verbal similarities, the Roma/ orbis dualism and the contrasting detail in calvo/ adfuso.. .capillo all point to direct imitation, rather than to commonplace formulae.21 Again, at 56-57 iam letifero cedente pruinis/autumno.../stridebat deformis hiems ('now, as pestilential autumn was giving way to frosts.. .foul winter [sc. wind] was shrieking...') appears to imitate Apoc. 2.4-5 et deformis hiems gratos carpebat honores/ divitis autumni ("and foul winter was plucking the pleasing tribute of rich Autumn').22 Taken together, these two 'timing' indicators suggest that the dramatic situation of the Apocolocyntosis (the death of an emperor and the advent of his successor) has influenced that of the fourth satire.23 A third and final pointer is the fisherman's flattering suggestion that Domitian should consume a turbot tua servatum...in saecula (68). saecula here means the 'new age' inaugurated by the emperor's accession (below, VI: the word is similarly used in the Apocolocyntosis [4.24]). I conclude that the dramatic date of the turbot consilium falls in the autumn either of 8 1 (i.e. within two months of Domitian' s accession) or 82. In either case, the consilium was meant to be seen as an early event in the reign. But why has Juvenal so clearly chosen an 'early' date? Why did he not rather depict some later point, perhaps in the 90s, more clearly representative of Domitian's 'tyranny'? In what follows, I want to suggest that the dramatic date reflects the time of writing, that Juvenal was himself writing in a post-accession period, and that his aim was to present implicit contrasts between Domitian and the early Hadrianic era. III: 'Laudatio' , 'Vituperado' and Gluttony. The fourth satire satirises the language of imperial panegyric (laudatio). A central example is its imitation of Statius' de Bello Germanico ?4 Laudatio is also suggested in the fisher- man's address to Domitian as a quasi-divinity (65-69; below, 128-29), and in Fabricius Veiiento's encomiastic interpretation of the turbot as an omen of future conquest (124-28).25 Again, laudatio is ironically deployed in the portrayal of Montanus' unrivalled usus edendi (136-43) and in praise {laudo, 18) of the schemer who purchases expensive fish for purposes 21 For J. and the Apocolocyntosis, see Courtney 1980, 197-98. 22 The borrowing is noted by Courtney 1980 ad loc ; deformis hiems also occurs at Sil. 3.489. 23 The Apocolocyntosis also describes a consilium (of the gods). The dramatic date of the consilium in Statius' de Bello Germanico is not known. On Syme's reading, and depending on the date of commencement of the expedition, it could have fallen between spring/summer 82 and early 83. But there is no reason to assume that Juvenal took his dramatic dating from Statius or that the turbot consilium must have taken place at an equal distance of time from Domitian's accession. 24 Griffith 1969. 25 On adulatio in satire 4, Sweet 1979, 289.</page><page sequence="5">ALEX HARDIE: JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN 121 of captatio or sexual conquest (18-21). Here, traditional targets of the satirist's vituperation, the captator and fornicator, are transformed into objects of ironic laudatio , in comparison to the glutton, who buys such a fish for personal consumption (22).26 Juxtaposed with this 4 laudatio ' is its rhetorical opposite, invective ( vituperatio ). This is introduced in the attack on Crispinus, and is sustained in the portrayal of Domitian and his consilium.21 A significant feature is the use for vituperative effect of intertextual references which in their original contexts had carried encomiastic force. An example, in the attack on Crispinus, is aegrae solaque libidine fortes/deliciae (3-4), which recalls Martial's earlier praise of this same Crispinus' natty dress sense (, deliciae , 8.48.6) but sarcastically reverses the force of the borrowed word.28 Another example of this satirical interchange between praise and blame terms was suggested earlier (dis aequa pote s tas, see above, 118), and further instances will be considered below. The primary topic of invective selected for satirical scrutiny is 'gluttony'. On the basis of a courtier's (Crispinus') gluttony, revealed in the purchase of a mullet for his own con- sumption, it is inferred that the emperor must be a still greater glutton (28-29, see below, 122). It is this moralising, satirical inference which prompts the narrative of the turbot consilium. Thus, the ostensible aim of the epic narrative (37-154) is to 'prove' that Domitian is an imperial glutton on a grand scale. There is a striking parallel, in Hipponax fr. 128 W., for Juvenal's deployment of epic parody (with appeal to the Muses) in a vituperative poem about a gluttonous tyrant who is doomed to perish by popular will (cf. cerdonibus , 153; see below, 122); and it may be that this (hexameter) poem was in some way influential in shaping the satire and its vituperative focus on gluttony. Another, more general, influence will have been fish consumption as a topic of Roman and Greek invective. This topic has recently been illuminated by James Davidson.29 Expensive fish was associated in Athenian popular thought with conspicuous consumption, with the gulf between rich and poor lifestyles and thus with 'class' distinctions. Fish acquired symbolic associations with acquisitive behaviour, together with a range of metaphorical applications. It entered the vocabulary of vituperative rhetoric. Fish could represent power and its abuse, and overweening ambition. Thus, in comic burlesque, a person buying any but the commonest species of fish might be accused of aiming at the revolutionary overthrow of democratic rule, and the establishment of tyranny.30 A separate, but related connection with 'rulers' is a series of anecdotes recording the reservation of remarkable catches of fish for Greek tyrants and Roman emperors.31 26 In speaking of 'the satirist' or of 'Juvenal* (in inverted commas) I mean the literary persona deployed as satirical speaker, as distinct from the poet himself: cf. Sweet 1979, 284; Hardie 1998, 235. For the flawed persona of the 'angry satirist' in the first book, see Anderson 1964; Braund 1988, 1-23. For interesting comments on the satire as a study of the satirist himself, Sweet 1979, 283-84; 292-95; 298-300. 27 On contrasted laudatio and vituperatio in the neighbouring Sat. 3, see Hardie 1998. The best exploration of vituper- atio in 4 is by Sweet 1979, 290-300 (though I do not agree that vituperatio gives way to 'epic mockery' when J. passes from Crispinus to Domitian: vituperatio is present throughout). For monstrum as a standard term of invective, Nisbet- Hubbard on Hor. Odes 1.37.21. 28 Colton 1991, 145-46. 29 Davidson 1993.

Davidson 1993, 59-61.</page><page sequence="6">122 BICS-42- 1997-98 Davidson locates the fourth satire within this pattern of vituperative motifs. Together with Hipponax fr. 128 W. (above), these motifs certainly bring into sharper focus the 'popular' element in Juvenal's conclusion (153-54) sed periit postquam cerdonibus esse timendus/ coeperat: hoc nocuit Lamiarum caede madenti. The eventual revolution at Rome involved the removal of a tyrannus (86) by the common people (thus, cerdonibus ), in the face of spinelessness by the aristocratic elite (thus, Lamiarum). The turbot may be seen as an omen of the ultimate reversal of Domitian's fortunes (below, V, VI).32 In this respect, it recalls Herodotus' account (3.42.1-2) of the presentation of a great fish to the tyrant Polycrates of Samos, where a fisherman claims his catch to be be oev re... ãÇioç Kai vfjç afjç áp%fjç ('worthy of you and of your rule') and where it foreshadows Polycrates' eventual fall.33 Seen in this broad 'fish consumption' context, the opening attack on Crispinus' sexual excesses (3-4; 9-10) and his purchase of expensive fish (15-33) gains in coherence. Davidson persuasively highlights conceptual links in the traditional material between the purchase of fish and sexual lust, again with strong figurative interplay.34 Crispinus, moreover, is a classic upstart, whose rise to power ( iam princeps equitum , 32) is paralleled by the reversal in his fish-activities (not selling any more, but buying). That he had been a seller of commonplace fish (33) signals humorous combination of stereotypical attacks on the profits made by fishmongers with traditional envy of the upward social/political mobility of the buyer of expensive fish.35 Juvenal also draws a parallel between Crispinus' purchase of private land in central Rome (&lt; emerit , 7) and his purchase of fish for personal consumption (15; 22). The acquisition of landed estates does not itself feature as a topic among the metaphorical applications of fish-purchase listed by Davidson, but the latter is commonly associated with the loss of estates through profligacy, or, as at Sat. 4.26-27, with the cost of estates as a comparable expenditure). With Crispinus' proven gluttony, Juvenal juxtaposes Domitian (28- 31): qualis tunc epulas ipsum gluttisse putamus induperatorem, cum tot sestertia, partem exiguam et modicae sumptam de margine cenae, purpureus magni ructarit scurra Palati Vituperatio is combined with the language of laudatio, induperatorem , 'a dignified word, rendered incongruous by the context of gluttony' (Braund) is Ennian and might here be supposed to represent a Statian designation, from the de Bello Germanico. The sarcastic modicae... cenae recalls that Domitian had been praised, during his reign, for his moderate eating habits and for acting as a role model in this respect for his household: compare Statius Silvae 5.1.121-22 ipsa [sc. Priscilla, dead wife of imperial secretary Abascantus] dapes módicas et sobria pocula traditi exemplumque ad erile monet. That Statian laudatio was pretty accurate in this area is indicated by Suetonius (Dom. 21): prandebatque ad satietatem , ut non temere super cenam praeter Matianum malum et modicam in ampulla potiunculam sumeret. This is a neutral description of a pattern of eating (main meal prandium , with cena 32 For the turbot as omen , cf. 124-25, and below, V. 33 Ephippus 5 K-A; Davidson 1993, 61. 34 Davidson 1993, 62-64. 35 For the activities of fishmongers in this context, Davidson 1993, 56.</page><page sequence="7">ALEX HARDIE: JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN 123 as a light supplement) which Pliny contrives to demonise when praising Trajan's eating habits (Pan. 49.5-8): he suggests, by implicit contrast, that Domitian's ostensible frugality was a mask for solitary eating (solitaria cena) and secret gluttony (clandestinam ganeam occultumque luxum ) both before and after the cena. That allegation is itself subject to discreet refutation by Suetonius (ibid.): convivabatur frequenter ac large , sed paene raptim; certe non ultra solis occasum nec ut postea comisaretur. Suetonius adds a comment as to Domitian 's true post- prandial activity, correcting, perhaps not without humour, the Trajanic distortion: nam ad horam somni nihil aliud quam solus secreto deambulai. All this illustrates how the same pattern of activity may be presented by different writers in laudatory (Statius), vituperative (Pliny), and neutral/factual (Suetonius) terms. In taking 'gluttony' as his point of departure, Juvenal chooses an area where Domitian had been blameless, but had been traduced by Pliny in a cheap panegyrical contrast with Trajan. The satirist alludes to the favourable tradition in modicae ... cenae , but distorts it, ostensibly for vituperative ends. Does he thereby align himself with Pliny's imputation of gluttony, and thus with the anti- Domitianic propaganda of the early Trajanic years, or does he rather satirise that propaganda, lying closer in time and in spirit to Suetonius' treatment? Are we really to take this invective seriously, or is it a pastiche of the real thing? It is time to consider Juvenal's portrayal of Domitian in more general terms and with a more open mind. In doing so, the reader may be guided by three signals as to Juvenal's possible intentions. The first is a preambular reference to rhetorical exaggeration (17); the second is his 'admission' that his praise of the Muses as puellae is motivated by self-interest, not by concern for truth (36, prosit mihi vos dixisse puellas ), allied to his use of 'the lying epic idiom to tell a tale that he has just claimed is strictly true (res vera agitur )'.36 The third, which follows immediately, is the extreme, indeed patently exaggerated, vituperatio of Domitian and his reign in the narrative introduction (37-38). Taken together, these passages signal self conscious awareness of the 'insincerity' of laudatio and vituperatio ; and they suggest that Juvenal's true aims may not, after all, lie in further vilification of the long-dead Domitian.37 IV: The 'Bad Ruler y and his Advisers Although Domitian is the central figure in the narrative portion of the satire, his character remains obscure.38 We mostly see him through the eyes of others, and through authorial comment. We see him, moreover, not as an individual human being but simply and solely as the holder of his official position.39 He is the last member of the Flavian dynasty, and in that sense heir to the last of the Julio-Claudians, Nero (37-38). At this leVel, Domitian emerges 36 Sweet 1979, 298-99 (quotation from 299). 37 Each succeeding reign posed its own questions about laudatio , its sincerity, and panegyric of past rulers; for a penetrating study of Pliny* s Panegyricus in this context, Bartsch 1994, 148-187. 38 Sweet 1979, 285. 39 This is emphasised by the range of titles and official functions reflected in the satire, as noted by Sweet 1979, 284-85: he is induperator (29), pontifex (46), Caesar (51; 135); dominus (52; 96); dux (145); cf. sub iudice morum (12), with reference to the emperor as censor.</page><page sequence="8">124 BICS-42- 1997-98 as a 'bad' emperor, lacking all the traditional virtutes of the good princeps.40 He is, indeed, a sterotypical 'bad ruler', within the terms formulated in rhetorical and philosophical writings on kingship.41 He is, allegedly, a tyrannus (86);42 he lacks self control, foresight and mild- ness; he is a poor model for imitation, inequitable in his administration of justice, a slave- master to his people, surrounded by poor advisers and susceptible to flattery; he is of poor physical appearance; and he is compared to two other 'bad kings', Tarquinius Superbus (102-3), and Agamemnon ( Atrìden , antonomasia for Domitian at 65).43 All this might appear more in tune with the post-Domitianic propaganda of Tacitus and Pliny than with the bio- graphical tradition represented by Suetonius. To the former, Domitian' s reign was all bad.44 But as portrayed by Suetonius, it deteriorated after a tolerable start. At first, Domitian displayed abstinentia , liberalitas (9.1), and even dementia (10.1); he is credited with con- scientious administration of justice (8.1); he aroused no suspicion of cupiditas or of avaritia (9.1-2), and to have discouraged delatores (9.3). saevitia , it is claimed, emerged later, and accelerated after 89 (10.5). Juvenal's 'all black' portrayal of Domitian, as a tyrannus by 81 or 82, is thus anachronistic.45 In attempting a closer assessment of Juvenal's vituperative anachronisms, I propose to focus on the relationship between Domitian and his advisers, as it emerges in the dramatic interplay of the consilium debate. In most assessments of the satire, the advisers' conduct and attitudes are ascribed to the tyrannical personality of Domitian and to the fear he inspired.46 On this reading, Domitian as emperor is personally responsible for his amici and for the wider deleterious effects of his reign. That a king should have good advisers was, unsurprisingly, an important topic of kingship literature.47 And that the ruler was a model for imitation by his subjects was also a commonplace.48 Contemporary interest in the interplay of a new emperor and his advisers, particularly as revealed in the former's early actions, is suggested in Tacitus' study of Tiberius and his courtiers in Annales l.49 In the fourth satire, the destabilising uncertainties involved in amicitia with a 'bad ruler' are suggested, by 40 Braund 1993, 64-68. monstrum nulla virtute redemptum/a vitiis (2-3, of Crispinus) carries technical reference to Domitian 's lack of imperial virtutes (fortes (3) alludes to fortitudo).

Summing up, he utters four words (130): quidnam igitur censes? conciditur?. His lead is rejected by Montanus (130-31), whose sententia (construction of a huge patina) wins the day (137). Comparison of this passage with the Panegyricus reveals a striking contrast. At 76.2-3, comparing Trajanic and Domitianic meetings of the Senate, Pliny says interrogatus censuit quisque quod placuit Ř, licuit dissentire... vicitque sententia non prima sed melior. at quis antea loqui, quis hiscere audebat, praeter miseros illos qui primi interro gabantur? Why, then, does Montanus refute Domitian, and 4 win'? One dimension lies in Montanus' long proximity to emperors. He represents luxuriam inperii veterem noctesque Neronis (137); and he embodies continuity and the perpetuation of old ( veterem ) ways in the new reign. Specifically, he perpetuates Neronian gourmandizing, thereby helping to substantiate the notion that Domitian represented a throwback to Nero ( Neronis , 137; cf. Neroni , 38). Montanus' familiarity with the court is underlined in his instructions to the imperial slaves (134).51 But who, it might be asked, is in charge, if a courtier can issue commands at court? The question is posed at an earlier point, in the portrayal of Crispinus as the 'purple buffoon of the great Palatine, belching...' (31, cited above, 122): the upstart Crispinus, now an eques , arrogates to himself not only the imperial colour (purpureus ), but the bad manners of the typical tyrannical' host (belching);52 and Crispinus, like Montanus, represents a throwback to the style of the Neronian court, an element of continuity in the consilium of the new emperor.53 Apparently trivial in itself ( nugis , 150), the turbot incident has wider implications for the new emperor's susceptibility to the corrupting influence of his own amici , and indeed to that of the imperial court which he had inherited as Flavius.. .ultimus (37-38). Domitian's consilium was inherited from earlier reigns. Domitian also inherited the entire structure of imperial agents and court flunkeys whose existence determines the pattern of events in the fourth satire: the inquisitores (49) who (in the fisherman's estimation) make it pointless to do anything other than present the fish to Domitian, and the Liburnian slave who has the proceres running to the consilium. And in the process, the structure grows, for on Montanus' advice, a new element is added, the household figuli (135). The workings of the court are designated in the ritualistic formality of impersonal passives: itur (65) and surgitur (144). The new princeps himself slips into linguistic conformity: thus, conciditur ?. underlined by the jingle in igitur (130).54 From such narrative clues, a picture emerges of a princeps who in his early months is by no means the sole master of events. Domitian is the heir to an 50 Thus, 37-38 ( lacerarei ; servirei ); 74-75 {miser ae. . . amicitiae ; 84 {clade et peste sub illa/saevitiam damnare ); 86 ( quid violentius aure tyranni...)' 95 (i mors tam saeva ); 144-46 (proceres.

Interpretations of the fourth satire as an exercise in autocratic manipulation are in my view wide of the mark. Domitian summons an urgent consilium : but that he does this simply as a frivolous demonstration of his own power is an assumption which ignores his passivity in the face of unfolding events, as well as clues to a possible alternative motivation. These may be found in the fisherman's anathematicon , in which the anticipated consumption of the fish is treated as if it were a public festive occasion (below, 129). The fisherman, a common man and himself the product of his age, articulates conventional encomiastic slogans to the new princeps ; and the latter makes the mistake of taking him seriously. That Domitian can be misled into thinking that his consumption of a fish is anything other than a personal and individual act, is of course bizarre. It represents credulity of a high order, and a crucial failure of independent judgment. The emperor takes his cue from the speech of a subject, including his exhortation to haste ( propera , 67), an urgency which then ripples through the system, and the satire.55 In approaching an issue which he believes (cf. credere , 70) to have a public dimension and to require a quick decision, he summons his consilium , and he allows himself to be guided by its advice. The whimsical action of an allegedly gluttonous tyrant can thus be seen in a different light, as a misguided attempt to act out the role of emperor in the manner Domitian felt was expected of him. The first actions of any monarch (in any age) will naturally be scrutinised by contemporaries and historians for pointers to the style of the new man and to the future course of the reign. Domitian was no exception. Suetonius' paragraph {Dom. 9) beginning inter initia ... points to just such a fascination with early form. The biographer would have it that Domitian' s rule deteriorated, and that the initial promise was disappointed. Juvenal offers a more interesting analysis. Underneath all the vituperative slogans of the satirist, he implies a human rationale, in the passivity and credulity of Domitian when facing his imperial inheritance. In a satire which opens with a dramatic metaphor (et est mihi saepe vocandus/ad partes , 1-2), Crispinus the man of parts, it is tempting to see also the features of the tragic king.56 Agamemnon, to whom Domitian is compared ( Atriden , 65), was conventionally portrayed as deceived by his wife and blind to the portents of his coming assassination.57 It might be argued that such a human, 'tragic' study of the pressures, pitfalls and temptations confronting a new emperor could be written under Trajan and as a coded reaction to Trajanic propaganda. But it is very hard to see what purpose would have been served by such an enter- prise. A satire which pokes fun at the encomiastic solemnities of the Panegyricus would arguably have aspired more realistically to acclaim at Hadrian's court than at that of his predecessor.58 55 Sweet 1979, 286. 56 So Braund on 63-5: 'At ride s may also evoke the portrayal of the fall of Agamemnon in tragedy, perhaps foreshadowing Domitian's fall at 153-4/ For suggested tragic influence on other grounds, Deroux 1983, 294-95; 298.

The vituperatio cannot simply be sidelined as the expression of a flawed satiric personality. It can be used to offset the laudatio (acting, in a sense, as its foil) and to explore deeper truths and realities, as Juvenal himself may see them. Of course, this raises wider questions than can be answered in the study of a single satire, and the interpretative framework suggested here will need further testing and refinement.59 V: The Religious Dimension The first dramatic scene (the catching of the turbot) is located by reference to the temple of Venus at Ancona (39-40), while the second (the conclusion of the fisherman's journey to Domitian 's Alban villa) includes reference to the cult of Vesta at Alba Longa. The Alban cult is correlated (in Vestam... minorem, 61) with the major cult of Vesta at Rome, and this in turn connects with the prefatory reference (9-10) to the Vestal Virgin Cornelia and her execution for incest in 93. Domitian himself is designated, qua destined recipient of the turbot, as ponti- fe X maximus (45-46). To a significant degree, therefore, the satire is 'religious' in orientation. The religious dimension has been studied from various angles. Weinreich saw that both the monstrum- turbot and its willingness to be caught ( ipse capi voluti, 69) constitute prodigia , as does the spontaneous opening of the villa doors as the piscator approaches (facili patuerunt cardine valvae , 63).60 Elaborating this insight, Deroux suggested that the monstrum/ prodigium was a signal of divine displeasure; and that together with another monstrum (Crispinus; 2), it should have been submitted by the pontífices to the process of procuratio prodigiorum , whereby might be determined the identity of the god(s) offended, the reason for this displeasure and the nature of the expiation to be offered (that Domitian, as Pontife x Maximus fails to initiate this process may be regarded as an impious error, induced by the flattering suggestion of the piscator that he eat it himself).61 Another attempt to relate the satire to Roman religion has recently been made by Roberta Stewart (1994), emphasising the importance within the satire of the cult of Vesta and of Cornelia's trial at the Alban Villa (cf. 9-10).62 An aspect of the imperial Vesta cult not stressed by Stewart was its role in identifying the emperor and his household with the Roman state religion. Since Augustus' assumption of the post of Pontife x Maximus ( PM ), the person of the princeps had been intimately linked with Vesta and with the Palladium, the pignus imperii (guarantee of imperial eternity), which resided in her temple.63 The conceptual association of Augustus as PM , the hearth and fire of Vesta and the Palladium was underlined by Augustus' action, celebrated by Ovid in the 59 1 deal with Juvenal's combined deployment of laudatio and vituperatio in the third satire, in Hardie, 1998. 60 Weinreich 1928, 166-70. monstrum is foreshadowed by spatium admir abile, where admirabile can denote porten- tous phenomena, including prodigia : Juv. 6.646-47; 13.53; Cat. 64.15; Accius ap.

This was a big step in the process of identifying the state and its public institutions with the person of the emperor and with his household.64 So close was the linkage of PM and Vesta that Ovid could portray the assassination of Julius Caesar as an attack on the 'priest of Vesta', and thus, by implication, on the very hearth of the Roman people.65 This same identification of Vesta with 'her' PM underlies the anathematicon of the piscator , appealing to Domitian to accept the turbot (65-69): itur ad Atriden. tum Picens 'accipe' dixit 'privatis maiora focis. genialis agatur iste dies, propera stomachum laxare sagina et tua servatum consume in saecula rhombum. ipse capi voluit.' privatis maiora focis, suggesting that only the imperial kitchens can cope with the turbot, alludes to the publicus focus of Vesta and equates the kitchen fire with that of Vesta (picking up ignem Troianum et Vestam, 61).66 The turbot, given to Domitian as PM (45-46) is to be cooked on the public hearth. Public and private are thereby interlinked. The piscator alludes also to the quasi-divine status of the emperor himself ( laudatur dis aequa potestas , 71), and to his numen and its power over nature ( ipse capi voluit).61 The imperial numen was itself closely related to the Vesta /PM association outlined above. This emerges in Ovid's treatment of Augustus and Vesta (Fast. 3.41 1-12): ignibus aeternis aeterni numina praesuntlCaesaris: imperii pignora iuncta vides ; the numen Augusti (itself a pignus imperii like the Palladium), presides over the fire of Vesta, and Vesta in turn is asked to protect Augustus (426). Separate from the emperor's numen , but overlapping with it in meaning, was his genius.6* The genius , tutelary spirit of the individual, had always been the object of household worship. In decreeing libations at banquets to Augustus' genius , the Senate extended the domestic worship of his household into the public sphere, and this trend was confirmed and accelerated by later measures, including the dedication of Augustus' household lares and penates in the Palatine shrine of Vesta.69 A public cult of the emperor's genius was established by Nero.70 Domitian' s promulgation of his genius is attested in a municipal lex (AD 82-84) providing for a magisterial oath by Jupiter, the deified emperors and genium Domitiani Aug(ustum) deosque Penates ( ILS 6088.XXVI); Pliny (Pan. 52.6) suggests that sacrificial thanksgivings were offered to Domitian' s genius ; and there are prominent 64 Fast . 3.415-28; 4.949-54. 65 Met. 15.776-78; Fast. 5.573-76; Herbert-Brown 1994, 69-70. 66 Cic.

The ostensible meaning, couched in vulgar but homely terms, is that Domitian should give his own genius a treat (i.e. by consumption of the turbot). But the appeal to private indulgence is combined with sloganeering terms suggestive of the impersonal observance of sacral ceremonial:72 the presentation of the turbot, it is hinted, is to be the occasion for public celebration of Domitian' s genius. Here again, the private personality of the princeps merges with his public existence and with observance of the sacral honours which were his due, qua emperor.73 Weinreich and Deroux showed that the turbot is a prodigium signalling divine displeasure and requiring procurado. But Domitian as PM fails to initiate this process, misled by tfye fisherman's flattering anathematicon into accepting it as an offering to his own divinity, and his own genius. The 'tragic' hybristic presumption in this sequence of events might be sufficient in itself to arouse or focus divine displeasure. But the reader may be left wondering why such a prodigium should have occurred at this stage of Domitian' s reign. Which god(s) might have been displeased, and for what reasons? Veiiento, as 'devotee of Bellona' attempts to explain the rhombus as a favourable omen of foreign conquest, by reference to one of its physical characteristic, erect dorsal fins. Equally portentous however, is the flat lozenge shape which gave the fish its name. A similarly shaped device, also called a rhombus (pójdfioç) was commonly used in aphrodisiac magic.74 So the question prompted by the (Greek) fish-name is this: might it connect with the turbot's catch-spot, 'in front of the house of Venus', at (Greek) Ancona (40)? Marine Venus was associated with fish and fishermen, while retaining her old interest in love and fertility;75 and dissection of fish (cf. 130?) could itself be associated with erotic incantation, magical love charms and seduction.76 Two passages in our satire bear on these issues. Both describe contemporary amici Caesaris as monstra (thereby inviting comparison with the turbot) and both have to do with perversions of amor . One is the blind Catullus qui numquam visae flagrabat amore puellae! grande et conspicuum nostro quoque tempore monstrum (1 14-15); the other is Crispinus, a monstrum whose incestům with a Vestal Virgin is the subject of the opening lines. It is, therefore, open to suggestion that the conjunction of rhombus and Venus 71 1.1.58; 4.2.26; 5.1.74, 187 (where genius worship is appropriate to a freedman, working within the imperial domus); Scott 1936, 117. 72 OLD s.v. ago 30. 73 Given the association of genius with birthday, there might be some suggestion of a 'second birthday'.

Moreover, the satirical assertion of the legal claim of the fiscus to any outstanding catch, aequore toto (54-55) would not only annexe for the emperor's private treasury what was recognised in law to be commune ; it would distort the law in order to trespass on Venus' marine domain.80 It may be, therefore, that the fisherman's perception of the inevitability of a legal claim to the fish by imperial agents further exemplifies the emperor's personal encroachment on venerable Roman institutions. Venus herself, the mother of all Romans, had at an earlier stage in imperial history been annexed as the dynastic deity of the Julian gens}1 Venus' displeasure might thus focus on a phenomenon inherent in the imperial system itself, and in the evolution of the household of the princeps , its growing tendency to encroach on, and to embody, the institutions of the state. The ideological relevance of Venus in the reign of Hadrian to the relationship between the person of the princeps , the res publica and the populus Romanus will be reviewed in section VII. VI: Novum Saeculum The piscator assures Domitian that the turbot is tua servatum...in saecula (68). He thereby identifies Domitian as the man of the saeculum and heralds the new age ushered in by the new ruler.82 Such ideas had been common currency at Rome since the mid-first century BC and had taken on particular significance in the period leading up to the Ludi Saeculares of Augustus in 17 BC. Domitian celebrated his own Saecular Games in AD 88. As might be expected, Juvenal exploits Domitian's novum saeculum for ironic effect: the speech of the piscator underlines just how commonplace (and devalued) the concept had become; the conventional role of 'man of the age' as 'saviour' of Roma underlies his suggestion that Domitian eat a rhombus 'saved' until his reign;83 the parallel role of 'future conqueror' is satirised in Veiiento's prophecy of a great triumph (124-27) and undercut by reference to the 77 Cf. Ferguson's comments on line 40. Erotic content: 3; 9; 20; 36 (implicitly of the 'praise' of the puellae Muses who, it is implied, are no longer virgins); 106 (cinaedo)' 114. 78 It is relevant that amicitia and amicus were both etymologised from amor (Maltby 1991 s.w.): perversion of amor is interlinked with perversion of amicitia at court. 79 A fish-sacrifice to Venus would be suggestively paralleled in Theocritus fir. 3, where a sacred fish is dedicated to (probably) Aphrodite-Berenice. 80 The communelpúvate contrast is well brought out in the parallel material cited by Mayor ad loc. For Venus and the law, cf. Ov. Fast. 4.92-93: iUa tenet nullo regna minora deofiuraque dat cáelo, terrae , natalibus undis...; the passage refers to Venus Genetrix , as a compliment to the Julian house, and her concern with iura can be explained by reference to her temple on the Forum Iulium, itself built to extend the lawcourts (Weinstock 1971, 80-82). 81 Weinstock 1971, 80-90; 91; Herbert-Brown 1994, 81-95.

By contrast, Hadrian's early religious policy involved the conspicuous presentation of 'saecular' themes. It drew extensively on the concept of the Roman saecula , the series of ages, variously computed, which stretched back to the foundation of the city and beyond that to the fall of Troy.87 The transition from one saeculum to the next had to be negotiated with care, a process normally achieved by the staging of Ludi Saecularesř 8 Hadrian did not himself stage a saecular festival (Domitian' s celebration of AD 88 will have been too recent for any such manifestation). But in AD 1 17, he immediately signalled interest in saecular themes with the appearance on coinage of the phoenix.89 The phoenix symbolised change, self-renewal and eternity. It had traditionally been associated with saecular and astrological lore and had most recently been deployed in saecular propaganda by Claudius in 47 (the 800th anniversary of the foundation of Rome; Pliny HN 10.5).90 Syme plausibly suggested that 1 17, as 'the year of the phoenix', is connected with a significant anniversary, the 1200th anniversary of the foundation of Rome, calculated on a pre-Varronian reckoning which placed it 100 years after the fall of Troy.91 The phoenix features again on the coinage of AD 121. 92 An aureus carrying the legend aureum saeculum depicts a young man within a zodiacal circle, holding an orb on which is perched a phoenix. Tacitus devotes a prominent chapter (6.28) to an alleged sighting of the phoenix in Egypt in AD 34, a piece of learned antiquarianism which has plausibly been seen as a reference to the phoenix iconography of 1 17:93 this saecular phoenix (post longum saeculorum ambitům) prompted learned discussion about its age (de numero annorum ), its country of origin (not, it was alleged, Arabia, as should have been the case), and its pattern of behaviour in flying to the ara Solis at Heliopolis. Juvenal does not speak of the phoenix. But his saecular turbot (tua servatum...in saecula rhombum , 68) plays a comparable post-accession role to the phoenix projected on the coinage of 1 17. Veiiento's ironic failure patriam ut rhombi memorarei et annos 129) is intriguingly reminiscent of the phoenix controversies, as reported by Tacitus.

VII: The ' Templům Veneris et Romae ' The Templům Venens et Romae stood at the heart of Hadrian's religious programme and of renovatio in a new aureum saeculum . Hadrian was personally involved in the design, and promulgated drawings of the temple and its proposed cult statues at a relatively early stage.95 This was the first major appearance at Rome of the eastern cult of Dea Roma .% The temple was the biggest in Rome, and was Greek in design.97 It was, in fact, a Greek temple at the heart of Rome, lying north of the Sacra Via, between the Arch of Titus and the Flavian Amphitheatre. The cult statue of Roma Aeterna , seated and holding the Palladium in her right hand, symbolised the aeternitas of Rome as seat of the empire; and that of Venus Felix , also seated and holding Amor , symbolised the felicitas and fecundity of the age, but also recalled Venus as the ancestress of the Aeneadae , and thus of the Roman race.98 Placed back to back, the statues have been well described as 'representing Rome's perennial might rest[ing] on the Roman people'; and the temple itself 'was to unite all Romans in a new state cult that reflected their glory and their origins'.99 Such cult and iconographie issues might appear to lie some distance from Juvenal's concerns. But that Juvenal is, at some level, interested in Venus is clear enough (above, 129-30). The lines which introduce her occur at the start of the narrative and may serve as a basis for discussion of her temple (37-41): cum iam semianimum laceraret Flavius orbem ultimus et calvo serviret Roma Neroni, incidit Hadriaci spatium admirabile rhombi ante domum Veneris, quam Dorica sustinet Ancón, implevitque sinus; 94 Gagé 1936 151-87; also Gagé 1934, 94-97.

In assessing this important passage, from a point of admitted chronological uncertainty, it is fair to pose a hypothetical question: if the satire were indeed Hadrianic (written, say, around 1 18-120), what would its first audience have made of these lines? How would it have reacted to Juvenal's juxtaposition of Venus and Ancona, Roma and the start of Domitian' s reign? I have suggested (above, 118) that on such dating, Hadrìaci would have brought to mind Hadrian's own cognomen. Is it further possible that the Ancona temple would have brought to mind his personal project, the Templům Veneris et Romael To suggest any detailed correlation between Juvenal's text (and a provincial temple) and a Roman temple which had yet to be built might seem, on the face of things, implausible. But there is no great difficulty in postulating public knowledge, pre- 121, of Hadrian's plans for the Templům Veneris et Romae.m And a precedent for such fore- knowledge is to hand in the projected temple of Clementia Caesaris decreed by the Senate in 45 BC, together with statuary of Julius Caesar and Clementia clasping hands; although never built, this projected temple appeared on coinage in 44 BC.101 As for a provincial / Roman correlation there is a parallel, though admittedly not an exact one, with the correlation of the Alban and Roman cults of Vesta (61; above, 127). The possibility of a correlation between Juvenal's Ancona temple and the Templům Veneris et Romae is not, then, to be dismissed out of hand. Juvenal stresses the Greek character of Ancona ( Dorica ) and suggests a particularly close relationship between city and goddess (40). The relative quam is, however, ambiguous: it may have domum as its antecedent, in which case sustinet suggests that the town supports the temple in an elevated situation (and correctly so, for the temple stood on a hill);102 but the antecedent could also be Veneris , in which case sustinet might also have dual meaning, suggesting that Ancona 'supports' Venus herself with food ( OLD s.v. 3b), and this would be an appropriate nuance in the context of a large catch of fish. Such an anthropomorphic conception is consistent with the designation of the temple as Venus' 'home' {domum Veneris ), itself a reflection of the ancient identification of cult statues with the gods they represented.103 Indeed, insofar as Juvenal may suggest that the cult statue of Venus may get 'sustenance' from catches of fish, it is something of a reductio ad absurdum of that concept.104 As it happens, the sacral and topographical features reflected in line 40 were the subject of controversy in relation to the Templům Veneris et Romae. According to an anecdote preserved by Dio's epitomator (69.4.3-5), Hadrian sent the plans of the proposed temple to Apollodorus of Damascus (Trajan's architect), and invited him to comment. He replied that the temple 'ought to have been built in a raised position.. .so that from its higher setting it 100 MacDonald 1982, 136 suggests that the plans were forwarded to Apollodorus in the mid- 120s. This seems far too late, for the temple precint was dedicated in 121, and construction is likely to have started by 125 at the latest.

The thrust of Apollodorus' reported comments relates precisely to the Greek character of the temple and its cult statues, the disproportionate size of which in relation to the cella was modelled on Greek practice.108 As phrased, these comments explicitly equate the goddesses with their cult statues, and implicitly draw on the concept of the temple as the goddesses' home (again, compare Juvenal's reflections of these anthropomorphic concepts).109 Whether Juvenal's Dorica might carry any technical reference to the Doric style of architecture ( OLD s.v. b) is uncertain; but it is worth noting the suggestion that the decastyle temple of Venus and Roma, placed on a low, stepped podium, may have given it the proportions of a traditional Greek Doric temple.110 A striking feature of the narrative introduction is the prominence of Nfcro ( calvo Neroní). Juvenal means to suggest Nero's role as a model for Domitian's reign. However, Nero happens also to have particular relevance for Hadrian's Templům Veneris et Romae. The temple site covered some of the ground previously occupied by Nero's Domus Aurea , thereby reclaiming for public use land which had been expropriated for the imperial living space.111 The Domus Aurea is the subject of an implicit reference in Juvenal's opening attack on Crispinus' property (5-7), in particular his iugera... vicina foro (7).112 A surviving relic of the Domus Aurea was the colossal bronze statue of Nero which had stood in its vestibulum , and which had been converted by Vespasian to carry the features of the deified Sol.1 13 This object, rising to a height of over 100 feet, was moved from the site of the new temple to a position between it and the Flavian Amphitheatre ( SHA Hadr. 19.12-13). 105 Dio 69.4.4 (Apollodorus commented) ... on tcaì fierecopo v avròv ... yevéoůai êxpfjv, iV êç re rfjv iepàv òôòv ¿K&lt;1&gt;avéarepoç èÇ viļrr)Xoxēpov eir¡ ....

I believe this is correct., and that at this point Juvenal has in mind standing cult statues of the Muses, which he asks to *sit down'. 110 Boatwright 1987, 120. 111 Boatwright 1987, 132. 112 For the allusion to the Domus Aurea, Townend 1973, 155; iumenta fatiget (5) suggests pack animals (cf.

Valerius Catullus Messalinus' praise of the turbot (1 19-122): nemo magis rhombum stupuit; nam plurima dixit in laevum conversus, at illi dextra iacebat belua. sic pugnas Cilicis laudabat et ictus et pegma et pueros inde ad velaria raptos. Catullus' praise of gladiatorial contests and of spectacular effects in theatrical performances suggests regular attendance at an amphitheatre. The comparison seems rather forced; but the context (ingratiating flattery) suggests reference to the Flavian Amphitheatre. There might, then, be a topographical signal in Catullus' 'left'/'right' confusion to the Amphitheatre's proximity, on the east side of the Templům Veneris et Romae ,114 The Templům Veneris et Romae represented a reversal of the policy of previous emperors both spatially (in that it involved the return to public use of land annexed for private imperial construction) and ideologically (in that it 'extolled Rome's traditions rather than an individual dynasty').115 The temple thus embodied Hadrian's claim populi rem esse , non propriam (SHA Hadr. 8.3). It is possible, moreover, that in pursuing this collective approach, Hadrian chose to associate it with the genius of the city of Rome: Athenaeus (361e-f) links the Parilia/Romaia festival with the temple foundation rfj rfjç nóÀecoç Tv%r]' and Tv%rj is the standard translation of Latin genius (in a series of bilingual dedications to the imperial house made at Perge in the period 119-122, one is made GENIO CIVITATIS / TTXH THE IIOAEQE, suggesting reproduction of contemporary terminology at Rome).116 Focus on the genius of the city on the 21 April Parilia (the natalis Romae , birthday of Rome) would have been fitting. It might also have been designed as a 'collective' corrective to the emphasis laid by earlier emperors on the cult of their personal genius (reflected in genialis dies : above, 128-29). 117 One further dimension requires comment. It has been suggested by several scholars that in placing the statues of Roma and Venus (carrying Amor) back to back, Hadrian was reflecting the well-known palindrome, of Roma and Amor.m This suggestion gains in interest from a modern hypothesis, based on ancient evidence, that Amor was in fact the so-called 'secret name of Rome' (or, at any rate, a candidate for that unknown nomen)}19 Were such 1 14 Apollodorus argued for hollow chambers in the temple podium which 'might have accommodated the [theatre] machines in its basement, so that they could be put together unobserved and brought to the theatre unforeseen' (Loeb tr., adapted).

Persuasive argumentation for re-dating Juvenal's first two books is likely to be cumulative, and to proceed by identification of features which would have struck a Hadrianic audience with a sense of relevance or recognition. There is an inherent risk in this process of overplaying the evidence, and of seeing influential correlations between the historical record and Juvenal's text where none may have existed in reality. But at this early stage of the discussion, a short summary of the features of the fourth satire which are arguably Hadrianic in character may be helpful. On the hypothesis presented here, Juvenal reflects his time of writing in his choice of a dramatic date early in Domitian's reign. Domitian's reign (on the estimate of the piscator) was a novum saeculum ; and so, as we know, was Hadrian's. But whereas Hadrian's reign was introduced by the phoenix, symbol of renewal and eternity, Domitian's is marked by a monstrum-imboi, itself a prodigium signifying divine displeasure. Failing to recognise the portent, Domitian, as Pontifex Maximus , fails also to set in train the correct sacral procedure of procurado; and his advisers, in delusory prophecy of imperial expansion, actually see it as a favourable omen. The turbot' s catch-spot, in front of the Ancona temple of Venus, seems to point to her as a source of divine hostility. But Venus played a central and positive role in Hadrian's novum saeculum : no longer annexed to the ruling house as a dynastic goddess, she found a new Roman context in the Templům Veneris et Romae. At the heart of the satire lies the traditional identification of the person of the princeps with the state and with the multifarious agents of the imperial household and its fiscus. Domitian's personality is submerged in his ceremonial and state role. He inherits the system and is moulded and corrupted by it. In this area, Hadrian presented a strong ideological contrast from his predecessors, moving the focus away from his own person, and towards Roma and the sovereign inheritance of its populus. Of interest to Hadrian would have been Juvenal's portrayal of the gulf between proceres and common men, the boni (13), who, unlike Crispinus, do not enjoy immunity from the law. Hadrian was a populist. A central slogan is reflected in his assurance ita se rem publicam gesturum ut sciret populi rem esse , non propriam (SHA Hadr . 8.3). The state, he claimed, was not embodied in the princeps , but in the people. Populism is suggested also in his well- publicised remission of debts to the fiscus. 121 Informal in personal style, he ostentatiously mixed with subordinate ranks of society (SHA Hadr. 17.8: fuit et plebis iactantissimus amator): no 'class' gulf so far as he was concerned. At the same time, his domestic policies suggested that the state existed for the benefit and material security of all its citizens: aequitas 120 For amor in Sat. 3, see Hardie 1998, 250-51. Tony Woodman first suggested to me the possible relevance of the palindrome as represented by the back-to-back statuary. 121 SHA Hadr. 7.6.</page><page sequence="21">ALEX HARDIE: JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN 1 37 appears as a coin legend in 1 19 and in 121/122.122 These slogans amount to a presentational sea-change in the relationship between princeps and populus. In such an ideological environment, Juvenal's deployment of the old vituperative topics of fish, sex, elitism and revolution, and his evocation of the disabilities of the common man under a previous reign, would no doubt have found a strong resonance of approval and gratification at court. In foreign and frontier policy, too, Hadrian's actions lie in contrast with Juvenal's portrayal of Domitian and his court. Hadrian determined to abandon some of Trajan's eastern conquests.123 He also determined to 'keep the empire within its limits' (RIB 1051), a policy which he claimed had been 'laid upon him by divine command'. Proper assessment of references in the fourth satire to provincial affairs must await a study of Juvenal's treatment of the empire in the first book as a whole. But Veiiento implants the presumption of foreign conquest, the capture of kings and the fall of the British Arviragus (125-27). He evinces a kind of whimsical aggression, underlined by comparison to a ministrant of the bloodthirsty war goddess Bellona (123-24). 124 Here again, Domitian appears passive in the face of his courtiers. As it happens, Hadrian too faced problems in Britain and Germany at the start of his reign.125 His response was to enforce a new frontier strategy, entailing defensive measures in places where there were no natural boundaries. In some places, a pallisade of stakes was thrown up.126 In Britain, Hadrian's wall marked the reversal of Domitian's plans to conquer the whole country. Does Juvenal reflect these momentous issues? We cannot hope to know, since the planning and gestation period of the defensive frontier stategy is not attested. But it is perfectly likely that discussion was under way by the period 1 18-120, before Hadrian's departure on his visit to Germany and Britain in 121. And, making all due allowance for the uncertainties, speculation may reasonably fall on Montanus' recommendation testa alta paretur/quae tenui muro spatiosum colligat orbem (132): if, as has been recognised in earlier scholarly assessment, orbis (i.e. the turbot) can also refer in symbolical terms to ťthe world', it might be surmised that the murus is a further metaphor, a 'wall' confining the (imperial) world.127 On such a reading, the turbot would act not just as an omen of disaster for the expansionist Domitian, but, at longer range, as a positive portent of Hadrian's defensive strategy, walls and all. Intriguingly, there is evidence of opposition to Hadrian's frontier policy in his consilium', 128 and it would hardly be surprising if the new emperor faced a policy clash with his amici, inherited from Trajan.129 If that is the case, then Domitian's 122 Aequitas : Strack 1933, 94. Birley 1997, 93-112; Syme 1958, 487; cf. also Alexander 1938, esp. 172-75. There is a somewhat idiosyncratic assessment in Thornton 1975. 123 SHA Hadr. 5.3.

In this, I think he is reflecting the style and atmosphere of a new court, distant in time from Domitian's reign, and capable of taking a detached view of the rhetorical excesses, both favourable and hostile, which it had prompted. Inherent in such an outlook would be humour, as well as consciousness of the less than glorious role of literature and writers during the relevant periods. There is evidence that Hadrian encouraged sophisticated ways of assessing the past in relation to the present, and oblique approaches to celebrating his own reign: the seventh satire (certainly Hadrianic) illustrates these processes, and at the same time shows that Juvenal was able to make jokes about things which Hadrian took seriously.131 That the satirist should refer in humorous terms to the novum saeculum is not, therefore, an objection to Hadrianic dating; and barbato regi , itself (in my view) a reference to Hadrian (above, 1 17-18), is a further example of humorous irreverence. The arguments here put forward suggest that important features in the fourth satire are consistent with Hadrianic dating, and may best be explained on that hypothesis. Nothing stands in the way of post-1 17 dating; and read as a Hadrianic document, it can be appreciated both as a commentary on contemporary issues and as a document which would have amused, and flattered its principal auditor. That Hadrian is not praised directly, but rather through hints, allusions and implicit contrasts, is not, I have argued (118-19), problematic. But that assessment self evidently will require amplification, in a wider study of Juvenal, his reasons for writing satire and his relationship to the imperial court. Royal Holloway , and Foreign and Commonwealth Office, London 130 Kienast 1980, 402 and Syme 1988a, 160 (= Syme 1991, 347) note the near-conjunction of the inauguration of the site of the Templům Veneris et Romae with Hadrian's departure on his first major imperial journey, to Gaul, Germania and Britain. Birley 1997, 111 suggests that the project helped emphasise his devotion to Rome before an extended absence. 131 For Hadrian's toleration of jokes about things he took seriously, see Hardie 1990, 192.</page><page sequence="23">ALEX HARDIE: JUVENAL, DOMITIAN, AND THE ACCESSION OF HADRIAN 1 39 BIBLIOGRAPHY Abt, A., (1908).
