<plain_text><page sequence="1">Egalitarian Honors: Challenge English PATByIICK PATRfICK F. BERGER and DANIEL DESCHAMP WITH THE POPULARIZATION of the Coleman report, buttressed by the publi- city that Christopher Jencks has received, and strengthened with President Nixon's slash of educational funding, the much needed fracture of the myth that educa- tion can cure all the ills of society and lead America to Utopia has been accomp- lished. But an equally dangerous myth is currently emerging: that schools make no difference in helping students achieve quality education. Despite refinements and denials that such a conclusion was ever intended, let alone explicitly stated by Jencks, Moynihan, and others in their highly technical and complicated statisti- cal findings, we have found that at the popular level, parents are beginning to accept this latest stereotyping as basically true. What we as teachers have to ask our- selves is whether such long-accepted con- cepts such as "quality teaching" and "motivation of students through per- sonalized teaching" really do make a dif- ference in student attainment of skills, in-depth understanding of ideas, and en- joyment of learning. Traditional criteria for measuring teacher performance have been: continued graduate work in one's field, enthusiasm for one's subject matter, personal interest in one's students, and the day-to-day performance of the truly professional instructor, who must be part actor, psychologist, technician, task- master, and part parent. If such criteria are now invalid, then teachers, who have been ideally defined by these standards, are a dying species irrelevant to the edu- cational process. With this background in mind, we asked ourselves some interesting ques- tions. Could we design a course that would make any difference in the de- velopment of student thinking and at- titudes and could we as teachers play any valid part in the learning processes of our honors students? Somewhat egotisti- cally, we decided "yes" to both these questions. A recurring theme appeared in all our inquiries: just how hard and how effec- tively can we expect honors students to work. This question came up as we ex- pressed our intention to develop a col- lege level course to help students qualify for advanced placement in English upon entering college. We were also question- ing the elitist system which traditionally consisted of a small group of well- qualified students handpicked from the seventh grade and marched along to- gether at an "accelerated" pace ever after. Although we were campaigning for brains capable of struggling with difficult EDITOR'S NOTE The authors are teachers of English at the Parkway West Senior High School in Ballwin, Missouri, and describe an honors program which was not exclu- sively designed for the top quality stu- dent.

The course was ultimately called Challenge English and was opened to any student who had earned a B in his Junior year. If he did not qualify on that basis, we accepted him anyway if he could obtain a recom- mendation from any English teacher. The course itself and the philosophy that accompanied it have proven so suc- cessful that the challenge idea is now being applied to English courses at all levels. More than 150 students signed up for the course and were split between two teachers. We decided to set the high- est standards in the reading of literature and the writing of initial papers. We were not sure what the quality would be since a high school in a neighboring dis- trict made up of 4000 students only al- lowed 32 to enter its senior honors pro- gram, and those were the only people that the instructor taught. Happily, the student quality of writing and critical reading has been fairly high. Of the 150 students last year who took the course, 78 decided to take the Prince- ton Advanced Placement examination. Sixty-eight scored three or better-three being the equivalent of college credit. Of those 68, 14 scored 4's, and 5 reached the rarified area of the coveted 5's. What started us on the "challenge" concept was the realization that we really had no idea how highly our students could be motivated. After all, seniors in high school are adults, not children, and essentially they are moved to meet chal- lenges when they are asked to produce at the level of adults. So in planning this course for senior advanced placement, we decided not only to put the goal on a challenge basis but at the same time to open the course to any student who wanted to search for the fullest extent of his capabilities. As a result, since the stu- dent has decided how far and how fast he wanted to advance, he knew that teachers could only offer challenge, not force it. This mixture of the heretofore elite honors student with the "average" stu- dent has blended into a smooth pot- pourri. The students who have always been in honors classes have to prove themselves all over again to their peers. They are pushed by the motivation of the other seniors who have been chal- lenged to prove themselves. On the other hand, the exposure of the new group to the quality work of the student who has always written in an articulate manner serves as a revelation to the newcomers. The teacher, too, has taken the challenge to stimulate, to entertain, to push and be pushed, and to create in the class an ex- citement about the discussion of ideas and the "how" of their expression. Course Description and Methodology We decided that our reading selections would not attempt to survey either the literature of a particular nation or that of an era. Since we believed that student writers must have ideas before they can begin the process of expression, we chose thematic approach. In addition, to help present the techniques of critical writing, we ordered Writing Themes About Litera- ture by Edgar V. Roberts, one of the many fine books in this area. Neither our methods nor thematic selections were new or revolutionary. Rather, we picked ideas that excited us and which we thought would excite the students. We then selected works that we thought were of high caliber or at least of proven liter- ary merit. An obvious theme with which to open the year was the proverbial one con- cerned with the complex and enigmatic</page><page sequence="3">1974 EGALITARIAN HONORS 377 treatment of the problem of love as ex- pressed in literature. We began by lectur- ing on the ideas of C. S. Lewis's The Four Loves and Eric Fromm's The Art of Loving. Though not required reading, we strongly suggested that these books be examined during the quarter. We then gave them a copy of Shakespeare's "Son- net 116." Some interesting conclusions emerged from the class discussions. The students saw what Shakespeare said that love was not. Love does not change when it finds that the one loved is different from what he was expected to be, or that he has been made different through change and experience. We then asked how this attitude differed from lust. Lust involved desire, satisfaction, and plea- sure. Someone then offered the dictum that if such were the definition of lust, then he probably felt lust for almost every pretty girl that he saw, even some not so pretty ones. Shakespeare, how- ever, says the true love is like a permanent landmark that tempests cannot shake, that it is like a star that leads a wander- ing ship. We also noted that Shakespeare ends the poem with an emphasis on the contrast between time, the slayer of all, and love, which somehow continues its journey beyond time to the edge of doom. Everyone could see that Shake- speare thought this concept of love was mysteriously enduring, if nothing else. With this sonnet, along with the works of Lewis and Fromm as a backdrop, we then pursued the study of what serious writers have said about profane and di- vine love as in the poetry of John Donne and the Grahame Greene novel, The End of the Affair. For instance, Greene's treatment of the adultress turned saint naturally intrigued the students. Many commented that the first part of the book, ante conversion, was more fun to read than the second section. But we pointed out that sin is usually more en- joyable than attempts at virtue. The group was then able to see the point of this Augustinian tale of love and purifica- tion. For after Green depicts Sarah's con- version and spiritual development, he at- tempts to portray the positive effects that the power of divine love, as channelled through her, has on the rationalistic exis- tence of the people whose lives have been touched by her. At the conclusion of this section the students helped make up study questions and a paper was assigned on this topic from any of those questions that had been drawn up. Then we took up the problem of the necessity of suffering in order to attain true love that results from the conflicting demands of self-love versus altruistic love. We read The Assistant by Bernard Malamud for this particular section. Most of the students liked Frankie Alpine. De- spite his selfishness, he constantly exhi- bited a desire for reform manifested by his expanding realization that true love demanded that one live for the good of others. But the ending was difficult for some students to see as worthwhile; Frank was paying too dearly for the "love" of Helen Bober. Others were able to begin to understand what Shakespeare may have meant in "Sonnet 116" in the light of Frankie's endurance and stead- fastness. From the above mentioned problem, we moved to the more blunt side of love: The eternal battle between the sexes or the connection between sex and power. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (Coughill Translation) provides excellent vignettes of this proverbial struggle. The students were quick to detect the male chauvinist pigs in the "Clerk's Tale" and "The Man of Law's Tale." But they were surprised at the Wife of Bath, an extremely aggres- sive female chauvinist piglet. The stu- dents were also appalled at the vicious- ness of infidelity in marriage as seen in "The Merchant's Tale," but they were titillated, while being mildly shocked, at</page><page sequence="4">378 The CLEARING HOUSE February the light-hearted ribaldry of "The Miller's Tale" and "The Reeve's Tale." They were also shocked at the similarity between the Romantic View of love shown in "The Knight's Tale" with the way Hollywood has traditionally pre- sented love. By the time we reached "The Franklin's Tale," they were so happy to see a married couple working in harmonious self-trust that they wanted to read more tales like that. Another in- sight became apparent: love was not only complicated but also as mysterious as the star in "Sonnet 116." Finally, we ended the first quarter by reading Hamlet from the angle of familial love. The obvious questions centered around the following problems: when can the idealization of parents and their potential become idolatrous and lead to unreal expectations; when does protec- tiveness lead to suffocation and the stunt- ing of personal growth, and when can the means no longer justify the end when one desires to find out the truth about those closest to him? As always, the study of Hamlet raised more questions than answers, but from just a survey of the es- says in the Norton Critical edition, the students discovered that minds with far more subtlety and wider backgrounds than theirs were as equally divergent in their opinions of Hamlet. We ended the quarter by writing an in-class essay on the play. The teachers also wrote a paper under the same pressure. We then spent several days reading, correcting, and re- vising our papers. For the second quarter, we decided to deal with the problems of honor, integ- rity, and hypocrisy. The President's well-worn phrase, "peace with honor," made this subject most poignant in the minds of the students. We divided up the problem of honor versus compromise as viewed from the following levels: religi- ous honor and scrupulosity; personal honor in a task-oriented society; social honor and justice; and psychological in- tegrity in the search for self-knowledge. The first problem concerning religious honor and scrupulosity was dealt with by reading as a trilogy Jean Anouilh's Becket, T. S. Eliot's Murder in the Cathedral, and John Osborne's Luther. The students liked Anouilh's Becket because they could not decide whether his conversion re- sulted from a genuine desire to serve God in a distinterested manner or whether conversion represented the same old Becket doing a job well because any- thing worth doing should be performed with class, grace, and style. Eliot's Becket was seen in the more traditional light of personal temptation to obtain power, riches, and pride, which he rejected after soul-searching and insight gained through his struggle with the devil. Osborne's Luther posed the largest problem of all: how to balance Luther's sincere questions about his right to rebel against the corrupt practices of the church with his eventual rejection of the peasants in their rebellion. Had he "sold out" once he became a center of power himself? This question had to be handled delicately and researched thoroughly, be- cause prior to any intelligent probing of this issue, we had to front the problem of whether Luther was basically a medieval man or one of the first modernists in the philosophical sense of the word. How Luther viewed the structure of the uni- verse obviously colored his vision of au- thority and the limits of genuine rebel- lion. We were amazed at the interest shown by the students towards this prob- lem and at the sophisticated approach they took before they made any value judgments within the context of the play. Perhaps the book most enjoyed by the students was John Upkike's The Centaur. We discussed it from the viewpoint of a seemingly incompetent person trying to find personal honor and worth in a bureaucracy that recognized achievement</page><page sequence="5">1974 EGALITARIAN HONORS 379 and measurable results rather than per- sonal warmth and understanding. The students were also becoming intrigued with man's need for a superstructure against which he can measure his values and sacrifices, whether it be the Greek Universe of the anthropomorphic ca- pricious gods or the more familiar and benevolent Judeo-Christian Universe. We then had great fun with the ques- tion of social honor and justice by read- ing Dickens's Hard Times. Josiah Bound- erby of Coketown is such a blatant hypocrite; Thomas Gradgrind is like so many utilitarian Junior High school prin- cipals; and Sissy Jupe and the circus people are so simply warm and emo- tional, that the students could rather eas- ily see the social satire and the prophetic power of a writer who foresaw the now almost cliched problems of ecology, in- dustrialism, individuality, and emotional stability that are so popularly discussed in intellectual circles. Our next foray was in the field of psychological integrity. For that task, we read Hesse's Steppenwolf Although the students found the book filled with bril- liant individual passages of a confused mind seeking form in a society deadened by excessive bureaucracy, technology, and nationalism, they thought it an over- rated novel. If one wanted Freud, Jung, and Buddha warmed over, Erich Fromm had attempted such a synthesis in a far more organized manner. Finally, we ended the semester by read- ing perhaps the greatest dramatic treat- ment of the problem of honor, Henry IV, I. The two teachers acted out the play, complete with ribald interpretation of the myriad puns, hyperboles, understate- ments, and standard vaudeville gag lines that are an integral part of the work. From Hotspur's idealized adoration of Dame Honor to Hal's frivolous low life in the bars of Eastcheap to Falstaffs cynical but insightful treatment of the topic, "Can honor set to a leg?" No. or an arm? No. or take away the grief of a wound? No,...." the students found the treat- ment of this topic serious, funny, and masterful. They were especially interested in Hotspur's idealized view of honor. He defined it in terms of militaristic courage, upholding family name, and asserting Hemingway masculinity. The students were able to see that although there is validity to such a militaristic view of honor, such was not the case here. For most agreed that Hotspur was not capa- ble of reaching beyond a level of boyish adventure. This attitude was aptly pointed out by a student's discussion of Hotspur's attitude before going into bat- tle, "Doomsday is here, die all, die mer- rily." But neither were the students pleased with Falstaff's honorless posture. In the name of profit and pleasure, he sold the commissions of those who were to serve under him. And at great personal profit, he induced the lame and aged to fill the vacated ranks. We then concluded that both Hotspur and Falstaff, although to- tally different in methodology and be- liefs, were fundamentally the same psychologically: they were both motivated by selfishness-one for personal glory and honor, the other for hedonistic pleasure. All agreed that the play was most difficult to read because of the puns, the careful setting up of a scene for an effective one line laugh, the com- pactness of action and time, and the local dialect which required careful inquiry into the footnotes. But most decided that the effort was worthwhile because of the powerful use of language, characteriza- tion, and plot. The standards that we established for the writing of papers were the same that every teacher of writing and rhetoric de- sires. We demanded purpose, careful ex- pression of thesis, and the concrete work-</page><page sequence="6">380 The CLEARING HOUSE February ing out of the topic. We worked on the use of smooth transitions, balanced sen- tences, clear pronoun reference, the elimination of dangling and ambiguous modifiers, and so on. Perhaps the most important result achieved in the course was the realization that the reading of great authors requires work and that the critical written expres- sion of their ideas and conflicts requires even more labor. From our own view- point, another fact became evident: that the teacher-as-learner is an effective force in helping students to grow and to think. We all concluded that such an ef- fort, while challenging, is most worth- while; for as Shakespeare has noted about love or any worthwhile attempt at growth, "it is an ever'fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken."
