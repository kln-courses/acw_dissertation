<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Part I Fields and Interfaces of Musical Play How oft, when thou, my music, music play’st  Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds  With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway’st  The wiry concord that mine ear confounds. . . —Shakespeare, Sonnet no. 128, lines 1–4 </page> <page sequence="2">  </page> <page sequence="3"> Key 1 Ludomusicality How is music played? Responses will vary depending on where the stress falls in  the question. “How is music played?” interrogates the agencies and mechanisms  responsible for music’s coming into audible being. It asks how “play” can oper- ate as a verb flexible yet precise enough to describe the striking of a drum, the  agitation of a string, the vibration of a column of air, the depression of a key, and  the tapping of an onscreen triangle: in other words, it inquires into the means of  music’s embodied and instrumental mediation. Asking “How is music played?”  shifts the emphasis to the ludic dynamics that can motivate the bringing forth of  music and the senses in which the processes of improvisation, performance, and  recreation are comprehensible as ludic modes of behavior.1 Finally, “How is music  played?” asks how music might be akin to other things one plays, such as solitaire,  chess, rugby, roulette, Tetris, the fool, footsie, or truant.2 In these senses, the play- ing of music can be related to the playing of games, to role-play, simulation, and  deception, to calculation and strategy, to risk and uncertainty, to sociality and  flirtation, even to the wanton—sometimes violent—pursuit of euphoria and self- abandonment. The elucidation of these relations is this book’s raison d’être. Prompted by the sound and sight of the mysterious Dark Lady at the keyboard,  the Shakespeare sonnet from which the epigraph for Part I is drawn revolves  around the axis of play as topic and mode. Music issues from the motion of the  Dark Lady’s “sweet fingers” while standing as a metaphor for the beloved herself:  music at once plays and is played by music. At the material interface of the virgin- als (“that blessed wood”), her digital maneuvers are transduced into vibrations  that delight the poet’s ear, leaving him tantalized and disoriented. The whimsy of  Shakespeare’s textual play derives from the play of fingers and keys, the oscillation  15 </page> <page sequence="4"> 16    key 1 of strings and sonic waves; the to-and-fro of repetitive motion carries an erotic  charge that throws distinctions between subject and object, cause and effect, into  pleasurable disarray. Framing music and play together in this way suggests that  musical activities can realize playful concepts and, conversely, that play can be  conceived in terms of musical engagement. Musical play and playful music take  shape in the spaces that open up between sign and sound, instruction and execu- tion, the probable and the implausible, the permissible and the imaginable. Play’s resistance to definition is one of its defining qualities. Typically negoti- ating between subject and object, the verb “to play” connotes a relational mode  at the same time as denoting a particular type of ludic action. Even when “the  play’s the thing,” which is to say masquerading as a noun, play never stops play- ing. Correspondingly, music is not merely the outcome of a certain type of play,  but constitutes a set of cognitive, technological, and social resources for playing in  and with the world through the medium of sound, its mechanisms, and its repre- sentations.3 Play, in turn, becomes the means by which such musical behavior is  made audible. In these multiple senses, play activates music via patterns of actions  that can be identified as ludomusical. Within (and against) the constraints that  regulate it, ludomusical play fluctuates between the preordained and the unfore- seeable, emerging in relation both to the performance of familiar cultural scripts  and to the imperative to improvise. Although play is often cited as an intrinsic attribute of humankind, it has long  been observed that play is not exclusive to people, or even to gamboling animals.4  Play can also describe mechanical processes that animate inorganic matter by  accident or design: we speak of the play of light, the play of a loosely fitting drawer,  and the playing of chess by machines such as IBM’s Deep Blue. Navigating the  shifting material and cultural formations that regulate any given mode of musi- cal play thus involves the traversal of both human and nonhuman realms. In  Shakespeare’s sonnet, the reciprocal relations of musical subjects and objects pivot  around play, bearing out Gadamer’s claim that “all playing is a being-played.”5  Cornelia Vismann reframed this chiasmus in the discursive terms of media theory: If media theory were, or had, a grammar, [the] agency [of media and things] would  find its expression in objects claiming the grammatical subject position and cultural  techniques standing in for verbs. Grammatical persons (and human beings alike)  would then assume the place assigned for objects in a given sentence.6 As the Dark Lady and her virginals bear witness, such chiastic encounters have  often played out at the interface of the keyboard, where human meets mechanism  and operation becomes technique. From the fourteenth-century chekker to con- temporary digital games, the keyboard has formed a field of play on which musi- cal epistemologies have been allegorized, tested, and challenged via the cybernetic  configuration of input and output.7 While keyboards invite us to play music, the  </page> <page sequence="5"> Ludomusicality    17 automatism with which well-drilled fingers navigate them has been repeatedly  invoked to illustrate how music can “play” us.8 Keyboards even help account for  how music can play on its own: the player piano testifies to the possibility of musi- cal recreation without anthropic contact. When activated by human digits, however, the keyboard’s mechanisms become  entangled in play as embodied and social experience. As Huizinga pointed out in  his classic book Homo Ludens, the association between play and instrumental skill  is most directly embodied by “the nimble and orderly movement of the fingers.”9  While such motion requires effort, it need not involve toil or strain: Sigmund  Freud famously conjectured that the infantile origins of the delight taken in play’s  to-and-fro oscillations have less to do with the arduous accomplishment of a par- ticular task than with the pleasure taken in shaping, ordering, and repeating bodily  movements that convert anxiety into security.10 Across many Indo-European lan- guages, moreover, the roots of “game” and “play” are etymologically associated  with movements that give rise to communal joy as well as personal pleasure.11 The  gestural qualities of such motions also reflect the social connections between play- ing, dancing, and miming observed by both Theodor W. Adorno and Gadamer in  the context of the word Spiel.12 Insofar as it reiterates such motions, even solo play  responds to the play of other bodies. As is most evident in its theatrical sense, play is also bound up with make- believe, the exercising of the imagination, and the fantastical possibilities afforded  by the subjunctive mood. The phenomenological characteristics of play have less  to do with intention and emotion than with entrainment and affect.13 Even with- out consciously simulating or dissimulating, one plays “as if,” thereby forging  the connections between musical performance and role-play noted by Nicholas  Cook.14 As a performative mode, play preempts and subverts questions predicated  on linguistic concerns with communication, meaning, truth, and sincerity.15 More  enactive than representational, play insists on the reality of pretense, allows for  the simultaneous acceptance and circumvention of constraints, and thrives on the  inevitability of uncertainty. Since musical play often involves the abandonment of the self, or at least the  temporary occlusion of its ulterior motives, it maintains a close relationship with  ritual.16 As objects of play, both music and games are part of quotidian life, and  yet they tend to take place in realms where everyday protocols are suspended.  Whereas Huizinga went so far as to claim there to be “no formal difference  between play and ritual,” however, Claude Lévi-Strauss placed the two in recipro- cal relation: while rites transform events into structures, play transforms struc- tures into events.17 This function of play is most apparent in ludomusical practices  that, like sporting occasions, shift focus from the prevailing rules (often articu- lated and enforced by social conventions and incarnated by a particular body of  repertoire) to the playing out of singular, unrepeatable events that emerge from  </page> <page sequence="6"> 18    key 1 a particular ludic environment and its affordances. In the performance of much  folk music, for instance, sonic and affective experiences are informed not only by  the selection and transmission of musical materials, but also by factors such as  the moods of musicians and audience, the tuning of instruments, and even the  weather. Conversely, the traditional circumstances of Western art music in per- formance are closer to ritual insofar as the contingency of the individual event is  typically downplayed in favor of a quasi-atemporal presentation of (more or less)  fixed musical material. The ritualistic qualities of such performances are intensi- fied by their circumstances: the hushed, darkened hall and the spatial separation  of performers from spectators amplify the tacit signals governing the voluntary  yet constrained actions taken by participants. Under these conditions, play is  regulated by one of its antipodes, the musical work; as a result, particular con- cordances with and departures from the “rules” of the score are magnified and  invested with interpretive significance.18 To a greater or lesser extent, however, regulatory functions are to be found in  all forms of presentational and participatory musical praxis, no matter how differ- ently their parameters might be defined.19 In the jazz club as in the opera house, the  fascination of ludomusical play lies in its shuttling between structure and event,  the criteria established by formal and social models on the one hand and the qua- lia of an individual experience on the other. Accordingly, Huizinga noted that  certain social sites, from the tennis court to the concert hall and the sumo ring to  the court of law, are reserved for the staging of encounters and exchanges enacted  according to particular rules. Such “magic circles” form ritual frames wherein the  internal coherence of rule-bound systems is temporarily granted primacy over— or protection from—external exigencies.20 Huizinga’s concept of the magic circle has recently come under fire, particu- larly from sociological angles. Critics bent on demystification have pointed out  that all attempts to transcend the social are themselves symptomatic of social  forces at work, and have thus dismissed the magic circle as an invidious formalist  delusion.21 As Edward Castronova observes, magic circles are always materially  and historically grounded, and the political processes by which they assert ter- ritorial integrity are subject to interrogation and negotiation: their membranes  are permeable and the spells they cast can be broken.22 Even as they circumscribe  play-spaces, the boundaries of magic circles connect them to the world outside;  concomitantly, as Clifford Geertz noted, play takes place both within such circles  and through their relations to what lies beyond.23 Nonetheless, taking the illusory  aspects of magic circles seriously can help us grasp the subjunctive, metacommu- nicative, and even paradoxical logic by which systems of play can frame arbitrary  objects and contingent events as absolute and necessary. With the creation of a  magic circle, a line is drawn that simultaneously marks and makes a difference  in the world. To frame this in the recursive terms of Luhmann’s systems theory,  </page> <page sequence="7"> Ludomusicality    19 games are played in accordance with a digital logic based on epistemological  distinctions (such as inside/outside or fair/foul) that make games themselves con- ceivable in relation to all that is not a game.24 At the same time, as Jesper Juul puts  it, “a game must be integrated into a context in order to be experienced as sepa- rate from that context.”25 Oscillating between participation and observation, this  double function can help clarify the specific topology of any given magic circle,  where it is grounded, how and why it is drawn, and the genealogical shifts that  its changing forms chart over time as particular elements of play are successively  incorporated, privileged, marginalized, or excluded from social and historical  configurations. Schiller observed that play constructs relationships between material and  formal impulses so that “the operation of the one simultaneously confirms  and limits the operation of the other.”26 Negotiations between internal, quasi- autonomous rules and external forces account both for the courses taken by  play—the unforeseeable and yet strangely inevitable way that things “play out”— and for its compelling appeal as event and spectacle. Those who play (with)  music can transgress and subvert as well as obey the protocols that constitute  the unwritten rules of engagement, and such play can on occasion transform  the rules themselves.27 As exhibited within and by artistic movements such as  Fluxus, Situationist International, and OuLiPo, many of whose members were  devotees of the surrealist parlor game known as cadavre exquis, play has often  realized the tactical potential to mock, shock, and critique, whether by ignor- ing rules, observing them in the breach, or breaching them via absurdly literal  observation.28 From Dada to digital games, instances of transformative play  reveal how subversion can either be integral to gameplay dynamics or emerge  through imaginative counterplay with (and against) the rules that shape them.  In itself, neither the following nor the flouting of rules is necessarily aligned with  a particular aesthetic or political stance: the transgression of conformity often  involves conforming to transgressive norms, and the representational implica- tions of a game’s range of possible actions must be considered in relation to its  underlying formal and mechanical principles.29 In this regard, it is telling that both Schiller’s and Gadamer’s perspectives on play  were indebted to Immanuel Kant’s Critique of the Power of Judgement, in which the  free play of the imagination is identified as the animating principle behind intel- lectual pleasure.30 For Kant, such pleasure derived from the law-bound exercising  of freedom. Crucially, however, these laws are not necessarily either specific or  universal, but rather issue from a sense of lawfulness that can itself be created by  the imagination.31 This aligns with Kant’s distinction between the purposeful and  the purposive: to the extent that they are legislated in the name of pleasure, the  laws of play are arbitrary and lack moral purpose, rendering any beauty that results  ultimately inconsequential, no matter how delightful it might be.32 </page> <page sequence="8"> 20    key 1 Herder condemned what he saw as the meaningless frivolity of Kant’s formu- lation and drew on musical analogies in the course of rebutting it. For Herder,  art had to do not with the playing of “amusing or tedious ape-like games,” but  rather with the perception of “good order and good form” via resonances between  mind and world in accordance with the principles of natural law that regulate the  harmonious relations of bodies and sensations.33 Herder’s claims were echoed by  Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, for whom art was concerned not with “child’s  play, but .  .  . with an unfolding of the truth.”34 Combining Kant’s receptivity to  the aesthetic qualities of play with a Herderian concern for ontology and ethics,  however, Schiller argued in his Letters on the Aesthetic Education of Man that the  Spieltrieb (“play drive”) had to do with far more than the childish pursuit of diver- sionary pleasure. Through interplay between life and form, power and law, nature  and reason, “the freest and most sublime state of being” could be attained: “Man  plays only when he is in the full sense of the word a man, and he is only wholly  Man when he is playing.”35 In his “Conversation on Poetry,” Friedrich Schlegel  went even further, holding the play principle to account not merely for aesthetic  beauty, but for the very formations of the universe, at once autopoietic and auto- telic: “All the sacred games of art are merely distant imitations of the endless play  of the world, the eternally self-creating work of art.”36 Although the immediate occasion of Schiller’s Letters was his disillusion- ment with the French Revolution, his own faith in the profound power of play  was drawn from Plato’s Laws, in which the Athenian stranger decrees that men  and women “should live out [their] lives playing at certain pastimes—sacrific- ing, singing, dancing—so as to be able to win [the gods’] favor.”37 In this sense,  Schiller echoed Marsilio Ficino’s praise of the oxymoronic capacity, shared by  Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras, for “joking seriously and playing assiduously  [iocari serio et studiosissime ludere].”38 As well as projecting his vision of a  neo-Hellenic play-space to be realized via the cultivation of Bildung, Schiller’s  formulation of the Spieltrieb reflects the close relationship between the Greek  terms for play (παιδιά, paidia) and pedagogy (παιδεία, paideia) as well as their  common root in παῖς (pais, “child”). As educational method and outcome, play  can afford a childlike clarity of vision into the workings of the world as well as  childish diversions from serious matters, a paradox encapsulated by Heraclitus’s  gnomic dictum: “Lifetime is a child at play, moving pieces in a game. Kingship  belongs to the child.”39 Yet Schiller’s invocation of what he imagined to be the ancient Greeks’ pure  delight in the edifying beauty of physical contests and intellectual rivalry reveals  how tightly the phylogeny and ontogeny of play are bound together.40 As memo- ries of childhood attest, play was purer in the past, while its concrete manifes- tations in the present are always less than ideal. For Sven Lütticken,  Schiller’s  paean to Greek play “introduced the topos of the fundamental  inadequacy of  </page> <page sequence="9"> Ludomusicality    21 actual games, of their betrayal of the idea of play.”41 Schiller’s nostalgia for ancient  Greece, his dissatisfaction with the present, and his vision of a better world to  come were both inspired and tempered by his horror at the gulf that separated  revolutionary ideals from the violent acts that made them matter. His ostensible  rejection of Kantian dualism notwithstanding, Schiller maintained a crucial dis- tinction between physical, animalistic play and the type of high-minded aesthetic  play that formed both the apogee and the repudiation of human striving, for the  former was too readily associated with the bloodlust of the Roman ludi or the  Jacobin mob. As Mechthild Nagel observes, the material was synonymous with  the abject for Schiller, who railed against the “mechanical artists” of the French  Revolution in terms redolent of Herder.42 Despite Schiller’s idealizing desire for play to transcend its mechanical basis,  however, his acknowledgment of the relations between its material and its formal  aspects echoed Kant’s claim that “in all liberal arts there is nevertheless required  something compulsory, or, as it is called, a mechanism, without which the spirit,  which must be free in the art and which alone animates the work, would have no  body at all and would entirely evaporate.”43 In this light, the changing relation  between the shifting valorization of play and instrumental music in eighteenth- century German thought is revealing, as Peter Pesic and Felix F. Diergarten have  noted.44 The mechanical constraints of musical instruments enabled free play  that was not subject to rational, emotive, or mimetic decoding (as was held to  be the case for the sense and sound of vocal music). After being roundly dispar- aged by Johann Georg Sulzer, instrumental music’s semantic coyness was deemed  praiseworthy by Christian Gottfried Körner and Christian Friedrich Michaelis,  for whom instrumental music granted “the imagination [der Fantasie] lighter and  freer playfulness . . . than when it is fixated on definite thoughts.”45 In a similar vein,  Ludwig Tieck remarked that instrumental music “fantasizes playfully.”46 Read in  the contexts of contemporaneous musical genres and their associated behavioral  codes, these comments invoke the tendency of the late-eighteenth-century fanta- sia and capriccio to call upon—yet ultimately to elude—a sense of quasi-semantic  logic by way of rapid affective feints and textural oscillations.47 Such “free play”  enabled hand and mind to join forces in enacting an organic process of discovery  and creation. By 1826, Hans Georg Nägeli could confidently assert that music’s  very “essence is play, through and through,” and that “the more . . . playful a musi- cal composition is . . . , the more successful it is.”48 While musical freedom from semantic strictures took the form of imaginative  invention, such lofty play was typically articulated and materialized at the digi- tal interface of the keyboard. Analogously, the free motion by which sound itself  became audible was mechanically limited in order for it to be parsed as distinct  pitches and rhythms, whether produced by the vibration of a string, the excitation  of a column of air, or the play of the keys that could initiate either. Instruments and  </page> <page sequence="10"> 22    key 1 the conceptual possibilities afforded and foreclosed by tonal systems combined  to form epistemological structures that also outlined ludomusical fields of play.  Such play takes shape as a realization of the potential for unpredictable interac- tion between players and objects and the constraints that regulate their motion:  freedom on the one hand, limits on the other. From this perspective, the keyboard  emerges as a digital means of articulating the distinctions by which play is defined  and between which it oscillates. How might we begin to identify the laws—explicit and tacit, material and  conceptual—observed and breached in the course of ludomusical play? According  to the principles of cultural techniques, a philosophical and anthropological  assemblage of concepts and critical tools with which Vismann was associated, the  answers should precede rather than follow linguistic models.49 In other words— or perhaps with no words at all—we should take seriously Huizinga’s conten- tion that play is constitutive rather than illustrative of knowledge, and that this  knowledge is typically produced at interfaces between limbs and objects.50 If, as  Thomas Macho supposes, humans counted before the invention of numbers and  singing came before the scale, then musical play surely preceded the devising of  instruments and the tallying of scores.51 Once those technologies had been devel- oped, however, ontological formations and ontographic operations combined to  enable music and games to be played in accordance with rules—understood here  as arbitrarily binding directives that both prescribe and proscribe—for entering  into material and imaginary relationships with the world. Before analyzing musical play and the ends to which it has been put, then, we  should acknowledge the ways in which its chiastic configurations supplement the  oral, literary, and numerical methods by which subjects have been formed and  cultivated. Music and the techniques that shape it simultaneously trace and are  traced by the materials, technologies, and metaphors of play.52 It is in this sense that  play does not represent so much as it simulates: rather than enacting “a passive,  interior mimesis” of other phenomena, as Roland Barthes put it, the play of musi- cal bodies and objects is emergent, procedural, generative, and recursive.53 It has  to do not with the production of meaning, but with the distinctions and oscilla- tions on which meaning is predicated and by which it is processed. This helps account for the cognitive and linguistic dissonance between the  registers of musical discourse most explicitly associated with theory, praxis, and  history. In their own ways, all three idioms are as remote from play as it unfolds in  the here and now as they are from those who bore witness to the play of the past.  How, then, might we speak of ludomusicality in a way that reflects both its cur- rency and its historicity, its immediacy and its mediation? This Key attempts to  unlock answers from five perspectives. By way of musical examples both mythi- cal and historical, the first presents Caillois’s taxonomy of play as a means of  recognizing its various forms and their associated characteristics. The second  </page> <page sequence="11"> Ludomusicality    23 considers play’s antonymic relationship with work in the context of a nineteenth- century ontological and aesthetic agenda that continues to exert a strong influ- ence over today’s musical cultures. Since the proceedings of play have so often  gone unratified by the archival record, it has largely eluded the discursive grasp of  historiography. The Foucauldian concepts of archaeology and genealogy suggest  alternative ways in which play itself might constitute an epistemological mode  capable of registering the spatial and temporal dimensions of musical phenom- ena. Accordingly, this Key’s third component introduces the digital game as a  contemporary manifestation of play that is historically and technologically impli- cated in audiovisual representations of conflict, while the fourth traces a media- genealogical lineage connecting seventeenth-century hydromechanical organs,  eighteenth-century musical automata, nineteenth-century telegraphic interfaces,  and late twentieth-century “rhythm-action” games. Finally, the fifth focuses on  the haunting figure of Frédéric Chopin in order to tease out ways in which digital  gameplay at the keyboard can obtrude from the passage of historical time, invok- ing and betraying the past in order to offer visions, at once utopian and dystopian,  of how the future might play out. 1–1 ORDERS OF PLAY Let us begin where Schlegel’s “Conversation on Poetry” ends, accepting its  invitation to loop back to what might be deemed a ludomusical origin myth: the  fateful contest between the Greek god Apollo and the satyr Marsyas.54 The myth’s  ludic drama and lurid violence have long fascinated artists and scholars, particu- larly those concerned with the establishment of hierarchical relations within and  between artistic realms. In recent years, it has attracted the attention of Daniel  Albright, John T. Hamilton, Lydia Goehr, Richard Leppert, Andreas Dorschel,  and James R. Currie.55 As is made evident in Key 2–1, the reading of the myth pre- sented here is willfully anachronistic insofar as it brings out themes that resurface  at unexpected historical junctures, foreshadowing or echoing techno-epistemo- logical shifts that reach far beyond the ancient world.56 The basic outline of the myth is well established, although significant details  vary among its sources.57 Marsyas, a satyr from Phrygia, picked up an aulos dis- carded by Athena, who had been disgusted by its distortion of her facial features  when she played it. Having been inspired by the breath of a goddess, the instru- ment produced beautiful music as soon as Marsyas blew into it, which delighted  and emboldened him. The satyr rashly challenged Apollo to a musical contest to  be judged by the Muses: the winner, it was agreed, could do whatever he pleased  with the loser. Apollo played the kithara while Marsyas played the aulos (or per- haps two auloi at once).58 After the first round, Marsyas seems to have held the  advantage, forcing Apollo to resort to dubious tactics.59 In one version of the myth  </page> <page sequence="12"> 24    key 1 he added his voice to his kithara, while in another he played his kithara upside  down, feats he knew Marsyas would be unable to match.60 The Muses thus ruled  in Apollo’s favor; as punishment, Apollo had Marsyas bound to a tree and flayed  alive. According to Ovid, his blood mixed with the tears of the satyrs and nymphs  who mourned him to form a river that took his name, while others reported that  Apollo repurposed the satyr’s hide as an askos, a flask or pouch that could serve as  wineskin, windbag, or drum.61 At first sight, this myth is hardly playful; on the contrary, it teaches a stern  object lesson on the dangers of hubris and the provocation of divine wrath. The  neo-Pythagorean music theorist Aristides Quintilianus was among many who  rebuked Marsyas for “dignif[ying] his music beyond its worth.”62 Contemporary  readings of the myth thus have no trouble in identifying or extrapolating the illib- eral forces that predetermined the contest’s outcome.63 The field of play was cer- tainly tilted heavily in Apollo’s favor: exoticized, feminized, and stigmatized by his  choice of instrument even before he dared challenge a god, Marsyas was a marked  satyr.64 Just as the aulos had deformed Athena’s features, so Apollo ensured that it  led to Marsyas’s excoriation.65 The officious savagery of the punishment continues  to elicit horror and sympathy, as it presumably did from the Roman courtesans  who adorned the statue of Marsyas in the forum with flowers.66 It is nonetheless important to acknowledge that Apollo and Marsyas engaged  each other in a form of play. Throughout the ancient world, play was often as  brutal as it was divine: from the παγκράτιον (pankration, a mixed-martial-arts  staple of the Olympic Games that could bring death as well as glory) to the  Roman ludi (which incorporated athletic events, chariot racing, and gladiato- rial combat into votive offerings and funerary rituals), games could have conse- quences wholly disproportionate to their nominal stakes, especially when staged  as public spectacles.67 In this light, it is telling that the Pythian and Isthmian  Games featured kithara and aulos competitions alongside displays of athletic and  martial prowess.68 The Greek term ἀγών (agōn) captures the notion of competitive struggle in  terms of both its ludic structure and the physical toll it can exact.69 Although agōn  was initially used simply to denote public ludic events from races to musical con- tests, the word “agony” became synonymous with the writhing contortions of  bodies—like Marsyas’s—that suffered the harrowing effects of play.70 Huizinga  perceived the principle of agōn, which he construed as the exhibition of prowess  in specially demarcated locations under rule-based competitive conditions, to lie  at the heart of culture sub specie ludis: “play is battle and battle is play.”71 Huizinga  also remarked on how the display of skill, the testing of one’s own and others’ lim- its while vying for victory, and sometimes even the endangerment of safety and  well-being for no rational reason pervade many societies, often to an extent that  defies all attempts at utilitarian explanation. The central thesis of Homo Ludens  </page> <page sequence="13"> Ludomusicality    25 holds that a culture’s most vital elements should be understood as fundamen- tally  playful to the extent that they involve challenge, competition, theatricality,  virtuosity, and improvisation. For Huizinga, play in the simultaneously primal  and rarefied form of agōn was responsible for the flourishing of cultural practices,  networks, and institutions from dialogical philosophizing to the adversarial legal  system, professional sports to the theater, and love-making to music-making.  (This ludic perspective on the theatrum mundi was shared by Johann Mattheson,  Handel’s friend and dueling partner, for whom life’s most intense and meaningful  experiences “always had something playful” about them.)72 The enduring importance of agōn to the staging of musical drama can be  tracked across musical history. Goehr links the mythical clash of Apollo and  Marsyas not merely to the god’s analogous contest with his satyr-like counterpart  Pan, illustrated in Figure 12 and recreated in J. S. Bach’s cantata Der Streit zwischen  Phoebus und Pan, BWV 201, but also to the bitter contest at the heart of Wagner’s  Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg.73 Heinrich W. Schwab suggests that this lineage  might be traced back to Robin et Marion, a thirteenth- century pastoral attributed  to Adam de la Halle in which a shepherd and a knight vie for Marion’s affec- tions via reports of sporting activities—a game of football and a tournament—that  map onto their disparate social ranks.74 Gioachino Rossini’s La regata veneziana,  a set of three whimsical canzonettas in Venetian dialect, also entwines agōn and  eros: over the piano’s figuration, alternately lilting and intensely kinetic, the feisty  Anzoleta coquettishly spells out the stakes of a gondola race to her would-be beau  Momolo, offers breathless commentary on the event itself, and subsequently  rejoices in Momolo’s victory.75 Numerous other musical productions have taken competitive activities as their  subject matter: Pietro Metastasio’s libretto L’Olimpiade was set more than fifty  times in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.76 Only in the twentieth century  did ludomusical events emulate the format as well as the theme of ancient com- petition, however. Pierre de Coubertin’s revival of the Olympic Games featured  composition among a lineup of artistic contests staged from 1912 until 1948. (With  the notable exception of the silver medalist Josef Suk [1932], the entrants have  generally failed to trouble the scorekeepers of music history.)77 Drawing on explic- itly ludomusical works by composers such as Charles Ives, Erik Satie, Arthur  Honegger, Bohuslav Martinů, and Constant Lambert, Anthony Bateman argues  that the codification and international dissemination of sporting protocols were  coeval—if sometimes at odds—with particular brands of musical modernism, the  testing of aesthetic and political limits, and the quasi-veristic imperative to reflect  and incorporate the clamorous registers of early-twentieth-century urban life.78 In the orchestral arena, Honegger sought musical analogs for the “savage,  brusque, untidy, and desperate rhythm” that marked the “attacks and ripostes” of  rugby; his eponymous symphonic movement (1928) followed in the  programmatic  </page> <page sequence="14"> 26    key 1 footsteps of Franz Berwald’s sprightly depiction of a race (Wettlauf, 1842).79  Meanwhile, the avid soccer fan Dmitri Shostakovich made good on his apocry- phal description of the sport as “the ballet of the masses.”80 The Golden Age (1930),  a satirical ballet set to a libretto by Alexander Ivanovsky, treats sport as a meta- phor for class warfare and the international agōn of communism and capitalism,  conducted via fair socialist means amid foul bourgeois chicanery.81 In the wake of Battez Philidor! (1882), an opéra-comique by Amédé-Jean Dutacq  and Abraham Dreyfus featuring eighteenth-century composer and master player  François-André Danican Philidor as the principal antagonist, the cerebral con- flict of chess was subjected to numerous twentieth-century musical representa- tions, most notably in ballets featuring anthropomorphized chessmen composed  by Martinů (Échec au roi, 1930) and Arthur Bliss (Checkmate, 1937).82 The serial  maneuvers of Stravinsky’s Agon (1957) enacted both an abstraction and a politi- cization of agonistic dynamics: George Balanchine’s choreography mapped the  black and white of chessboard and keyboard onto the costumes, and even the  racial identities, of its twelve dancers.83 Beyond the aesthetic and historical ambit of modernism, and in their way more  telling than the overt representations of ludomusical activity on which Schwab  and Bateman focus, are instances in which music is associated with the perfor- mance as well as the scripting and staging of agonistic action. From Handel vs.  Domenico Scarlatti to the two-player battle mode of Konami’s beatmania digital  games, the trope of the musical duel resonates by way of legendary contests based  on the evaluation of technē at the keyboard.84 Such contests tend to place a high  value on improvisation as a measure of wit, ingenuity, and flexibility as well as  skill: in competition, successful players read and respond to the game’s shifting  state and the actions of their opponents in real time rather than according to a  script.85 But conventional musical scores are also capable of prompting agonistic  play, as is illustrated by Mozart’s Sonata for Two Keyboards, discussed in Key  4–2. Rather than a “work,” the score constitutes the written-out rules for a light- hearted two-player game that is at once collaborative and competitive. On paper,  Mozart’s meticulous rotation of thematic material between the two instruments  might be seen to typify the “classical” virtues of balance and symmetry. In per- formance, however, it can give rise to feuding and jesting in equal measure: the  evenhanded alternation of roles compels each keyboardist to play each phrase  more beautifully, virtuosically, or wryly than the other. Since this type of good-natured agonistic play is predicated on the mutual plea- sure that arises through the sharing of ludic endeavor, it exposes certain limi- tations of Huizinga’s approach.86 In his book Les jeux et les hommes (translated  as Man, Play and Games), Caillois applauded Huizinga’s fundamental insight  into the significance of play, but complained that Huizinga’s privileging of agōn  failed to do justice to the diversity of play’s forms and functions. Via a search- ing  critique of Homo Ludens, Caillois sought to arrive at a structural taxonomy  </page> <page sequence="15"> Ludomusicality    27 table 1 Roger Caillois’s taxonomy of play. Adapted from Les jeux et les hommes, 91   (Man, Play and Games, 36). agōn  alea  mimicry  ilinx   (competition) (chance) (simulation) (vertigo) paidia races children’s games of make-believe whirling fights rhymes and illusion swinging athletics coin-tossing dolls riding boxing betting masks waltzing fencing roulette disguises carnivals football lotteries theater skiing billiards spectacle mountain-climbing checkers ludus chess tightrope-walking of play.87 He affirmed Huizinga’s view that play must be voluntary (one must  choose to play, free from coercion, which disqualifies gladiatorial combat) and  separate (insofar as play unfolds in spaces akin to Huizinga’s magic circles, areas  physically and epistemologically delimited from everyday life even though they   constitute—and are constituted by—its material and social fabric). By insisting on  the multifariousness of play, however, Caillois diverged from Huizinga’s almost  exclusive focus on agōn. Acknowledging the ludic history of probability (the cal- culation of which often involved the rolling of dice), Caillois stressed the uncer- tainty of play and the principle that its outcome not be knowable in advance.88  (The stigma attached to those discovered to have breached this principle by cheat- ing indicates the importance of regulation to all forms of play, whether imposed  by explicit rules, customs, or taboos.) Caillois also drew attention to play’s fictive- ness, its disruptive and disorienting powers, and its disregard for productivity:  the objective of a game is not to generate goods or capital, although they may be  acquired or redistributed as a condition or consequence (as occurs in professional  play and gambling, respectively).89 Having established these defining qualities, Caillois presented a taxonomy of  games and playful activities (recreated in Table 1) that classifies them according  to their blend of formal attributes as well as the physiological and psychological  states they engender. After addressing agonistic competition, Caillois accounted  for games of chance and fortune (alea), the play of make-believe, simulation, and  deception (mimicry), and the dizzying, unruly play of motion (ilinx). While agonistic play has to do with the assertion of self, the exertion of power,  and the dividing of participants into winners and losers, alea involves the abdica- tion of the self to the arbitrariness of external events. Marsyas’s reckless challenge  to Apollo involved an element of alea in that the satyr could not have foreseen its  outcome, despite his confidence in his own musical skills. Unfortunately for him,  he was competing with Apollo, to whom belonged “the lots of the diviner and  </page> <page sequence="16"> 28    key 1 . . . the seers,” as Callimachus observed.90 Whether figured as the result of divine  (im)providence in the name of necessity (the primeval goddess Ananke) or blind   contingency (the tutelary deity Tyche), Marsyas’s fate was thus always already  sealed: as Nietzsche put it, “we shake the dice box with iron hands; even in our  most intentional actions, we do no more than play the game of necessity.”91 As Nietzsche implied, and as Rüdiger Campe has scrupulously documented, the  ludic form of alea traces historical tensions between theological concepts of fate  and mathematical calculations of probability. In Jacques Derrida’s formulation, the  concept of play brings together chance and necessity “in an endless calculus,” com- bining the unknowability of fate with the quantification of likelihood: in refusing to  submit one to the other, play challenges the notion of a divinely ordered universe.92  Much of the stigma attached to gambling issued from religious broadsides against  games of chance such as the third-century Liber de aleatoribus, which warned that  “the devil is always present at the dice table,” and Gerolamo Cardano’s Liber de  ludo alae (ca. 1526).93 For Paul Schleuse, Alessandro Striggio’s “madrigal comedy”  Il gioco di primiera (1569) illustrates “both the pleasure and danger of gambling”  by dramatizing the threat it poses to self-control and social decorum alongside the  cunning ruses by which players attempt to control their destinies amid the thrill of  uncertainty and risk: ultimately, communal harmony must be restored by way of  a dance in which winners and losers all participate.94 But while Striggio depicted  card-playing as a form of social allegory, life itself could also be construed in terms  of the arbitrariness and amorality ascribed to play: Chaikovsky’s operatic adapta- tion of Pushkin’s The Queen of Spades (1887) imbricates fortune, destiny, and the  supernatural to underline the nihilistic credo that “life is but a game.”95 Beyond depictions of card and dice games, aleatoric procedures have infiltrated  the generation and realization of musical texts. As both compositional method and  performative mode, the play of alea helps account for such music as John Cage’s  Music of Changes (1951) and Fontana Mix (1958), the choose-your-own-adventure  of Pierre Boulez’s Third Piano Sonata (ca. 1955–63), Witold Lutosławski’s Jeux  vénitiens (1961), and the triple-LP box set of Henri Pousseur and Michel Butor’s  opera Votre Faust (1973), which included game boards, playing cards, and a spin- ner that enabled listeners/players to determine the course of musical events.96  Despite the vast differences in their ideological and aesthetic underpinnings as  well as their means of prompting and determining sonic consequences, the epis- temological principles of all such texts can be traced back via the paper machinery  of eighteenth-century musical dice games (Würfelspiele), technological forebears  and descendants of which are examined in Key 3. Caillois’s adoption of the English term mimicry emphasizes the playful, teasing  aspects of mimesis, the etymological roots of which lie in μῖμος (mīmos), mean- ing “mime,” “imitator,” or “actor.”97 From Plato to Alan Turing by way of the  sixteenth-century poet and historian Gregorio Comanini, the imitation games  </page> <page sequence="17"> Ludomusicality    29 of mimicry have tested the limits of resemblance and its intelligibility by way of   pretense, illusion, and outright deception.98 Mimicry suggests ways of theorizing  the performance of identity via forms of imaginative role-play while calling atten- tion to the representational strategies of media themselves. The late antique poet  Nonnus reported that when Marsyas’s hanging hide was transformed into a wind- bag, “the breeze often entered, swelling it out into a shape like his, as if the shep- herd could not keep silence but made his tune again.”99 The “as if” of Nonnus’s  poem brings out the subjunctive mood of myth and its generativity as a playful  simulacrum, at once real and imaginary.100  Even as we lament Marsyas’s violent demise we can, like Philostratus the  Younger, delight in its fictive status and the play of its many representations.  Describing a painting of the fateful instant before Marsyas’s death, Philostratus  drew the viewer’s eye to the dread of the satyr, the serene joy of Apollo in his  moment of victory, and the savagery latent in the knife-grinder about to adminis- ter punishment on the god’s behalf. Last, but not least, Philostratus bid the viewer  pay attention to Marsyas’s fellow satyrs, who, as they tearfully lament his fate,  cannot help but exhibit “their playful spirit and their disposition to leap about.”101 Through this inferred behavior, the chorus of satyrs embodied the tragicomic  register typical of the satyr play, a theatrical form often inserted within or follow- ing a sequence of tragedies that performed a comic function somewhat akin to  that of the eighteenth-century operatic intermezzo. (Needless to say, opera writ  large evinces an intense engagement with fictive play through mimicry: its masks,  costumes,  pyrotechnics, and other theatrical accoutrements shore up its demand  that the audience suspend the disbelief occasioned by its flagrant violations of  veristic behavioral norms.) The comic elements of satyr plays did not typically  reside in the action itself, which typically unfolded in line with the tragic dynamics  of mythical narrative. Instead, they emerged from the subversive relation of the  chorus of satyrs to the high drama they were witnessing, as was the case regard- ing Philostratus’s ekphrasis of the painting of Apollo vs. Marsyas. While the exu- berance of satyric drama was most obviously manifested via bawdy props and  skits, the playfulness of satyr plays also emerged from the multiple levels of their  theatricality, the back-and-forth between role and actor as well as protagonist  and chorus. For Philostratus, such metaplay was a mode of engagement derived  from—and formed by—arbitrary yet reciprocal relations between subjects and  objects often operating at cross-purposes to normative vectors of signification,  interpretation, and even morality. Just as the player is also played, the actor is also  acted upon according to the analogical dynamics of theatrical mimicry.102 As illustrated in Figure 1, the ludic category of ilinx is also satyric and subversive  insofar as it embraces behavior that is animalistic, intoxicating, and libidinous. If ago- nistic play has to do with challenging others, then ilinx tests—and often exceeds—the  limits of the self, engendering risky behavior that the  transformation of Marsyas’s  </page> <page sequence="18"> 30    key 1 Figure 1.

Caillois took its name from  ἶλιγξ, a term connoting the whirling of maelstroms that reflects both a relation to the  spinning tops associated with alea and a vortical propensity to “destroy the stability  of perception and inflict a kind of voluptuous panic upon an otherwise lucid mind.”103  The play of ilinx is frenzied and carnivalesque, like the orgiastic rites associated with  the goddess Cybele in Phrygia, whence Marsyas hailed. Its emphasis on risk-taking  and self-abandonment allies ilinx to the virtuosic display of musical kineticism, the  disorienting effects of which are readily transmissible to others (as demonstrated by  the mania induced by charismatic performers from Liszt to the Beatles and beyond).  Issuing from and yet eclipsing the body’s sense of itself, ilinx eliminates the reflec- tive distance between artistic stimulus and corporeal response, rendering aesthetics  a strictly physiological matter. It stands for a Nietzschean state of ecstasy “in which  sounds, rhythms, and dance figures . . . emerge and vanish endlessly,” short-circuiting  the representational strategies of symbolic signification.104 In terms of form as well as function, ilinx becomes musically tangible in the  whirling motion of dances (as noted by Eric McKee in the context of the late eigh- teenth century), the rough-and-tumble of spirited finales, the overtly ludic genres  of the scherzo and badinerie, and the quicksilver whimsy of the capriccio.105 Since  </page> <page sequence="19"> Ludomusicality    31 ilinx issues both from repetitive, rhythmic motion and from its unpredictable dis- ruption, the distinction between its enactment and its representation is difficult  to draw. In the case of his boisterous scherzos, Beethoven apparently relished the  fact that depictions of ilinx were also liable to engender it. When, especially in the scherzos of his symphonies, sudden, unexpected changes of  tempo threw all into confusion, [Beethoven] would laugh tremendously, assure the  men he had looked for nothing else, that he had been waiting for it to happen, and  would take almost childish pleasure in the thought that he had been successful in  unhorsing such routined orchestral knights.106  Bizet’s Jeux d’enfants, a set of twelve miniatures for piano duet, invokes the same  phenomenon via its mesmeric presentation of the oscillation of a swing and the  rotation of a spinning top alongside the more rambunctious ludic experiences of  leapfrog and blindman’s bluff.107 But while Beethoven’s scherzos rejoice in thigh- slapping humor and Bizet’s assortment of toys and games is bathed in a nostalgic  glow, other manifestations of ilinx are darker. György Ligeti’s vertiginous piano  études, for instance, disorient the listener via the Escheresque manipulation of  musical pitch-space and dizzyingly complex metrical layering: for all concerned,  their impact in performance derives from the rapturous (con)fusion of bravery and  terror in the face of physical demands that are at once perfectly logical and pro- foundly irrational.108 From the waltz to the mosh pit, the unbridled power and atten- dant risks of ilinx are often framed by buffer zones and mitigated by safety nets that,  like magic circles, are at once socially, materially, and ideologically constituted.109 Across all four of Caillois’s categories, a perpendicular axis of play measures  the degree of paidia and ludus.110 Paidia represents the player’s childlike delight  in defying or simply ignoring constraints, and the pleasure taken in tumult,  improvisation, and contrary behavior (somersault-turning, thread-pulling, or  queue-jumping, for instance). Ludus, conversely, indexes the player’s willing sub- mission to the nonnegotiable rules that govern the pursuit of games and regis- ters the pleasure taken in confronting—or ingeniously circumventing—arbitrary  and  recurrent obstacles (as in crosswords or Sudoku puzzles, for example).111 The  paidia-ludus continuum reflects social mediation and the player’s psychologi- cal state as much as it characterizes activities themselves: even chess, which for  Caillois is paradigmatic of ludus, can be played with a devil-may-care, indifferent,  or actively disruptive attitude that introduces an element of paidia.112 Thinking in terms of paidia and ludus can open up fresh perspectives on the  roles played by rules and regulations, whether internally or externally mandated  and whether obeyed or flouted. In Sports et divertissements (1914), an album con- taining twenty-one piano pieces adorned with handsome illustrations of ludic  activities, Satie resisted the tyranny of forced enjoyment by conveying the ennui  of play and leisure when smilingly imposed by social convention. In part, these  metaludic strategies can be read into Satie’s willful refusal to adhere to the usual  </page> <page sequence="20"> 32    key 1 protocol governing music’s mimetic relations with images and ideas: in ironic  contrast to the approach adopted by Bizet, he undercut the very notion of coor- dinating ludic motions with appropriate musical inflections.113 As is typical of  paidia, Satie played with the rules rather than by them. In the collection’s final  piece, “Le tennis,” the game (such as it is) emerges from the discrepancy between  the musical figures scattered across the page and the laconic dialogue overlay- ing them, which makes it clear that erotic subtexts are far more compelling than  Major Wingfield’s rules of play.114 The same could be said for Debussy and Vaslav  Nijinsky’s ballet Jeux (1913), in which tennis serves merely as a metonymic pretext  for amorous encounters, although Debussy cultivates a much more intimate rela- tionship between the sensuality of (fore)play as manifested via the subtle dynam- ics of oscillation, undulation, repetition, and variation.115 The Kantian discipline of ludus emphasizes that structural beauty and com- plexity can be achieved both despite and owing to strict constraints. Cultural  artifacts that display such qualities include architecture, textiles, origami, math- ematics, canons, puzzles, and computer code: they generally emerge from and  represent systems that are both governable and circumscribable by rules that are  at once logical and arbitrary. In this respect, the rationality of ludus is closely  associated with the codification of game theory by John von Neumann and Oskar  Morgenstern. Their Theory of Games and Economic Behavior (1944) enabled social  and economic interactions to be comprehensively formalized in terms of strategies  designed to confer optimal advantages to rational players of zero-sum games. By  articulating the mathematical rules governing agonistic encounters from court- ship to war games, a group of scholars including von Neumann, Morgenstern, and  the mathematician John Nash established the algorithmic logic that proceeded to  guide diplomatic and military strategies throughout the Cold War. In ludomusi- cal terms, this type of play is most directly found in Iannis Xenakis’s Duel (1959)  and Stratégie (1962), which pit two orchestras and conductors against each other:  their scores are calculated from the particular combinations of musical modules  chosen by each, and at the end the audience salutes the victors.116 The discipline imposed by ludus and its relation to education, edification, sys- tematization, and order can be directly gleaned from the games of tones devised  by Samuel Scheidt (Ludi musici, 1621), Josef Hauer (Zwölftonspiele, 1939–59), and  Paul Hindemith (Ludus tonalis, 1942) as well as from the development and deploy- ment of arcane isorhythmic and contrapuntal techniques. Rules are omnipresent,  as Foucault observed: their epistemological and material codes of conduct govern  the behavior of human bodies as well as social systems and relations.117 Like the  laws of chance, such rules emerged from theological doctrine, most obviously in  the form of monastic regulae, before gradually forming the basis of philosophical,  mathematical, and musical early-modern thought, as manifested by texts such as  Johann Joseph Fux’s Gradus ad Parnassum (1725). </page> <page sequence="21"> Ludomusicality    33 In the nineteenth century, such rule-bound systems came under sustained  attack. A staunch advocate of both ilinx and paidia, Nietzsche was equally averse  to the formulaic application of rules and to Hegel’s opposition of “child’s play” to  the pursuit of artistic truth: he defined maturity as the recapturing of “the serious- ness one had as a child at play.”118 Channeling Heraclitus while wreaking havoc on  Kant’s configuration of freedom, purposiveness, and play, Nietzsche claimed that  “absolute free will can only be imagined as purposeless, roughly like a child’s game  or an artist’s Spieltrieb.”119 In this world, only play, play as artists and children engage in it, exhibits coming- to-be and passing away, structuring and destroying, without any moral additive,  in forever equal innocence. And as children and artists play, so plays the ever- lasting fire. It constructs and destroys, all in innocence. Such is the game that aiōn  plays with itself. Transforming itself into water and earth, it builds towers of sand  like a child at the seashore, piles them up and tramples them down. From time to  time it starts the game anew. . . . Not hubris but the ever self-renewing impulse to  play calls new worlds into being.120  At first glance, paidia seems closely bound up with Dionysian qualities, allied  with Marsyas against the Apollonian attributes of orderly ludus. Yet the capri- cious behavior described by Nietzsche invokes Apollo’s deadly destruction of an  Achaean rampart during the Trojan War, which Homer likened to a child’s petu- lant demolition of a sandcastle.121 It is Apollo, not Dionysus, who ruthlessly bears  out the claim of Plato’s Athenian stranger that humans serve as divine playthings  and should behave accordingly, echoed by King Lear’s rueful remark that mortal  fate is no more than divine caprice: “As flies to wanton boys are we to th’ gods./  They kill us for their sport.”122 Accordingly, the question of whether play is tragic  or comic, profound or whimsical, has always been a matter of perspective as well  as scale.123 Like Schlegel, Nietzsche suggested that the logic of ludus persists across  cycles of creation and devastation: “The child throws its toys away from time to  time—and starts again, in innocent caprice. But when it does build, it combines  and forms its structures regularly, conforming to inner laws.”124 Rather than being  opposed, paidia and ludus keep each other in check—and thereby in play. 1–2 BEYOND WORK AND PLAY  Throughout Western thought and culture, play’s checkered history can be related  via its shifting antonyms: earnestness, utility, efficiency, industry, labor, and,  above all, work. In the nineteenth century, these antonyms conspired to put play  on the defensive. Play was feared, demeaned, and infantilized for representing a  subversive threat to the work ethic that, as Max Weber grimly observed, drove  the twin pursuits of spiritual salvation and economic growth.125 As Bill Brown  </page> <page sequence="22"> 34    key 1 points out, Huizinga’s insistence on play as a fundamental principle that pre- cedes its antitheses must be balanced against Herbert Marcuse’s contention that  precisely insofar as play marks “a breaking off from labor,” it betrays its roots  in work.126 In terms of nineteenth-century music, the production of the reified  musical work, personified by the Herculean figure of Beethoven and borne out  by the transformative effects of his compositional labors, stands as evidence for  Marcuse’s argument: painstakingly documented and represented by thematische  Arbeit, the work regulates, and even justifies, the instrumental play that fleetingly  animates it.127 Gooley has shown that Robert Schumann progressively distanced himself  from ex tempore play at the keyboard as a primary form of creative activity,  stressing instead the virtues of conceiving and elaborating musical designs as  a purely mental process.128 Despite his own youthful indulgence in six-hour  improvisatory marathons, in 1838 Schumann warned his wife-to-be Clara “not  to improvise too much“ since valuable material “gets uselessly lost that way.”129  Gooley accounts for this shift in terms of the burgeoning “moral economy  of the German bourgeoisie,” which insisted on the evidence of tangible pro- ductions wrought via compositional thrift and motivic efficiency.130 Even at  the turn of the century, the rise in the aesthetic stock of instrumental music,  reflected by Tieck, Michaelis, and Nägeli, had been coeval with disparage- ment of its means of production. Goehr notes that at the hands of Herder,  performance was associated with “impure labor” and instruments became  synonymous with lowly tools (Werkzeuge) that were put to artificial ends.131 In  Goehr’s reading, such instrumentophobia reached its apex with Wagner’s Die  Meistersinger, the agōn of which reassigns aesthetic and political power from  “those who perform upon [instruments] in favor of those who become them,”  from those who merely play to those who prove themselves worthy of being  played by a higher power.132 In the face of concerted attacks from Wagner and his supporters, who fol- lowed the lead of Herder and Hegel in targeting play’s virtuosic instrumentality  and meaningless formalism, the articulation of play as a viable aesthetic mode  required the appropriation of its detractors’ critical weapons. It was in this spirit  that Eduard Hanslick appealed to his readers’ memories of childhood when prais- ing instrumental music’s purposive, kaleidoscopic “play with colors and forms,”  treating such activity not as autonomous but rather as evidence of (and stimu- lation for) human consciousness and creative cognition.133 Although Hanslick’s  Kantian definition of music as tönend bewegte Formen echoes Nägeli’s emphasis  on music’s Formenspiel and anticipates the tautologically gnomic terms in which  Gadamer would define play as “the self-representation of its own movement,” it  was nonetheless born from the Herderian conviction that these motions reso- nated with “the great motions of the universe” as well as the tremors of the soul.134  </page> <page sequence="23"> Ludomusicality    35 The dazzling play of the virtuoso left Hanslick cold insofar as its exploitation of  corporeal techniques and sensations left precious little to the imagination: while  he sought to distance music from language, function, and utility, he nonetheless  insisted on its spiritual as well as its aesthetic attributes. In this sense, Hanslick’s  attitude neatly reciprocated that of his nemesis Franz Brendel, who backhand- edly acknowledged Kantian aspects of musical play even while insisting on the  primacy of programmatic texts and concepts.135 Weber connected the elevation of the work ethic and concept with the rise  of Protestantism and industrialized capitalism, implicating both in the rational  and systematic development of institutions and instrumental technologies such  as the symphony orchestra, the hierarchical organization of which precluded  improvisatory play and other informal interactions. Huizinga adopted a similar  line, bemoaning the effects of industrialization that had weakened play’s ritual  force and communal functions. While the narratives of Weber and Huizinga  recapitulated Schiller’s nostalgia for an older, purer world in which play was  unsullied by material considerations, Weber’s analysis also registered the dis- cursive effects of historical musicology, in which music was understood primar- ily in philological terms as a library of texts in need of ontological grounding  beyond their functions as cultural scripts. J. Q. Davies argues that the concept of  the musical work only became imaginable in an age of mass reproduction, since  the disenchantment wrought by ubiquitous commodification brought with  it the implication that music’s essence must reside elsewhere.136 Analogously,  the anxiety shared by Herder, Schiller, Wagner, and Hanslick concerning the  rational, mechanical aspects of instrumental play simultaneously obscures and  reveals the extent to which Romantic aesthetics relied on them, if only as a point  of departure. Unlike the relationship between singer and song in Die Meistersinger, the  ludic oscillation between playing and being-played is subject to inversion at any  moment: it can bypass intention, consciousness, and even life itself (as Nonnus’s  description of Marsyas’s resonating hide suggests). For Caillois, as for Weber,  such meaningless fluctuations were at odds with the pragmatic commitments to  productivity and utility that underwrite the moral and economic codes of indus- trialized societies: “Nothing has been harvested or manufactured, no masterpiece  has been created, no capital has accrued. Play is an occasion of pure waste: waste  of time, energy, ingenuity, skill, and often of money.”137 Yet the liminal forms of  play that unfold at society’s fringes, even those implicated in immorality, cor- ruption, and dysfunction, also lie at the heart of “civilization.”138 Agonistic con- flict, competition, and cheating thrive in the economic and educational systems;  speculative gambling fuels the stock market; and codes of costume and conduct  legitimize institutional power in the guises of dress-up (uniforms) and role-play  (etiquette). </page> <page sequence="24"> 36    key 1 This exposes the economic, sociological, and psychological stakes of describing  an activity as either “work” or “play.” According to the Oxford English Dictionary,  work moves objects through effort and exertion, while in play they oscillate and  revolve freely; work transforms things from one state into another via laborious  activity, while play involves quicksilver changes from one state to another and  back again; work is tiresome while play is pleasurable; work is real while play  is make-believe; and work has to do with the production of tangible artworks,  whereas play has to do with the (re)enactment of drama and music.139 Yet how  can we explain the fact that the very conditions and characteristics that make play  enchanting—repetition, entrainment, the enforcement of rules typical of ludus,  the tumult of paidia—can be indistinguishable from those that make work ardu- ous and tedious? As Tom Sawyer discovered when confronted by a fence that  needed to be painted, there is nothing intrinsic about an activity that defines it  as either “work” or “play”: it is categorized as such according to the values, func- tions, and imperatives that govern whether and how it is performed.140 The criteria  by which “work” and “play” are told apart shed as much light on the esteem and  stigma attached to a particular activity as on the activity itself. In their influential schematic representation of play, digital game theorists  Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman reflect this state of affairs by concentrically  nesting “game play,” “ludic activities,” and “being playful.”141 At the center lies  the relatively narrow definition of “game play” as the formalized interactions that  take place when players experience the logic of a ludic system through play (as in  an organized game of baseball, for example). Moving outward, “ludic activities”  accommodate behavior that is not bound by formal rules but that incorporates  ludic elements (such as an impromptu game of catch). At the periphery, “being  playful” implies a playful attitude or modality that can be applied to ostensibly non- ludic situations or actions (such as popping bubble wrap, dressing up, or painting  a fence) as well as to the playing of games themselves. In Salen and Zimmerman’s  neo-Kantian formulation, play “takes advantage of the space of possibility created  from the system’s structure”: it owes its existence to rigid rules or material con- straints, but takes place despite—and sometimes in opposition to—them.142 This  type of relation accounts for both the orderly principles and the stochastic flow of  a soccer match or a bebop performance, in which the ludic distribution of agency  among and between actors, objects, rules, and strategies is clearly apparent, even  (and perhaps especially) when those rules are being breached. For Foucault, the task of representing such principles and agencies was both  archaeological and genealogical: it had to do not only with the affordances and  restrictions of particular systems of thought (épistèmes), but also with their tempo- rally shifting formations. Foucault believed the generation and storage of knowl- edge to be governed by epistemological rules distinct from those that regulate  grammar, logic, and history. While these rules delimit conceptual possibilities,  </page> <page sequence="25"> Ludomusicality    37 they both effect prohibition and enable transgression via vectors of power and  discipline that, in conspicuously ludic terms, rehearse the dynamics of agōn, “the  endlessly repeated play of dominations” and its associated maneuvers, tactics, and  techniques.143 Adopting and adapting the term from Nietzsche, Foucault claimed  that genealogy eschews the purposeful teleology associated with work, uncover- ing ludic recurrence where others sought evidence of serious historical progress.  Genealogy “operates on a field of entangled and confused parchments, on docu- ments that have been scratched over and recopied many times.”144 It traces archae- ological methods as well as remains, taking as its subject matter not only archival  evidence, but also the discursive formations of the archive itself, which consti- tutes “the set of rules governing the range of what can be verbally, audiovisually,  or alphanumerically expressed,” as Wolfgang Ernst puts it.145 Ludomusical fields  of play are Foucauldian palimpsests that at once enable, regulate, and erase the  inscriptions of bodies in motion: rather than determining specific outcomes, the  prevailing rules provide a framework within which a range of possible outcomes  becomes imaginable and simulable. Although indebted to Foucault, Ernst’s technical terminology leads away from  the épistème and toward Kittler’s Aufschreibesystem, which Kittler defined as the  assemblage of technologies and institutions “that allow a given culture to select,  store, and process relevant data.”146 By focusing on media mechanisms and tech- niques, the work of Kittler and Ernst draws attention to the material conditions  that make an utterance, transcription, or genealogical palimpsest possible. This  is particularly important when it comes to ludomusical praxis, since games and  music cannot be directly accessed from within an archive or repository: insofar as  their documentary remains are always static and fragmentary, their reanimation  requires technologies of recreation (bodies, instruments, and other devices) as  well as textual modes of transmission. In humanistic scholarship, the archive has typically provided the lettered basis  for recovering the past through the activation of the literary imagination. For  music, as for theater, an analogous function is performed by the corpus of texts  grouped under the rubric of a repertoire, which serves to index the conceptual  range and limits of a particular form of cultural praxis. Emanating from the field  of performance studies, recent debates over the ontology of audiovisual materi- als and their functions as documents of the performed past have given rise to  new formulations of relations between archive and repertoire, text and perfor- mance, event and trace.147 As a challenge to the nomological imperative of the  archival record, which guides and ratifies accounts of the past insofar as they form  sums or subsets of its documentary evidence, Rebecca Schneider has explored  how the embodiment of remembered or imagined experience under the simula- tive rubric of reenactment can itself constitute a form of historical substantiation  when p erformed and recorded.148 Her work problematizes distinctions between  </page> <page sequence="26"> 38    key 1 texts, acts, and material evidence, suggesting new ways in which we might register  performance and the technologies deployed to capture it. From another perspective, acknowledging the drastic power of acts in and as  performance involves locating them within Vismann’s chiastic syntax of media.  To understand how bodies store and transmit cultural knowledge, we must appre- hend how communicative media are themselves materialized and physiologically  embedded, which opens the archive to media-archaeological forms of inquiry.  Georges Didi-Huberman claims that the past “can impose itself as an alienating  element of . . . historical interpretation itself.”149 Via historical research, we “gain  access .  .  . to the subtleties of a given period, which we then try to understand  through its own intelligibility. But we must also know how to smash the ring . . . ,  insofar as we want to understand the intelligibility itself.”150 To this end, Ernst high- lights the predominance of historiographical metaphors that frame the flight of  time’s arrow in the organic terms of embryonic development, maturation, and  senescence.151 Such narrative strategies emerge not merely from the chronological  ordering of events, but from the logic of the alphabet and the cultural techniques  of literacy that naturalize the serial concatenation of words and events alike. In recent years, digital humanists of various stripes have demonstrated that  numbers (and numerical procedures) can supplement letters (and literary theory)  in accounting not merely for inscriptive techniques, but for the sequencing of cul- tural operations writ large. In the contexts of communication and bureaucracy,  Siegert notes that while ink and paper might primarily be associated with the devel- opment and dissemination of literary content, they have also been implicated in  networks based on signals rather than utterances, relays rather than communica- tions, and instructions rather than expressions.152 Similarly, Markus Krajewski’s  intellectual history of the card catalog draws structural analogies between “index  cards and bank notes, house numbers and book shelving, card catalogs and Turing  machines.”153 Krajewski frames these various exempla of informational technologies  as “paper machines,” a maneuver that can be read in terms of Foucault’s genealogi- cal palimpsests. Chronological contiguity alone cannot account for the observability  of isomorphic relations between disparate instantiations of the same technologi- cal and epistemological principles. Tracing such techno-epistemological strands  through time and space while remaining steadfastly in the present tense, Krajewski  self-consciously deploys the rhetorical strategy of catachresis, which he defines as “a  failed transfer, a juxtaposition of incongruous elements” that produces “a surplus of  meaning that stimulates thought” as it makes explicit the fictiveness of the historio- graphical mode and its imputation of cause and effect.154 As Krajewski shows with regard to Gottfried van Swieten (Prefect of the  Viennese Imperial Library, inventor of the card catalog, and patron of Haydn and  Mozart), the principles and means of organizing knowledge can be named and  described via the retrojection of latter-day technical terminology even as they are  </page> <page sequence="27"> Ludomusicality    39 grounded in their native historical milieux.155 At once revealing and demonstrat- ing the multiplicity of the means by which cultural techniques can be represented,  such maneuvers reconfigure temporal and cultural distance as space to be negoti- ated by contemporary and historical observers alike. By ultimately returning to the trope of history as fiction, Krajewski becomes  embroiled once more in the literary terms from which he departed, just as his  provocative thoughts on paper machinery are nonetheless framed and bound in  the traditional format of the book. But Krajewski’s literary feedback loop suggests  a means by which the playing of musical texts, which have long been recognized to  blur the boundaries between expressive utterance and performative instruction,  might offer alternative modes of navigating beyond the realms circumscribed by  literary tropes of signification and meaning. Such texts themselves can be appre- hended as paper machines, as algorithmic programs that order and process infor- mation via ludomusical play.156 Ghiselin Danckerts’s Ave maris stella (1535, Figure 2) is a puzzle canon pre- sented in the form of a chessboard, on each square of which is notated a musi- cal fragment. According to Hans Westgeest, who claimed to provide the first  comprehensive solution in 1986, twenty viable four-voice motets in addition to  Ave maris stella can be derived by partitioning and navigating the board in vari- ous ways.157 As well as representing a game, Danckerts’s canon constitutes one: it  operates as a paper machine that guides and regulates the moves of its players in  nonlinear and yet systematic ways in order to produce multiple viable musical  outcomes. As a field of play, the chessboard is thus capable of staging the devis- ing and execution of ludomusical strategies, a relationship observed by the chess- loving violinist in Vladimir Nabokov’s novel The Defense: “What a game, what a  game. . . . Combinations like melodies. You know, I can simply hear the moves.”158 The epistemological common ground shared by Danckerts’s chessboard, an alle- gorical fifteenth-century illustration of a chekker, eighteenth-century Würfelspiele,  and contemporary digital games will emerge over the course of the Keys to come.  For now, these disparate phenomena are grouped together not only to indicate a  particular lineage of contemporary ludomusical praxis, but also to suggest that mod- ern technologies and discourses might provide a catachrestic lexicon with which to  describe objects and techniques that are temporally and geographically remote but  morphologically related.159 In this sense, musical scores might be understood not  merely as quasi-literary utterances or architectural blueprints, but as sets of rules  based on the play of correspondences between signs and actions, graphē and phōnē,  logos and technē. Analogously, and reciprocally, digital games can be apprehended  in terms of the ludomusical performances they prompt and regulate. To this end, Krajewski’s deployment of catachresis can be supplemented by the  concepts of retronymy and skeuomorphism. A retronym is a term introduced to  distinguish a long-standing object or practice from successors that bear the same  </page> <page sequence="28"> 40    key 1 Figure 2.

In the wake of electrification and recording, for instance, a guitar or a  musical performance must be retronymically qualified by the prefixes “acoustic”  </page> <page sequence="29"> Ludomusicality    41 or “live,” respectively. Conversely, a skeuomorph is a derivative object that retains  ornamental design cues to elements that used to be—but are no longer—integral  to its structure or operation. While retronyms recognize and sharpen distinctions  between the past and the present, skeuomorphs smooth them over, and yet the  identification of either is predicated on the assumption that phenomena change  over time in line with a logic of supersession and obsolescence. From a media-archaeological perspective, the insights of retronymy and  skeuomorphism can be combined to form the concept of the reverse skeuomorph,  which Alan Liu defines as a feature that seems ornamental, coincidental, or ines- sential in historical terms, but that proceeded to assume structural significance  in concepts, practices, and objects derived from it. Such “prophetic relics,” as  Liu calls them, “are epistemological rather than instrumental stitches between  past and present. They are an index or placeholder (rather than cause or ante- cedent) of the future.”160 Once they have been situated as such, the process of  navigating between these indices and placeholders becomes recursive, as Geoffrey  Winthrop-Young observes vis-à-vis Krajewski’s work: tracing their genealogical  relations transforms their historical contexts, which in turn alters their status and  significance in the present.161 Instead of ordering events in a series governed by the  logic of antecedence and consequence, the cross-referencing of such indices con- figures them in terms of prolepsis and analepsis: they come into being by shuttling  between the not-yet and the always-already.162 Historical instances of ludomusical mechanisms often take the form of reverse  skeuomorphs insofar as their distinctive attributes were later identified as such  under drastically different techno-epistemological conditions. At the same time,  since contemporary digital games are themselves thoroughly historical phenom- ena, the playing of such games and the music they enact, recreate, and prompt  can retool our understanding of ludomusical activities that are stranded in the  past. To take two examples to be discussed toward the end of this Key, digital  gameplay suggests how performances of Chopin’s “Minute” Waltz can be con- strued as speedruns and how chamber music might be played as an asymmetri- cal cooperative multiplayer game.163 In part, such juxtapositions are whimsical  gambits designed to jar the reader into taking their implausibility seriously. At  the same time, they constitute an attempt to recognize the historicity and coexis- tence of performative aspects of ludomusical play that stubbornly elude literary  description and are thus absent from the historical record. On yet another level,  they lodge a deeper claim concerning how information becomes conceivable and  transmissible via digital means of arraying and accessing it. In this light, it is notable that it took more than three hundred years for a  comprehensive solution of Danckerts’s puzzle to be registered, indicating that it  resonated in sympathy with twentieth-century ludic mechanisms. For Nabokov’s  violinist, certain rare sequences of ludic moves could be both tactically irresistible  </page> <page sequence="30"> 42    key 1 and aesthetically harmonious; the elusiveness of such combinations are reflected  by the fact that the sixty-four squares of the chessboard also formed a test bed for  problems involving permutational and exponential functions.164 Inquiry into the  means by which an unfathomably large range of patterns could be algorithmically  generated from a relatively small collection of fixed elements was pursued under  the logic of the ars combinatoria first described—and materialized by way of paper  machines—by Ramon Llull at the turn of the fourteenth century.165 More recently,  Deep Blue’s digital computation of optimal chess strategies involved brute-force  combinatorial calculations as well as reference to a vast library of previous games. Such processing also informed the ludic turn taken by poststructuralist think- ers such as Derrida, for whom the permutational mechanics of play worked  against the logic of totalization, the establishment of centers, the pursuit of origins,  and the construction of unequivocal meaning: ludic infinitude was constituted  by the endless serial interplay of discrete elements, whether notes or letters.166 In  a similar vein, Barthes noted that textual play opens up infinite possibilities while  sidestepping the ineffable, just as it is generative without being productive.167 For  Barthes, play was the means by which text could mobilize and propagate in the  face of potential ossification into a work fit only for philological or hermeneutical  exhumation. Significantly, Barthes—an amateur pianist as well as a lover of games— invoked music as a paradigm for the collaborative process of “play[ing]” a text,  of “mak[ing] it go.”168 For Huizinga, the performance of music and the fort-da of  its rhythmic unfolding were indispensable to the very notion of artistic play; for  Laurence Dreyfus, the dream of “unfettered play” offers reciprocal access to “music’s  greatest joy.”169 In different ways, all three divert attention away from the cul- tural functions that texts, games, and music fulfill and toward how they (enable  people to) play by investing actions with transformative power. In this light, the  rules of musical play can be understood as performative as well as discursive.  Similarly, its materials are subject to social and historical flux while also form- ing structures that obtrude, resisting straightforward assimilation by progress,  entropy, and other narrative strategies. Treating play as principle and mode as  well as object of inquiry, we might deploy other means of tracing the forces that  have shaped particular forms of play over time. Rather than attempting simply  to describe ludomusical play, we can set out to transcribe the rules, both tacit  and explicit, according to which it has been imagined, materialized, mediated,  and experienced. Along the way, we might register play’s idiosyncrasy and pro- miscuity, its violence and its rapture, its carefree yet contingent transgression of  the boundaries drawn between divine, human, animal, natural, and mechanical  realms. Any instance of play can be historically indexed and situated only once its formal  properties have been identified; conversely, such properties assume significance only  </page> <page sequence="31"> Ludomusicality    43 when embedded in the historical and cultural milieux that furnish the terms on which  their legitimacy is granted, demonstrated, and questioned.170 If, as Dreyfus suggests,  the playful oscillation between seemingly incommensurable criteria can obviate  the temptation to subjugate one set to the other, then the keyboard’s most overtly  ludic manifestations and associations offer the best chance of capturing the full  range and variegated shades of its digital analogies, as explored in Key 2.171 Whether  real or imagined, historical interactions between sweet fingers, blessed wood, and  wiry concord can inform our understanding of contemporary ludic phenomena.  Reciprocally, and in keeping with play’s commutative logic, a full account of today’s  ludic environment, which is predominantly characterized by digital games of con- flict (agōn), fortune (alea), role-play (mimicry), and sensory overload (ilinx), can  enrich our attempts to construe how the musical past played out. 1–3 THE SOUND OF GUNPLAY  While all media reflect the material and ideological conditions under which they  became conceivable, the case of the digital game is particularly revealing.172 The  twenty-first-century media landscape has been profoundly shaped by the rise of  games to an unprecedented level of cultural prominence. Most commonly regis- tered through their seismic impact on the economic terrain of the global enter- tainment sector, digital games have transformed the stock of financial, symbolic,  and social capital in which popular culture has traded since the late 1970s. Such  games channel a dizzying array of preexistent art forms, media, and genres that  includes calligraphy, painting, manga, anime, graphic novels, science fiction,  board games, theater, opera, film, television, radio, advertising, recorded sound,  electronic music, dance, and performance art. Fabricated as an unruly assemblage  of technologies and delivered as a multipronged sensorial assault, the digital game  indexes the Gesamtkunstwerk not only via its promiscuous (re)mixing of media,  but also by the scope of its ambition, its susceptibility to violence and bathos, and  its seductive promise of transcendence.173 Whether as simulation or simulacrum, and whether it conceals its represen- tational means or draws attention to them, the digital game symbolizes imagi- nary worlds in a subjunctive mood that discloses much about the fears and desires  haunting the contemporary unconscious.174 As dispatches from technology’s front  line in registers ranging from the defiantly subcultural to the elegantly neoclassi- cal and the elaborately baroque to the self-consciously avant-garde, digital games  have opened up new modes of representation, expanded the critical lexicon,  and stimulated distinctive contributions to debates surrounding the visual arts,  film, literature, and new media. In the wake of groundbreaking contributions by   William Cheng, Karen Collins, K. J. Donnelly, William Gibbons, Miki Kaneda,  Fares Kayali, Neil Lerner, Elizabeth Medina-Grey, Kiri Miller, Peter Shultz, Tim  </page> <page sequence="32"> 44    key 1 Summers, Chris Tonelli, and a growing band of others, digital games have also  begun to infiltrate the discourse and practice of (ethno)musicology, while their  soundtracks have been analyzed by an increasingly sophisticated music-t heoretical  apparatus.175 A chasm nonetheless yawns between the status of mainstream digi- tal games—replete as they are with ugly stereotypes, pulpy plots, and violent  action—and attempts to ennoble them with high-flown theory (despite the prec- edent set by Wagner, not to mention Greek mythology, on each of these counts).  For Alexander R. Galloway, this rift is to be celebrated rather than bridged, for  it reveals how the immediacy, vitality, and presence of digital games fly in the  face of the taxidermic academic impulse.176 Yet, as Pierre Bourdieu observed and  Galloway’s own work bears out, high theoretical stakes can on occasion be raised  with particular acuity by “apparently mundane, if not derisory, objects.”177 The digital game unites two of the furthest-reaching innovations of the twen- tieth century, both closely associated with von Neumann: the discipline of eco- nomic game theory, which he developed with Morgenstern in the years leading  up to the Second World War, and the computer architecture developed in the  postwar years that bears his name.178 It should be no surprise, then, that the digital  game has served as a lightning rod for debates concerning the representation of  violence, the rationalistic quest for domination in zero-sum conflicts, and rela- tionships between reality and simulation as well as human and machine: it stands  in synecdochically for the economic, technological, and militaristic operations of  late capitalism writ large.179  A strain of ludic evangelism has countervailed the opprobrium piled upon  digital games and those who play them. Jane McGonigal argues that games pos- sess the potential to transform twenty-first-century lives for the better, teaching us  how to enrich and inspire rather than—or as well as—how to “frag,” “troll,” and  “grief” one another.180 Conversely, Nick Dyer-Witheford and Greig de Peuter con- tend that the military technology that powers digital games and the ideologies of  production and consumption that underwrite them expose their abject complic- ity in the workings of corporate capitalism and empire.181 From their Marcusian  perspective, the freedom of play is merely a Trojan horse concealing the nefarious  means by which games induce people to labor for scant reward. For those in posi- tions of power, moreover, the playing of games becomes indistinguishable from  gaming the system, with little heed paid to the ethical and environmental fallout  that can accrue.182 Just as interpretations of Apollo vs. Marsyas must negotiate the myth’s ludic  drama and its shocking violence, approaches to digital games must navigate  between aesthetics and ethics when confronting the dystopian fantasies that they  so often enact. Tellingly, the most provocative recent work in play studies has  issued from digital game scholars whose research interfaces with critical theory  and political activism as well as the praxis of game development. On the former  </page> <page sequence="33"> Ludomusicality    45 front, Galloway and Ian Bogost have focused on systemic, procedural, relational,  and algorithmic aspects of games; on the latter, Bogost, Mary Flanagan, Celia  Pearce, and Anna Anthropy have explored historical and political dimensions of  the technologies that drive digital gameplay and its design, thereby elucidating  the ideological forces that establish, enforce, and subvert its rules.183 Collectively,  their work takes account of how digital games operate and of the phenomenologi- cal and social experiences that they afford, demonstrating that the technical and  representational means of digital games are thoroughly intertwined. Players of digital games acquire literacy across an array of visual, sonic, tactile,  and affective codes.184 The syntax, grammar, and tropic logic of these codes can  be processed semiotically through representations native to the digital game and  those incorporated from other media. Players can choose whether to submit to a  game’s ludic logic, to circumvent it via exploits, to subvert it via forms of uncon- ventional play, to redefine its constraints by altering its code, or to reframe its rep- resentational strategies and outcomes. The blending of simulation and mimesis  that is so characteristic of digital games thus requires a bifocal approach. Mimesis  interacts and interferes with the logic of simulation, creating a parallactic play- space that can be perceived—and occluded—from multiple vantage points. The  elements that define and distinguish the digital game have their own historical  and epistemological lineages, but they also reflect the ecology in which games  participate today, an ever-shifting environment that shapes the meanings derived  from the processing of binary code and its modulation into signals that impinge  on the human sensorium. For the purposes of architects, sound engineers, surgeons, and drone opera- tors as well as the players of games, computers calculate or approximate the  relevant optical, acoustical, and geometrical data required to simulate environ- ments via complex sets of rules. While doing so, the computer’s central process- ing unit (CPU) is insensible to distinctions between different types of data, since  all information must be transcoded into bits. In the terms of Luhmann’s systems  theory, the computer is “operationally closed” insofar as its relatively high lev- els of internal order and complexity rely on the identification and isolation of  information from noisy environments according to strict protocols. But while it  cannot communicate directly with those environments (as anyone who has sworn  at a crashed computer knows all too well), a computational system is nonetheless  deeply embedded in and promiscuously “coupled” with them by way of input  and output devices that modulate information into stimuli to which both human  and nonhuman actors can respond.185 For the computer, a keystroke converts an  alphanumerical symbol into a snippet of binary code; from a sensorial perspective,  the digital distinctions supplied to and processed by the CPU can be represented  as pixels or pitches, flashes or rumbles, animations or syncopations. Both despite  and owing to its foundation on digital operations, the significance of such events  </page> <page sequence="34"> 46    key 1 cannot be foretold or circumscribed, but rather emerges via the asynchronous and  unpredictable collusion of artists, developers, hardware, code, interfaces, screens,  speakers, and players. Beyond its immediate history, media-archaeological fragments of the digital  game are scattered among the mathematical and technological innovations of phi- losophers, inventors, and polymaths ranging from the ancient Greek philosopher  and statesman Archytas to Filippo Brunelleschi, Leibniz, and Athanasius Kircher.  As mathematician, acoustician, astronomer, engineer, strategist, and acquain- tance of Plato, Archytas explored the calculability of sonic phenomena as well  as the trajectories of airborne objects. In the early fifteenth century, Brunelleschi  established geometrical optical linear perspective as a painterly technique, which  was codified and demonstrated by his acquaintances Leon Battista Alberti and  Masaccio. In the seventeenth century, Leibniz had a hand not only in the inven- tion of binary, but also in the development of differential calculus, which offered a  means of digitizing the continuous trajectories of bodies in motion and thus ren- dered them computable.186 For his part, Kircher developed the lanterna magica,  a forerunner to the slide projector that beguiled onlookers by throwing ghostly  images of demons and skeletons onto walls.187 As documented in his Musurgia  universalis (1650), Kircher also developed combinatorial systems of music com- position, codified modes of musical encryption, and worked on technologies  related to mechanical musical recreation.188 As Kittler pointed out with relish, a thread connects these innovations: all  are related to the waging of war.189 While Archytas’s observations on the pro- portional relations between pitch and velocity may have been inferred from the  aulos, they were equally applicable to the motion of projectiles on the battlefield.190  Perspective, as deployed by Leonardo da Vinci and Albrecht Dürer, became a   technological means of aiming firearms accurately. Similarly, the benefits of the  capability to calculate the ballistic properties of cannonballs were an impetus  behind Leibniz’s development of calculus, while Kircher’s lanterna magica and  musical codes were conceived in order to transmit military intelligence over long  distances. Through and beyond these examples, Kittler notoriously argued that  all technologies of diversion owed their very existence to the war machine: “The  entertainment industry is, in any conceivable sense of the word, an abuse of army  equipment.”191 Even with Kittler’s militaristic bias set to one side, it is indisputable that digital  games do not merely draw on an agonistic media-genealogical legacy, but were  directly spun off from technologies initially developed for and by the US military- industrial complex. Correspondingly, the operations that govern them issued  from the development of the earliest computers by von Neumann and his col- laborators and competitors in the aftermath of the Manhattan Project, in which  von Neumann played a critical role. This helps explain why the development of  </page> <page sequence="35"> Ludomusicality    47 the digital game was closely tied to the relationship between the United States and  Japan, nations whose military and technological fortunes were bound together by  conflict, trade, and cultural exchange. William Higinbotham’s Tennis for Two (1958), one of the earliest electronic  games made accessible to the public, illustrates these relationships and codepen- dencies.192 Higinbotham had worked on the Manhattan Project before becoming  head of the Brookhaven National Laboratory’s Instrumentation Division, and his  game was played not on a television but on a triggered-sweep cathode-ray oscil- loscope. This analog display technology had been developed as a means of map- ping the presence of invisible objects as identified by sound waves (sonar) or radio  waves (radar); it was concerned with providing data that tracked sea- and aircraft  for military purposes.193 From its formative moments, then, the predigital video  game traced the trajectory of Leibniz’s calculus in dealing with representations  of bodies in motion, whether they took the form of airplanes or tennis balls. (In  this light, it is telling that Nijinsky had initially envisaged that his and Debussy’s  Jeux—which Higinbotham might have called No Tennis for Three—would con- clude with a plane crash.)194 Tennis for Two challenged players to process images  in order to enter timely and accurate input that coincided with (and brought  about) spatial collisions. The agonistic and violent qualities of such games were  thus integral to their development rather than overlaid onto it. The repurposing of  hardware for ludic purposes simply enacted a shift from the mimetic representa- tion of external phenomena (such as airplanes) to the simulation of physical laws  governing the motion of imaginary objects (“tennis balls”) via analog or digital  computation and the modulation of relevant data into audible or visible signals.195 Although audio-related technologies from sonar to stereophony made contri- butions to the development of the computer and the waging of war, early digital  games such as Spacewar!, developed by a team at the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology in 1962, produced no intentionally musical sounds.196 As Claus Pias  observes, however, the very title of Atari’s Pong (1972) signaled the supplanting of  the relay clicks of Tennis for Two by the onomatopoeic bloops and bleeps of audible  sine waves: hardware designed for video display was repurposed to deliver sonic  feedback that synchronized and represented the binary logic of colliding and miss- ing through distinctions of frequency.197 In human terms, these different pitches  articulated the zero-sum representation of victory, defeat, and their ludic deferral. When ballistic data were processed by the digital computational power of von  Neumann’s serial architecture rather than by televisual relays and gates, relatively  complex artificially intelligent responses could be calculated and performed by  the machine itself. This facilitated the pseudoapocalyptic drama of Tomohiro  Nishikado’s Space Invaders (1978), in which a lone human is pitted against endless  waves of computer-controlled alien adversaries. In Space Invaders, it is imme- diately apparent that the computer has transformed from neutral arbiter into  </page> <page sequence="36"> 48    key 1 implacable (and unbeatable) enemy: the phalanx of aliens unremittingly traverses  and descends the screen in a pattern that emulates in slow motion the sweep  of the electron beam that plots their bitmapped images. As the player reduces  their number via laser cannon, the decreased load on the CPU accelerates their  movement. This effect is matched by an increase in the tempo of the soundtrack’s  reiterated descending tetrachord that, in a positive feedback loop, both registers  and stimulates the player’s quickening pulse as the stakes rise.198 The increased  motion that accompanies the redistribution of the burden of execution from CPU  to human is thus represented both visually and aurally. As this synchrony suggests, the computer can both visualize auditory data  and “sonify” visual data as commanded, and this media-agnosticism is often iden- tified as a hallmark of the digital age. That notwithstanding, the mechanisms by  which computers store and process binary information evoke Gotthold Ephraim  Lessing’s distinction in Laocoön (1766) between the “spatially juxtapositive arts  .  .  . of painting, sculpture, and architecture, and the temporally progressive arts  of . . . poetry and music,” in Albright’s paraphrase.199 Bits are either stored as spa- tially divergent but temporally fixed structures of memory, or executed serially  in temporal sequence as code. The static configurations of bits as memory can be  correlated with the spatial properties of the image (and in some early comput- ers they were even visible as such); the execution of bits as code and the resul- tant “syncopations of changes in registers,” as Bogost describes them, are more  closely analogous to the transformation of a score into a musical performance.200  Describing the CPU as a “sonic, highly rhythmical mechanism,” Ernst makes this  connection explicit: “digitized signals resemble the tradition of music notation”  insofar as “they wait to be algorithmically executed within the CPU.”201 The accelerando of Space Invaders illustrates this isomorphism between digital  gameplay and the performance of music. When Galloway points out that “[one]  plays a game. And the software runs. . . . Here the ‘work’ is not as solid or integral  as in other media,” he is preoccupied with differentiating digital games from pho- tography and film.202 In the process, however, he echoes Vladimir Jankélévitch’s  claim that “music is not made to be spoken of, but for one to do: it is not made  to be said, but to be ‘played.’ ”203 Insofar as players’ timely input is routed via fin- gers, thumbs, and other technological devices, digital gameplay has more to do  with the choreography of instrumental performance than with spectatorship or  discourse.204 Both games and music are better conceived as drastic than gnostic,  in Jankélévitch’s terms: they are activities to be performed rather than texts to  be deciphered. Their unpredictable unfolding in time is a defining characteristic,  a paradox that simultaneously distinguishes and problematizes their ontological  status. Furthermore, thinking about games musically affords the possibility of  coordinating their audiovisual elements into a ludic counterpoint that signifies  more than its voices can individually convey. </page> <page sequence="37"> Ludomusicality    49 Music’s elusiveness reduced Jankélévitch to a plaintive litany of questions as to  where it might ultimately reside: “Is it in the piano, or on the level of the vibrat- ing string? Does it slumber within the score? Or maybe it sleeps in the grooves  of the record? Is it to be found at the tip of the conductor’s baton?”205 Analogous  questions might be asked of the digital game: Does its essence lurk in software, in  the binary code etched into optical media or corralled by the logic gates of flash  memory? Does it spring into being with the execution of that code, animated by  the operational logic that sends it coursing through the console’s CPU and audio- visual hardware and modulates it into multisensory stimuli? Or could it be said to  emerge at the interface of the game controller with the player’s body, distributed  across the circuitry of mind, machine, and social network? Rather than offering categorical answers to these questions, we might observe  that all admit—or even invite—a certain ambivalence, a fort-da oscillation between  affirmation and demurral that hints at underlying ludic dynamics.206 Music and  games may (not) be apprehended as texts, objects, phenomena, and modalities:  both forms of activity can be at once rational and irrational, tender and violent,  human and inhuman. But digital games differ from music in that their constitu- ent elements are combined and remediated under the technological aegis of the  computer, which recursively establishes and enforces the protocols that govern  their interaction. In a radical shift from the traditional ontology and aesthetics  of mimesis, the computer creates the worlds it represents, realms governed by  laws it both reads and writes. In the words of the Atari pioneer Nolan Bushnell,  the computer serves simultaneously as “an arbiter, an umpire, a scorekeeper, and  a dungeon master.”207 Its binary protocols transcode sensible representations of  language, number, sound, image, gesture, and affect by way of audiovisual modu- lations and input devices that operate both as formal mechanisms and as digital  interfaces. In this regard, the device that most conspicuously brings the historical,  cultural, technological, and epistemological properties of music and digital game- play into direct contact is the keyboard. 1–4 BITS AND BEATS If play mediates between the cultural techniques by which human subjects are  formed and those that bring the world to hand, then the keyboard is perhaps the  paradigmatic instance of a ludic interface. Negotiating between the epistemological  limits of Lessing’s juxtapositional and progressive categories, the keyboard and its  derivatives materialize and order bits of information, making them available for  digital processing by humans and machines.208 Keys and buttons (re)present bits  as spatially discrete entities that are configured and mapped according to specific  formations of cultural memory, the elements of which are stored and retrieved by  recourse to notes, letters, numbers, tunings, and temperaments. Temporally, the  </page> <page sequence="38"> 50    key 1 keyboard enables these bits to be processed in succession, configuring sequences  of events that can be programmed (composed), executed in real time (performed),  or both at once (improvised).209 Keyboards allow for infinite variation via permutational and combinatorial  processes. In true Kantian form, however, this infinitude is only conceivable  owing to the imposition of strict limits and an insistence on absolute distinctions.  In conjunction with the storage medium of notation, the keyboard represents  and implements a set of rules for selection, processing, and transmission that are  at once inseparable from and independent of its physical instantiations and cul- tural functions, plotting the conceptual trajectory of encoding and decipherment  delineated in Key 2–2. Most relevant here is the role played by the keyboard as a  point of contact between what Patrick Feaster terms “oscillographic” and “melo- graphic” forms of musical inscription, both of which supplement and relativize  the technologies of conventional notation.210 Édouard-Léon Scott de Martinville’s phonautograms (1853–61) exemplify oscil- lographic notation, which registers the amplitude of sonic signals.211 Conversely,  melography is closer to traditional music notation inasmuch as it symbolizes  information in terms of the contiguous domains of pitch and rhythm, frequency  and duration. Whereas pitches are typically iconized by individual notes, acciden- tals, and their relative positions on the page’s y-axis, however, their rate of tempo- ral succession must be inferred via the decoding of linguistic directives, expressive  indications, and arbitrary symbols as well as by the spatial distribution of these  signs along the x-axis, which is broadly suggestive rather than explicitly prescrip- tive. Melography offered an alternative that was isomorphic with the regulated  passage of time as well as the keyboard’s topological layout.  The term “melograph” can be traced back to a device designed by the math- ematician Leonhard Euler in 1752 that aimed to capture extemporized keyboard  playing by attaching pencils to the action of each key that marked pitches and  durations on a spool of paper.212 As a means of musical programming, storage,  and recreation, however, the principle of melography can be extended back to the  mechanical flute player described in the ninth century by the three Persian broth- ers known as the Banū Mūsā and forward to today’s MIDI sequencers.213 In 1842,  the musicographical reformer V. D. de Stains observed that melographic notation,  illustrated in Figure 3 by the Huguenot engineer Salomon de Caus’s design for a  hydromechanical organ (1615), plots pitches and durations on a Cartesian grid  that allows their relations to be precisely quantified, coordinated, and digitally  processed in—and as—space and time.214 Owing to their unambiguous calculabil- ity, the periodic processes by which pitch and rhythm could be encoded readily  lent themselves to the technologies of automation in which Caus specialized: the  machine-readable tablature of Striggio’s madrigal “Chi farà fed’al cielo” takes the  form of pegs that activate the keys at the bottom of Caus’s illustration.215  </page> <page sequence="39"> Figure 3.

Daniel Hillis.217 Whereas Caus’s illustration exposes the mechanisms of automation, construc- tors of android automata sought to conceal them as artfully as possible. From this  perspective, one of the famous android automata built by Pierre and Henri-Louis  Jaquet-Droz in the 1770s—a keyboard player known as Marianne or la musicienne  (Figures 4 and 5)—is particularly telling.218 Although Terrance Riley points out  that all eighteenth-century automata were “fundamentally musical machines” to  the extent that they depended on the pinned barrels and clockwork mechanisms  that had long been associated with musical reproduction, the performance of la  musicienne is unusual in its imbrication of the human, the mechanical, and the  musical.219 The android’s complex engineering coordinates cams that direct the  continuous sweep of her forearms (and the rise and fall of her chest) with a stud- ded barrel that does not directly activate sonic production, but rather operates her  digits—and digitizes her operations—at the ergonomically curved keyboard. In  line with contemporaneous pedagogical treatises, her digital and analog technolo- gies are brought together in the interest of mechanizing human actions as well as  humanizing their mechanical counterparts.220 As Abbate points out, la musicienne does not simply reproduce music, but  plays it.221 In the process, she stages and performs the isomorphic relationship  between the keyboard and melographic tablature. At the same time, her doll- and  childlike qualities present la musicienne as a Gadamerian object of play. Beyond  that, her mechanized femininity suggests that the processing of melographic data  might do more than provide passive entertainment for human onlookers and lis- teners: assigning them roles in the digital recreation of music can engage them as  players while making them “playable” too.222 As historical artifact, digital protocol, and reverse skeuomorph, la musicienne’s  melographic barrel indexes a wide range of phenomena. Across today’s ludomusi- cal landscape, such technologies and their audiovisual properties collide most spec- tacularly in the rhythm-action genre of digital games, popularized by the beatmania  (Figures 6 and 9), Dance Dance Revolution (1998–2014), Guitar Hero (2005–15), and  Rock Band (2007–16) franchises, which draw directly on the functions represented by  </page> <page sequence="42"> 54    key 1 Figure 7.

The “rhythm” and “action”  in such games derive from the digital or podial activation of the appropriate keys,  buttons, or foot switches in a timely fashion. Programmed by the representation  of a rotating studded barrel, the digits of the beatmania player activate a keyboard  in order to recreate music, just like those of la musicienne. In the context of play,  such devices become platforms for the exhibition of timing, rhythm, and dexterity,  attributes that are as integral to digital games as they are to musical performance. From Caus’s organ to beatmania, and whether performed by human or  machine, the operation of mechanisms that enable this type of musical rec- reation requires a consistent source of energy (whether supplied by air, water,  solar power, muscles, gravity, or electricity) and temporal regulation (whether  imposed by counting, entrainment, clockwork, or crystal oscillators).223 This hints  at a genealogy that reflects the organ’s long-standing associations with musical  timepieces. At certain junctures, “mechanical clock” and “mechanical organ”  became virtually synonymous insofar as both types of instrument were closely  associated with the passing of earthly time, the evocation of eternity, and the  marking of festivities.224 The earliest notable digital games from which evidence  of this media-archaeological lineage can be excavated are Nintendo’s Game &amp;  Watch systems (1980–91,  Figure 7), which invite players to test and refine their  </page> <page sequence="43"> Ludomusicality    55 abilities to  perform sequences of precise audiovisual synchronizations in pursuit  of the highest possible score.225 Both functions of the Game &amp; Watch, the “trivial”  game and the “serious” timepiece, are programmed and realized via the pressing  of buttons, the oscillation of quartz, and audible feedback.226 On the one hand, this  involves the mechanical simulation of musical time as experienced by humans; on  the other, it entails the human emulation of the measurement and partitioning of  time by mechanical means. The indiscernible rapidity with which an electronic  clock’s liquid crystal display flickers and the slowness with which its numerals  succeed one another are both concessions to the normative limits of human per- ception; conversely, a player’s button presses must be measured and converted  into machine code if a difference is to be made within the ludic system. In other  words, if coupling is to occur between the operationally closed systems of player  and game, the human must become “machine-shaped,” and vice versa.227 As the anthropomorphic form of la musicienne goes to show, absolute distinc- tions between the human and the mechanical have long been open to question.  In La tonotechnie (1775), a fastidious treatise on the melographic art of pinning  musical cylinders, Marie-Dominique-Joseph Engramelle repeatedly located the  elusive quality of “taste” and evidence of a good ear in the microtimings of  musical  execution, without which music was “cold, mechanistic, insipid, and lifeless.”228  Conventional notation was incapable of prescribing or capturing these nuances,  but they could be accurately rendered via correspondingly subtle processes of cal- culation, since “nothing in music cannot be exactly measured.”229 The most refined  musical expression was itself expressible by nothing more (or less) than the “mea- surement of notes by numbers, the division of the circumference of cylinders into  so many equal parts as required to apply prongs at precise and regular distances,  and the disposition of such prongs in a manner that plays pieces of music with  taste and precision.”230 By enumerating and classifying the fine-grained agogics of  a performer’s touch at the keyboard under the rubrics of tenues, tactées, silences,  and ornamental modules, Engramelle—who numbered clock-makers among his  intended readership—laid the claim that musical time was not simply composed  of rhythm and meter as conventionally conveyed.231 On the contrary, and on scales  ranging from the subtactile module to the twenty-four-measure formal span of a  minuet, discrete units of time (which, in the case of cylinders, were synonymous  with the spatial partitions of circumferential planes) could be transformed into  periodic waves and arcing parabolas by way of Engramelle’s musical calculus.232 By yoking play to a metronomic clock, digital games such as the Game &amp; Watch  stress not only the primacy of ludomusical rhythm, but also what Pias describes in  self-consciously Kantian terms as “the game player’s duty.”233 In an analogous vein,  Nietzsche’s characterization of the “rhythmic tick-tock” of ancient verse as a quasi- sacred “compulsion” that “engenders an unconquerable desire to yield, to join in”  suggests how digital gameplay configures a dialectic between ludus (the player’s  </page> <page sequence="44"> 56    key 1 voluntary submission to the arbitrary and intransigent conditions imposed by the  CPU) and paidia (represented by the association of games with toys, most clearly con- veyed by their simulative functions and miniature scale).234 Experientially, this dialec- tic between ludus and paidia can be construed in terms of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi’s  cybernetic theory of “flow.”235 By presenting a clear goal that becomes increasingly  challenging to attain, monitoring progress, and communicating the state of play  through a continuous feedback loop, rhythmical gameplay allows the player to navi- gate between boredom and frustration on the one hand and control and abandon- ment on the other, ideally leading to an intense state of focus, joy, even rapture. Konami’s beatmania series established the blueprint for the performance  of rhythm-action gameplay at a keyboard interface (Figure 6). The media-  archaeological connection with la musicienne is clearly visible, as both illustrated  and iconically represented in Figures 4, 5, and 6, but the genealogical ramifications of  beatmania’s digital interface also extend in other directions. In 1874, Jean-Maurice- Émile Baudot introduced a five-bit chorded interface (Figure 8), configured in the  two-plus-three layout of the piano’s black keys, as the input device for his multi- plexed telegraph system. The conceptual basis for Baudot’s five-bit system of alpha- numerical encoding had been articulated by John Wilkins in 1641; its optical and  acoustical materialization, involving a machine “designed to resemble a piano” and  a keyboard “with a minimum of five keys,” was first detailed by the keyboardist,  composer, and conductor József Chudy in 1787.236 As Ivan Raykoff notes, Baudot’s  keyboard was denigrated as unwieldy and inefficient before being rendered obso- lete by the automation of its functions.237 More than a century later, however, the  long-defunct keyboard returned, interleaved in black-and-white formation and set  alongside the digital simulacrum of an analog turntable, as the interface for beatma- nia’s ludomusical gameplay (Figure 9). Such latter-day extrusions of Baudot’s interface might suggest a chronological  narrative based on the ways a communicational protocol was itself communicated.238  At the same time, it invites us to consider other modes of relating its various itera- tions to one another, even if—or perhaps especially when—our historicizing instincts  are unsettled in the process. Just as Krajewski forges connections between Turing  machines and card catalogs, the representational lineage of beatmania’s material  forms and notational principles can be traced across a broader network, among  the nodes of which can be counted not only the MIDI sequencer, the player piano,  and Caus’s hydromechanical organ, but also the punched cards with which Basile  Bouchon, the son of an organ maker, first programmed a textile loom in 1725.239  These technological artifacts index a protocol by which musical information could be  codified and transmitted, revealing the degree to which all music notation is a storage  medium that makes information visibly available for audible transcoding. Beyond  that, however, the same constellation of objects and principles also represents a  clustering of musical and industrial technologies implicated in the epistemology of  </page> <page sequence="45"> Figure 8.

That notwithstanding, their  entanglement in cognitive, linguistic, social, and affective systems has enabled them  to communicate via encryption, to touch via mechanical processes, to give form  to imaginative impulses. Their functions should thus be understood in terms of  praxis, “a set of executions or actions in relation to a world,” as Galloway puts it  in the context of computation, rather than merely in terms of formal ontology.242  Reinterpreting the performance of five-bit telegraphy in parallel and serially as the  chords and sequences of musical recreation, rhythm-action games from beatma- nia to Rock Band 4 demonstrate that the logic governing both systems is chiastic,  reversible, and capable of engaging its players at a tactile and affective level even  while ostensibly restricting them to the automatable task of mechanical reproduc- tion.243 Baudot’s telegraph indexed the waveforms of spoken or imagined utterances  in symbolic form for the purposes of transmission and storage; c onversely, players  of beatmania convert stored symbols into sound via the same digital  operations. In  the process, unwieldy transmissive inefficiency is transformed into a pleasurable  ludomusical challenge, bearing out Bernard Suits’s definition of playing a game as  “the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary obstacles.”244 The ludomusical dimensions of Baudot’s interface as realized by beatmania  reveal ways in which communicative technologies can become playful when put  into digital practice, embodied by “the nimble and orderly movements of the   fingers.”245 But the original function of Baudot’s device—to make present a trace  of that which is physically absent—remains. Accordingly, the performance of  communicative techniques can connect subjects and objects across time as well  as space, mediating between past and present in the course of bringing remote  phenomena into contact. 1–5 PLAYING UNDEAD Materialized via binary formalism, enabled and constrained by game-theoretical  dynamics, and driven by cybernetic feedback loops, the praxis of digital game- play reflects the culturally embedded precepts that underpin the von Neumann  architecture as well as the psychological and affective impact of its operations.  In Nietzschean terms, the digital game’s Dionysian excesses and its mythic, oth- erworldly qualities follow, quite logically, from the Apollonian rationality that  determines the course of proceedings: its paidia and ludus are entwined.246 Games  render rationality palpable: their significance derives from a vast array of visual,  sonic, tactile, and affective representations that issue from the spatiotemporal  </page> <page sequence="47"> Ludomusicality    59 modulation of digital operations.247 In the terms of mimicry, these modulations  can be perceived as analogous as well as simulative in that they index the distance  between a concept, object, or praxis and its representations, testifying to the ubiq- uitous truth of technological deception. Digital games such as beatmania, Guitar Hero, and Rock Band that take musi- cal recreation as their primary subject matter form only a small subset of titles that  might be considered ludomusical. From the Tron-like technoscapes of Rez (2001) to  the musical ramifications of the narrative binary trees presented by L. A. Noire (2011)  via the platforming hijinks of the bongo-controlled Donkey Kong Jungle Beat (2004),  games distribute the responsibility of ludomusical enactment in innumerable ways  across the nexus linking composers, developers, hardware, code, interfaces, and play- ers.248 In the present context, and for reasons that extend beyond its thematic and  mechanical foundations, the relatively obscure Frederic: The Resurrection of Music  (2011–14, Figure 10), developed by the Polish studio Forever Entertainment, provides  the most striking combination of the ludomusical tropes introduced thus far.  Cutting across the registral divide separating the e litism ascribed to “classi- cal” music from the putative philistinism of digital games, the liminal figure of  Chopin has formed an unexpectedly persistent locus of ludomusical encounters  that unfold at keyboards, whether they involve the relaying of single bits of infor- mation, the activation of complex acoustic events, the realization of the ineffable,  or all of the above. His music reveals how the play of fingers over the keyboard  allows for the creation of sonorous effects that simultaneously reinforce and defy  its black-and-white gridding of frequency. In 1852, for instance, the exiled German  composer, author, and pedagogue Johanna Kinkel heard Chopin’s piano music to  herald the “emancipation of quarter tones” by “rattling the gate” that both barred  and disclosed “Nature’s eternal sounds.”249 Condemned to “slink reluctantly by way  of semitones,” Chopin’s melodies “grope for finer spiritual nuances than current  intentions can realize.”250  Kinkel’s dissatisfaction was framed as both symptom and diagnosis of the piano’s  crude temperamental partitions, but its ramifications extend deeper, infiltrating the  foundations of the keyboard’s digital epistemology. Thinking of such interfaces not  merely in terms of the work accomplished, or the information transmitted thereby,  but as facilitators of play opens up different genealogical perspectives, however. Like  the narrow voids at the intersections of paving stones, the cracks between the piano’s  keys present ludomusical challenges, successful navigation of which entails both  acknowledgment and circumvention. On the one hand, the keyboard’s crude parti- tions could be heard to distort natural continua; on the other, as Siegert describes  the latticed “veil” through which Alberti rendered natural phenomena as veristic  images, its gridwork formed frames through which Chopin’s swooping curves could  become observable, calculable, graspable, and recreatable in a lifelike manner.251 From Kinkel’s day to our own, the keyboard has consistently mediated Romantic  fantasies that at once admit and deny the mechanisms that bring them to life.252  </page> <page sequence="48"> 60    key 1 Figure 10.

An analogous logic obtains in relation to the temporal dimensions of digital play.  Whether taking the form of the microtimed desynchronization of melody and  accompaniment in a Chopin nocturne, the improvisation of a Hammond organ  </page> <page sequence="49"> Ludomusicality    61 solo, the expert playing of Guitar Hero, the dexterous transmission of an urgent  text message, or the destruction of an enemy base, such play is predicated on k airos  rather than chronos, on strategically seizing the right moments to syncopate the  metronomic spacing of the matrix that partitions milliseconds and centuries alike.253 Chopin reportedly bestowed the title “valse du petit chien” on his Waltz in D flat,  op. 64, no. 1, after being amused by the ilinx of a small dog chasing its tail.254 While the  waltz’s subsequent reception history might have been predicated on an accentual mis- placement (the adjective “minute” was first applied as a simple diminutive), the fact  that so many pianists have responded to the challenge of completing a performance  within sixty seconds testifies to its ludic qualities.255 Such recreations of Chopin’s  music cannot be understood in terms of mimesis, and still less within the normative  rhetoric of performance practice, but they make explicit the scope—which is also to  say the limits—of simulation as a fictive mode of play. On the one hand, an emphasis  on speed might seem to reduce the waltz to a mere pretext for the display of mecha- nistic virtuosity; on the other, it need not preclude the imaginative demonstration of  qualities more typically associated with the performance of Chopin’s music.256 This quickly becomes evident from a perusal of speedruns of digital games, in  which players also aim for completion in the shortest possible time under regu- lated conditions that either prohibit or mandate the availability of technical assis- tance from software or hardware tools. In the former case, phenomenal dexterity  is a prerequisite for the accomplishment of such feats, but the most impressive  performances of both types rely less on mechanical proficiency and more on an  intimate knowledge of the logic on which the game’s mechanics are based. The  acquisition of such skills and knowledge requires creativity, acuity, and sensitivity  as well as painstaking practice. As in Guitar Hero and countless other rhythm-action games, the outcomes  of Frederic’s gameplay are calculated according to the speed and accuracy with  which players can “match” the notes that, like the pegs on Caus’s rotating bar- rel, travel toward the piano keyboard at the bottom of the screen (which, on the  PC and Macintosh versions of the game, is mapped onto its QWERTY counter- part). For Adorno, the code of the barrel organ’s cylinders (“die Geheimschrift  der Walzen”) enabled the seizure of all “unclaimed musical goods” from both  past and present, whether sacred or profane, comic or tragic; as a result, they were  flattened, rationalized, commodified, alienated, and rendered “prehistoric” by its  technological “magic.”257 From Caus to Frederic, an isomorphism persists across  devices and technologies that involve the transduction of such code—whether it  takes the form of staff notation, tablature, real or virtual pinned barrels, MIDI  data, or C++—via mechanisms of play enacted by humans and machines.  While its subject matter might be relatively unusual, Frederic is thus a typical dig- ital game insofar as it unabashedly remediates its narrative, visual, and mechanical  elements—not to mention its soundtrack. Frederic presents nine “catchy remixes”  </page> <page sequence="50"> 62    key 1 of Chopin’s greatest hits in the form of “epic musical duels” between Chopin—who,  according to the game’s promotional materials, has returned from the dead to “save  the world from soulless, mass-produced music”—and stereotypical representatives  of the various popular genres in which his music has been remixed, mashed up, and  mercilessly quantized for the sake of digital synchrony. Ludicrous though it may  seem, Frederic’s premise is typical of its genre: many rhythm-action games  launch  the player on a quasi-Pythagorean quest to restore harmony and order to a world  under attack from alien forces whose hostility can be gauged in terms of dissonance  (and vice versa).258 In this regard, Frederic’s violent imagery is directly extrapolated  from the nineteenth-century piano duel and its agonistic genealogy: like Apollo vs.  Marsyas, it represents a musical game of life and death. Needless to say, irony abounds in Frederic’s lambasting of “soulless, mass- produced music” and its shameless caricature of Romantic ideals concerning  genius, sensitivity, and performance, a genealogy of which is mapped out in Key  2–3. Even here, however, strange symmetries and resonances emerge between  Chopin’s limning of death both as a historical figure and in his digital afterlives.259  In Giorgio Agamben’s terms, the objects and referents of play constitute “an uto- pian topology of historyland, which has no site except in a signifying difference  between diachrony and synchrony, between aiōn and chronos, between living  and dead, between nature and culture.”260 The plot of Eternal Sonata (2007–09,  Figure 11), a sensorially opulent role-playing game, unfolds within the composer’s  tubercular fantasies as he lies on his death bed; conversely, the monochrome fig- ure of Frederic represents Chopin on the other side of the threshold separating life  from death, inhabiting the realm of the “undead” populated by ghouls, zombies,  and other denizens of digital game-worlds.261 As productions of Chopin’s con- sumption, Frederic and Eternal Sonata represent the senses in which music and  play unfold beyond the limits of history’s temporal flow and yet bear haunting  traces not only of beauty, but also of conflict, entropy, death, and decay. With the keyboards of la musicienne, Baudot, beatmania, and Frederic in mind,  and thus attuned to the temporal transformations that media technologies effect as  well as undergo, we might detect the objections of musical objects to the uncritical  application of biographical or historical narrative as a means of describing their  passage through—and creation of—time.262 The chronological ordering of such  phenomena is, in Ernst’s words, “less about temporal antecedence than about the  techno-epistemological configurations underlying the discursive surface.”263 In  ludomusical terms, we might go further: while these technologies materialize par- ticular epistemological strands and afford specific types of behavior, they are inter- woven with others that reflect distinct aspects of both music and play. Digital games instrumentalize a form of play predicated on the miniaturization  of objects as toys and the concomitant flattening of the past into a single frame  of reference, animated and yet bound by the in(de)finitely iterative cycles of the  </page> <page sequence="51"> Ludomusicality    63 CPU’s clock. But these tendencies are already apparent in the musical technology of  Caus’s barrel. For a grotto in the famous hortus palatinus at  Heidelberg Castle, Caus  designed an elaborate mechanical staging of Apollo’s contest with Pan (Figure 12),  in which the contrasting instrumental means by which each god performs covertly  share the same digital and cylindrical mode of programming.264 This foreshadows  Adorno’s observation that the demotic technology of the barrel organ is associated  with the injection of the banal into the holy: whether its music is heard to issue from  god, man, or beast, and whether its (re)creation relies on the sonic activation of pipe  or string, the barrel remains sublimely indifferent to the provenance and functions  of the information that its rotation processes.265 Perhaps even more telling is Adorno’s construal of the relationship between  a barrel organ and its mighty Baroque counterpart as analogous to that between  a “puppet show and a tragedy.”266 For Caus’s contemporary Markus Sittikus  von Hohenems, archbishop of Salzburg and tenant of the Hellbrunn Palace,  Marsyas’s tragic end became an automated puppet show by way of the techniques  of mechanization described and illustrated by Caus.267 Reenacting the scene rhe- torically conjured by Philostratus the Younger, Sittikus’s knife-wielding Apollo  and tree-bound Marsyas endlessly rehearse and replay the harrowing moments  preceding the latter’s execution (Figure 13 and Video 1).268 Hovering between life  and death in mimetic as well as narrative terms, their repetitive motions ani- mate Apollo’s divine power and Marsyas’s desperate protestations by harnessing  inanimate forces. Despite its Promethean pathos, however, the scene is undercut by the very  technological means that produce it. Mechanized and miniaturized, Apollo and  Marsyas are turned into playthings that, like Chopin in Frederic and Eternal  Sonata, are neither alive nor defunct but rather undead. Like a short-circuiting  digital game or an animated GIF, they are trapped in an infinite loop and thereby  suspended from historical time. For Agamben, the paradoxical effect of such  dehistoricization is to render history all the more vivid: the toy “makes pres- ent and renders tangible human temporality to itself, the pure differential mar- gin between the ‘once’ and the ‘no longer.’ ”269 The value of relating Frederic and  Eternal Sonata to Chopin lies within this differential margin, which can also be  measured by the keyboard as a techno-epistemological configuration capable of  synchronizing the desynchrony between the present and the past. Regardless of  its avowed historical orientation, any performance of Chopin’s music performs an  analogous act of (de)synchronization. Accordingly, the mode of play also allows us to project the differential mar- gin between the “now” and the “yet to be.” In “Chamber Music,” a speculative  essay written in the 1980s, Vilém Flusser imagined playful praxis at keyboards to  encapsulate the archetypal mode of interaction in what he foresaw as the inter- connected, “telematic” society of the future. </page> <page sequence="52"> Figure 12.

The  prevailing state of mind will be reminiscent of the one we experience in our creative  moments, the experience of being out of oneself, of adventure, of orgasm. . . . The basis  for such music-making is an original score, a program, a set of rules.  .  .  . I imagine  these musicians meeting not to read scores but to improvise from a vailable scores, as  was common in the Renaissance. . . . [But such scores] will soon disappear behind the  horizon of musicians who are improvising with continually reprogrammed memo- ries. . . . The recording device is nothing like the work of chamber music (the result  of the work); rather it serves as its memory, which is durable and can be randomly  replayed. . . . Chamber music is pure play, by and for the players, for whom listeners  are superfluous and intrusive. It employs participation (strategy) rather than observa- tion (theory). . . . It is futile to look for the meaning of the information that emerges  in this way anywhere but in the game itself, in the players and the rules they follow.270  Within the confines of this brief thought experiment, Flusser combined and com- pressed the introversive significance and rule-bound premises on which  Kantian  play depends, a Gadamerian acknowledgment of play’s chiastic motion, Csík- szentmihályi’s immersion in the intense pleasure and excitement of ludomusi- cal experience, Foucault’s genealogical sensibility, a Nietzschean consciousness  of play’s ever-emergent nature, and recognition that the generative powers of  memory and recording are recreative as well as reproductive. In certain ways, Flusser’s prophecy of the “chamber music” to come also reca- pitulated Adorno’s bleakly elegiac chapter on the same topic in his Einleitung in  die Musiksoziologie. Like Flusser, Adorno stressed the interaction of players over  the passivity of listeners, invoking the Kantian function of functionlessness in  describing “a production process without an end product. . . . In a double sense,  the players are merely playing.”271 Although Adorno acknowledged the agonis- tic elements of chamber music, its ludic give-and-take was subsumed under the  ideal of “fair play [as] in the old English sports,” ultimately “anticipating a state  in which labor becomes play.”272 As it transpired, however, the reverse happened:  in music as in sport, the noble amateurism of play was either professionalized  or relegated to the nonproductive margins of bourgeois life.273 In the process,  its autotelism was coopted by the pressing demands of both work and leisure,  and the primary connotation of “amateurism” slid from ardent love to rank  incompetence. While Adorno’s gloomy prognostications might have been overdetermined  by historical consciousness, its patina has also dulled the gleam of Flusser’s  imagined future. For the moment, we can choose to focus instead on respond- ing to the playability of the music that surrounds us today, whether conceived  as a reconstruction of a prior event, as a simulation of praxis under a particular  set of historical conditions, or as a simulacrum bearing no particular relation  to the past. From a ludomusicological perspective, all these forms of play forge  connections that enable us to historicize the new and to renovate the old via  </page> <page sequence="54"> 66    key 1 techniques of projection and retrojection. These techniques should be under- stood as supplementary rather than self-sufficient: they can neither supersede  historical investigation nor obviate its attendant responsibilities. But by inter- rogating the qualia of historical events and attempting to reconstruct their ludo- musical logic, they offer the tantalizing prospect—however elusive, illusive, or  delusive it may turn out to be—of bringing the future of the past within range of  twenty-first-century sensoria. </page> </plain_text>
