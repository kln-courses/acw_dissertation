LIPNER Lecturer in Divinity, University of Cambridge THE WORLD AS GOD'S 'BODY': IN PURSUIT OF DIALOGUE WITH RAMANUJA In this essay I propose to offer some observations in due course on how Christian thought and practice in general (though some reference will be made to the Indian context) might profit from a central theme in the theology of Ramanuja, a Tamil Vaisnava Brahmin whose traditional date straddles the eleventh and twelfth centuries of the Christian era.1 The central theme I have in mind is expressed in Ramanuja's view that the 'world' is the 'body' of Brahman or God.2 We shall go on to explain what this means, but let me state first that my overall aim is to further inter-religious understanding, especially between Christian and Hindu points of view. In professing a concern for inter-religious dialogue I know that I reflect a longstanding interest of Professor H. D. Lewis. I shall seek to show that the Christian religion can profit both from the content and the method of Ramanuja's body-of-God theology. To this end this essay is divided into two sections. Section I is the longer: it contains an analysis of what Ramanuja did (and did not) mean by his body-of-God theme3 - doubtless unfamiliar ground for most of the readers of this essay - and serves as a propaedeutic for what follows in section 2. In section 2 I shall attempt to 'extrapolate' Ramanuja's thinking into a Christian context, with dialogue in mind. Section 2 cannot be appreciated for the promise I hope it holds out without the (sometimes involved) detail of the first section. We start with the observation that Ramanuja's theology affirms an abiding monotheism-cum-ontological-dualism.4 His God has an essential nature or proper form ('svarupa')5 defined by the five characteristics of being (satya), 1 For a summary of Ramanuja's life and for discussion on his date cf. The Theology of Ramanuja byJ. B. Carman (New Haven and London, I974), ch. 2. 2 In this article 'God' is used as a descriptive term for the supreme being. 3 This article contains the substance of a fuller discussion in my forthcoming book on Ramanuja, The Face of Truth, to be published by Macmillan. 4 In Hindu thought at least, a monotheist need not be a convinced ontological dualist. gamkara, for example, espoused a theism which was to be sublated ultimately in an uncompromising non-dualism. 5 Svarfipa: lit., the form proper to an entity qua that entity.</page><page sequence="2">146 J. J. LIPNER knowledge (jiana), bliss (ananda), infinitude (anantatva) and purity (amalatva), and characterized also by a host of non-defining qualities which for the most part' make up the catalogue the monotheist ascribes to his God in general. The Lord produces and sustains the real and lasting finite order - for all practical purposes this world comprising conscious and non-conscious being (cidacidvastu) - by his omniscience and omnipotence. There is much more we can say in this regard2 but this is not to our purpose here. We are concerned with the fact that Ramanuja goes on to maintain that the world is Brahman's (the Lord's) body, and that this assertion dominates the way he theologises. Clearly a great deal depends on what Ramanuja means by 'body'. Let us deal with this first and then comment on what is meant by 'world'. To begin with what are the main sources of our theologian's body-of-God language? They seem to be twofold: scriptural and sectarian. As to the former, Ramanuja quotes both from the canonical scriptures (the s'ruti) and those texts (the smrti) putatively backing up the s'ruti, in support of his view, but undoubtedly the most important for his purposes were s'ruti texts, especially from the seventh section of the Brhadaranyaka Upanisad's third chapter. There it is said, for example: 'He who dwells in all beings, who is within all beings, whom all beings do not know, of whom all beings are the body, who controls all beings from within, he is your Self, the inner Controller, the immortal One...'.3 Though such scriptural backing was more important than sectarian support for Ramanuja's aim of making as universally respectable a case as possible for his position in the orthodox Hindu religious world of his time, it seems clear that hints for a body-of-God theology were present in the thought at least of his acarya (rather than guru) predecessor, Yamuna.4 In any case, Ramanuja was not theologising in a vacuum. He was certainly not keen to give the impression that he was 'doing theology in an original way', without obvious support from both scripture and an established interpretative tradition of the sacred texts, for he functioned in an orthodox thought-world which demanded the credentials of a socially respectable teaching pedigree in the study of the scriptures before it would even listen to what he had to say. It is mainly in his great work the Sri Bhasya, his chief commentary on the I The exception arises through Ramanuja's ascribing to the Lord a supernal, anthropomorphic form, constituted of a sui-generis substance that is not material. Contemplation of and association with this divine form, which possesses corporeal qualities like charm, beauty, pleasing proportions, etc., is part of the blissful experience of liberation. Of course, the Lord's divine form does not exhaust his divine nature nor is it to be identified with the essential core of his being (defined by the five characteristics mentioned earlier). 2 Detailed discussions about the divine nature and divine causality will be found in my forthcoming book. 3 III. 7.

The discussion is conducted in the traditional Hindu way of presenting one's case through a process of argument and counter-argument, objection and answer, till what one regards is the right conclusion (the siddhanta) is finally reached, secure from further challenge, in the eyes of its presenter at least, by virtue of its successful dialectic passage. Now surely, argues the opponent, the world cannot be the body of Brahman, for is not a body 'the locus of the senses which are the means for experiencing the pleasure and pain that are the fruit of (one's) karma, (a locus) which supports and yet depends upon the five modifications of breath and which is a special aggregate of the elements earth, etc.'?2 Surely the supreme being, perfect, and transcending as it does the world of materiality, karma and rebirth, cannot have such a body? In answer, Ramanuja rejects this understanding of 'body' as too narrow. We must operate with a meaning of 'body', he contends, that takes account of the range of literal uses of the term in sacred and ordinary (Hindu) parlance. Thus the opponent's definition of 'body' does not take account of the avataric bodies of the Lord which are not made of ordinary elemental matter; nor does it apply to the bodies of plants which lack the fivefold breath, nor to the bodies of wood and stone of Ahalya and other (folkloric) figures, which were not the abode of sense-organs. In fact, says Ramanuja, giving his own definition of 'body', 'Any substance of a conscious being which can entirely be controlled and supported by that being for the latter's own purposes, and whose proper form is solely to be the accessory of that being, is the "body" of that being '.3 The following points are worth noting. First, Ramanuja claims to have exposed the basic literal sense of 'body', one shorn of any accidental surplus of meaning (in contrast to what the opponent has done in his definition). This enables him to affirm as we shall see that created being is literally - not metaphorically - Brahman's body, yet not in any obvious sense.4 Second, 'body' in the sense described can be predicated of a substance related only to a conscious entity, that is, in fact to the atman or spiritual principle, which in the case of a spirit-mattSr composite is the immortal centre or 'self' of that ' Especially under iI.

LIPNER composite.' In other words, the 'ensouler-body' relation in our specialized context is an asymmetrical one in which the self or atman is the dominant term. Finally, the concept of 'body' so defined prescinds from whether its referent is spiritual or material. Any substance, spiritual or material, which is related to a self in the way described is that self s 'body'. This makes it possible not only for material substances but also for spiritual substances, i.e. finite atmans, to be the 'body' of the infinite, supreme Self or Atman. At this juncture we can comment on the meaning of 'world' in the statenent: 'the world is Brahman's body'. Ramanuja has not addressed this question explicitly, but it is not difficult to understand what he means by the term. In the first place, 'world' must not be understood in the sense of some sort of 'system' (open or closed). The sense of an organized inter-relation of discrete parts central to the word 'system' is absent from Ramanuja's usage of 'world' that we are considering. He is using 'world' simply in the sense of' aggregate of finite conscious and non-conscious beings (cidacidvastujata), especially of such beings in their empirically manifest (prapafica) form'. Thus 'world (jagat)' here becomes no more than a collective term, a convenient short-hand, for finite individual substantival (conscious and non-conscious) entities or aggregates of such entities, and Ramanuja is as prone (if not more so) to refer to such individuals as the 'body' of Brahman as he is to the whole collection. This cuts at the root any objection made against the body-of-God idea analogous to those made by A. Farrer, for example, against the anima-mundi doctrine of the ancient western world, a doctrine Farrer assumes is based on regarding the world as some kind of organic system.2 This also makes it quite inappropriate to refer, as some modern commentators have done, to the relationship between Brahman and the world as his 'body', as organic. There is nothing 'organic' in the usual sense about this relationship. Returning now to the basic sense of' body' expressed by Ramanuja earlier, this is how he describes the general relationship between the atman as ' ensouler' and its 'body': This is the relation between the self (atman) and its body (in the sense we are considering): the relation between support and thing-supported such that the latter is incapable of being realized apart from the former, that between controller and thing-controlled, and that between principal and its accessory. The atman - from ' In Vedantic philosophical anthropology, the human individual is a composite of spiritual atman, whose nature it is to be conscious, and material body (essentially insentient). Though Ramanuja, in common with other Vedantins, maintained that all living things (including plants) were composites of a material body and an atman (whose uniform conscious nature in sub-human forms of life could not for one reason or other be expressed fully), it is clear that he regarded the human composite as the (qualitatively distinct) paradigm of the empirical union of spirit and matter, a paradigm we shall adhere to in this essay. 2 See chapter Io, i.e. 'Anima Mundi' in A. Farrer's Faith and Speculation (Adam &amp; Charles Black, London, I967).</page><page sequence="5">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY I49 'apnoti' (namely 'it obtains') -is that which in every respect is the support, controller and principal of what is the thing-supported, controlled, and the accessory, viz. the 'body' or form which exists as a mode (of the mode-possessor, i.e. the atman), incapable of being realized apart (from the latter). Now this is the relation between the (finite) individual self and its own (material) body. Thus because the supreme Self is embodied (in the way described) by everything, it is expressed by every (type-naming) word.' As is indicated by this passage towards the end, Ramanuja maintains that the 'body-ensouler' relationship is instantiated microcosmically, as it were, between the finite atman and its material body2 and obtains macrocosmically between Brahman and the world/its individual entities. Though we shall be chiefly concerned with the latter application of this relationship in this essay, we shall see that the former, i.e. the microcosmic application has an important part to play in our appreciation of Ramanuja's theological method. Before we go on to examine this complex self-body model,3 in terms of whose constituent relationships macrocosmically and microcosmically applied, Ramanuja, in fact, understands the interplay between the One and the many, let me state that in the following discussion, unless their meaning is clear, I shall refer to the ensouling-self of the self-body model as the selfm, and to its 'body' as the body,. Now as Ramanuja describes it, the self-body model contains three constituent sub-models each with its own central relationship. To consider each briefly in turn. (i) The support/thing-supported (adhara/adheya) relationship The operative expression explaining this relationship, as the quotation above informs us, is 'incapable of being realized apart from' (in Sanskrit, prthak siddhy-anarha) or PSA for short. In other words, in the context of the self body model, the thing-supported (adheya) is related to its support (adhara) in such a way that the former is 'incapable of being realized apart from' the latter. What exactly does this mean? To explain we must have recourse to two related concepts Ramanuja makes use of, namely those of the 'mode (prakara) ' and of its correlate the 'mode-possessor (prakarin) '. The reference above also informs us that to be a bodym is to be a 'mode', and then goes 1 ayam eva catmasarirabhivah prthaksiddhyanarhadharadheyabhavo niyantrniyamyab havah sesa 9eqibhava9 ca. sarvatmanadharataya niyantrtay5se9itaya ca - apnotity atma sarvatmanadheyataya niyamyataya sesataya ca - aprthaksiddharp prakarabhuitam ity akarah sariram iti cocyate. evam eva hi jivatmanal svasarrasarpbandhah. evam eva paramatmanah sarvasariratvena sarvasabdavacyatvam. From another important work by Ramanuja, the Vedirthasarpgraha, in J. A. B. van Buitenen's edition (Poona, 1956), paragraph 76, p. I14 (this edition also has an English annotated translation). The expression 'expressed by every (type-naming) word' refers to Ramanuja's theory of divine denotative predication which cannot be dealt with here. 2 Not, of course, in so far as the material body is made of matter, or has a distinctive shape, or functions in its characteristic biological ways, etc., but in so far as the material body is related to its atman in the technical sense described in n. i, above. 3 ' Model' is to be understood in the sense of a conceptual structure or framework in terms of which a complex, multifaceted reality can be opened up to the understanding.</page><page sequence="6">I50 J. J. LIPNER on to affirm that the relationship between mode and mode-possessor is of the PSA kind. Thus we can get a good idea of what the PSA relation is between support and thing-supported on the basis of what is meant by it between the mode and the mode-possessor. In fact Ramanuja offers an explanation of the PSA expression in terms of the relation between the latter pair. Now in this context, there are two nuances to Ramanuja's understanding of the PSA expression. One is ontological (a), the other (b) is epistemological. (a) Consider the following quotation: In the case of things like generic characteristics, because they are the mode of an entity in that they express the generic configuration (of that entity) - here the mode (viz. the generic characteristic) and the mode-possessor (viz. the individual entity) are different kinds of being - the mode is incapable of being realized apart from (the mode-possessor) and indeed of being rendered intelligible apart from (the latter).' Ramanuja is here considering the modal dependence of such things as generic or class characteristics on the individual entities instantiating them. Ortologically speaking, for him a class characteristic (jati, e.g. 'cowness') cannot exist in abstracto as it were; it is realized in and through the individual (cows). The same point can be made for properties (gunas) such as 'white', 'brown' and so on. Modes such as properties and class characteristics essentially have a borrowed being: they exist as the things they are by inhering in their ontological supports.2 That is, in being they 'are incapable of being realised apart from' their ontological supports. This sort of ontological dependence obtains between the support and the thing-supported in the context of the self-body model. Where the support is the finite atman and the thing-supported its material body, the ontological (modal) dependence of latter on former is not absolute. No doubt the body needs its atman to subsist as an organic entity, and, as Ramanuja points out, at death, that is, upon being separated from the atman, it disintegrates and ceases to be a body. Nevertheless the finite atman is not the bestower of being to its body in the absolute sense: it has no power to originate its body existentially or to stave off biological death permanently. In the case of Brahman as ontological support, however, and the world (or individual substantival entities considered separately) as thing-supported, Brahman is, absolutely speaking, the bestower and mainstay of being. Finite being is his totally dependent mode. Well then, one may ask, if finite being has a totally dependent, that is, derived being, does not the spectre of the world's being, in the final analysis, an illusion arise? After all, that is what the Advaitins maintained. Ramanuja emphatically rejects this point of view: the world does have a substantival reality, he affirms, a reality which cannot 1 jatyader vastusamsthanataya vastunah prakaratvat prakaraprakarinos ca padarthantaratvam prakarasya prthaksiddhyanarhatvarp prthaganupalambhas ca.... VedS., para. 62, p. I07. 2 For Ramanuja class characteristics and qualities were things with a tenuous reality-status.</page><page sequence="7">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY 151 be sublated in terms of a 'higher' experience. How Ramanuja tackles the demand to reconcile the total derivativeness of the world's being with its substantival reality is a question we will take up when considering his method. (b) Besides making an ontological point, the quotation on page I 50 makes also an epistemological point. This is to be found in the last phrase of the quotation. There it is said that the mode depends on the mode-possessor for its intelligibility. In other words, the mode-possessor (the prakarin) provides the mode's raison d'etre. This is clear enough if we inspect the sort of relationship which exists between class characteristic and instantiating individual, but it also explains the otherwise puzzling phenomenon of Ramanuja's willingness to refer to substantival entities as modes. Ramanuja allows that such substances as ear-rings and staffs are to be reckoned as modes even though, unlike class characteristics and properties, they are capable of existing apart from their mode-possessor (viz. the ear-ring wearer and staff-bearer). If the PSA expression had no more than an existential import we could not explain the modal nature of substantival things like staffs and ear-rings. In fact, in the case of the relationship between the staff and its bearer, for instance, Ramanuja is adverting mainly to the epistemological nuance of the PSA expression when he says that this relationship is modal. In other words, though qua substance the staff has an independent existence, qua staff it has no reason for existing, no intelligibility, apart from the staff-bearer. Staffs and ear-rings are to be understood for what they are only in relation to staff-bearer and ear-ring wearer respectively. They exist for the sake of the latter and as such are modes of the latter. The movement to grasp their intelligibility is in one direction only. Thus it does not matter really whether the mode in general is a substance or not; for something to be a mode it must either be essentially incapable ofexisting apart from the mode-possessor or be unintelligible as the sort of thing it is apart from the mode-possessor, or both. This is what Ramanuja is intimating that the PSA expression says with respect to the kind of relationship that obtains between mode and mode-possessor; further he is implying that both the ontological and the epistemological nuances as described above apply in the PSA relation between support and thing-supported (the former's mode) in the context of the self-body model. This is why we have translated 'prthak-siddhy-anarha' by 'incapable of being realized apart from', where 'realized' is intended to bear both the ontological ('real-ized') and the epistemological ('realized') nuances. In other words Ramanuja is saying that the thing-supported in so far as it is the body, of its support cannot in essence exist apart from the latter (its selfm) nor be understood for what it is apart from the latter. That is, the selfm 'supports' its bodym (relatively or absolutely) both existentially and intelligibly. Applying the self-body model microcosmically under this heading from the epistemological point of view, the finite material body, according to</page><page sequence="8">I52 J. J. LIPNER Ramanuja, is unintelligible for what it is (i.e. this organic body and of this sort) apart from the atman. It derives its raison d'etre from the latter and exists to serve the purposes - in the final resort, liberation - of the latter. But the material body's dependence on the atman in this way is not absolute. The finite atman cannot supply the body's raison d'etre in its fullness, for the finite atman itself is not its own raison d'etre. For this side of the picture we must look to the macrocosmic application of the self-body model in this context. Here Brahman is the epistemological support of the world, his bodym - the ultimate principle of its intelligibility. In other words the world exists to serve Brahman's purposes (purposes neither extrinsically nor intrinsically necessary to Brahman, we might add). Speaking particularly, Brahman supplies the ultimate raison d'etre of the finite atmanic composite, which exists for Brahman's ends. Once more a question assails us: if the finite atman derives its intelligibility from the supreme being alone, has it no import of its own in terms of which we can make sense of the material world? Is there no real meaning to our saying that the material world has intelligibility in terms of the finite atman's ends? Ramanuja would want to answer in the affirmative. Again, the way he goes about holding together the apparently conflicting insights of Brahman being the ultimate principle of intelligibility of everything and of the individual atman being a real bestower of meaning in its own right to the material world, we will take up when dealing with Ramanuja's method. (2) The controller/thing-controlled (n'yantr/n'ydmyal) relationship To begin with, the terminology here stresses the personal nature of the dominant term, i.e. the selfm, of the self-body model. But what sort of 'control' is being implied? It is significant that the Sanskrit term 'niyantr' which we have translated by 'controller' can be used in the sense of 'charioteer' (cf., e.g. Maitri Upanisad 11.6). This gives us a clue to the relationship intended by Ramanuja under this heading. Just as the charioteer guides and directs his horses along the path, and restrains them if wayward, so the selfm should act as guide to its bodym, leading it to its true end and checking it if wayward. If the bodym is a conscious principle this controlling must respect, in moral actions, the free will of the latter; if the bodym is not a conscious principle, or involuntary actions are being considered, the selfm is empowered to take full control to bring about its own acceptable ends. In any case the selfm as controller is presumed to have the knowledge and will to achieve its ends. Macrocosmically considered, Brahman, the supreme Lord, is the controller of the world (or its individual substantival components), the thing-controlled. The Lord through his omniscience and omnipotence, guides and directs 1 By rights, Sanskrit grammar demands 'niyamya' but all the best authorities have 'niyamya'.</page><page sequence="9">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY I53 conscious and non-conscious beings to their destiny, their true fulfillment. Part of the general terminology of this sub-model is Ramanuja's frequent description of the Lord as the 'inner controller (antaryamin) ' of finite being. Where conscious agents are concerned, the Lord guides and directs through the scriptures, through grace in genuine religious experience in private and social life, and last but not least through the power of the agent's karma which sets up the general options-for-living for the agent. Where the non-conscious world is concerned, by considering the accumulated and unmatured karma of all conscious beings of a previous world (for Vedantins like Ramanuja believed in the periodic dissolution and production of the world by the Lord - the non-liberated souls remaining in a sort of suspended animation in the intervening period), the Lord determines the sort of world each new world is to be with its natural laws and relationships. Thus the Lord exercises his control over the world. We must note that where the bodym of the Lord is a system of some kind, part of the controlling process consists in harmonising so far as this is possible in the context of the natural conditions of the universe and of the co-operation of man, the various inter-related components of that system. This feature of the controlling process takes account of a meaning of 'yam' (the verbal root from which 'niyantr' (i.e. 'controller') is got) prevalent in that seminal religious text for all Vedantins (Ramanuja included), the Bhagavadgita, in connection with the atman's integrating and harmonising of its body and bodily components. From the microcosmic point of view, the controller is the individual atman and the thing-controlled its natural (healthy) body. It is common experience that the individual self controls the body for its own ends. For the good soul, however, these ends should be in accord with the legitimate goals and methods of the sacred texts, and in any case subordinate to the highest goal of man - liberation from this world of rebirth. Ramanuja is keen to acknowledge a core of moral autonomy for the finite atman, so that it is a 'controller' - a determiner of its destiny - in the true sense. Does not this acknowledgement clash with the claim that the Lord is universal controller of the whole world, of conscious and non-conscious being alike, which Ramanuja, in traditional theist fashion, is prepared to make? We shall take this question up in due course. (3) The principal (sesin)/accessory (sesa) relationship Ramanuja says: 'This is, in all cases, the relation between principal and accessory: the accessory is that whose nature it is to be given over to the tendency to render due glory to another; that other is the principal.'I If under the epistemological aspect of the support/thing-supported relationship we 1 ayam eva hi sarvatra s'qas'qibhdvah. paragatatisayadhanecchayopadeyatvam eva yasya svaruiparp sa gepah parah gell. VedS., para. I 2 1, p. 15I.</page><page sequence="10">154 J. J. LIPNER can say that the bodym exists to serve the natural or (in Brahman's case) self-determined purposes of the selfm, here we can say that the very purpose for existing, as it were, of the bodym as accessory to its selfm as principal, is to glorify - to proclaim the importance and superiority of- the latter. This the accessory does, if it is a person, by appropriate forms of subservience to its principal and by conforming to the latter's will. So far as non-conscious being is concerned, the accessory renders glory by just being what it is, always presuming, of course, that there is conscious being present to appreciate this. Again, from the macrocosmic viewpoint, Brahman is the principal of all finite being, his accessory. And finite being exists to render due glory to its Lord, either by being what it is or by that worship of life and thought which fashions more and more in the devotee a 'holy will' in total conformity to the Lord's. In this way of speaking, that is, in terms of the Lord's being principal and of finite being acting as his accessory, nothing can be said to accrue to the Lord; the purpose of the accessory is fulfilled if the Principal is duly allowed to be magnified for the sort of being it is by the accessory's recognition of the sort of being it is. In other words, the Lord is aknowledged to be the focus, fulfillment, crown and source of value of the world. But there is a microcosmic application of the principal/accessory relation ship. In this case, the individual atman is the principal of its accessory, the material body. The material body is meant to 'set off' the jewel that is its inner spirit. And the material body does this by its beauty, its prowess, its various capacities, its subservience to the atman. Further, in so far as the whole inanimate world can be regarded as an 'extension' of the (human) atmanic composite - for it is the human atmanic composite that best encapsulates in this world the principal/accessory relationship - by function ing as the extended bodym of the finite atman (its selfm), the human person becomes the summit of visible creation. This means that the human person in and through its spiritual principle, its atman, is not only the bestower of meaning to the world in a real sense, but is also the material world's value-giver; more, that it is in some way the seat of value, that it is an end-in-itself. Well then, we may remark, there seems to be a problem here. How can we say, in one breath as it were, that the Lord is the ultimate 'principal' of creation, the finite atman existing solely to magnify the Lord as his accessory, and that the individual atman itself is an end-in-itself, a value bestower in its own right in this world? This question, like the others, will be dealt with presently as we go on to consider Ramanuja's theological method. We have completed our review of what Ramanuja means by the self-body relationship so central to his thinking. We shall now be able to appreciate how central it is by examining his theological method. We start with the observation that Ramanuja himself has nowhere explained his method in the</page><page sequence="11">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY I55 way we propose to do. This is why his theology is so hard to interpret as a conceptual system, viz. a coherent and articulate ordering of a great many ideas so as to produce a comprehensive vision of reality in the light of the Transcendent. And there can be no doubt that Ramanuja intended his thinking to be 'systematic'. We propose to interpret his method by the use of an 'imaginative construct' which we think incorporates all the significant elements of his thinking and which in fact pivots around what is admittedly for Ramanuja central for his theology: the self-body model. Because of the limitations of space we shall not be able to show here how all the noteworthy facets of his thinking fit into the model as we have interpreted it. As noted before the fuller study has been attempted elsewhere. But I hope enough will be done to indicate how the self-body model comprehends the more salient features of Ramanuja's thought systematically. To begin with, Ramanuja's focal insight and concern with respect to the relationship between God and the world is that this relationship is one of 'identity-in-difference '.1 He articulates this relationship distinctively in terms of his self-body model. And to do this his method consists in the identifying and then the holding together of a system of polarities. In other words it is this 'system of polarities' which finds expression in the self-body model comprising as it does its three sub-models or component relationships which themselves have, as we have seen, a two-tiered application: in microcosm to the finite atman and its bodym, and in macrocosm to Brahman and his bodym. It is through the interplay and the inter-relationships of the various polarities of this complex two-tiered structure that the range and depth of Ramanuja's theology are expressed. By 'polarity' here I mean a more or less stable tension between two (sometimes more) poles such that this tension is resolvable into two mutually opposing but synchronous tendencies. One tendency is 'centripetal' whereby the poles are attracted to each other; the other is 'centrifugal' keeping the poles apart. Each tendency by itself is destructive of the polarity as a whole, but as simultaneously corrective of each other the tendencies work towards preserving the dynamic equilibrium of the system. The centripetal and centrifugal tendencies comprising a polarity can each be articulated in terms of a distinctive but complementary (to each other) mode of discourse. Each polarity itself is translatable into its own appropriate and more or less self-contained pattern of speech which ultimately, through a set of' universal ising factors', must be integrated into the universe of discourse of the polarity-system as a whole. All this sounds very complicated but we can explain what we mean by Ramanuja's 'polarity-theology' by illustrating how it works. This can conveniently be done under each of the component headings of the self-body model. I This is the point of his theology as 'vigii dvaita' as it later came to be called, namely the non-duality of differenced being.</page><page sequence="12">156 J. J. LIPNER (a) The support/thing-supported relationship. Under this heading, in its macro cosmic application, Ramanuja's understanding of Brahman's originative causality with respect to the world finds expression. To understand the polarity-method in this context, we must first consider briefly what Ramanuja's position is on Brahman as 'originative cause'. In this respect Ramanuja regarded Brahman as being, at the same time, the 'substrative cause (upadana karana)' and the 'efficient cause (nimitta karana)' of finite being. Let us look at each type of divine causality in turn. Now Ramanuja (and the other Vedantins) would find quite unsatisfactory a doctrine of 'creatio', i.e. the production of the world by God out of nothingness, such as has traditionally been held in Christianity. To hold such a belief would do scant justice to those scriptural texts and images (and to the living religious experience encapsulated by them) which point to Brahman as the very ground of being, as the source from which finite reality emerges, in which it subsists, and into which it is finally re-absorbed.1 Ramanuja wanted no ontological, 'creational' gap between the infinite source of being and its finite effects. It was in the concept of the 'substrative cause' that he, like other Vedantins, found what he was looking for. The substrative cause is that out of which the effect is produced. A well-known empirical example for the Vedantins was the clay out of which the clay pot (the effect) was produced. From the point of view of the world's existence, Brahman is the substrative cause of the world. The world is produced out of him, continues to subsist in him, and is finally re-funded into him. In this way Brahman 'supports' the world, the thing-supported, which 'cannot be realized apart from' him. Indeed, to preserve this insight, Ramanuja is prepared to talk of Brahman in his creative aspect as the 'causal Brahman' and of the produced world as the 'effected Brahman'.2 Now this way of talking can be said to be 'centripetal' in that it tends to collapse the Brahman-pole and the world-pole into each other by its 'kenotic' emphasis; that is, it empties out, as it were, Brahman's reality into the world, identifying the reality of the cause too closely with that of the effect. By seeking to do justice to the utter derivativeness of the world's being, it threatens the transcendence of that being's originative cause. Now Ramanuja (and his colleagues) were well aware of this threat to their God. As a corrective they spoke of Brahman also as the efficient cause of the world. The efficient cause is that cause which, being different from its effects, initiates and sustains the action which brings them into being. In our empirical example, the potter is the efficient cause of the clay pot(s).3 For Ramanuja Brahman was also the efficient cause of produced being and as such was not to be identified with finite being. Brahman's initiating causal 1 See, e.g., Taittiriya Upanisad III. I. I for an important sruti reference encapsulating this idea. 2 Cf., e.g. the discussion under ShBh. I. 4. 23, p. 386, Ii. i8-22; Th., p. 399. 3 In empirical experience the efficient cause is numerically distinct from the substrative cause. In Brahman's case Ramanuja was keen to identify the two.</page><page sequence="13">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY 157 action was sovereign (that is, it was intrinsically and extrinsically unnecessi tated) and in need of no accessory causal agency of any kind. Such causality was 'supportive' of finite being in that without it finite being could not be 'realised', could not be translated from potency to act. Now to talk of Brahman as the world's efficient cause could be regarded as talking ' centrifugally' since, in so far as the efficient cause is different from its effect, the Brahman-pole and the world-pole are sought to be kept apart. The way is thus open for Brahman's supreme transcendence to be preserved. Thus here we have within one and the same context of divine originative causality, a polarity expressed in terms of two modes of discourse: a ' centripetal' one and a 'centrifugal' one. The centripetal mode of discourse emphasises Brahman's identity with the world, the centrifugal way of speaking his difference from the world. Neither mode of discourse within the polarity is sought to be eventually done away with, as for example, Samkara did. gamkara also accepted that Brahman was the world's substrative as well as efficient cause - but only from the point of view of the conditioned Brahman (i.e. the saguna Brahman), Brahman viewed through the illusory spectacles of duality. From the final standpoint there is no ground for polarity discourse since there is but one reality (the nirguna Brahman) - non-dual, relationless and ineffable. Ramanuja on the contrary affirmed the permanent value of polarity-discourse in theology. In fact, it is distinctive of his theological method to identify, on the basis of an equal hermeneutic status given to all kinds of scriptural texts (dualist, non-dualist etc.) and the religious experience grounded on these, a range of polarities and to use their (mutually) counterbalancing modes of discourse, within the general framework of the self-body model, to articulate and comprehend the unique sort of identity-in-difference he sought to preserve between his God and the world. Thus though describing Brahman as substrative and efficient cause is not distinctive to his system (we have seen that Samkara also speaks thus - though in a limited way), to identify it as a polarity is distinctive, the more so when we consider that under this heading Ramfiuja works out a number of other polarities which we cannot mention here. There is a further corrective he applies, by his distinctive method of shifting our perspectives on Brahman and the world, to counterbalance the polarity of Brahman's originative causality which after all on the whole does emphasize the utter derivativeness, the non-substantival nature, of the world's reality. This takes account of the 'second-tier' of the self-body model, viz. the supportive relationship pertaining to the individual atman as the selfm of its material body. From this point of view we experience ineluctably our non-sublatable substantival reality in and through the relationship we have with our bodies (this Ramanuja seeks to establish by an analysis of conscious and other 'embodied' experience). To come back then to a question raised earlier, one's individual reality is not swallowed up by and in that ofBrahman.</page><page sequence="14">I58 J. J. LIPNER (b) The controller/thing-controlled relationship. Here too a polarity is to be discerned. From the theological point of view this sub-model has as its dominant idea the Lord's absolute control over the world, and his guiding it to its true destiny. A chief way of doing this is by his considering the unmatured karma of the previous world(s) and by his fashioning the world-to-be accordingly. This engenders a mode of discourse fully alerted to the sovereign, unthwartable will of the Lord. The world is in danger of being viewed as a pre-determined series of events, and human persons, the true representatives of this world, run the risk of being evacuated of any moral autonomy (in the context of a deterministic Calvinist-type ethic). The tendency in this perspective is centripetal in that no room is left for genuine chance, contingency and (moral) freedom in the world - the world has no 'character' of its own in the face of the Lord's absolute sovereignty. As a corrective Ramanuja espouses a centrifugal mode of discourse in which divine grace and divine 'incarnational' descents come into play. This way of speaking implies moral and physical freedom on the part of finite agents to resppnd to the Lord's love in human love (cf. the role of bhakti). A polar opposition between the Lord and the world is thus set up, with all the language, imagery and behaviour that this implies. Again, both (centripetal and centrifugal) modes of theological grammar are to be held together in the life of the devotee, each with a validity in its own right. Again, another facet of the identity-in-difference relation between God and the world is being proclaimed by Ramanuja. A further corrective to the centripetal tendency comes from regarding the self-body model under this heading in its microcosmic aspect. Here the individual self experiences its genuine moral and physical freedom in its (albeit limited) control over its material body (which is its bodym). The autonomy of the human self is not swamped by God's absolute, universal causality. (c) The principal/accessory relationship. Speaking macrocosmically, the centri petal force is supplied by the insight (and its grammar) of the Lord being the supreme End, Focus and Value of creation, and of the world, conscious beings included, existing solely to glorify him.' And which student of religion can deny that the literature of all the great theistic religions is replete with this insight? 'God is everything, we are nothing; He must become greater and greater, we less and less'. The problem here is that if such talk is taken to its logical extreme, man ceases to have any intrinsic value and becomes a mere means, not only in relationships where human beings are concerned, but in relationship with God too. And this Ramanuja rejects. The corrective, i.e., the centrifugal mode of discourse is supplied by the 1 Often enough, especially in his commentary on the Bhagavadgita, a commentary that is more devotional than philosophical, Ramanuja states that it is the self's sole function/essence/delight to be the Lord's accessory. Cf., e.g. his comments under Gita 7. I9.</page><page sequence="15">THE WORLD AS GOD 5S BODY 159 self-body model here in its microcosmic application. In the finite atman's relation to its bodym (i.e. its material body) the former knows and is assured of its intrinsic spiritual value qua atman, a knowledge first derived from the scriptures but then experienced in union with the Lord. The atmanic composite as an end-in-itself cannot be treated as a mere means, even by God himself. For Ramanuja the rationale underlying this affirmation is derived from his view that we participate most directly in Brahman in and through our atmans; we share his basic spiritual nature in a relation ofidentity-in-difference whereby we are his bodiesm and he our selfm. We can conclude this brief treatment of the way Ramanuja's polarity theology works with the observation that the whole system is bound together in the first place by the two over-arching terms/concepts i.e. 'self' (or 'ensouler', namely sarlirin) and 'body' (s'arlira) and then by the somewhat less universal ideas and language contained in the three submodels, applied macrocosmically and microcosmically. Through these more and less universal 'stepping-stones' of ideas/terms connecting resonances are set up between particular polarities along which the mind can move freely integrating the whole. We can now pass on to the next section. II In this section we shall comment briefly on how Christian thought and practice might profit from the content and method of Ramanuja's body-of God theology. I am assuming that there is no need to justify the desirability, indeed the need, for Christian dialogue with non-Christian religions, Hinduism included.' Since space is short, it will be convenient to make our observations in the form of points. (i) I submit that it would be theologically fertile, both conceptually and devotionally, for Christians to regard the world, and its individual components, as God's body. No doubt in the theological articulation and development of this idea, certain aspects of ' body' would have to be eschewed (e.g. the term's explicit organic connotation) but other aspects, bolstered by an appropriate imagery, e.g. the great intimacy between spirit and body, the bodily indwelling by its spirit, the sense of mutual belongingness between the two, applied theologically, could be liturgically evocative and devotionally sustaining. After all, in Christian tradition there is a precedent of a kind for 'body-talk' in a divine context, in the doctrine of the 'mystical body' (especially in traditional Roman Catholic theology). The New Testament epistles also are not afraid to use body-imagery in connection with the faithful's relationship to Christ. 1 I have indicated the outlines of a justification of this kind in my article 'Through a prism brightly' in Vidyajyoti, (April I980) (from Vidyajyoti, Institute of Religious Studies, 23 Raj Niwas Marg, Delhi 110054).</page><page sequence="16">i6o J. J. LIPNER Further, Ramanuja's body-of-God theology, in its very choice of the 'body' term (i.e. ' sarlira') looks positively on the world of materiality. In the main, Christians have tended to reflect this positive outlook, but Ramanuja's articulation introduces a much-needed note of radical ambiguity to the 'body' idea. Though in its microcosmic application the self-body relation is intended to be a benign one - the bodym furthering the ends of its selfm and in the process coming to fulfillment - theoretically the relationship remains an open one in that the bodym (really, in this context, one's material body, but by extension, the material world) may 'rebel' (in terms of natural opaqueness/resistance to technological control or penetration, through sickness, disease etc. and even death) and thwart the true goal(s) of its selfm. Matter, thus, even in its most intimate associations with man, has a feature of inherent 'explosiveness' which is potentially dangerous to man. As a result, matter has to be understood, by its selfm, for what it is and what it can do - its 'co-operation' has to be sought. Allied to this insight is a much-needed corrective for the western world especially (but also for the east which is beginning to ape the west here), in connection with its Nature-exploitative and anti-Ecological ethos derived from Genesis I: 26-30. We subdue and dominate, rather than co-operate with, our bodiesm at our peril, as we are beginning to discover. Much of all this has special relevance for the future Church in India. The Indian Church in the past has sought no rootage, theologically, devotionally or liturgically, in the local Hindu tradition, 'great' and 'small' (though positive strides in this regard are now being taken especially in Roman Catholic circles). As a result, for the most part, the Church is regarded (and this is now being recognised as a feature of its self-image) as an alien in what should by now be its home. I suggest that Ramanuja's body-of-God theme provides a rich source, in the ways indicated, for the Indian Church's 'inculturation'. It would be all the more possible, in its Indian context, for the Church to make use in its liturgy and devotional practice of appropriate images and language from this theme. (2) Looking at, now, the more particular aspects of the self-body model under its three component headings there is clearly much food for dialogic thought. The stress on the utter derivativeness of the world from God, both as to existence and intelligibility (distinctively through the notion of the 'substrative cause'), the insight into the Lord as absolute controller of world and individual, and the emphasis on the Lord's being the crowning glory of creation, counter-balanced from the microcosmic viewpoint, by the finite atman's being in its own right a support, controller and principal of its bodym,1 both challenge and echo Christian thought. This brings us to the next point. 1 Ramanuja's philosophical anthropology faces a potentially grave problem which the Christian adaptation need not face. Though we have pointed out earlier that Ramanuja theologizes as if the human</page><page sequence="17">THE WORLD AS GOD S BODY i6i (3) Here let us make some observations on Ramanuja's method. As we have seen this consists in, within the framework of the component submodels of the self-body model in its two-tiered application, the setting-up of a network of polarities (each with its distinctive mode of discourse). The point of this method is, not to do away with eventually the tension between polarities by dissolving one or other polarity, but to preserve the polarities as a system in dynamic and creative equilibrium (with the recognition that each polarity has a validity in its own right). For this method to make sense the referent being subjected to articulation and analysis besides being a multifaceted whole must in the last resort be recognized to elude exhaustive conceptual analysis, an 'entity' in some way inexhaustible in its secrets and reluctant to yield them (e.g. God, man, the Church). This is why Ramanuja's method is a theological method par excellence dealing as it does with the 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans' par excellence. Further, this method must work on the deliverances of experience. Thus God is experienced as the ground of our being, 'in whom we live and move and have our being'; yet we also experience our own substantival realities. God is experienced as the sole raison d'etre for our existence; yet we experience the inalienable ends-that-we-are-in-ourselves, and so on. The answer is not to dissolve away one or other seemingly conflicting limb of these paradoxes by a seamless logic that seeks to do away with paradox altogether (as the determinists do in resolving the paradox of human moral autonomy and God's universal causality), but to acknowledge paradox for its true value by 'polarity theology' such as Ramanuja has attempted. This is not an invitation to wallow in 'mystery' or to indulge in 'soft thinking'. Any serious student of Ramanuja cannot but be impressed by the rigour of his analyses within the various polarities, according to an uncom promising logic whose rules (if not premises) apply with equal strictness throughout the whole system. It is rather a serious and humble recognition of paradox and mystery as ineluctable facts of human experience. Surely Ramanuja the theologian is offering us something, in the method and content of his body-of-God theme, that we could ponder with much profit. atman-matter composite is qualitatively superior to sub-human atman-matter composites (even some logical evidence in the form of indirect arguments can be adduced to support this stance) his acceptance of the theory of rebirth (inclusive of atmanic embodiment in sub-human forms of life) and his lack of critical treatment of the implications of this theory for issues like determining personal identity in general and intrinsic human value over and above non-human animal worth, leave important unclarities in his system.</page></plain_text>
