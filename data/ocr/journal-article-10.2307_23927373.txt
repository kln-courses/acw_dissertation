LEWIS David H. Sick Abstract The eldila of C. S. Lewis's science fiction trilogy hold a unique position in the author's cosmology. Lewis derived these spirits, angels or daimones chiefly from Apuleius' De Deo Socratis, although the authorial voice cites medieval sources. He, moreover, acknowledged their existence in the material universe. His willingness to accept a pagan divinity results from his understanding of Graeco-Roman myth as a distorted revelation of truth and his own spiritual and intellectual relationship with Apuleius over many years. Homo post-Christianus non similis homini pre-Christiano. Tantum distant ut vidua a virgine ... Ergo plerique homines nostri temporis amiserunt non modo lumen supematurale sed etiam lumen illud naturale quod pagani habuerunt. The post-Christian human is not similar to the pre-Christian human. They are as different as a widow and a virgin... Therefore most people of our time have not only lost the supernatural light but even that natural light which the pagans had.1 C. S. Lewis wrote those sententiae to Father Giovanni Calabria in a series of letters in 1953 and 1954. The two theologians were debating the relationship between the modern West of the twentieth century and its Graeco-Roman ancestor. The father was claiming that Europe was becoming pagan again, and Lewis, surprisingly, responded, 'Utinam fieretV 'Would that it were!' As the opening quotations indicate, Lewis believed that the adherents to the traditional Graeco-Roman religion had access to a truth, a 'lumen naturale', that modern apostates had lost. The revelation of this natural light was subsequently perfected by the rise of Christianity only to be rejected by modern skepticism. Lewis's views are made more striking by their expression in Latin; thus, not only in content but in medium his comments demonstrate his commitment and respect for the classical tradition. As he has become a favorite theologian of many Christian movements in the United States and Great Britain, it is perhaps worthwhile to understand his attitude toward Graeco-Roman religion and ethics, especially since so few of his modern devotees would seem to share that attitude.

LEWIS would be willing to say, as he himself did, 'Let us first make the younger generation good pagans and afterwards Christians'. Lewis compared and contrasted Graeco-Roman and modern mores, particularly those related to religion, in much of his creative writing. In his poem, 'A Cliché Came out of its Cage', he imagined what a paganism of the twentieth century might look like and comically supposed Bertrand Russell sacrificing white bulls to the Muses in thanks for his latest proofs in logic.3 It is, however, Graeco-Roman myth rather than ritual which receives the theologian's closest attention. Most are familiar with his use of the tale of Cupid and Psyche as a basis for the novel Till We Have Faces. In an explanatory endnote to that work, Lewis carefully described the relationship between Apuleius' Metamorphoses and his adaptation, which he subtided 'A Myth Retold': Apuleius was of course a man of genius: but in relation to my work he is a 'source', not an 'influence' nor a 'model'.4 Our mythographer furthermore believed it possible to discern the source that Apuleius himself used. 'I felt quite free to go behind Apuleius', Lewis commented in the same endnote. Such confidence, if not recklessness, in his ability to know the ur-myth must have stemmed from his attitude and understanding of myth itself. In An Experiment in Criticism, Lewis provides his definition of myth;5 for our purposes, two of its qualities are most important: myth is extra-literary, that is, the audience recognizes the value independent of the telling, and it is numinous, a term borrowed from Rudolf Otto and a particular favorite of the Oxford man.6 These two properties help to explain how one could so freely claim to know a myth independent of extant sources. The Cupid and Psyche tale is only a myth if it resonates without Apuleius, and this resonance is only of value if it is grave and awe-inspiring. A fundamental assumption in the latter point should not be missed, however: it is possible for Greek and Roman myths and rites to excite the profound awe indicative of the numinous. Lewis cites Ovid's Aventine grove from the Fasti and the palace of Latinus in Virgil as among the finest examples of the numinous in classical literature.7 In his creative writing Lewis advances the value of Greek and Roman myth even further. In the second novel of his space trilogy,8 Perelandra, the protagonist Erwin Ransom, after encountering the celestial forms of the gods Mars and Venus, exclaims, 'Our mythology is based on a solider reality than we dream: but it is also at an almost infinite distance from that base', (pp. 172—3), and elsewhere the same character wonders, 'Were all the things which appeared as mythology on earth scattered through other worlds as realities?' (p. 40) By our mythology, Lewis means chiefly the stories of the Greeks and Romans. On Mars Ransom visits the original cave of the Cyclops</page><page sequence="3">DAVID H. SICK 153 (p. 93), and on Venus he finds the inspiration for the Apples of the Hesperides9 (p. 40). In essence, the narrative voice nullifies the popular definition of myth as untrue story by moving the reality to a different plain, a different planet. It is the sort of attitude that allows one to make a proper British faun a prominent character in a Namian Eden, for Narnia itself is another world, another plain of existence, where elements of the classical and the biblical mingle without contradiction. The larger goal of this project is therefore, in some sense, to save C. S. Lewis for heathendom, or to put the proposition in less inflammatory language, to save heathendom for C. S. Lewis. More immediately, toward this larger end, we will describe how Lewis borrowed from another Apuleian masterpiece, De Deo Socratis, in order to create a class of divine entities in his science fiction trilogy, and, finally, how, given the reification of Graeco Roman myth in Lewis's fiction, the presence of these daimones seems to leave the defender of the faith in the curious position of arguing for the existence of a pagan entity on earth itself. First we should provide a little background on these works. Apuleius flourished in the late second-century CE in N. Africa, although his exact dates and name are uncertain. Most of what we do know about him, we know from his own works.10 In fact, his own biography is sometimes confused with that of the main character of his most famous work, the Metamorphoses or Golden Ass, a picaresque novel that recounts the misadventures of a young Roman nobleman accidentally turned into a donkey. The novel ends with the religious and physical conversion of the main character, who devotes himself to the cult of the goddess Isis.11 Apuleius and Lewis curiously share a similar curriculum vitae. Both were as much theologians and philosophers as creative writers. The Roman's interest in religion is most evident in his own apology, in which he defends himself against a charge of black magic. His in-laws, it seems, thought he had enchanted his older, wealthier wife; he argues against the claim by citing his reverence for various forms of traditional religious practice.12 Apuleius' novel is fused with the psychology of middle Platonism that had been developed through the exegesis of Platonic works such as the Symposium and the Phaedrus. A symbolic reading of the tale of Cupid and Psyche can easily demonstrate the interests: Love seeks the invisible Soul; Love finds Soul; Soul loses Love; Love saves Soul; Soul becomes divine.13 De Deo Socratis is a theological treatise whose ostensible objective is to define the nature of Socrates' monitory inner voice or daimonion. This question is used as a vehicle to describe the role and physical position of daimones in the universe: they inhabit the air between earth and heaven and act as intermediaries between gods and humans.14 The similarity in the life's work of Lewis and Apuleius comes through the common decision to convey theological ideas in a popular literary genre. Prose fiction was a late</page><page sequence="4">154 THE DAIMONES OF C. S. LEWIS development in antiquity, intended for a broader audience, while only the most educated were prepared to understand the refinements of the poetic art.15 One can even imagine Apuleius using words of the same sort as Lewis complaining of the failure of his reviewers to note the obvious Christian allegory of Out of the Silent Planet: ... Any amount of theology can now be smuggled into people's minds under the cover of romance without their knowing it.16 The novels of the space trilogy (Out of the Silent Planet, Perelandra and That Hideous Strength) were written just prior to and during the second world war and published from 1938 to 1945. The darkness of those years intrudes into the story; there is definite possibility that evil might win. Lewis overreaches with this threat by implying that the new modernism, what we might now in retrospect cite as the origins of post-modernism, arose from the same modes of thinking as fascism. The hero of the adventure is a Cambridge philologist, who, unwittingly and unwillingly, ends up a passenger on earth's first inter planetary spaceship. This choice of hero allows Lewis to link the story to his own academic setting, both in terms of characters (He himself makes a few brief appearances.) and trends of thought. His antagonists are an old school chum dedicated to Capitalism, profit and pleasure and a scientist over-sure of humanity's ability to advance beyond its present metaphysical state through its own knowledge. A complete summary of the plot would not be possible here, but the cosmography of the novels is key for our purposes. Many of the planets of our solar system are inhabited by mortal beings and all the universe (the planets, open space and earth itself) is populated with nearly divine and barely visible entities termed eldila.17 The second step in our more immediate goal should be to outline the relationship between Lewis and Apuleius. A search for the Latin sophist in Lewis's writings will result in quite a long list of occurrences. To start with a small example, it turns out that the wizard Merlin, revived in the third installment of the trilogy, modeled his Latin after Apuleius (p. 279). Lewis seems first to have read the tale of Cupid and Psyche in a sixteenth-century version by William Adlington over the Christmas holiday in 1916,18 and he quickly borrowed the complete works of Apuleius from the college library when he arrived at Oxford in the spring of 1917.19 It is important to keep in mind that Lewis's first major field of study at Oxford was classical literature; he only became a medievalist after the first world war.20 By September of 1923, he was working on a poetic version of Cupid and Psyche, and he returned to that idea several times in his career.21 By the time the project was finally completed in 1956 in the form of the novel Till We Have Faces, our author had done quite a bit of background reading in the secondary literature.</page><page sequence="5">DAVID H. SICK 155 Lewis described Apuleius' Metamorphoses as a 'strange compound of picaresque novel, horror comic, mystagogue's tract, and stylistic experi ment'.22 That brief comment reveals that he knew that the ancient novel was a late generic invention and that he was aware of the theory that connected the tale of Cupid and Psyche to the initiation in mystery cult portrayed at the end of the same work.23 Lewis, indeed, put Apuleius' version of Cupid and Psyche in the words of a temple priest who claimed that it was used in the rites of the cult (pp. 241—2). The larger point with regard to Lewis' interpretation of the Metamorphoses is that he was interested in the whole novel, not just those sections which recount Cupid and Psyche. With this interest in the complete work would come the necessity to confront the traditional or Hellenized cults of the novel. Not surprisingly pagan devotion is not mocked in Till We Haue Faces but given a place above overly skeptical rationality, the latter being represented by a Greek tutor in the novel.24 The value of pagan faith is again emphasised by association with the Apuleian antecedent. Toward the end of the work, the protagonist Orual must attend a ritual of the goddess Ungit. She gazes at the stone that represents the goddess and thinks to herself: I have said she had no face; but that meant she had a thousand faces. For she was very uneven, lumpy and furrowed, so that, as when we gaze into a fire, you could always see some face or other... In the little clots and chains of it I made out a face; a fancy at one moment, but then, once you had seen it, not to be evaded. (p. 270) It turns out, moreover, that this representation is more popular with faithful worshipers than a recendy installed anthropomorphic statue of the Greek tradition. An earth-mother goddess who makes an appearance at the end of Lewis's novel will easily call to mind the epiphany of Isis at the end of Apuleius'. The connection is proven by the pantheistic but multiform nature of both deities. Isis explains her nature to her new devotee Lucius in the Metamorphoses: she is 'the single form of gods and goddess', 'a single spirit in many aspects with varied rituals and manifold names'.25 Apuleius also figured prominently in Lewis's classes on medieval literature; the scholar cites De Deo Socratis as one of five classical works crucial to interpreting the medieval worldview.26 It is consequently not surprising that the ideas of De Deo Socratis should find voice in Lewis's fiction as well. In short, my claim with regard to Lewis and the God of Socrates is this: the eldila of his space trilogy are primarily inspired by the daimones of Apuleius' work. To prove this claim, one more preliminary step will be necessary. We must render a fuller description of the eldila and their role in the three novels. Eldil is a word in the common language of the solar system, a language invented by Lewis,27 to describe a class of incorporeal, nearly invisible, practically immortal</page><page sequence="6">156 THE DAIMONES OF C. S. LEWIS beings who generally live in space but do make appearances on planets. These beings are ranked in hierarchy, with each planet having a chief tutelary eldil; the eldila who rule over planets were understandably construed as the Olympian gods by the Greeks and Romans. It is a result of this connection between the eldils and the planetary gods that the protagonist Ransom meets Mars28 and Venus.29 The eldila are in the main stewards over corporeal life, although those on earth are an exception, being generally hostile to humanity. The eldils on earth, moreover, do not and may not communicate with the rest of the universe beyond the moon because of the rebellious crimes of the 'Bent One', an eldil who controls earth. They have been sequestered on earth after a primeval batde. The eldils beyond earth have always moved back and forth between the planets and space, but, before the action of the novel, mortals have never left their respective terrestrial spheres. This development has consequences for the rest of the plot of the trilogy. The perversion of the earthly eldila is also a clue to the connection to daimones, given the negative connotation of demons in the Christian tradition. 'The Bent One' is clearly the solar system's name for Lucifer, as he is described as 'brighter' than the other eldils.30 The opening of the second novel, Perelandra, provides an extensive discussion of tellurian eldils; there Lewis himself as a character confronts several and recounts the role of the malevolents on earth: Like bacteria on the microscopic level, so these co-inhabiting pests on the macroscopic permeate our whole life invisibly and are the real explanation of the fatal bent which is the main lesson of history. (p. 12) Apuleius was not, to be sure, the only source for the eldila, but we here emphasise Lewis's connection to the pagan theologian because the role of pagan theology and cosmology in the trilogy has been underestimated in the critical reception. In truth, the authorial voice cites the medieval works of Bernardus Silvestris31 and Natvilcius32 as experts on eldila. Natvilcius is a fiction, however, as David Downing has shown.33 Nat Whilk, meaning 'I know not whom', in Old English, was a pseudonym under which Lewis published occasional poems. Natvilcius is the Latinised form of the pseudonym. Bemardus did indeed live in the twelfth century, and his Cosmographia does contain a discussion of the geniî, numina and spiritûs who inhabit the air and ether.34 Lewis, moreover, borrowed a textual oddity or error in the reception of Bemardus to invent the term for an eldil who protects a planet. Thus Mars, the tutelary deity of the planet of the same name, is called the oyarsa of his planet, oyarses in the text of Bemardus perhaps being a corruption of Greek ovoiâpxps" 'author of existence'.35 We should not, however, overemphasize the influence of Bemardus in order to save Lewis from pagan connections. The lesser divine entities of the universe are not the</page><page sequence="7">DAVID H. SICK 157 main subject of the Cosmographia; it is a description of the creation of the universe, and nearly all the substantive material on daimones found in Silvestris is derived from Apuleius and other classical works. The real significance for Bemardus and daimones, according to Lewis himself writing about the medieval worldview in The Discarded Image, is that Bernardus was one of the last Christian theologians to believe that these spirits could be either good or evil; he is the last in a line beginning from Apuleius.36 Even the citation of oyarsa may have been meant as a deception. The Greek ovoMpxps" seems to be found in only one extant classical work, and in a Latin work at that—the Asclepius, another cosmological treatise that was attributed to Apuleius until the middle of the twentieth century.37 C. C. J. Webb, a colleague of Lewis at Oxford, posited the connection between oyarses and the Greek form.38 At Asclepius 19, the anonymous author explains, 'The seven spheres which are named have an ovaiapxps', that is, the leader of each.39 That phrase epitomises both the cosmic order in Lewis's trilogy and in Silvestris. We are operating in a Hellenistic or medieval solar system with only seven planets, and each one has a guardian oyarsa. The Asclepius, moreover, shares a basic similarity of cosmic structure and substance with its inheritors. All three describe a tripartite universe in which the immortal and mortal spheres are separated by air or space that serves an intervening and transitional function. There are indeed several characteristics of the eldila which are mentioned only briefly in Silvestris but are key to Apuleius' interpretation of daimones. Silvestris, for example, has little to say about the physical nature of daimones but this topic is treated rather fully by Lewis and Apuleius. Both are very interested in how and why humans can or cannot see and perceive these ethereal beings. Just as Apuleius says, 'No earthy substance would hold the place of light in them', one of Ransom's Martian friends says, 'Light is instead of blood for them'.40 Lewis, as one would expect, sprinkles his descriptions with terms from modem physics; it is toward this end that he invents Natvilcius, the supposed author of On Ethereal and Aerial Bodies who seems to have coined the Latin for 'multi-dimensional space'.41 Secondly, both Apuleius' daimones42 and Lewis's eldila are conveyors of signifying dreams and directly intervene in human affairs. Since humanity is only created at the very end of the Bemardus' Comsographia, there is no room for interaction between humans and daimones in that work. At the beginning of Perelandra, the character Lewis is beset with perceived obstacles as he hikes toward the home of Ransom. In truth the evil eldila were besieging him psychically. Ransom explained the incident afterward: Oh they'll put all sorts of things in your head if you let them... The best plan is to take no notice and keep straight on.43</page><page sequence="8">158 THE DAIMONES OF C. S. LEWIS In preventing or discouraging action, they use the same approach as the Socratic daimonion but toward the opposite moral end. Significant and monitory dreams figure prominently in That Hideous Strength. It is in search of an explanation of her odd dreams that the heroine Jane Studdock comes to our philologist and cosmic saviour Ransom.44 A corollary of this principle of interaction is that it is not the Olympian deities but only daimonic representations of them whom mortals meet. Thus, at De Deo Socratis 11, Apuleius asserts that the Athena who restrained Achilles in the Greek assembly in the first book of the Iliad was not the goddess herself but a daimon. Similarly the revived Merlin in That Hideous Strength reveals to Ransom a methodology of his magic: For—I need not teach you, you know more than I—it is not the very Oyéresu, the true powers of Heaven, whom the greatest of our craft meet, but only their earthly wraiths, their shadows.45 The true planetary gods could not appear on earth because of the stipulation against interaction with earth. It is not Jupiter himself who journeys from the fifth planet but some earthly messenger; one assumes one of the few earthly eldils who have not become 'bent'. Finally, the basic premise of Lewis's trilogy is dependent upon an assumption of Apuleius about interactions between mortals and immortals. In a Platonic tripartite division of the universe, the daimones inhabit the atmosphere, and, in keeping with their cosmographie position, it is their role in the middle region to act as intermediaries between humans on earth and the gods in the heavens.46 In the trilogy that role is nullified by the invention of the spaceship. Humans no longer need an intermediary to contact the gods; they can travel from the earth to deep heaven on their own. In the first novel Ransom meets Mars on the god's own planet; by the second, the true Mars is permitted to manifest himself on earth, for, as Ransom recounts the course of events toward the end of the trilogy, the intervening spirits are no longer necessary: If men by enginry and natural philosophy learn to fly into the Heavens, and come, in the flesh, among the heavenly powers and trouble them, (God) has not forbidden the Powers to react.47 The Olympians, in the view of Lewis after Apuleius, could not originally meet humans directly; these rules change if we go to them. It remains then to attempt to synthesise Lewis's concept of an eldil based largely on pagan, specifically Apuleian, theology, with his ideas about paganism generally, outlined at the beginning of this essay. In completing this</page><page sequence="9">DAVID H. SICK 159 synthesis, we should keep one point in mind about daimones: they are not only an element of pagan mythology but also Christian mythology. Lewis acknowledged this fact in both his fiction and his theology. One of Ransom's associates states, 'Even in St. Paul one gets glimpses of a population that won't exactly fit into our two columns of angels and devils'.48 Unlike the rest of Graeco-Roman myth, which is relegated to an existence on other planets or plains, daimons and eldils bridge the gap in doctrine and can be found here on earth. It is a rather striking if not heretical belief for the Christian advocate, especially when one considers that the pagan gods were deemed daimones by Apuleius and eldils by Lewis. In a letter to one of his fans he states, 'If the angels (who I believe to be real beings in the actual universe) have that relation to the pagan gods which they are assumed to have in Perelandra, they might really manifest themselves in real form as they did to Ransom'.49 There is certainly no heresy in a belief in angels and archangels; the variant lies in their connection to pagan gods.50 In the end, we must remember that, in the canonical tradition, Apuleius' air-dwelling deities came to be viewed as 'demons' not angels. A fair part of the awe in respect to the eldils is, however, their connection to pagan myth and in its rebirth. When Ransom meets the oyéresu of Mars and Venus and thinks to himself, 'My eyes have seen Mars and Venus, I have seen Ares and Aphrodite', (p. 172), the wonder comes less from the existence of angels but from the reification of the Olympians. In truth, the two remind him more of 'archaic statues from Aegina' (p. 171) than any popular notion of angels. If the heroic philologist, and perhaps by analogy Lewis himself, had not first been a good pagan, he would not have been so thrilled by the event; he would have missed the tmth of Graeco Roman mythology. As he himself said, we must first be good pagans, then good Christians. It is perhaps no wonder that the first character we meet in Namia is a faun, a tea-drinking one, but still a descendant of pagan Pan.51 Greek and Roman Studies, Rhodes College, Memphis, TN 38112, USA. sick@rhodes.edu REFERENCES See Ep. 23 and Ep. 26 in M.
