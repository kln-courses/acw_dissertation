<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW HUMANISM1 Dennis Williams Dennis Williams, co-editor of this issue, was educated on the East Coast, acquiring profes- sional undergraduate and graduate degrees. A Doctoral Candidate and Associate in Architecture at Berkeley, his current interests lie in discerning those often subtle relationships between human existence and the physical environment. His article is a positional reduction reflecting two larger works being put together; Set and Setting: The Social Constitution of the Everyday Physical World, a base for man-environment research, and The New Humanism, a collection of articles by students that support Humanism as an architec- tural and urban design stance. 1. The word "new" does not reference some past architectural period or perspective but is used to align the perspective presented with particular stances in psychology, sociol- ogy, social psychology and anthropology which are of recent origin or which have risen to the surface again as intellectual pursuits. These stances reflect humanistic attitudes as outlined in the paper. A general reference: Jack Douglas (ed.), UndersLai.Jing Everyday Life (Chicago: Aldine, 1970). INTRODUCTION I would like to talk briefly about two things in this introduction. The first is zeitgeist. The second is the nature of the transition we are going through in looking for a new meaning or content for the built world, be it building or city. These topics will serve as location points in putting forth the basic characteristics of the central position, the identification of what I have labelled Humanism. Zeitgeist is a convenient word to describe the trend of thought or feeling in an era, the spirit of the age. If we look at this age, it would be possible to point to accomplishments and thinking to say that it is an era of Scientism or rational, objective methodological research and its contributions to understanding what the world, space and men are all about. There have been remarkable advances in products, procedures and dis- coveries. On the other hand, it might also be called an ecological era because of the concern for the purity of the natural world which we are destroying at an alarming rate. An ecological or Natural era is often presented in some opposition to Scientism since areas of scientific research have been frequently named the villains for the polluted condition of the world and ill-treatment of life. These two era "spirits" are to some degree polar because they stand in contrast to one another. There is a third aspect of this age that is equally dominant and also equally polar. This aspect has to do with the qualities of human life. Quality is a very ambiguous word. I do not mean by quality efficiency, comfort or material possessions. I mean by quality the interest in the dignity of the human situation, the concern for the significance of the human condition; what there is about human life that is both unique and meaningful. This is not quite a scientific nor a naturalistic concern. It is definitely not naturalistic because a position based on the novel characteristics of man is anthropocentric and to varying degrees anthropomorphic. It recognizes a human state basic, different, important and necessary to maintain that can not be credited to other living animals. Nor is it scientific because such a concern for man is neither objective nor absolute nor does it point to a value system independent of ongoing human life. It deems important subjective response and multiple realities. This third "spirit" is humanistic in its emphasis and characteristics and in relationship to Scientism and Naturalism, it can be called Humanism. The second topic of this introduction is the transitional nature of the meaning of the built world. Most of us are aware of the growing consciousness or general feeling that our build- ings and cities seem to be without substance or content. There have been a series of eulogies and manifestos. The eulogies have told us that the old way of looking at things or giving meaning to the built world; space, function, integrity of materi- als, articulation, etc., is no longer appropriate. Manifestos have proposed economic theory, scientific methodologies, vernacular structures, etc,. as the means to generate new form, to give content to the built world. These proclamations and eulogies point out that the transitional nature of the meaning of the built world can be thought of as bearing a relationship to whatever we consider the zeitgeist or spirit of our time. Many seek to replace Functionalism, the Interna- tional or Bauhaus Style, or however we refer to how we have been constructing the built world with Scientism. The intention is that we "scien- tize" or systematically routinize the design process. Or, by using scientific methodology to read man-environment relationships to put to- gether programs or, still, by adapting scientific technology in approaching the built world. Others have referred to ecological systems, the interac- tion of life systems and cycles in which buildings and their inhabitants, people, are only part of a more complex system of living organisms and cycles. This placement of the built world in the complex system provides design determinants or design programs influenced by external ecological factors. Scientism and Naturalism thus give content or meaning to the built world. If Humanism is a spirit of the era then it too should indicate the means of giving humanist content or meaning to the physical environment. ORIENTATION AND HUMANISM There has been a humanist accent in many of the manifestos and proclamations. Referencing the vernacular, or the products of mass culture, is a humanist approach in that there is an attempt to recognize that popular forms must have some human meaning that can be interpreted or read. Asking the users of potential buildings to enter the design process is another humanist adapta- tion. However, the nature of the humanism represented by these two examples does not easily indicate a coherent definition. From what position, for example, does one read the vernacu- lar; from cognition, social values, subjective response? In the scientization of architecture it is easy to point to other fields, psychology and sociology, for example, in which scientization has played an important role. The concern for the purity of the earth is not limited to architecture. But, we would hardly ask people to design sociology or attempt to read societies without a better orientation to what we are looking for. A Humanist stance should present us with a coherent orientation to the built world. Indeed, Scientism and Naturalism exist independently as JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: VOLUME XXVII, NUMBERS 2, 3 29</page><page sequence="2">cohesive and coherent orientations complete with methodologies that are adapted to fields of study. We first accept eco-systems before applying them to design much as we accept the scientific methodologies and objective stance before utilizing them. Thus, the real question is what is the humanist orientation or perspective. Then how can that be related or adapted to the built world? Fortunately there is a recognized Humanist stance in sociology, psychology, social psychol- ogy and anthropology which can be applied to the physical environment, much as the recognized stances of Scientism or Naturalism have been identified and related to the design process, reading the built world or other aspects of building, altering or changing the physical envi- ronment. A stance or perspective here is an orientation to a phenomenon under study, whether that phenomenon is an atom or man and his physical world. The basic position of the Humanist stance is that man in everyday situations constructs his be- havior and that he is thus the determining agent in deciding the content or meaning of his everyday situations. In the process he determines the meaning or content of the physical environment. This is not a "scientized" environmental deter- minist view because in that orientation the position taken is that the physical environment determines man or at least his behavior. A humanist would have none of this. In addition, the Humanist stance is not "scientifically" methodological because such methodologies are based on the position that behavior is predeter- mined. The methodology only reveals how. A Humanist stance will not accept this. The real world is not "scientifically" identifiable. It can not be absolutely proven through interview techni- ques, questionnaires or scaling. Reality, in the humanist sense, is socially constructed;2 that is, the only way to understand what the physical world means to a population is to do just that, identify what meaning or content the world has for those who live in it from their own construc- tions. The humanist is very stubborn about this point. A scientific or naturalistic stance will not tell us this. The meaning attributed to the built world by those living in it would be subservient either to the methodology or the ecological systems. What a humanist wants to get at in environmental design is this meaning, this knowledge, that people have about the physical environments in which they live so that the meaning can be incorporated into the proposed or a new or altered built environment. To get at this meaning we have to go into the ongoing day-to-day world in which the population is living. But, problems begin to arise. How do we uncloak this meaning, this understanding? A perspective should not only provide an orientation to the nature of a phenomenon but should also indicate how that phenomenon should be approached in attempting to understand what is taking place. What should we look for? The "scientized" determinist knows this. He can act because he knows that the physical environment determines behavior, that is his basic assumption. The objects of that world force or coerce us in some way to behave as we do. His methodology is to discover how this takes place, how the built environment and people come into contact with one another and what type of control that world has over the behavior ob- served. He can map the encounter between object and person. He can build models of the built world and send people through them, collecting data as they go along to establish consensus about certain paths. He can question people about the mental images they have about that physical world in which they live. The humanist would do none of these things because he operates from a different perspective. We determine what objects mean; they do not determine us. If the humanist is to uncloak this meaning then his orientation should offer some indication of how this meaning or content is attributed so that he can observe or identify it in the ongoing world. ORIENTATION AND CONTENT The staypoint of Humanism with regard to the physical environment is that the environment or the objects in it have no intrinsic meaning. They cannot if the basic assumption of the position is that reality is humanly determined; that meaning is socially constructed. We attribute meaning to the built world. As a humanist might state it, "objects are human constructs and not self- existing entities with intrinsic natures. Their nature is dependent on the orientation and action of people toward them."3 Whether, for example, a physical object like a chair is a place to sit down or a weapon depends upon how we act toward it, how we designate it in that action. But then, how do we designate it? If a chair is to be a weapon or a place to sit down, how is the act so constructed that renders this meaning. From the Humanist stance, human beings are differentiated from animals in that people have a self and an object of self.4 We can, in fact, objectify ourselves. It is with this objective self that we hold incessant dialogues through which we construct behavior. This process is going on at this very moment when we decide to continue reading or anticipate the next sentence or wonder what we will be having for dinner this evening. This process allows us to continue relatively unproblematically through our day-to- day lives. It also defines us as reflective or- ganisms. We think about what we do; we 2.

Joint action is adapted from Herbert Blumer: Blumer, op. cit., pp. 70-77. 6. Taken for granted meanings indicate that in social interaction there is social order that has evolved as a "nonconscious" order or taken for granted rule systems. The object of investigation among many Humanists has been the construction and manifestation of these rules or meanings that support social order. See: Harold Garfinkel, Studies in ELlhnrnltuhudulogy (New Jersey: Prentice- Hall, 1967). And, from the Naturalist stance: Erving Goffman, Behavior in Public Places (New York: The Free Press, 1963). , Interaction Ritual (New York: Doubleday, 1967). , Relations in Public (New York: Basic Books, 1971). 7. Methodologies from the perspective have centered about observation or participant observation techniques followed by whatever methods would enable the investigator to understand what was happening in the social situations; that is, using the ongoing behavior in the situations to direct the investigation, not the extrinsic methodologies employed. See: Aaron Cicourel, Method and Measurement in Sociology (New York: The Free Press, 1964). Severyn Bruyn, The Humanist Perspective in Sociology: the Methodology of Particip- ant Observation (New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, 1966). Peter McHugh, The Definition of the Situation (Indiana: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968). Norman Denzin, The Research Act (Chicago: Aldine, 1970). (ed.), Sociological Methods: A Sourcebook (New York: Aldine- Atherton, 1970). construct our acts by pointing out things to ourselves, by making decisions about how to act toward them. It is the results of these decisions that we can be observed doing. And, in that construction and designation, we develop orien- tations to objects. We give meaning to them, meaning which they did not intrinsically possess. It is in the dialogue that the act is put together and the object content attributed. A similar process occurs when other people are present. Each reflective human being has to interpret what the other is designating and respond to the meanings of the actions of the others. However, in such groups there is some consistency as to the meanings constructed, some evolved agreement about the content of the physical world even though these meanings may be different from those attributed through a dialogue with one's self. They belong to the group, to the joint line of action of the group,5 and often identify the group. Their career may alter with the career of the group; that is, they may change or be maintained by the group over a period of time. At one time a chair might mean one thing to the group, at another time it might be reconstructed to mean something else. For example, the chair might be the place where the oldest member sits and because he sits there the group will give special meaning to the position of the chair. Later it might be decided that all the members will sit and so the content of the chair is altered. Nevertheless, for the group to persist there must be some consistency in some object meanings. What begins to surface about the physical world is that a wall, which exists in the world as it obviously is remains a wall. Whether it is a boundary and the nature of that boundary, how it defines and confines a situation, if it has special significance, is determined by what transpires in the interaction around it. Furthermore, simply by observing the wall and what takes place in its vicinity, we could not determine the meaning of the wall. The observable behavior as well as the wall have no intrinsic meaning. I would have to try to note how the acts and interactions were being constructed to ascertain the meaning of the wall in the physical environment. I would have to know what was going on. This would be true for all the physical objects that provide the set for the interaction. There is another aspect of this meaning that is important in relating Humanism to the built world. That aspect is that not only is the meaning constructed by reflective organisms alone or with one another, but also that such meanings are taken for granted.6 That is, we make them in ongoing behavior in our day-to-day lives, accept and proceed in interacting without thinking of them conscously again until the meaning be- comes problematic. During that state in which the meanings are accepted or maintained we are not fully conscious that we are doing so for if we were we could not act at all. We could not act because before performing we would have to reconstruct the meanings of all the objects in the physical environment. The simple act of writing would require that I reestablish the meanings of the chair, desk, lamp and typewriter and I would have to do this every time I wanted to write something. I do not have to do this because once the meanings are established, I can take them for granted. If an object meaning becomes problema- tic, I can attribute new meaning, give new content to the physical world through a dialogue. This aspect makes the Humanist content even more difficult to identify because it is inherent in the orientation that the meanings of the objects of the physical world are to be taken for granted in everyday life unless they become problematic. If you stop and ask a person or people engaged in an act to identify what the objects in the built world meant to them, be it a wall or a window, they would have difficulty in telling you. They might physically describe them, listing the physi- cal characteristics of the objects. They might even give you a special account of them by anticipating what they expect you to want to hear. Because the meanings are taken for granted, they, truthfully, would not know them; that is, call them into consciousness. From the Humanist perspective we know thus far three significant aspects concerning the built world: 1. That the built world has no intrinsic meaning. The content or meaning of the built world is socially constructed in dialogues or encoun- ters, whether a person is interacting with his self or with other people. 2. Such meanings are taken for granted in the everyday world. They are difficult to identify, even those engaged in the interaction are consciously unaware of them and they must be in order to act in the physical world. 3. Human activities have only intrinsic con- structed meaning. We cannot understand what people are doing simply by observing them. In such observation the activity and the physical objects are often assumed to be what they obviously are. Walls are taken to be walls, period. If meaning is constructed in interaction then the only procedure we have of understanding what is going on or what meanings are constructed is not to observe, but to enter the ongoing activity.7 MEANINGS CONSTRUCTED We have not come very far. It has been stated that an orientation should not only provide a perspective to a phenomenon but should also indicate how the phenomenon is to be understood JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: VOLUME XXVII, NUMBERS 2, 3 31</page><page sequence="4">or researched. All that the application of the Humanist stance has indicated is the difficulty in uncovering the significance of the built environ- ment. In addition, the perspective is dependent upon the ongoing world to expose its meanings, the world making the definition. A complete structuring of what that world is about before we enter it prevents us from seeing it through the eyes of those acting in it. The Humanist approach does not provide a definitively structured orien- tation but a sensitizing8 one, one that indicates enough to uncover meanings as constructed but not too inclusively for then meanings will be read into the everyday world. A sensitizing orientation is open-ended because it is dependent not on itself but on the day-to-day world of people who render the environment. With a sensitizing orientation in mind, the difficulty in identifying object or physical environ- mental meanings makes it clear, to some extent, the conditions under which the humanist content of the ongoing world can be revealed. One must enter the ongoing world and attempt to uncover the meanings a population attributes to the physical environment in their interactions. In addition, even though these meanings are taken for granted there should be some consistency in their maintenance, particularly in the interaction of groups whose members encounter one another with some frequency. From this point of development several routes can be taken to illustrate that, indeed, object meanings can be identified. They cannot only be identified but that'this identity can be incorpo- rated into the designed world. However, they are complex and only a reduction of one route follows beginning with the formation of meanings in augmenting the sensitizing orientation.9 The simple set of a chair, a table and a wall will provide the illustrative material. We construct meanings by interacting with our selves and with others. For the act of reading a book, I can, by holding a dialogue with my self, locate and make adjustments to that chair and table in relation to the wall so that I have attributed the meaning to them of a set for reading a book. I might decide that the table should be against the wall and the chair a little distant from the table so I can read with my feet supported by the table. I do not, for the act, have to use the table or chair. I could read a book on the floor or I could simply lean against the wall. To use that table, chair and wall I must give them that meaning. These attributed meanings originating in my dialogues must come from somewhere. The interaction is only the process of their generated product. It has been pointed out that groups have a collective biography, a career, in which object meanings are constructed, maintained and al- tered but also in which consistency is preserved so that the group can act. Individuals also have biographies. Each of us has a history of past experiences in which we or others attribute meanings that we call upon in the present moment to render objects that are confronting us so that they can be utilized for some future goal or purpose.10 Neither the table, chair, wall nor act of reading were the first tables, chairs, walls or acts that you or I have confronted. I have a biography of such experiences in which I have given meaning to those objects and that act in the past; the past experiences of tables, chairs, walls and reading books. In a group we are selective about our biographies or what we bring into the ongoing behavior. In a social situation what we do is to present an aspect of ourselves, a me.11 The me in the group contributes to the meanings constructed or maintained. The me is a me because of the selective aspects of the biography it presents in the here and now of the group which it might not select in a dialogue. A craftsman or a person trained to appreciate how the chair, table and wall were put together would give them a different significance than I who would use them for academic ends and would give them that content. In a group, however, an act could be going on in which neither of these subjective worlds would be relevant. The craftsman and I would select from among our experiences to participate in the ongoing group behavior, what- ever the group determines the desk, chair and wall to be. In the group, the table and chair might mean leadership if the leader does utilize them or they might have special significance in some religious act. The experiences that the craftsman and I would call upon in a dialogue are not lost, they are simply replaced by us in the joint act by other experiences which the joint act calls upon. We have various mes which we present to various groups. These mes bring with them object meanings that we attribute depending upon our interpretation of what is taking place. Other people in the group also have mes that they are presenting. The ongoing behavior of the group indicates that the situation of the group calls upon mes that contribute to the nature of the group act and group meanings. The subjective selection of the me points out that the intersub- jectivity of the mes of the group supports some consistent object meanings attributed and main- tained by them and necessarily so, otherwise the group could not act. Individual interpretations of the objects present would create an impossible quagmire. All the individual chair and table meanings would have to be reconciled among those present. We are as selective about our encounters and 8. The sensitizing concept is defined by Herbert Blumer as "terms which give a sense of reference, a general orientation, rather than a precise definition, to a phenomenon under study." Herbert Blumer, "What is Wrong with Social Theory?" in American Sociological Review, 19(1954), p. 9. 9. The reduction that follows draws upon as- pects of positions within the general stance. What is constructed is a general orientation to relate the stance to the built environment. The intricacies of particular positions are not determining influences here. Many terms are adopted and adapted from slightly differing points of view. 10. The designation of the biography that gives meaning to the present in anticipation of the future is a construct utilized in phe- nomenological social research in the effort to give value to subjective experience and intersubjective interaction. Relevancies are also phenomenologically based; we act de- pending upon what is relevant to us. See: Alfred Schutz, ed. Helmut R. Wagner, On Phenomenology and Social Relations (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970). The Classic work, however, is: , ed. M. Natanson, Collected Papers I: The Problem of Social Reality (Nijhoff, 1962). 11. The me as presented here is an adaptation of an Interactional construct. Mead uses the "me" and the "I" to point out the dialogue process in human interaction. The me as put forth in the text is an aspect of self under which is assumed a central identity. Selectiv- ity and sensitivity are also Interactionally based. The adaptations support the reduc- tion to indicate a consistency in object meanings. Mead, op. cit. 32 JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: VOLUME XXVII, NUMBERS 2, 3</page><page sequence="5">12. See Ellis' article in Part I which defines and references the nature of situations, occa- sions, etc. The distinction here is that the occasion and encounter are subclassifica- tions of the situation and not that occasions contain situations. This, however, is a minor issue. 13. Accounts and indexicality are constructs of the Ethnomethodologist. One of their con- cerns is the "indexical" ability we have as human beings to be able to fit into ongoing situations as if we had been participating in them although we may have just entered the ongoing behavior. Not only that, we assume the taken for granted rules and accounts, the constructs of the group. See: Garfinkel, op. cit. occasions as we are about the places in which we act; that is, we make some choice about people with whom we act and the sets in which we engage in ongoing behavior. If the me presented by the craftsman could not accept or maintain the meanings attributed in the group, he probably would not join. The me we present is constructed or played dependent upon our relevancies. Our relevancies, in turn, are influenced by the selectivity of our past experiences, our biog- raphy. Furthermore, our past experiences with objects that render them is not infinite nor are the objects present in any physical set infinite in number. That table, chair and wall can evoke just so many experiences. We can attribute just so many experiences to them. In this sense, a set inhabited by more than one person is an interac- tion of subjectivities, a composite of individual relevancies that would support similar or joint meanings of the objects present. A group interaction not only has a career but that career expresses intersubjectivity; consensus concerning the mes in the here and now ongoing behavior presenting compatible relevancies. If any of us were to enter an act engaged in by a group, whether an encounter or an occasion,12 we would bring our relevancies to it to present a me that could live with the maintained and constructed environmental object meanings. Since the meanings themselves are selected from all the meanings possible, you or I would have to understand the meanings portrayed. Our sensitivity would have to pick them up, construct or match them. If we remain with the group then these meanings can be said to be agreed upon or that they represent consensus about the mean- ing of the wall, chair or table. These strains of development point out that there are subjectively and intersubjectively ag- reed upon object meanings in both dialogues, conversation with our selves, and group situa- tions, interactions with others. These agreed upon meanings are accounts or typifications.13 They are the shorthand of our experiential- biographical (individual and group career) selectiv- ity in the here and now of ongoing situations in everyday life. Out of all the meanings that could be attributed to that chair, table or wall, the meanings we construct in a situation are ac- counts, identifiable shorthand typifications, that permit the situation to continue. If the accounts did not exist, if there were no socially determined meanings, then we could not act. As a member of a group engaged in formal or informal interaction, we must pick up these intersubjectively con- structed and maintained typifications if we are to act in that group. Similarly, if I am alone, I must typify meanings in my dialogues or refer to typified meanings if I am to accomplish anything. This consistency in object meanings that I have been hinting at is these accounts or typifications. Furthermore, if you or I are to act in any group we must bring to that interaction this ability to plug into the ongoing acts; this ability to pick up and maintain or construct accounts. Since most of us spend a great deal of time among people, we are able to do this. We can fit into a number of situations which correspond to our relevancies as organized to present a me. So, there is evidence that object meanings not only exist but can be identified. Indeed, we do this in a taken for granted manner in our day-to-day lives in ongoing situations. MEANINGS UTILIZED In the above description of the construction of object content form, a Humanist perspective, application of the orientation to the built world, was also evolved. The relationship of that content to the built environment can be made by a simple link. The orientation has pointed out that the meanings of the built world, or accounts, not only exist but can be identified. Indeed, the reading of these meanings is an ongoing process in our everyday lives. Since we have an indexical ability to fit into situations we can use that ability to read or identify the meanings of the physical environment in those situations. We can step aside for a moment to uncover the significance given to that world in the interaction. To this task we bring our relevancies, selectivity and our biographies. In designing the physical world, these sets of objects, whether they are put together through a dialogue between the designer and his self, calling upon biography, relevancies, etc., or through a joint line of action as represented by a committee with its career, what determines the configura- tion of the proposed built environment is the meanings attributed to the objects in those dialogues and encounters. The designed world is invested with subjective and intersubjective content. The link between Humanism and the designed world is quite simple. If we want physical worlds to have content from a Humanist stance, then the designer should use his indexicality, his ability to render situations, to point out the meaning or content of the built world which can then be put together to generate the physical form of the building. But, to design a humanist structure, one must read the world from the humanist perspective. The perspective provides the orientation which then generates the form. In summary: 1. People, in dialogues and encounters, through past experience, relevancies, selectivity and anticipated goals give meaning to the physical world. 2. We, as people, possess the individual ability to enter situations and understand, maintain or JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: VOLUME XXVII, NUMBERS 2, 3 33</page><page sequence="6">help construct these object meanings, these accounts. This ability can be used to step aside in situations to note the meanings constructed. 3. These meanings can be incorporated in altering or designing new forms by providing the physical components that contribute to the taken for granted meanings evolved in situations. The designer always does this because he puts together objects in terms of what meaning they have for him or for the group, the clients, for whom he is designing. This meaning can only be attributed from the perspective through which he gives meaning to the physical world. A Humanist perspective provides Humanist content. HUMANIST INFRASTRUCTURES If we look at a segment of the built world designed from a Naturalist perspective we see an infra- structure underlying the actual physical environ- ment. The infrastructure is the ecosystem applications that have determined to some degree the physical arrangement of the struc- ture at which we are looking. That segment of the built world thus has Naturalist content. If a scientific approach is taken, the infrastructure underlying the physical configuration is one of Scientism. The Humanist perspective supports a Humanist infrastructure. The Humanist infrastructure is particularly tel- ling. What I have been talking about is worlds that have multiple realities, worlds that do not exist as they obviously are. The components of the built world are covered with a film of attributed meanings, multiple past experiences, memories, reveries, etc. In addition, different groups or individuals give new or different meanings to the same objects. The basic position is that this film, often of multiple layers, is more real than the actual three-dimensional characteristics of the objects it covers. To get to the physical world, to give it content from a Humanist stance, we must first identify and construct the film and then the physical world behind it. Accounts, encounters, subjectivity, biographies, etc. are the means. There is nothing extraordinary about this film. For decades we have talked about the built world as space or function and that the purpose of that world was to define and control space to provide for the play of function. The infrastructure was one of function and space. The definition of the infrastructure was constructed before the built product was placed over it. From a Humanist stance, what replaces the Functional, Natural or Scientific infrastructure is that of socially con- structed meanings. The Humanist infrastructure does not only underlie a physical environment put together through its orientation,14 but it also underlies studies in sociology, anthropology, social psychology and can be found in many films and novels. If we collected all the recent efforts that fit within the simple definition of Humanism the collection would be quite large, as impressive perhaps as the collection of works under which there is an infrastructure of Scientism, or that collection under which the infrastructure is one of Naturalism. With these sentences we have returned to those introductory topics of zeitgeist and content. 14. The studio work in the article by Lifchez can be seen as the construction of the film and then the construction of the objects, the physical environment, from the Humanist stance. Too often we accept what we think is going on in the age in which we live as the possible alternatives. If we feel that the built environment must be given new meaning, we have frequently looked to that which was going on about us, and often the popular, as the generator of content, the built environment to purify the world; the built environment to be the product of an intricate mathematical or economic process. There is also another alternative, not as well known because it has not been as impressionable, the built world to nurture and support the human experience; the built world that reflects a third spirit. 34 JOURNAL OF ARCHITECTURAL EDUCATION: VOLUME XXVII, NUMBERS 2, 3</page></plain_text>
