Journal of Peace Research, vol. 34, no. 3, 1997, ISSN: 0022-3433, pp. 325-329 The Rhetorical Strategies and the Misleading Nature of Attacks on 'Postmodernism': A Reply to 0sterud HEIKKI PATOMAKI Finnish Institute of International Affairs, Helsinki As a reaction to 0sterud's attack on 'postmodernism', it is argued that post-structuralism, Critical Theory and critical realism should be seen as important responses to the crisis of positivism and modernity. Even the few 'postmodernists' who would be willing to defend the idea that it is only thought and discourses that matter or that 'anything goes' or that we should stop talking about truths have been able to contribute to transformations of un- derstandings in a constructive way. Even though some of the actual critical-reflective analyses have been rather conventional, there is much room for producing even better critical-reflectivist studies in the future. However, 0sterud's loaded terms have effects of power: there is an unjustified tendency to silence the emerging late- modern interpretative and explanatory possibilities. 1. Why Is the Debate Over 'Postmodernism' So Boring, Yet Awkward? The debate over 'postmodernism' is boring because there are only a few self-acclaimed 'postmodernists' and because the arguments are so predictable and repetitive. 0sterud's (1996) 'Antinomies of Postmodernism in International Studies' is a case in point. Of the authors mentioned in 0sterud's list of references, only two or three would be happy with the label 'postmodernist'. There are few if any novel arguments in his attack on 'postmodernism'. The simplicity of 0sterud's arguments notwithstanding, it is not easy to reply to him. His rhetorical moves seem to be leading to a 'no-win' situation.' If I were to defend 'post- modernism' in the manner he conceives it, some of his arguments would, indeed, continue to carry some weight. But making distinctions within what Osterud calls 'postmodernism' is equally problematical. It is not just that he de- nies the right of me - or any other person - to make these distinctions by authoritatively argu- ing that 'from the outside they all look the same'.2 It is, more seriously, a problem of exclusion. By giving in to the temptation of say- ing 'well, yes, there are some "postmodernists" who are in fact as bad as you claim, but with many others, I am not like them' would be equally unacceptable because it would justify academic as well as political marginalization and exclusion. As a matter of fact, I do not share the 'post- modernist' ideas that it is only thought and dis- courses that matter or that 'anything goes' or that we should stop talking about truths. Nonetheless, it is in many cases much more il- luminating and worthwhile to read the papers and books produced by those who believe ap- proximately in this manner than to read the works of positivists and empirical realists who are so eager to refute 'postmodernism'. The 'postmodernists' are able to problematize many things in an adequate manner and thematize im- portant themes from Otherness to surveillance and punishment and construction of sexuality and to genealogical readings or modellings of sovereignty, intelligence and security. With them I share many ideas about the importance of studying discourses, discursive practices and social construction of realities, although I am also critical about the prevailing tendencies to- ward linguistic and other fallacies (and about the ontological, epistemological and ethico-pol- itical consequences of these). Indeed, you do not have to be able to agree about everything in order to be able to commu- nicate and cooperate in a fruitful way, or to share many or some elements of a more con- crete analysis. The same holds true of positivists and empirical realists as well, of course. Yet, since many of the latter ideas are not only so well known - after all, we were in most cases trained in accordance with positivism - but also dogmatic in their foundationalism and pre- dictable in their line of analysis, there is often little to be found in these works, particularly in the more economistic and quantitative of them.3 Having said this, let me first try to make the argument that we should indeed make distinc-</page><page sequence="2">326 Heikhi Patomdki tions within this category of 'postmodernism'. Despite 0sterud's explicit advocacy for his right to build a caricature or a straw man - while carefully avoiding exposing any direct and sys- tematic textual evidence for his claims - there must in fact always be room for making further distinctions. Nobody should be allowed to close the conversation by saying that 'these are the es- sential and final categories and distinctions, take them or leave them'. Furthermore, there should also be more room for understanding what post- structuralism, as one strand of 0sterud's 'post- modernism', is all about. After these points, I try to tackle the charge of conventionality of the more concrete research along the critical-reflec- tivist lines. Finally, I show what kinds of unjus- tified effects of power 0sterud's rhetorics tends to have. 2. 0sterud 's Misleading Category of 'Postmodernism' There is one distinction in 0sterud's article that I take to be at least suggestive. The distinction between the 'hard core version of postmod- ernism' and the 'moderate versions' at least rec- ognizes some differences within this category of 'postmodernism'. 0sterud's accusation of Protagorean relativism is directed against the 'hard core version', as are most of his other arguments. If somebody really wants to say, literally, that there are 'no essences/real struc- tures', that 'there is nothing outside of text', that 'any textual narrative is as good as any other', then the accusation would, indeed, hold. There are some scholars in the field who might claim that there is no reality outside of the texts, that 'anything should go', and that there are no truths. Some of these (few) scholars might just have found the critical-reflective literature and make hasty readings out of it. Perhaps they might even be careless enough to stick to the epithet 'postmodern'. Certainly, also some texts by a Paul Feyerabend, a Richard Rorty, a Jean Baudrillard or a James Der Derian might well encourage this kind of reading. Moreover, it might even be plausible to associ- ate this kind of mentality with the 'cultural logic of late capitalism' (cf. Jameson, 1984) or with the globalized, post-Fordist production relations (cf. Harvey, 1990) and thereby to see it as a re- flection and part of a real historical phenom- enon, not just as a product of the biased imagin- ation of a critic. For instance, the Baudrillardian interpretation of the Gulf War - in some re- spects reproduced by Der Derian (1992, ch. 8), who also clearly states that 'while the architec- ture of the new world order may be built of sim- ulations, its hegemonic effect will be all too real for those nation-states that have little to gain from it' (p. 197) - might well be open to this kind of criticism. Nonetheless, to talk about a 'hard core ver- sion' and a 'moderate version' of 'postmod- ernism' is outrageously misleading. The first problem is the term 'postmodernism' itself. It must be taken to imply 'an epochal cultural shift', but this idea presupposes a typical Enlightenment conception of total social transformation in linear time. For me, as for many other critics of linear temporalities and Euclidean spatialities, the preferred epochal term is therefore 'late-modernity'. Although even this term captures only something that is characteristic of our times - namely the long presence and pervasion of modernity and the anticipation of the possibility that modernity in the future might not be that pervasive anymore because it has partially exhausted its energies and also possibilities for solving the problems it has itself created - it is preferable to the term 'postmodern'. For parallel reasons, many fol- lowers of Derrida and Foucault would prefer to refer to their research programme as 'post-struc- turalism'4 rather than 'postmodernism'. Secondly, the other possible critical-reflec- tive positions are typically not 'moderate ver- sions of postmodernism', most of them are not even 'moderate versions' of post-structuralism. Rather, in many cases they represent essentially different kinds of responses to the crisis of posi- tivism and modernity. It would be much more appropriate to say that these responses include at least (i) the Frankfurt School of Critical Theory and the vaguely related Gramscian School in IPE, (ii) 'postmodernism', that should, in most cases, better be called 'post- structuralism', and (iii) critical realism (see Bhaskar (1991), pp. 139-140). Although I have always been in favour of a synthesis of some of the elements of these strands - and some other ideas as well - I con- tinue to identify myself as a critical realist (see Patomaki, 1992, 1996). Let me therefore just</page><page sequence="3">A Reply to Osterud 327 point out how misleading 0sterud's broad cat- egory of 'postmodernism' is by taking up some of the central tenets of critical realism. The key moment in the development of criti- cal realism was the isolation of the widespread 'epistemic fallacy', i.e. the definition and analy- sis of being only in terms of knowledge (which actually unites positivists and some 'postmod- emrnists'). This category of fallacies includes the 'linguistic fallacy', in which being is defined in terms of our discourse of being. The isolation of this fallacy made it possible to concentrate on critical studies of ontological categories, with- out conflating being(s) and knowledge of being(s). Another important part of critical realism is its attack on the 'anthropomorphic fallacy', in which man is taken either as the centre or the goal of cosmos and/or where the cosmos is painted or interpreted in the image of the man. Hence, it would be ridiculous to claim that critical realism should be identified with the position that there is 'nothing outside of text'. It would be more appropriate to say that it makes precisely the opposite arguments, although criti- cal realism, too, enables one to do discourse analysis. Furthermore, as far as post-structural- ism is concerned, one would be as well also to remember that it is only for 'strategic-political reasons' that Derrida wants to generalize the concept of text, in a metaphorical manner, and without any limits, to everything that there is (in the social worlds in particular). Only for this reason, and in this very special sense, can he claim that 'there is nothing beyond the text' (see Bernstein (1991), p. 211). Similarly, one should take seriously this quote of Foucault (1996), p. 456: What I try to achieve is the history of relations which thought maintains with truth; the history of thought in- sofar as it is the thought of truth. All those who say truth does not exist are for me simple minded. Although the truths Foucault is talking about here are always in relation to certain historical ways of being and 'arts of living', and thereby to certain past or present discursive and non-dis- cursive practices, they are truths about some- thing. Of course, it is also true that Foucault did not articulate any systematic account of truth. And Derrida could perhaps have been much more ex- plicit about what it is that is outside of a 'text'. But the point here is not that Foucault and Derrida should have turned or been converted into critical realists, however reasonable that might have been in my view, but rather that, despite the problematical tendencies toward lin- guistic and other fallacies in post-structuralism, and despite the ontological, epistemological and ethico-political consequences of these tendencies, they are also typically far more complicated, sophisticated and scientifically/ ontologically realistic than allowed for by 0sterud. They should be seen as important re- sponses to the crisis of positivism and modernity. Hence, although 0sterud is well-advised in trying to see differences within his broad and vague category of 'postmodernism', his only distinction comes down to a rhetorical strategy aimed at creating an overall, yet unjustified cat- egory of trendy Protagorean relativists consist- ing of the people and approaches he does not like. He would be better advised to allow for real engagement with the ideas and arguments of different strands of critical-reflectivist re- search programmes. In fact, should we perhaps ask whether his characterizations of 'family re- semblances' of 'postmodernisms' have any- thing to do with the truth of the matter? 3. The Accusation of Conventionality Another at least initially suggestive point that 0sterud makes has to do with the actual re- search practices of some critical-reflectivists. 0sterud claims that 'the actual analyses behind postmodernist window-dressing are often rather conventional'. I agree. In many instances this tends to be the case. Sometimes this kind of conventionality might stem from lack of im- agination and the capability thoroughly to fol- low the requirements of one's own metatheory and theories. Sometimes the impression might be due to the expectation that one has to write in an understandable - often common-sensical - way, in order to be able to talk to an audience and to publish. Sometimes one might be implic- itly taken by the presuppositions of the previous research in the specific, more concrete area of study, even though these might contradict one's own metatheory. Sometimes it might be because the previous scholarship is valuable work on identifying elements of discursive practices and,</page><page sequence="4">328 Heikhi Patomdki more generally, of causally efficacious socio- historical complexes, even though they might not have understood how their works should actually be read. And there are other possible reasons as well. 0sterud is thus at least partially right. Some of 'the actual analyses are rather conventional', sometimes even when they should not be (i.e. it is not always a sin to be conventional). However, this does not, in any way, refute any of the points of Critical Theory, post-structural- ism or critical realism. Quite the contrary. Often it means that there is much room for producing even better critical-reflectivist studies in the future. 4. 0sterud's Loaded Terms and Their Effects of Power There are many impudent generalizations and overstatements in 0sterud's brief text. The points about 'anti-epistemology', 'literary turn', 'subjectivism', 'hidden claims in foggy formu- lations', 'trivial, commonplace ideas banging at an open door', 'vacuous linguistic affectation', 'naive pipe dreams in the classical sense' and 'the liberation from science' are, in most cases, simply loaded terms used to undermine the pos- ition of those against whom the criticism is di- rected. To define and use terms in this kind of one-sided, argumentative way is objectionable in a social scientific, scholarly dialogue. A large part of the argument of 0sterud's paper is based on a petitio principii: the conclusion is already built into the terms used in making the argu- ment. It is even more serious that this is also a matter of letting the terms be defined simply within the discourse that is actually at stake in the debate. There is a vicious circle there. From this perspective, 0sterud's (1996, p. 386) state- ment that 'the price of such an open mind could be quite high' might be seen in an ironic light. However, there is a gloomier aspect to it as well. As 0sterud rightly points out, IR and Peace Research are 'overpopulated and strongly competitive disciplines'. There is more than a hint in the article that 0sterud's main point is actually that 'postmodernism' - as this all-en- compassing category - has little to do with 'con- ceptual preciseness, systematic search for evidence and careful argumentation, method- ological explicitness, and establishing criteria for inter-subjectivity'. In other words, the claim is that 'postmodernism' does not in fact allow for real research at all. and therefore the conclu- sion must be that it should not be funded or pub- lished. Loaded terms can have real effects of power, independently of whether this kind of exclusion is intended or not. As Foucault phrased it: 'Actors do not always know what what they do does' (see Dreyfius &amp; Rabinow, 1983, p. 187). There is, of course, the temptation simply to turn the accusation around. I would nonetheless prefer to see things in a rather different way. Many of the scholars in the positivist tradition or orthodoxy are very scholarly, often with high ideals - peace, justice, better world, or some- times simply national interest - behind their studies. However, the orthodoxy tends to repro- duce caricatures of thought, from Thucydides (see Alker, 1988), Machiavelli (see Walker, 1993, ch. 2) or Hobbes (see Connolly, 1993, ch. 2) up to 20th century Political Realism, as well as simplistic pictures of the late-modern, global- izing and fragmenting world. This tendency - which severely constrains the possibilities of seeing and responding to the problems of our times - to go on reproducing simplistic carica- tures and pictures is not because of bad inten- tions or lack of scholarly virtues. These are mostly independent of the 'tradition' or 'school of thought' in question. It is rather the meta- physical ballast still weighing down the field that makes it almost impossible to envisage bet- ter interpretative possibilities. NOTES 1. I am grateful to Colin Wight for helping me to articulate this difficulty. 2. As for a racist, 'all the negroes/coloured people/different people look the same'. And, of course, for a racist, it is obvious who knows who they really look like. 3. The more qualitatively and historically oriented works in the (broadly conceived) positivist tradition are often much more helpful and useful for many purposes of doing research on a concrete topic. There is, of course, a lot to be said in the fantastic scholarly qualities of some of the best works in the quantitative tradition, too, but in the 1 990s the underlying fundamental problems of those ap- proaches should be already clear. The story of Hayward Alker's development illustrates this in a most insightful way; see Patomaki, forthcoming. 4. In the French context, this could have been read also as post-Levi-Strauss and post-Sartre, i.e. as a movement that tries go beyond both the semiotic and Marxist forms of structuralism. Many of the points are, of course, applica-</page><page sequence="5">A Reply to Osterud 329 ble, mutatis mutandis, to other forms of structuralism as well. Also, in his theory of structuration, Giddens was in- spired by Derrida's account of structure movement and transformations in time. REFERENCES Alker, H. Jr. &amp; R. Hayward, 1988.
