<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEORGE STADE K. Lorenz, and the Dog Beneath the Skin I E THOLOGY IS THE BIOLOGY OF BEHAVIOR, the science of "compara- tive behavioral physiology." Its particular objects of study are the forms and movements of animals in their natural settings. Its point of departure and of rest is in the theory of evolution. The first and last thing an ethologist wants to know about the morpho- logical or behavioral characters of a species is how these help the species to survive. For an evolutionist, to ask what a thing is for is to ask how it got that way; to investigate the adaptive function of a trait is to investigate the process that brought it into being. But between his first "what is it for" and his final "how did it get that way" the ethologist wants to know many other things. He wants to know whether a sequence of behavior is set off by stimuli from within or from without the animal. He must concern himself, that is, with neurophysiology and endrocrinol- ogy on one hand, and with ecology and the psychology of per- ception on the other. He wants to know whether a trait is peculiar to an individual or characteristic of its species, its genus, its order. He must concern himself, in other words, with ontogeny (the developmental history of an individual) and phy- logeny (the evolutionary history of a species), with genetics and taxonomy. He wants to know how fur, feather, or fin, how a disposition, capacity, or habit, is related to the whole of the animal, to the animal's conspecifics, and to the animal's extra- specific environment ("specific" is an adjective derived from "species"). Somewhere along the way he inevitably asks how what he has learned about other animals will apply to humans. The founder of ethology and its greatest practitioner is Konrad Lorenz. The recent publication, in a scrupulously accurate English translation, of his collected papers, dating from 1931 to 1963,</page><page sequence="2">GEORGE S ADE is an important event.1 They reveal the variety and complexity of the data, as well as the theoretical finesse, upon which ethology is founded, but they also reveal the fissures and soft spots underlying Lorenz' books for the general reader, Man Meets Dog (1953), King Solomon's Ring (1952), and On Aggression (1963). They reveal how the methods and concepts that now make up the ethologist's equipment gradually emerged from patient observation; and in the process of showing that ethology has a past, they make clear how promising is its future. They require no more special knowledge from the reader than did, say, The Interpretation of Dreams, but they demand an equal willingness to engage difficult and unfamiliar ideas; they are equally concerned with the intricacies, rigidities, and fragilities of the mechanisms of behavior. Among the rigidities of behavior the most rigid is the fixed motor pattern,2 "the Archimedean point on which all ethological research is based," as Lorenz puts it. Fixed motor patterns- these "innate action and response norms," these "ready-formed species-specific functional lay-outs," these "rigidly-structured, phylogenetically inherited behavior patterns," as Lorenz vari- ously refers to them-are inherited in the sense of being common to all healthy members of a species (like an infant's nursing movements), rather than special to individuals (like an ability to swallow swords). Each animal brings into the world a re- pertoire of fixed motor patterns that defines his membership in a species as precisely as do his morphological features. Such patterns evolve among the members of any species by the same processes of mutation and selection that shape bones, teeth, and silhouette. They are as invariable, in their temporal unfolding, as are the markings of a duck in their spatial distribution, and they are as immutable in the face of experience. Once set off, in fact, a fixed motor pattern is very little subject to deflection by an internal or an external stimulus, unless the stimulus is as irresistible as, say, a ruptured aorta or a round of 1STUDIES IN ANIMAL AND HUMAN BEHAVIOUR, by Konrad Lorenz.

Ethologists writing in English usually write "fixed action pattern."

Certain insects will continue their mating ceremonies right to the end, no matter what-long after, for example, their prospective mates have been conspicuously removed. A fixed pattern is an indigestible chunk; it is virtually autonomous; it behaves "like an inorganic inclusion in the ambo-ceptor causal reticulum of the organic system." So long as the environmental conditions in response to which fixed patterns evolved remain unchanged, the rigidity of the patterns is of great survival value to the animal. They enable him to do things that he could never learn to do through insight, imitation, or trial and error: A young swift reared in a narrow cave in which it cannot extend its wings (far less beat them up and down), in which it cannot attain a sharp retinal image, as the farthest point of the cave is much nearer than its shortest focusing distance, and in which it cannot gain any experience on parallactic shifting of retinal images, never- theless proves to be perfectly able on the very moment it leaves the nest cavity to assess distances by the parallactic shift of the object's images. It can also cope, in its rapid flight, with all the in- tricacies of air resistance, upcurrents, turbulence, and air pockets and can "recognize" and catch prey, and finally effect a precise landing in a suitable place. The information implicitly contained in the adaptive molding of all these forms of behavior to the environ- mental givens to which they indubitably do fit would fill many volumes. The description of the innate distance computers alone would contain whole textbooks of stereometry and that of the re- sponses and activities of flying, an equal number of data on aero- dynamics. Thus knowledge stored in the genome, or set of chromo- somes, and acquired through phylogeny is more subtle and more extensive than anything an animal can pick up in its lifetime; but it is like the knowledge that might allow a dancer to get up and pirouette in her sleep, rather than like the kind that allows a choreographer to organize pirouettes into a significant form. Animals run through their fixed patterns like sleepwalkers; they give no sign of an awareness that they go through these innate motions for a purpose-a purpose either of their own or of their species. Birds, for example, build nests not to provide for their young, but from a compulsion to build nests. They build them even if they have never seen eggs, even if they have been reared away from all other birds and every kind of nest. A female canary pushes loose strands of material into the cup 62</page><page sequence="4">GEORGE STADE of her nest with a special weaving movement. If reared in iso- lation it will still perform this weaving movement on the floor of its cage-but without strands and without nest. The bird knows neither what it is doing, nor why; neither what set the action off, nor what it is good for. For all the zombie-like aspect of an animal enacting its fixed patterns, these are not reflexes, or unconditioned reflexes, or even chains of reflexes, though this is what for a long time Lorenz as- sumed, even asserted, they were. Reflexes can only be set off by ex- ternal stimuli, but fixed patterns sometimes "explode" in vacuo, as Lorenz puts it, without any observable stimulus whatsoever: A hand-reared starling that I owned many years ago had never in its life caught flies nor seen any other bird do so. All his life he had taken his food from a dish, filled daily. One day I saw him sit- ting on the head of a bronze statue in my parents' Viennese flat, and behaving most remarkably. With his head on one side, he seemed to be examining the white ceiling, then his head and eye movements gave unmistakable signs that he was following moving objects. Finally he flew off the statue and up to the ceiling, snapped at something invisible to me, returned to his post, and performed the prey-killing movements peculiar to all insect-eating birds. Then he swallowed, shook himself, as many birds do at the moment of inner relaxation, and settled down quietly. Dozens of times I climbed on a chair, and even carried a step-ladder into the room- Viennese houses of that period have very high ceilings-to look for the prey that my starling had snatched: but not even the tiniest insect was there. Such Leerlaufreaktion, or "vacuum activity," poses a prob- lem. Lorenz, at first tentatively, but with increasing confidence as the evidence from neurophysiologists (especially Paul Weiss and Erich von Holst) began to accumulate, and as the opposition of behaviorists stiffened, postulated the "spontaneous, automatic- rhythmic" production by the central nervous system of "energy parcels" allotted to particular fixed motor patterns. These are produced automatically once the animal has reached a certain stage of maturation, no matter what its experience, or lack of it. They appear spontaneously and rhythmically even if the piece of spinal chord producing them has been severed from the animal's brain and from the nerves reaching to the animal's sensory receptors-its sole means of contact with the outside world. The reaction-specific energy, as it's sometimes called, 63</page><page sequence="5">THE HUDSON REVIEW accumulates between performances of the fixed pattern to which it is allotted. The pattern, once elicited, uses the accumulated energy up. But if after a critical period of time the pattern is not elicited, if, that is, the animal is isolated from the kind of natural situation in response to which the pattern evolved, the action specific energy may "overflow"; the pattern may explode in a stimulus vacuum. The canary then weaves invisible strands and the starling catches invisible flies. The reaction specific energy is "dammed up," in other words, and the fixed pattern it tenders is "inhibited," by a "higher," or more centrally-organized, structural or functional system. Each system is at once a part of another system and a whole made up of sub-systems. The function of any one sub-system is alternately released or inhibited by the more inclusive system of which it is a part, but once released it acts with relative autonomy, according to the instructions fed into it by its evolu- tionary history. The automatism of an instinctive behavior pat- tern, says Lorenz, "is virtually a closed system. It is subject to the systemic control of the central nervous system only with re- spect to the timing and degree of disinhibition." Although each functional or structural component is relatively autonomous, or closed, the components together form "a complex hierarchical system of reciprocal inclusion and exclusion of sequences of more restricted behavioral motivation." Imagine a tree growing up- side down, the thickest part of the trunk on top and the branches spreading downward. At each junction of branch with trunk or branch with branch, there is a "center" that inhibits or releases the activity of the center below it and coordinates the activities among its various branches. Without this system of inclusions and inhibitions, the gazelle, say, might stop dead in its headlong flight from a lion to munch tender shoots from the top of a bush or to put on a courtship display before an enticing female. Lorenz' centers, hierarchies, and levels of integration at first had roughly the status of Freud's topographical metaphors for the structure of the human psyche. Like Freud, Lorenz had hoped from the beginning that the physiological basis for his functional topography would ultimately be discovered. Like Freud, he had assumed from the beginning that "all 'pure' psychological pro- cesses are simultaneously neuro-physiological processes." Freud 64</page><page sequence="6">GEORGE STADE died still hoping, but neurophysiologists seem to have given Lorenz what he was looking for. I quote from Paul Weiss's ex tempore summing up of conclusions reached during the cele- brated Hixon Conference of 1948, among whose participants were such distinguished scientists as H. Klover, Wolfgang Kohler, K. S. Lashley, W. S. McCullock, and Linus Pauling: ... A few things have come out ... for instance, the relative auton- omy of structured patterns of activity, and the hierarchical principle of their organization.... The nervous system is not one big mono- tonic pool whose elements can be freely recombined in any number of groupings, thereby giving an infinite variety of nervous responses. This used to be the old idea of the associationists, and it is utterly incompatible with what we have learned about the development of the nervous system and its function in animals. The working of the nervous system is a hierarchical affair in which functions at the higher levels do not deal directly with the ultimate structural units, such as neurons or motor units, but op- erate by activating lower patterns that have their own relatively autonomous structural unity. The same is true for the sensory input which . . . operates by affecting, distorting, and somehow modifying the pre-existing, performed patterns of central co-ordi- nation.... The final output is then the outcome of this hierarchical passing down of distortions and modifications of intrinsically pre- formed patterns of excitations which are in no way replicas of the input. The structure of the input does not produce the structure of output, but merely modifies intrinsic nervous activities that have a structural organization of their own.... . . . Any group of bulbar or spinal nerves taken from vertebrates, if deprived of their structural bonds of restraining influences and allowed to undergo a certain degree of degradation, will display permanent automatic, rhythmic, synchronized activity of remark- able regularity. Rhythmic activity, therefore, seems a basic property of pools of nervous elements. . .. The rhythm is not something generated through an input rhythm, but is itself a primary rhythm which may be released and even speeded up or retarded by the input, but is not derived from the input. So we have experimental evidence that rhythmic automatism, autonomy of patterns, and hier- archical organizations are primary attributes of even the simplest nervous systems, and I think that this unifies our view of the nervous system. According to Weiss, and Lorenz, this unified view of the nervous system gives the coup de grdce to the behaviorist and reflexolo- gist notion that animals, including human animals, do whatever 65</page><page sequence="7">THE HUDSON REVIEW they do just as they do it only because of stimulus input. They do as they do because of patterns of central co-ordination pre- formed by phylogeny and subject only to modification and timing by sensory input. The animal is not passive in the face of experience; it is not infinitely malleable; it is not silly putty or a bank of buttons and levers and slots. Against the contingencies of its individual experience it asserts the practical lessons built into its species by evolution. II We need to look at a few more items in the animal's behavioral repertoire before we can see which, if any, of them are also in the human's bag of tricks. The center governing a fixed pattern, then, is primed by endogenous-automatic nervous impulses. Its load may also be affected by hormones, by the integrating center above it, and by local stimuli from its chemical environment within the animal. The various centers are primed in sequence according to the workings of an internal clock, which has been synchronized by evolution to the normal seasonal and diurnal changes in the animal's ecological niche. Birds look for nesting materials when the weather is right, male mammals look for females when females are in estrus, frogs look for insects when insects have hatched, but not because the weather is right or females are in heat or flies are buzzing. Birds, males, and frogs look for nesting materials, females, and flies because of a kind of "arousal pressure"; the priming of particular centers with reaction-specific energy has given them something like an "ap- petite" for a performance of the fixed patterns that those cen- ters control. The arousal pressure nudges the animal off in search of the very particular set of external circumstances that will release the pattern under pressure. This search for a releaser, this appetitive behavior, as it is called, has the look of being pur- posive, because it exhibits "adaptive variability whilst the goal remains the same." The animal seems to know what it is looking for. Evolution, or conditioning, or individual experience, or the habits of the tribe, has taught the animal where to look for what it needs-such as a nest site or appropriate prey-but the 66</page><page sequence="8">GEORGE STADE 67 animal can circumvent obstacles on its way and choose among alternative routes; it can explore and try things out. It seems almost human. The whole sequence of actions, from the point of arousal to the discharge of the fixed motor patterns-from the migration north to the completion of the nest, from the meowing at the kitchen door to the slaughter of the field mouse-is usually made up of various behavioral elements intercalated with one another, some innate, some relatively ad hoc. In the appetitive behavior of higher animals, for example, there may be intercalation, in variable sequences and combinations, of reflexes, of condi- tioned responses, of subordinate fixed patterns, of taxes (or orienting responses, some of which are like what used to be called "tropisms"), and of intelligent or "insight-controlled" behavior, actions that solve problems without the governance of fixed patterns, or an antecedent term of learning. Appetitive behavior, says Lorenz, "extends from the simplest motor rest- lessness to the complex, purposive behavior patterns of human beings, involving an enormous variety of functions." From the abrupt turning of a frog toward a fly so that it may discharge the fixed pattern of shooting out its tongue, to Konrad Lorenz struggling to solve the mind-body problem, we have only dif- ferences of degree. "From the standpoint of objective ethology, no distinction can be made between the simplest orienting re- sponse and the higher form of 'insight' behavior." All forms of appetitive behavior are alike, then, in that their goal is the discharge of reaction-specific energy. Prior to dis- charge, the accumulating energy is felt as a kind of tension or unease; discharge of the energy through the final motor pat- tern, or consummatory act, feels good. Because the consummatory act feels good, it serves as a reinforcement of the behavior that led up to it. The animal is therefore "driven and attracted" to perform the fixed patterns necessary for the survival of its species. And every fixed pattern, as Lorenz says, "is in itself an autonomous purpose as well as an autonomous reinforcement of precedent behavior." If you are an animal, at least, it feels good to do what is good for you, and what is good for you is also good for your species. Under normal conditions, the consummatory motor pattern</page><page sequence="9">THE HUDSON REVIEW is performed not in vacuo, but amidst the particular kind of environmental situations in response to which it evolved. In most cases the animal does not recognize the situation as being of a certain kind, one in which, for example, its particular food is available or in which it is in danger from a predator; such recognition would depend on an ability to abstract and general- ize that few animals have. Instead, most animals have an innate capacity to recognize certain representative elements, or key stimuli, as English-writing ethologists call them, that are regular concomitants of the situation. An ethologist with a literary bent might call them "synecdotal stimuli." They are called key stimuli because they fit an innate receptor correlate as a key fits a lock. When stimulus key fits receptor lock an innate releasing mecha- nism is activated. The innate releasing mechanism removes the block that had been inhibiting the fixed motor pattern in ques- tion. Upon disinhibition the animal pecks, gapes, preens, bristles, broods, flees, fights, copulates, displays its colors, tends its young, or changes color, depending on which fixed pattern in which animal has been released. One category of triggering stimuli has especially interested would-be ethologists of human behavior, mostly cranks. Such stimuli are the morphological or behavioral features that co- ordinate the fixed patterns among members of a given species. A scent, a sound, an electrical charge; the display of a marking, a silhouette, a configuration, or a fixed pattern, will under appro- priate circumstances and at appropriate stages in the animal's maturation, release a reciprocal fixed pattern in a conspecific. A herring gull chick pecks at the red dot on its parent's bill; the parent regurgitates food; the chick eats. Both the red dot and the chick's pecking are what Lorenz calls Ausloser, usually translated as "social releasers." The red dot releases the pecking; the pecking releases the regurgitation (which, so to speak, re- leases the food). But most of the gorgeous colors and improbable shapes of animals; their various ritualized motor displays of presenting, appeasement, enticement, and challenge; the per- fume of their ruts and the accents of their cries-all these are likely to be social releasers. They are most likely to be social re- leasers if they seem unadaptive, if they seem to reduce the ani- mal's ability to function and survive, if, for example, they make 68</page><page sequence="10">GEORGE STADE him conspicuous to predators or clumsy in form or movement. Social releasers and their receptor correlates differentiate through a kind of dialectic and along parallel lines; they evolve in response to a selection pressure working out of relations among members of a specific population, rather than in response to pressures working out of the relations between a population and its environment. The pressures making for differentiation, that is, are intraspecific rather than extraspecific. The gratuitous quality of many social releasers, their quality of gestural exag- geration, results from the relative strength of intraspecific, as compared to extraspecific, selecting factors, and makes them that much more useful as signals. They differentiate in the direc- tion of maximal simplicity of structure with maximal improbabil- ity of form. Lorenz cites the yawn as an example of a social re- leaser among humans. A number of his popularizers cite the breasts of human females, which are the only kind that remain extended all year round and which would be easier for babies to nurse on if they were smaller; and popularizers cite the but- tocks of human females, which in their gratuitous bloom have no equivalent in the animal world-the popularizers cite breasts and buttocks as social releasers of, at the least, appetitive be- havior in human males. The consummatory act is released by something else. III The paradigm of a typical behavioral sequence, then, is as follows: (1) at a certain stage in the animal's maturation, a stage synchronized by evolution with a certain point in the day or year, (2) an accumulation of reaction-specific energy leads to a state of arousal or motivation, which (3) generates appe- titive behavior consisting of various intercalated motor com- ponents, some innate, some learned, until (4) the animal comes upon the key stimulus (which may be a social releaser) that (5) activates the particular innate releasing mechanism whose function it is to disinhibit (6) the consummatory act, a fixed pattern concluding the sequence and using up the reaction-spe- cific energy. Many contingencies may complicate the paradigm or interfere 69</page><page sequence="11">THE HUDSON REVIEW with the sequence of its unfolding. If the reaction-specific energy for a certain fixed motor pattern is low, either because not much has yet accumulated or because repeated performance of the pattern has exhausted it; or if the key stimuli releasing the fixed pattern are either partial or of weak intensity, the pattern may only begin to go off. The animal only gets as far as an intention movement. If the intention movement occurs frequently enough, it may take on signal functions. The jackdaw's crouch prepara- tory to flight may warn its fellows that a predator is in the distance. Through selective pressures the intention movement may jell, differentiate further, undergo gestural exaggeration, and become the kind of social releaser called a symbolic motor pattern, now entirely distinct from its initial function. If, con- versely, the reaction-specific energy for a certain fixed pattern becomes unusually high, the pattern may go off in vacuo or in the presence of inappropriate stimuli; or the energy may "over- flow" (in the hydraulic metaphor) or "spark over" (in the electrical metaphor) and release a different fixed pattern. Such displacement activities, such sparking over, may also occur when a single situation activates the innate releasing mechanisms for two fixed patterns. A bird equally motivated to fight and to run may instead peck at the ground, or even fall asleep. Displace- ment activities may also jell, differentiate, encourage the selec- tion of receptor correlates, and become ritualized into symbolic motor patterns. In situations of extreme conflict or deprivation or novelty, a fixed pattern may be activated that is not normally in the species' repertoire but that was in the repertoire of the genus from which the species differentiated. Extreme conflict, or deprivation or novelty, that is, may produce regression, a return to the phylogenetic past. A habit accidentally acquired may inhibit the fixed pattern adaptive to the situation; one fixed pattern accidentally triggered may inhibit or deform the adap- tive one; the slightest inherited or acquired physical defect may twist fixed patterns into amazing behavioral oddities. In- nate "gaps" left in motor patterns, normally filled by experi- ence, may be filled with the wrong objects. An animal may imprint its caretaker; it may become permanently fixated on him, so to speak, as the proper object of an innate pattern, rather than on another member of its own species; it may then act 70</page><page sequence="12">GEORGE STADE toward the caretaker as if he were its mother or its mate. "Greater snow geese (Anser hyperboreus atlanticus), and probably many others possess perfectly good phylogenetic information about how a fellow member of the species behaves when inviting copu- lation, but they have to learn what a fellow member of the species looks like." Case histories of fetishism, of animals fixated by im- printing on substitute objects, abound in the literature of ethology. The literature of ethology, in fact, demonstrates vividly enough just how easy it is to make animals do things that among humans would be called neurotic or crazy. The fixed patterns of animals are so dependent for their regular func- tioning upon a normal upbringing and upon a characteristic set of experiences; they are so intricately meshed with the dif- ferent action patterns of mates, rivals, parents and offspring; with prey and predator, host and parasite; with the lay of the land and the course of the season; that only minor modifications of these by natural accident or experimental design may shock the animal into an exemplary lunacy. Animals so shocked be- come compulsive, as though gripped by an obsession. They burst into inexplicable rages or fall into fatal melancholias. They seem to hallucinate the key stimuli they are deprived of; they court phantoms, joust with shadows, feed on air, and dis- play before mirages. They cower shaking before their natural prey. They brood stuffed replicas of their natural enemies and murder their offspring. They develop ovarian cysts, prostate trou- ble, and various kinds of cancer. They scratch, peck, claw, and bite themselves or each other bloody. They treat everything pre- sented to them as though it were a threat; they become as though suspicious and fearful of everything. They develop an anxiety that seems to float free of any external cause or past experience. Above all they act like characters in Bergson's treatise on com- edy. In their solemn self-absorption, their mulish lack of self- awareness, their fits and starts, they blunder along as mute and dead-pan as Buster Keaton, like wind-up toys with rusty springs, like puppets jerked by strings in the hands of mischievous chil- dren, like victims of demonic possession, like comic humors in ritual bondage to fixed ideas. They only seem to act that way in the eyes of a human ob- 71</page><page sequence="13">THE HUDSON REVIEW server, no doubt. My language, no doubt, has been unscientifi- cally anthropomorphic. What we call neurotic, an ethologist would call unadaptive. But by "adaptive" he means no more than "just good enough for the survival of the species." And even under the best of conditions, there are endless opportunities for behavior that at the very least has a low survival value, given the way evolution puts things together: Organisms are never built on the principle which must be postulated on the basis of preformationistic concepts, that is to say, like build- ings whose function a far-seeing architect foresaw, whose smallest details were agreed upon before the first stone was laid, and whose actual erection then took place all in one sitting. Organisms are always constructed on the principle on which a house is built by a settler, who first erects a simple provisional shack in which to live, and who later on, as his affluence and his family increase, adds one piece after the other to the building. In such a house, many parts will, in the course of time, change their functions completely: What first was the living room, may become the stable or even the lumber room; compromises and temporary shifts will become necessary. The efficiency of the building as a whole will necessarily remain inferior to that which could be achieved by the construction of a planning architect, but the latter is unattainable just because the house has to be lived in all the time and can never be torn down al- together and wholly reconstructed. We have to revise, therefore, our first provisional topography of the systems that govern and execute an animal's behavior. Instead of one neat functional hierarchy, each sub-system of which is integrated by a center subordinate to centers above it and in control of the centers beneath it, we must think of many hierarchies, at all angles to each other and some of them not so hierarchical. The hierarchies are all of different sizes, shapes, powers, and ages-in both the history of the species and the history of the individual. Any two of them may intersect here, overlap there, interlock there, and share a part somewhere else. The waxing of one may famish another and fatten still a third. Any new one may make an old one vestigial, make another hyperactive, and fight still another to a standstill. Any hier- archy may release, inhibit, encroach upon, and cooperate with, others, or parts of others, to different degrees, at different times, under different conditions, and not always to the animal's ben- 72</page><page sequence="14">GEORGE STADE efit. We have to imagine, then, not a single tree growing upside down, with the thickest part of the trunk on top and the branches spreading downward, but a whole forest of trees and shrubs of different kinds, ages, rates of growth, fruit, foliage, pliancy, and rigidity, all crowded together in all the possible permutations of symbiosis, parasitism, and competition, stealing light and nour- ishment from each other or sharing it, the branches inextri- cably tangled or connected by creepers hung with tropical moss. This monstrous contrivance, assembled in a fit of distrac- tion by a stinting and impatient Frankenstein (as passages in Lorenz make us see it), works well enough to preserve if not the animal, at least the population of which it is a member, so long as the conditions that brought the machinery into existence prevail. But any contingency not prepared for by phylogeny, any deprivation of nourishment or experience, any shock or set of conflicting key stimuli may drive the whole contraption careening off course, spilling gears and flywheels, or pull it apart. As W. H. Thorpe, an English ethologist, notes, "In some species of starfish the lack of coordination between the arms occasionally results in the animal actually being pulled in two merely by the antagonistic activity of its own tube feet." Analogous things hap- pen to all animals. When such things happen, they are unadap- tive, sure enough, but they occur because of what successive adaptations have put together. The provisions for something like madness are species-specific to all species of animals, in- cluding the human animal. IV At the moment, says Lorenz, the scientific investigation of hu- man behavioral specifics has only stumbled a step or two beyond Darwin. So far, the drafting of a detailed and complete human ethogram, or behavioral map in evolutionary perspective, is no more than a program, although there is no more urgent a need. It takes years of patient observation before an ethologist is ready to rough in the behavioral contours of one simpleminded bird or fish; a scientifically respectable ethogram of homo sapiens will require the life work of many cartographers of behavior- 73</page><page sequence="15">THE HUDSON REVIEW among whom Lorenz expressly does not include the social sci- entists, who in his eyes are mostly not scientists at all.3 Even when the work of psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists meets the standards that apply in the natural sciences it does not furnish the ethologist with what he needs. And because ethology operates on a "more general" level of explanation, it would similarly be "an illegitimate extension" for ethologists to ex- plain ethologically "any complex special principles governing human intellectual or social life"; at the same time it would be an avoidance of responsibility were ethologists, or students of "comparative behavioral physiology," as Lorenz often de- scribes his field, not to explain what they can about the more general processes underlying those specifics of human intellec- tual and social life: If we, as natural scientists, wish to provide a natural explanation for the special, immeasurably complex principles governing human behavior and the human mind (i.e. by tracing them back to the adjacent, more general level of natural principles), then we are faced with the question: "What are these more basic principles?" There can be no other answer: "The principles concerned are those which govern the behavior of living organisms in general." When the social sciences begin to elucidate human social and intellectual life on the basis of principles that in theory at least can be traced back to those governing the behavior of living or- ganisms in general, which latter principles can themselves be traced back to those governing the movements of inorganic matter, there will be at last a unification of the sciences, and the social sciences at last will become natural. Lorenz' argument to this point is professionally self-serving but plausible, especially if one is not a mystic. Certainly the ab- sence of an inclusive theory, against which both the unlikely and the significant might leap into focus, explains as well as any- thing why the data amassed by the social sciences are in the main either soft or trivial. Lorenz feels that much of Marx and Freud will survive the unification, or naturalization, so to speak, of the social sciences. He speaks with enthusiasm of "the pro- 3 Lorenz does not seem to know the work of Erving Goffman, who, so far, has done more toward the constructing of a human ethogram than any ethologist. With respect to his studies of human interaction, says Goffman, "it is from ethology that the basic concepts come." See Relations in Public (New York: Harper Colophon paperback, 1972), p. 59. 74</page><page sequence="16">GEORGE STADE gressive unification of ethology and psychoanalysis," and of Marx he says: "Everything he said in Capital is right, but he always made the error of forgetting the instincts." In my opinion a uni- fied theory of human behavior built up on what is consistent in psychoanalysis, Marxism, and ethology would be something worth having, but I doubt that it would look like anything either psychoanalysts, Marxists, or Lorenz have in mind. In any case, Lorenz is very anxious to counter the charge that measuring the degree of human singularity against the princi- ples that govern the behavior of living organisms in general is a way of shortchanging that singularity. Far from trying to make the human element fade into its animal background, ethol- ogists, says Lorenz, provide the point of view from which hu- man singularity is thrown most dramatically into relief. We can only see what constitutes the naked and native dignity of man, and where it came from, against the background of those evolu- tionary processes in which all animals live, and move, and have their being. All human traits, whether they are universal, such as the facial expressions that accompany anger or terror and such as incest taboos, or whether they are culturally diversified, such as ideas of history and definitions of incest, are either the direct products of evolution or are based on dispositions and capacities that are themselves the direct products of evolution. "Behavior is adapted to environmental givens and it can only be thus adapted by two well-defined processes, phylogenetic adap- tation and adaptive modification"-by habits picked up during the evolutionary history of the species and by social and indi- vidual modifications of those habits. As it turns out, the human elements in human behavior that comparative behavioral physiology throws into relief are both disappointing and reassuring in their familiarity. They are as follows: (1) The degree to which humans are capable of rea- son, the most complex kind of appetitive behavior, and are cap- able of "insight," the sudden apprehension of relations and analogies. (2) "The unique, phylogenetically unprecedented phenomena of rational responsibility," through which men may repress a natural inclination in behalf of an ethical idea or so- cial imperative. (3) Culture, which is based on an "accumula- tion of tradition [that] is practically equivalent to the inheri- 75</page><page sequence="17">THE HUDSON REVIEW tance of acquired characteristics," and which is as essential to the mind as food is to the body. Because "man's whole system of innate activities and reactions is phylogenetically so constructed, so 'calculated' by evolution, as to need to be complemented by cultural tradition," anyone so unlucky as to be reared without it would be a "poor cripple," functionally indistinguishable from an idiot whose cerebral cortex had been destroyed in some in- tra-uterine disaster. (4) Speech, which seems to have evolved for the express purpose of handling and passing on culture: "It was indubitably the selection pressure of accumulating tradition which caused the rapid growth of the human telencephalon," which contains the speech center. (5) Self-awareness, the hu- man's capacity for objectifying himself. "The best definition of man is that he is the one creature capable of reflection, of seeing himself in the frame of reference of the surrounding uni- verse." To the extent that a man is self-aware he moves out of the realm of irony, in which he is possessed and driven by demonic obsessions, to the realm of comedy, in which his pre- tentions are mocked, although his impulses are confirmed, by natural energies. (6) Most inclusive among the human ele- mental capacities and dispositions, one that amounts to "the constitutive character of man," is an innate, unique, and life- long curiosity, a drive to investigate and explore, which impels any healthy human into a "continuous, inquisitive communica- tion with extra-subjective reality," into an "active, dialectic con- struction and dismemberment of the environment," so that in- formation may be picked up and stored as engrams in the cen- tral nervous system for future use, and so that bit by bit a signifi- cant, thoroughly objectivized world solidifies to enclose the very animal who alone can see it in the round. All this amounts to the conclusion that human action when exemplary in its humanity, rather than human-all-too-human in its subservience to the dog beneath the skin, is a full, delicate, finely attuned, continuously adjusting responsiveness to all the particulars of whatever the situation, as successively it unfolds. But this singular responsiveness is no miracle, the product of a cosmic purpose or occult will; it is in theory perfectly explicable by a convergence of certain of the processes that shape the differentia of all species. Neoteny, for example, the preservation 76</page><page sequence="18">GEORGE STADE throughout maturity of traits that in ancestral species were only characteristic of infants and foetuses, has been observed in num- erous species, but only in conjunction with the other adaptive strategies that shaped humanity did it make possible the life- long playfulness and curiosity of men and women. Similarly, our descent from a tree-living primate that climbed by means of grasping extremities, rather than by hooking claws, explains, given everything else, our capacity for stereoscopic depth-per- ception, for a central representation of spatial relations that de- veloped finally into a sort of "imagination-space," in which hy- pothetical situations might be visualized. "And this is the be- ginning of all thinking processes," as well as the prerequisite for the making of tools. Again, the evolution of our versatile, non-specialized, physical traits included the development of an equal behavioral versatility. The fact that we are adapted to no one environment means that we can adapt to many. We are, says Lorenz, "specialists in nonspecialization." No other one ani- mal can climb twenty feet up a rope and swim fifty feet under- water at a depth of two fathoms and walk twenty miles in a day; our modes of perception and conception are correlative in their range and plasticity. Finally, domestication is primarily a condition in which selection by extra-specific pressures no longer takes place; "human self-domestication" produced effects homol- ogous to those that domestication produced in barnyard fowl and dogs. Domestication is accompanied by increased physical and behavioral variation among individuals within a species; by the atrophy of more recent drives, such as those having to do with brood care and social life; by the hypertrophy of more primitive drives, such as those having to do with feeding and mating; by a reduction in the selectivity of innate releasing mechanisms, so that substitute stimuli may serve as releasers; by a general dismantling of fixed patterns and inhibitions, so that the patterns and bits of patterns may be employed for novel situations and in novel combinations, and so that intelligence and improvisation may fill the gaps. "The constitutive freedom of human behavior is the direct result of domestication-induced reduction of rigid instinctive behavior," but it is a freedom as phylogenetically adapted as the opposability of our thumbs. Less familiar, less reassuring, and more difficult to take, is 77</page><page sequence="19">THE HUDSON REVIEW Lorenz' insistence that much of human behavior, especially hu- man social behavior, is directed by a complex of releasers, innate releasing mechanisms, motor display patterns, endogenous- automatic accumulations of reaction-specific energy, and dispo- sitions to learn only certain kinds of things under only special circumstances at only specific stages in the course of individual development. Imprinting-like phenomena, or fixations, sometimes seem to occur at various more or less well-defined points from infancy through adolescence, and movements like those of swallowing and ejaculation may be genuine fixed patterns; but for the most part the accumulation of reaction-specific energy in a human does not lead to the performance of a fixed motor pattern. More characteristically it leads to an intention move- ment that has evolved into a motor display pattern-one of those postures, gestures, or facial expressions that can tell us at a glance whether a fellow human from anywhere in the world is angry or happy, hostile, or flirtatious. According to Iranaus Eibel-Eibesfelt, one of Lorenz' students, "smiling, laughing, and crying, also the expressions of anger, pouting, fear, and sadness, looked the same in blind-born children, although they could not have imitated anyone." When display patterns are genuine social releasers they fit receptor correlates that evolved along with them and that enable us to understand the "meaning," in one sense of the word, of the display. We do not have to learn, for example, that a snarl is a snarl. Reception of the display (the snarl), activates the appropriate innate releasing mechanism, which in a human, however, releases not a fixed pattern (an- other snarl), but an emotion (fear or anger). The emotion had been the "subjective experiential correlate" of a fixed pattern that has since dropped out, thus leaving the emotion as the sole automatic component of any response. Lorenz argues that the qualitatively separable human emotions are each based on "an action-specific arousal modality and behavioral motivation. With very many of these specific behavioral motivations, assumption of an endogenous-automatic basis is supported by the fact that the stimulus threshold shrinks during periods without response and rises following abreaction of the drive concerned." After a good venting of fear or anger, for example, we feel relieved, all passion spent. 78</page><page sequence="20">GEORGE STADE In some cases, then, endogenous-automatic stimulation gen- erates a motive and primes an emotion. Not all physiological processes prime motives, but all emotions are signs of an in- stinctive process. Our gut reactions, whether aesthetic or moral, to fellow humans comprise an especially instructive category. "The close interaction and the far-reaching analogies between instinctive and culturally determined norms of behavior not- withstanding, I am quite convinced that, at the root of every emotional value judgment, an innate releasing mechanism lies concealed." Lorenz goes on to argue that the aesthetic and eth- ical emotions are logically distinguishable but functionally in- separable. Aesthetically speaking, our emotional value judgment categorizes as repulsive characters which have arisen through typical domestication effects, whilst char- acters which are threatened by the same effects of domestication are classed as desirable. There is scarcely one typical domestication effect in the morphological realm, which does not evoke our pro- nounced aesthetic revulsion. Almost more important than this statement is the fact that the converse also applies; virtually all characters which we perceive as specifically ugly are genuine do- mestication effects. Muscular flabbiness, a hanging stomach, weak connective tissue and their side-effects such as flabby skin, bow-leggedness and so on, relatively small looking eyes, expressionless facial features lacking in "striking" qualities, pug head and many other "ugly characters" are typical results of domestication. If a large series of wild forms and their domestic derivatives is assembled, one is again and again amazed by the "beauty" and "nobility" of the wild animals in comparison to the domestic forms. . . The same correlation exists between our ethical evaluation feelings and domestication-induced alterations of behavior as be- tween aesthetic feelings and morphological domestication charac- ters. In this case, too, the ethically highly valued behavior patterns are just exactly those which are adversely affected by domestication- induced deficiency, whilst those judged to be "bad" and inferior are those which tend toward hypertrophy through domestication. Among the endogenous-automatic behavior patterns of human beings, each was originally equally valuable and necessary for the preservation of the species-food-uptake and mating just as much as parental care responses or more highly differentiated social im- pulses. The fact that we perceive one to be ethically valueless, in- deed sinful, and the other as a highly estimable moral attribute, is no doubt closely related to the fact that the former are over-de- 79</page><page sequence="21">THE HUDSON REVIEW veloped in civilized human beings just as in domestic animals, whilst the latter tend to disappear. I quote this passage at length because it is probably wrong in detail and just possibly sinister in implication. The domesti- cated thoroughbred horse, for example, is more "noble" in ap- pearance than the wild hammer-head cayuse. The German Shep- herd dog is at least as noble as the jackal, from which, says Lorenz, it was bred. And it is unlikely that domestication can worsen the looks, or the morals, of the hippopotamus. Further, the flabby muscles, hanging stomachs, and so forth, of humans are not effects of domestication in the same sense that they are in, say, the Muscovy duck: in humans they are not inherited, they are not universal, and they can be eliminated during the lifetime of an individual by exercise and diet. At the same time, I find it plausible that, cosmetic fashions aside, the people of all cultures respond with innate approval to the athletic type of body that is best adapted to grapple with a rigorously selective environment. And I find it plausible that if, as Chomsky says, the child is born "with a perfect knowledge of universal gram- mar, that is, with a fixed schematism that he uses . . . in ac- quiring language," he is also born with a fixed inclination to approve some kinds of human actions and bodily shapes and to disapprove others. If Lorenz is right, our innate approvals and disapprovals will often conflict with precepts we arrive at through reason and with injunctions that support the institutions of our society. We may find ourselves liking people whose morals we con- sciously disapprove and disliking people whose morals are ir- reproachable. We find it hard not to sympathize with violent men, if they are also men of "honor," by which I mean the con- stellation of values that tends to prevail among primitive hunt- ers, rather than among agriculturists. Those groups and individuals who are driven above all by a desire to amass or pre- serve honor, usually by counting coups or exacting revenge, tend to get our imaginative sympathy and our moral disapproval. To most people the ferocity of ancient Greeks, questing knights, Renaissance princes, Plains Indians, Italian mafiosi, Japanese samurai, teenage gangs, western heroes, and private eyes is both 80</page><page sequence="22">GEORGE STADE attractive and lamentable. We are likely to think that there is something wrong with a young man who would rather have been St. Francis than Achilles, but it is not so easy to say why. The examples are mine, and I am not sure that Lorenz would endorse them, but the point is his: our innate judgments in practice often over-ride our rational commitments and social al- legiances. None of that is news. More unexpected is Lorenz' argument that as much trouble is caused by the loss of certain innate ac- tion-and-response norms as by the preservation of those that have become dysfunctional under the conditions of advanced industrial society. A whole set of "the more finely differentiated social instincts and inhibitions" has been dismantled by do- mestication, or has been gradually selected out by the increasing human reliance for behavioral directives on abstract principles, social imperatives, cultural ideals, and novel ecologies. At one time, presumably, social instincts and inhibitions made relations between men and men, men and women, parents and children, brothers and sisters, the individual and his group a kind of dance in which everyone knew the steps and the musicians al- ways played in tune. Life was no doubt harsh and short; not, however, because of the way individuals within a group treated each other. But for a long time now, except among a few forest peoples, freedom from social instincts and inhibitions has had a positive selective value. The behavioral traits that on ancient grounds we still judge to be ugly or wrong have become the very ones that enable those who have them to sit pretty. Avarice, treachery, cowardice, ingratitude, assertiveness, disloyalty, ran- dom promiscuity, ruthless ambition, "emotional deficiency and value blindness," neglect of young children and aged parents, were once as unadaptive as they were repulsive-repulsive be- cause they were unadaptive. Now they are just repulsive. At one time, again presumably, they were held in check or were selectively and adaptively directed by superordinate instinctive mechanisms. But in some cases "headlong, culturally determined changes in human sociology and ecology" have at once routed the inhibitions and inflamed what they were inhibiting. Lorenz' remarks about the "pervading degeneration" of our social instincts under the effects of domestication probably sound 81</page><page sequence="23">THE HUDSON REVIEW cranky, the sort of thing one might expect from a man who has spent fifty years studying animals and noting how much more healthy and attractive they are in the wild. But it has been easy for many people to arrive at similar conclusions on different grounds. It is not only students of animal behavior who have ob- served "how abjectly stupid and undesirable the mass behavior of humanity actually is." Lorenz is not the first to have com- mented on "the pathological disintegration of our social struc- ture" or the "catastrophic social confusion of mankind." All kinds of people agree that "at the moment, humanity represents a functional entity which has gone fundamentally awry." Lorenz is not the only student of behavior who has been led to conclude that "discomfort within our culture" is inevitable, that neurosis, given the social circumstances within which our natural inclina- tions must now express themselves, is also inevitable, that, in sum, "we are all-without exception-psychopaths." Neither is he the only observer to have pointed out that the conditions of advanced industrial society bring out the worst in people. And I find it hard to see how one can disagree with his claim that "the danger to modern man arises not so much from his power of mastering natural phenomena as from his powerlessness to con- trol sensibly what is happening in his own society." For all that, Lorenz and his conclusions have been attacked with some heat, mostly on political grounds. The ethologists' claim that individual behavior and social institutions are still shaped by instinctual residues, and especially Lorenz' claim that aggression is caused by the endogenous-automatic accumulation of reaction specific energy, have lead to charges that his attacks on modern social conditions are merely the grumbling of a con- servative, if not the bile of a reactionary or the ravings of a fascist. The charges would hold better if Lorenz were a conserva- tive or if the implications of ethology were not in fact revolu- tionary. So far as I can tell the charges are supported mostly by rumor, by a confusion of Lorenz with Robert Ardrey and Des- mond Morris, both of whom he disowns in the introduction to Volume I of Studies in Animal and Human Behavior, by a mis- reading of the first eleven chapters of On Aggression, and, more reasonably, by reference to the traditional connection between conservatism and some sacred or secular notion of original sin.4 4 See Ashley Montagu, ed., Man and Aggression (Oxford University Press, 1968). 82</page><page sequence="24">GEORGE STADE The conservative tends to assume that we are naturally vicious and that only good institutions can keep us in line; the Left usu- ally assumes that we are naturally good or naturally nothing and that only bad institutions make us vicious. Lorenz for his part insists again and again that "the imagination of man's heart is not really evil from his youth up, as we read in Genesis." In various works and in different words he keeps saying, "we fundamentally disagree with the biblical thesis defended by some child psychologists and psychoanalysts, that man is utterly 'wicked from childhood on.'" Lorenz' opinion, rather, is that "man can behave very decently indeed in tight spots, provided they are of a kind that occurred often enough in the paleolithic period to produce phylogenetically adapted social norms to deal with the situation," or provided that stress, overwork, hunger, anxiety, hopelessness, and overcrowding have not subverted his reason or his instinctive aestheticoethical value judgments. I have not been able to find anywhere a full statement by Lorenz of his politics, but it is easy enough to judge where he stands from his scattered remarks on the issues of the day-he stands in that shifting and uncircumscribed zone in which left- liberalism, social democracy, and democratic socialism jostle one another. He supports, for example, much of women's libera- tion: he speaks of young wives as "a whole class of people who are treated as slaves and who are exploited shamelessly." He at- tacks as he tries to account for "demagogically directed mass cruelty, such as witchcraft trials or anti-semitic persecution." He has no use for nationalism, imperialism, or racism: "Na- tional ideas were still serviceable for our grandparents. During the time of Rudyard Kipling, the norms of social behavior he wrote about were valid for his epoch and his country. Transposed into our time, Kipling results in Hitler-just as imperialist and just as racist." In the early 196os he observed that "the way in which huge numbers of young Americans have recently identi- fied themselves with the rights of the American Negro is a glorious exception" to the political apathy of the young; and now in the 197os he supports the "student protestors"; he believes that "youth sees very clearly the great faults committed by the 'Establishment'"; he believes that the accusations of the young are "frequent, necessary, and absolutely just"; he joins with 83</page><page sequence="25">THE HUDSON REVIEW them in trying to expose "the real obsolescence of many social norms and rites still valued by some of the older generation." He has written at considerable length and with some vehemence against the evils that accompany military fanfare, militant en- thusiasm, and charismatic leaders. He is pacifistic and perhaps a pacifist (he managed to stay out of World War II for the first few years and then served as a field surgeon). His arguments with behaviorists are more than academic: their ideas, he says, are helping to bring about "the best of all possible worlds for the Russian apparatchiks or the American monopolists"; for "as far as mass manipulators are concerned, the Pavlovian dog is the ideal citizen." And his remarks on the consequences of domesti- cation do not constitute social Darwinism, but the opposite. All this does not amount to a politics, of course, but it dis- qualifies Lorenz for fascism. Although his feelings on the practical issues of the day are those characteristic of left-liberals, his deepest impulses, I suspect, are anarchic. To an interviewer from L'Express he said, "I'm against everything, against all the ideologies, all the regimes in the world. Except perhaps the Dubcek regime, which no longer exists. It's the only regime that would have been able to get my vote." An anarchist maybe, or simply a political naif, but a humane, humanistic, kindly, and even tender-hearted one, as every page of his writings on hu- mans and animals shows. There is a grave and rich music to Lorenz' pessimism; it is orchestrated by an old-fashioned love of humanity and counterpointed by the "Avowal of Optimism" that concludes On Aggression, an avowal based on the virtues built into us by our evolutionary past. And it was precisely be- cause he believes in those virtues, and because he is so "naive" as to be appalled by the universal slaughter and disorder that he wrote On Aggression (although his evidence, as he knew, was far from conclusive) rather than because he believed that since our nature is fixed and fallen, social revolution is useless. In fact, his avowal of optimism rests on the belief that our evolutionary past will demand a revolutionary future. More important than Lorenz' personal feelings about things are the political implications of ethology. These are, simply, that we have ineradicable needs and inclinations. Societies vary in the extent to which they permit the irreducibly human in us 84</page><page sequence="26">GEORGE STADE to find satisfaction. Societies that satisfy the irreducibly human in us very little turn us into psychopaths. Such ideas strike me as comprising a basis for slogans as good as any we have around. I also think we are ready for the ethologist's shift of emphasis from the socio-historical dimension in people to the individual and human dimensions. I, for one, am tired of being encouraged to think of myself as entirely the product of historical accidents and social contingencies. The ethologist redirects our attention to "the influence exerted by the structure of the individual within an organic system upon the structure of the super-individual society." He insists that "there are very many qualities of an individual which can indeed only be 'understood' through the structure of the total entity, but which the individual possesses as innate, inherited features and not as traditionally trans- mitted acquisitions." The ethologist also insists that what the in- dividual asserts against the crush of his society is precisely what he shares with the individuals in all societies. He insists further that what humans share unites them with nature: "We con- sider the moral law within us not as something given, a priori, but as something which has arisen by natural evolution, just like the laws of the heavens." Ethology provides the philosophic basis for an ethic that shares Spinoza's main assumption and some of his sublimity: We all agree that the greatest and most precious freedom of man is identical with the moral laws within him. Increasing knowledge of the natural causes of his own behavior can certainly increase a man's faculties and enable him to put his free will into action, but it can never diminish his will. If, in the impossible case of a uto- pian, complete, and ultimate success of causal analysis, man ever should achieve complete insight into the causality of earthly phe- nomena, including the workings of his own organism, he would not cease to have a will but it would be in perfect harmony with the incontrovertible lawfulness of the universe, the Weltvernunft of the Logos.
