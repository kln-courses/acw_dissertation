<plain_text><page sequence="1">23 An unusual LMI four-sided prism* Ingo Pini This article focuses on a highly unusual four-sided hard stone prism, once in the possession of David M. Robinson. It was published by him 60 years ago, together with other gems, rings and earrings in his collection.1 This was subsequently bequeathed to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.2 When V E. G. Kenna and E. Thomas compiled CMS XIII, covering seals in the smaller North American collections, they did not include the prism; nor did they given any reasons for its exclusion. However, in the Vorrede der Herausgeber to that volume I mentioned that it might be a genuine Minoan seal.3 This exceptional piece now merits re-publication. The seal is a four-sided prism with flat rectangular faces of chalcedony. The stone is predominantly opaque and milky white with some light blue patches, which appear mostly under the surface, although a few small greyish blue areas seem to be translucent; in addition there are some very fine veins or cracks (fig. 23.1 a-d). One edge is slightly damaged. The length is 1.8 cm, the width of the sides 0.7 cm. The provenance is given as 'from northeast of Cnossus'. One can only speculate as to whether it may have come from Poros or Katsambas. Unfortunately we have no information as to precisely when or how the piece was acquired by Robinson. MATERIAL AND SHAPE Chalcedony is a micro-crystalline quartz, translucent or milky, with pale blue or bluish-grey coloration.4 It was occasionally used by engravers from MM II to LB II/IIIA1, and became more frequent in the Late Archaic and Classical periods.5 The opacity of our example suggests that the seal may have been burnt or exposed to high temperatures. Although there are many instances where Bronze Age seals appear to have been exposed to heat, it is uncertain whether this was practised deliberately, i.e. in order to alter the hue and opacity of the stone.6 Accidental exposure to fire could also explain why naturally translucent stones have turned opaque, though sometimes it is difficult to ascertain whether that was really the cause. In our case the fine cracks do seem to point to burning. Some LB lentoids of agate are not only opaque, but show numerous fine cracks and sometimes the original white colour has changed to grey.7 But the signs of burning on seals from graves are rather strange, since inhumation was the normal method of burial in Bronze Age Greece. Only rarely are traces of fires are mentioned in the excavation reports, mostly in connection with incense fires lit for purification purposes. The production of four-sided prisms with flat rectangular faces, normally of equal width, is virtually restricted to MM II.8 They occur in both soft and hard * It is a great pleasure for me to present this small offering to Peter Warren, whom I first met half a century ago, around the time of the first Cretological Congress. 1 Robinson 1949, 309 no. 3, pi. 39. 2 The seal is now in the Arthur M. Sackler Museum at Harvard: bequest of David M. Robinson, 1960.626. I am grateful to Karen A. Manning for helping me to obtain scans. The photographs of the seal faces were provided by the Harvard Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts; those of the impressions are by the author. I should like to thank Olga Krzyszkowska for inviting me to contribute to the volume and for making helpful suggestions. 3 F. Matz - I. Pini, CMS XIII, p. x, n. 4. I have seen the seal personally and made impressions of the four sides. But as this was almost 40 years ago, the description of the stone is based on information provided by the museum. 4 The mineralogical term 'chalcedony' refers to a family of micro-crystalline quartzes, which include agate and carnelian, as well as blue chalcedony. To avoid confusion the CMS now restricts the term 'chalcedony' to the blue variety: Krzyszkowska 2005, 82; cf. W. Miiller, in CMS III p. 14. 5 Krzyszkowska (2010, 252 n. 15) estimates that c. 50 Aegean seals are blue chalcedony, comparable to amethyst and lapis lacedaimonius, but rightly observes that uncertain identi fications and terminology in earlier CMS volumes renders counting difficult. In my view the number of chalcedony seals is somewhat higher.

Scale 4:1 (photographs Harvard Art Museum). stone; some bear figural motifs, many are inscribed with Hieroglyphic devices.9 In technique, a few show links to the 'talismanic' group.10 This is certainly true of the ornamental devices on CMS VI no. 106a-c, as well as the lion on side d, indicating a date in MM III or later. However, as will be shown below, our seal must be dated to LM I and as such is the only example from that period with flat rectangular faces. DESCRIPTION OF THE MOTIFS (FIG. 23.2 a-d) a) A human figure in right profile, with a breast apparently rendered as female. The arms are slightly outspread with bent forearms. Curved lines on either side of the legs seem to indicate a garment, probably a diaphanous (?) skirt." The two short lines in front of her left thigh are perhaps part of the garment. Two dots sided prisms with amygdaloid faces and ornamental devices, also occur in LH III, though may just be decorated beads, e.g. CMS I no. 301; V no. 391; V S. 1A nos. 29-32. CMS V no. 582 with convex amygdaloid faces and a figural motif is datable to the early LBA. 9 See for instance Yule 1980, 65-6; Krzyszkowska 2005, 83, 96. An unusual piece is CMS III no. 241 with 'architectural' motifs. 10 These are CMS II.2 no. 273, VI no. 106, and XII no. 95. 11 Three lines arranged in triangular form around the body of a female figure on the seal CMS II.3 no. 16 are described there as a diaphanous garment, but this is by no means clear.</page><page sequence="3">AN UNUSUAL LMI FOUR-SIDED PRISM Fig. 23.2 (above).

'Mother of the Mountain' sealing from Knossos: details (after CMS II. 8 no. 256). behind the waist cannot be interpreted. The head with a 'nose' pointing upward is executed rather sketchily. The feet are given with short strokes while the hands are not indicated at all. b) A male (?) figure in right profile with one bent arm. The head is rendered as a thick dot with a 'tail'. An oval dot in the area of the waist can probably be interpreted as a belt. The feet are depicted with short strokes. Immediately in front of the body is an elongated sack-like object of smooth texture not dissimilar to the one on side c, described by Robinson as 'an animal's head as mask'. A short oblique line at the upper end, two more on the 'neck', and two parallel ones at the lower end are partly hidden by the 'cloth'. Finally, at the lower end are some fringes. It is difficult to see this object as an animal's head. One might instead somehow relate the object to the so-called sacred robes/ garments held by human figures on a number of LMI seals and rings,12 which are however rendered differently. The meaning of two pairs of slightly oblique parallel lines, the one behind the belt, the other behind the thigh remain enigmatic. c) A male figure in right profile with one bent arm. It has an aniconic grain-shaped head. The figure wears only a belt. In front of the body an object somewhat similar to that on side b, but described by Robinson as 'a large shield'.13 In this case, it is more rectangular and has a thorn-like upper end, with a short line at the upper end, two parallel lines in its upper half and at the lower end, below these again a kind of fringe as on side b. The parallel with the fringe on side b of our seal and the position of the object seem to speak against an interpretation as tower shield. d) Two 'star fish', some crescents and lines in the field. The crescents and the tubular drill mark in the upper star fish are clear features of the 'talismanic' style group,14 although the motifs are not very typical.15 12 CMS II.3 nos. 8, 145; II.7 no. 7; V S. 3 no. 394.

LCIII-LXVI discusses a number of hitherto isolated 'talismanic' motifs; pis. LXIII.6 and LXV42 are also atypical of the talismanic group.</page><page sequence="4">INGOPINI DISCUSSION Interesting is the combination of a 'talismanic' device on side d with three human figures on sides a-c. Strangely enough the three figures have almost nothing in common with the 'talismanic' style. The only feature which might point slightly in this direction is the aniconic rendering of the heads, but these are also found on numerous LM I gold signet rings and ancient impressions thereof with 'naturalistic' representa tions.16 Thus the figures on our seal are not connected to those figures rendered in the 'talismanic' style on CMS III no. 339,17 V no. 180, and perhaps XI no. 20a. Rather they should be regarded as representative of the general stylistic trends in LM I. Similar stylistic discrepancies do occasionally occur between the representations on two or three sides of a seal.18 On all three sides of our seal the legs of the figures are arranged slightly obliquely to the front, while at least on sides a and b the axis of the upper body is slightly inclined towards the back. In other words we see the kind of hollow back so characteristic of many early LM bronze statuettes of 'adorants'19 and of the male figure on the sealing with the Mother of the Mountains from Knossos, impressed with a ring of LM I date (FIG. 23.3 a-b).20 It is hard to offer any persuasive interpretation for the individual figures and, especially, for their juxtaposition on three faces of the prism, not least because specific elements are hard to read, and parallels are remote or altogether lacking. At best we may suggest that on side b, and possibly on side c, fringed skirt(s) might be depicted. If so, then there might be some connection with 'robe rituals', about which Peter Warren has written.21 Conceivably, then, the figures on sides a-c might be read as participants in a procession. But I stress that this suggestion is highly speculative. CONCLUSIONS Why Kenna and Thomas came to exclude the seal from CMS XIII remains obscure. Perhaps doubts as to its authenticity were raised by the appearance of the three human figures on the flat faces of a four-sided prism, a shape characteristic of MM II glyptic. Clearly the seal had been in the possession of Robinson as early as 1948, and conceivably was acquired even earlier. It is hard to believe that a forger could have invented such a seal long before the publication of the CMS series or before Kenna's publication on Cretan seals.22 As we have seen, the material was occasionally used on Crete by seal engravers between MM II and LM IIIA1. And in stylistic terms there is nothing whatsoever to cast doubt on the genuineness of the piece. Rather we should regard the seal as a unique latecomer to the ranks of four-sided hard stone prisms, datable to LM I. REFERENCES Boardman, J., 1970.
