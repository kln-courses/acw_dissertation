<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Sandra Pannell Of gods and monsters Indigenous sea cosmologies, promiscuous               geographies and the depths of local sovereignty Introduction In a recent volume on ‘Customary marine tenure in Australia’, the editors  point to an ‘ethnographic blind spot’ regarding the documentation of indige- nous people’s relationship with the sea (Peterson and Rigsby 1998:2). In offer- ing various explanations for this state of affairs, Peterson and Rigsby raise the  idea that not all coastal-dwelling people have systems of customary marine  tenure or necessarily rely upon the sea for their livelihood.1 This idea was ini- tially proposed by Nicolas Polunin (1984:272), who suggested that one of the  reasons for this is that ‘people in several areas tend [...] to be averse to the sea’.  In his consideration of the evidence from Indonesia and Papua New Guinea,  Polunin (1984:272) describes how the Balinese view the sea as polluted by the  ‘filth of the land’, in contrast to the purity of the mountains, regarded as the  ‘seat of the gods’. The Javanese, on the other hand, view the sea as a ‘wilder- ness beyond the control of human society’ (Polunin 1984:271), a ‘supernatural  background drea ... of the sea’ apparently also shared by the Tanga Islanders  of Papua New Guinea (Polunin 1984:272).  While Polunin hints at the association of the sea with evil spirits and mon- sters, other writers link the sea to various deities and ancestors. For example, in  the Kei Islands of eastern Indonesia, Cécile Barraud discusses the ancestors of  the village society of Tanebar-Evav. These ancestors are collectively known as  wadar, and are said to be eighteen men and women who went to sea and sub- sequently disappeared. These ancestral figures, also referred to as ‘our fathers- grandfathers’, are ritually offered people’s catch from the sea, including ‘parts  of dolphins, sea-cows [dugongs] and turtles’ (Barraud 1990:43). In other Indo- 1  Due to local hostilities and open warfare, many societies throughout Indonesia, for example,  traditionally built their villages on hilltops some distance from the coast. In the course of Dutch  ‘pacification’ of the population, many of these village societies were forced to move down to the  coast and occupy village sites which could be more effectively accessed and controlled by the  Dutch (see De Jonge and Van Dijk 1995).  </page> <page sequence="2"> 72 Sandra Pannell nesian societies, such as the seafaring Bajo people of southeast Sulawesi,2 the  ancestors not only inhabit the sea but they also accompany people on their long  maritime voyages around the archipelago. Writing of the Bajo of the Tukang  Besi Islands, Natasha Stacey (1999:71) observes that Mbo Madilao, the ‘ances- tors of the sea’, are not ‘confined to any particular location but live “wherever  there is sea”’. Stacey (1999:71) concludes that ‘the spiritual maritime domain of  the Bajo has no boundaries, it is infinite’. As such, it encompasses politically- charged areas within the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) claimed by Australia  under the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention. In Australia, indigenous sea cosmologies also have far-reaching political  and legal ramifications. For example, in the seas surrounding Croker Island in  northern Australia, the Dreamtime figure of the Rainbow Serpent lies beneath  the water, resting on the seabed.3 Around this island, Aboriginal people  refrain from throwing meat overboard in fear that it will ‘arouse the local  Rainbow Serpent’ (Peterson and Rigsby 1998:6) which, when disturbed, may  manifest itself as a cyclone, a waterspout or tidal floods (see Memmott and  Trigger 1998:121). These beliefs about the Rainbow Serpent and the danger it  poses have recently been put to the test in the Croker Island native title case,4  where the question of Aboriginal ownership of the seabed and their exclusive  possession of offshore waters is at issue.  As these ethnographic examples from Indonesia and Australia suggest,  indigenous cosmologies implicate specific geographic features or environments,  in the process defining a landscape of memory, action and identity. James Fox  (1997:8) notes that cosmologies often take the form of ‘topogeny’ – ‘the recita- tion of an ordered sequence of place names’. Fox observes that ‘topogenies’ may  recount the journey of an ancestor or the migration of a group. For instance,  cosmological narratives in eastern Indonesia often refer to the sea voyages of  ancestral figures as they migrate from their point of origin, usually an island,  to the place of their eventual settlement. In many eastern Indonesian societies,  these narratives underpin local orders of precedence and the division of author- ity into ritual and secular domains. Fox also notes that topogenies may refer to  the movement of objects. To illustrate this latter point, he briefly alludes to a  Rotinese narrative which describes the journey of ‘two great rocks that eventu- ally came to settle along the north coast of the island’ (Fox 1997:9).  In northern Australia, indigenous sea cosmologies, often in the form  of detailed song cycles, refer to the creation of islands and the journeys of  ancestral Dreaming-beings across large bodies of open sea. For example, in  2  Also known as ‘sea nomads’, ‘sea gypsies’, ‘Bajau Laut’ and orang laut (‘sea people’) (Stacey  1999:1). 3  The Rainbow Serpent, a mythological figure similar to the giant water snake or Naga recog- nized in many parts of Southeast Asia, is a pervasive image throughout indigenous Australia (see  Maddock and Buchler 1978; Radcliffe-Brown 1926). 4  Formally known as Yarmirr v Northern territory (1998) 156 ALR 370. </page> <page sequence="3"> Of gods and monsters 73 the Wellesley Islands, in the southern Gulf of Carpentaria, the site known as  Ngaliwan, consisting of three rocks rising from the sea, is regarded by Lardil  people as the bodies of their ancestors, while the Shark Dreaming is said  by Lardil people to travel along the northwest coast of Mornington Island  planting cycad seeds at the places where it stopped (Memmott and Trigger  1998:119-120). In the Wellesley Islands, these Dreamings are linked to indi- vidual totemic identity, as well as being accorded an important ritual status in  regional initiation ceremonies.  As a number of studies from north Australia indicate, the journeys and  the sites associated with these Dreaming-beings often serve as the basis for  claims of estate group ownership or for the assertion of individual rights and  interests (see Peterson and Rigsby 1998). In eastern Indonesia a similar situa- tion exists. Discussing cultural topographies in West Timor, Andrew McWil- liam (1997:111) observes that in Meto society origin narratives not only link  a named group with significant places but they also serve as a ‘legitimizing  discourse and statement of claim to land’. This is a point also made by Pannell  (1997a) in her examination of the social and political ramifications of invoking  traditional ‘topostories’ in coastal boundary and marine resource disputes on  the island of Damer.  As these comments suggest, in Indonesia and Australia indigenous cos- mologies are implicated in local perceptions of territoriality and resource  ownership. In this respect, they often function, to borrow Michel de Certeau’s  term (1984:122), as forms of ‘spatial legislation’. The efficacy of cosmologies  to serve as spatial legislation or as the foundation of sovereign power is not  simply a function of an association between founding figures and certain  places. These cosmologies also constitute moral discourses, inculcating cul- tural values regarded as intrinsic to the customary order of things and people.  As indigenous parables, these narratives profess a certain truth or ‘ultimate  verity’ (Herzfeld 1987:13) about the world. On the basis of this claim to identify  the fundamental conditions (and limits) of truth, indigenous sea cosmologies  can be regarded as potent political statements about the nature of knowledge  and power, on both a minute and monumental scale. In plotting assertions of territorial sovereignty or indigenous orders of  moral authority, these cosmologies translate into a cultural landscape where  certain places are valued as keramat (‘sacred’), pemali (‘taboo’), suci (‘holy’),  jahat (‘evil’), panas (‘hot’) or bahaya (‘dangerous’), linked as they are to a pan- theon of gods and monsters.5 Liisa Malkki (1995:55-6) refers to this imagina- 5  Throughout this article, Indonesian terms are presented in italics and identified with the  abbreviation ‘BI’.

This article explores the often contested and sometimes subversive rela- tionship posited between cosmological narratives, space and sovereign power  through a consideration of ethnographic examples from eastern Indonesia  and Aboriginal Australia. In focusing upon the articulation of indigenous ‘sea  cosmologies’ as spatial discourses, I attempt to go beyond the popular view of  these accounts as quaint or fabulous stories referring to a creative epoch in a  dim and mystical past. Instead, the emphasis of this article is upon the role of  this spatial imaginary in the assertion of local sovereignty and in the creation  of what Jane Jacobs (1996:5) calls ‘promiscuous geographies of dwelling in  place’. As the histories of Indonesia and Australia graphically demonstrate,  the exercise of power and the politics of cultural identity are primarily about  space. In his spatial history of colonial discovery and settlement in Australia,  Paul Carter (1987) reminds us that space is not simply a backdrop or stage  upon which significant events take place or are inscribed upon. To paraphrase  Carter (1987:xxii), a culture declares its presence through ‘spatial forms and  fantasies’. These spatial forms and fantasies are part of ‘an ever-shifting  social geometry of power and signification’ (Massey 1994:3). In this regard,  the cosmological landscapes considered in this article represent ‘geographies  which struggle’ (Said 1993:7), vividly disturbing the notion of space, identity  and authority as somehow inherently fixed or settled.6  Landscapes with sea views: space and discourse In a number of European languages, the term ‘landscape’ originally referred  to a province, a district or an area of land, in other words, a geographical  region. Thus, in Europe in the early 1500s regional maps were described as  ‘landscapes’ (landschap in Dutch) and their production constituted an exercise  in chorography. The notion of chorography, with its emphasis upon regions,  can be contrasted with the Ptolemic concept of geography, which entails the  representation of the entirety of the known world.7 The concept of landscape which we are familiar with today is of landscape  as pictorial subject matter rather than as a geographical region. However, the  6  Throughout this article, I use the term ‘landscape’ in its broadest connotation to refer to spa- tial histories with both a marine and terrestrial focus. 7  As previously noted, the Dutch concept of landschap originally referred to a small area of land,  which was viewed as an inset of a much larger region or context. The concept of chorography  emerged as a way of representing and talking about this form of confined perspective. In this  respect, landschap coincides with the German meaning of the word Landschaft (see Bender 1993:2). </page> <page sequence="5"> Of gods and monsters 75 regional connotation of the word landscape still persists in terms of the scope  or prospect of the artistic subject matter. Although the concept of landscape  has been unhooked for some time from its original art associations (see Bender  1993; Hirsch and O’Hanlon 1995), there is still a dominant view of landscape  as an inscribed surface, akin to a map or a text, from which cultural meaning  and social forms can simply be read.  Susan Kuchler refers to the view of landscape as inscribed or associated  surface as the ‘landscape of memory’, wherein memories (or meanings) are  somehow captured in, or represented by, the form of visual landmarks. She  points out that in this view the idea of landscape is not ‘affected by the project  of its representation and remembrance’ (Kuchler 1995:104). Kuchler (1995:85)  contrasts this view of landscape as the encoding of memory and meaning with  the notion of ‘landscape as memory’. In this perspective, landscape is impli- cated in both the dynamic and interactive social processes of memory-making  as well as being one of the products of these on-going processes.  The historian, Paul Carter, is another scholar who takes issue with the idea  of space as a backdrop or stage upon which significant events, such as Euro- pean discovery or an indigenous ‘Dreamtime’, take place or are inscribed.  Similarly, Carter is critical of the view which presents physical surroundings  as merely this. As Carter (1987:349) points out in his book, The road to botany  bay, what is symbolized is not ‘the physical country’ per se but ‘the enactment  of [an already] historical space’. In other words, references to such things as  physical country can only be made by means of the cultural representations  of those things.  Carter draws our attention to the importance of realizing that a cultural  landscape, whether indigenous or European, signifies more than just another  way of representing or symbolizing geographical entities or natural surround- ings. Representation constitutes just one facet of people’s interaction with and  experience of their environment. As this statement suggests, landscape can be  seen not only as a complex cultural product but as a dynamic one as well. Drawing upon the work of Kuchler, Carter, Bender and others, this article  adopts a view of landscape as both an immanent and emergent cultural  construct which is informed by and, in turn shapes, historical experiences  and social relations. Put another way, landscapes can be regarded as both the  objects and effects of specific discourses. If landscapes are created by humans,  then they are also contested, disputed and, at times, denied by them. In this  sense, the idea of landscape can be regarded as a ‘concept of high tension’  (Inglis 1977), often enacted at the interstices of history, politics, and society.  One is reminded here of Simon Schama’s warning (1995:18) that not all land- scapes are ‘places of delight’, nor are all memories ‘pastoral picnics’. Schama’s  cautionary words (1995:18) refer to the horror and tragedy often encountered  on the ‘trail of social memory’.  </page> <page sequence="6"> y g Lel an  Ba Kaiwatoe TIATA ISLAND Mo MOA ISLAND LOEANG ISLAND KALAPA ISLAND a St Siota MERATERIALAM ISLAND r Cape SerodonaSerwaroe ait Eloe Rotnama Noewewan Lartoetoeng Patti Moanga Sera Lelang Loehoelele LAILAWAN ISLAND Klis Werwaroe AMORTAOEN ISLAND METATNA ISLAND LETI ISLAND Cape Njadora Cape Wahar Regola Letoda Lolotoeera LAKOR ISLAND MEATY MIARANG ISLAND Map 1.

It is  located in the southernmost waters of the Banda Sea, and is marginally closer  to Darwin than it is to the provincial capital of Ambon. Covering an area of  only eight square kilometres, Pulau Luang (BI) is well known in the region  for its near absence of trees, scarcity of drinking water8 and its extensive reefs  which, covering some 350 square kilometres, makes it the second largest reef  system in Indonesia. This reef complex consists of the home reef system, cen- tred upon the island of Luang, and the barrier reef system of Mettriralma  (‘within the reef’), situated some twenty five kilometres southwest of Luang  (see Map 1). The sea surrounding the two reef complexes drops off quickly  from the edge of the reef to a depth of some 2000 metres (hleta, ‘deep sea’),  making the passage between the two reef systems quite rough and, at times,  quite dangerous. The 1800 or so inhabitants of Luang reside in two villages  – Luang Timur and Luang Barat (BI). The residents of Luang are also well  known in the region, largely because they constitute a highly mobile sailing  population and because of the widespread belief that they live entirely on fish  and other marine resources. While rarely found on maps these days, Luang  occupies a pivotal place in the cosmological landscape of the region. Throughout Maluku Tenggara, the island of Luang is widely acknowledged  as the respective geomorphological and ontological source of the islands and  societies in this part of Maluku. I recorded one account of how this came to be  from a ritual specialist from the island of Damer: In the past, so the narrative goes, Pulau Luang was a sizeable, mountainous island  with a large population of people. A sailfish, named Upo Hrui cut through the  island with its dorsal sailfin, shattering it into many pieces. These terrestrial frag- ments of Luang became the islands which now comprise Maluku Tenggara. The  island of Luang itself was reduced to a small speck in the Banda Sea. The people  of Luang were unable to live on this island fragment and so many left to settle the  other islands created by Upo Hrui.  My informant then proceeded to narrate the history of settlement on the island  of Damer resulting from the actions of the sailfish (BI ikan layar) Upo Hrui:9  The Tuan Tanah of Luang, from the house of Wolonteri, sailed by perahu [BI] to  what is now the island of Damer. The perahu ran aground on the exposed sum- mit of Gunung Lumtuni when the rudder became entangled in the moss/algae  8  According to local government statistics, Luang receives an average annual rainfall of 150  mm. 9  On Damer, upo is the generic term for ancestor whereas on Luang, the term upa is used.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 78 Sandra Pannell (lumtun) which covered the mountain. As the sea receded, the Wolonteri ancestors  descended down the mountain in the perahu, stopping at various places and per- forming certain activities. These exploits are captured in the names ascribed to  these places. The Wolonteri ancestors changed their name to Surlialy and, as the  first group to arrive on the island, proclaimed themselves lelehro [Western Damer  Language] or rajah (BI ‘king’).  Other island societies in Maluku Tenggara have similar origin stories linked  to the Upa Hrui narrative which depict the establishment of pre-colonial poli- ties in the region.  While the account from Damer identifies the reason for the dispersal of the  original population as overcrowding, other versions of the Upa Hrui narrative  I recorded on Luang specifically identify incessant warfare between the eleven  autonomous polities on the island as the explanation for the wholesale depar- ture of six of the original indigenous states. The inhabitants of these six poli- ties eventually settled on the islands of Seram, Tanimbar, Kei, Sermata, Timor,  Kisar, Lakor, Teun and Damer. As this suggests, the Upa Hrui narrative is as  much a ‘colonization myth’ (Geertz 1960:23) as it is an account of creation. As a creation story, however, the Upa Hrui narrative has an ambiguous  status. For it is as much a story about the transformation and differentiation  of the world as it is an account of its origin and nature. In this respect, the nar- rative emphasizes destruction and dispersal, disruption and displacement as  essential elements in the cosmological process. An indigenous equivalent to  the second Law of Thermodynamics if you like. The Upa Hrui narrative can  be regarded as an inter-linked set of cosmological and moral ordering stories  which converge to make and, perhaps more importantly, remake the world. While conducting research on the island of Luang, I recorded detailed ver- sions of the sailfish narrative from a number of senior men. Akin to a Shake- spearean drama, these versions use an affinal arrangement between Luang  and the ancestral village of Melai Watukali in East Timor to explore what is  a common theme in Indonesian cosmologies, the rivalry between elder and  younger brothers. At the heart of these accounts is the betrayal of the younger  brother’s wife (who originates from Melai Watukali) and her marriage to the  wealthier older sibling (from Luang) called Rettiau Lay. In retaliation for this  breach, the younger brother, Rettiau Ruru, with the assistance of Rarilmietma –  Rarlelkialwa, an old woman referred to as putri laut (BI ‘queen of the sea’), calls  up the sailfish, Upa Hrui, from the depths of the ocean. The younger brother  climbs on the back of the sailfish and orders it to destroy the island of Luang  so that ‘people will not be able to say it’s name anymore’ – a reference to the  affective power and political potency of place names on Luang. According to  this account: </page> <page sequence="9"> Of gods and monsters 79 The sailfish jumped out of the water and cut across Luang creating Mettutun. It  jumped out of the water again and cut up the islets of Donna, Liakra, Kapuri and  Tiata. The whole of Luang shook as the sailfish jumped across the island. People  became afraid and fled Luang to the other islands in the region. Eventually the  sailfish and the younger brother were stopped by an old woman, Surriai, who  pleaded with the sailfish and her grandson [the younger brother] not to entirely  destroy the island of Luang, not to shatter the earth. In her efforts to halt these  destructive forces, she became a large boulder at Tutungain [BI muka tanjung or  ‘front of the cape’] while the sailfish became the island of Upa Hrui.10 From the Upa Hrui narrative it would appear that transgressions of the social  and moral order evoke equivalent cataclysmic repercussions, in this case, the  dispersal of society and destruction of the known world.11 In this sense, the  narrative can be thematically likened to biblical stories, European fairytales,  and Aboriginal Dreaming accounts (see Stanner 1989). Like Aboriginal cos- mologies, people on Luang are spatially confronted with the displacing and  dangerous effects of transgression and indiscretion in their physical engage- ment with the landscape created by Upa Hrui.  The Upa Hrui narrative not only recounts the fundamental formation of  the islands of this region but it also provides explanations for their specific  geomorphological features. For example: The sailfish and the younger brother surfaced from the depths of the sea between  Timor and Kisar. When they surfaced, the sailfish was facing south. He wanted to  test his strength against the island of Timor and in doing so he cut off the tip of  the island called Nohmehi. Then he turned around and headed straight for Kisar  and the island shook vigorously. Because of this the mountains of Kisar are at the  edge of the island and the villages are in the middle of the island. Then Upa Hrui  headed north to Romang and destroyed the western side of the island, in the pro- cess creating Pulau Nohyata Roma. Susan McKinnon records that in Tanimbarese cosmological narratives the  geomorphological differentiation of the world is a task undertaken by pro- spective bridegrooms from offshore islands, in lieu of a hefty bridewealth  payment. As McKinnon (1991:45) points out, these Herculean tasks made  marriage with distant others ‘virtually impossible’, thus maintaining the ‘self- contained unity of the [Tanimbarese] world’. 10  In some accounts of this master narrative, Upa Hrui cuts through the island of Luang with its  bill, in other versions, it is the dorsal sail fin that slices up the island. In a number versions I have  recorded, Upa Hrui trails a long rope from its mouth, which it acquired from the old woman of  the sea, and it is this rope that cleaves Luang into the islands which comprise Maluku Tenggara  today. 11  Cécile Barraud (1985:122) makes a similar point with regard to the implications of ‘incest,  adultery and murder’ in Tanebar-Evav society. According to Barraud (1985:122), ‘the whole  society [...] is destroyed in [the] case of such misconduct’. </page> <page sequence="10"> N I D O N N I R I J O E K O K P I A  H A D O N LIAKRA O E R I DONA K E P LAILAWNA TIATA MO’ORA TAWNU MET TUTUN Luang Timur Luang Barat KALAPA HU’ULUGAIN LUANG MNOLAWNA PU’O ROMKHERA UPA HRUI WATUVELADA Map 2. The reef complex of Pulau Luang </page> <page sequence="11"> Of gods and monsters 81 On Luang, this relationship between local and distant bride-givers and  bride-receivers, expressed in terms of the alliance between Luang and Melai  Watukali, is the subject of a number of related narratives which are set in, and  give further definition to, the cosmological landscape recreated by Upa Hrui.  In common with Aboriginal totemic accounts, the landscape of Luang  comprises a rich geography of named places and powerful beings (see Map  2 and Map 3). As one informant observed, semua tempat yang ada nama, punya  orang dan sejarah (BI ‘all places which have a name, have a person and a his- tory associated with them’). An observation similar to Claude Lévi-Strauss’s  comment (1966:168) that ‘space is a society of named places’. These named places include various types of beaches, capes and points,  islands, submerged and exposed rocks, spits, sandbars, submerged reefs,  areas of deep water, tidal areas, and areas where strong currents and whirl- pools are encountered. The names bestowed often evoke what is regarded  as the primary physical feature of a place. For example, hnyariwarta or ‘west  door’, refers to one of only two passages through the barrier reef at Mettri- ralma. A name may also evoke a resemblance, as in the case of Donna Hayuri  or ‘buffalo horn rock’, or be historically invigorated by an event. For instance,  Watuvlada, the white rock said to be a petrified Dutchman whose boat appar- ently ran aground on the reef in the VOC period. Throughout the reef com- plex, there are a number of stone boats (pu’o). For example, the rocky islet in  the vicinity of Pulau Upa Hrui is identified as a perahu (BI ‘traditional sailing  vessel’) from the island of Romang (pu’o romkhéra), replete with the fossil- ized belongings of its occupants, while at Mo’ora Liwutenna (BI ‘pusat meti’  or ‘navel of the reef’), the western point in the Mettriralma reef complex, one  can see the stone keel of a perahu from Melai Watukali. In addition to these  stone perahu, it is also possible to see the wrecks of a number of wooden perahu  which have run aground in the reef systems of Luang and Mettriralma.  The names of other places in the reef system may appear quite general or  neutral in terms of their lexical meaning yet are associated with quite signifi- cant cosmological events and figures. The uninhabited island of Mnolawna  illustrates this point. Translated as ‘big place’, at one level, the name of the  island refers to its size in relation to the surrounding islands. At another level,  however, the name captures the former status of the island as the peak of the  highest mountain on Luang, located in the middle of the island (nohophorara- iapnu). On the summit of this mountain are situated the ‘stairs’ and the ‘rope’  (retna lotna), which not only connect the sky with the earth but also allow  humans to access and communicate with the ‘ancestral sun’ being known as  Upléra Mermetma, Upléra Warwarha.12 This being is described by people on  12  Up or upa is the local term generally used for ancestral figures, while the term lera specifically  refers to the sun. As Marshall Sahlins (1985:18-9) points out with respect to Hawaiian chiefs, the  solar associations of Uplera Mermetma, Uplera Warwarha may be linked to indigenous notions  of divinebeauty and ancestral power as displays of ‘brilliance’, ‘radiance’ and ‘luminosity’, rather  than to the existence of a solar cult. </page> <page sequence="12"> 82 Sandra Pannell Luang as an ambivalent amalgam of Setan and Tuhan (the ‘Devil’ and ‘God’),  and is regarded as the singular incarnation of the different powers associated  with each of these beings.13 According to the Upa Hrui narrative, the destructive  actions of the sailfish caused the mountain to shake so much that the peak fell  off, landed in the sea, and became the island of Mnolawna. With its connection  to the middle of the island, Mnolawna is also identified as the anchor of Luang,  preventing the island from drifting away in the strong southerly currents. The  earthly conduit to Upléra Mermetma, Upléra Warwarha is still located on the  summit of the mountain, now known as Mnolawna, and is guarded by a being  which sometimes presents itself in the shape of a cat (o’ha). Interestingly, while  Mnolawna is identified as an island which has a ‘history’ (BI pulau yang berse- jarah), it is not generally regarded as a keramat (‘sacred’) site.  In his review of marine tenure in the Torres Strait, John Cordell observes  that reefs, shoals, rocks and open sea are not only named after events but,  when considered in their entirety, constitute a detailed seascape. Cordell  (1984:307) defines this seascape as ‘a living history with associated myths,  stories and legends that provide moral and cultural guidelines. It is the store- house of social identity for islanders’. James Weiner (1991:32) succinctly captures this relationship between names,  space and social identity when he states that ‘a society’s place names schemati- cally image a people’s intentional transformation of their habitat from a sheer  physical terrain into a pattern of historically experienced and constituted space  and time’. As Cordell and Weiner suggest, names are not ‘inert, lexical labels  for places’. Rather, ‘place names have their origin in discourse, and it is within  discourse [...] that places are named’ (J. Weiner 1991:45). In the sea cosmologies  of the people from Luang, named places in the coastal zone and the reef envi- ronment are also invigorated by the presence of powerful beings. The beings which are associated with named places are variously described  as ‘witches’ or ‘ghosts’, ‘malevolent figures’, ‘ancestors’, ‘chiefs’ and ‘people’  (BI suangi, iblis or setan, moyang, datuk or orang). While these various entities  are often granted basic anthropomorphic characteristics, as Valerio Valeri  (2000:25) points out in his discussion of ‘occult powers’ among the Huaulu  of Seram, the use of the appellation ‘superhuman’ to describe these figures  is inadequate as it fails to grasp the often ‘subhuman’ or ‘inhuman’ features  of these beings. Like the occult powers identified by the Huaulu, the beings  associated with Luang are ‘wild at heart’ (Valeri 2000:26), and their mediat- 13  While this reference to Setan (‘Devil’) and Tuhan (‘God’) implies some similarity with a  Judaeo-Christian moral cosmos, particularly the opposition between good and evil which we find  in the latter, there are also considerable differences in the way morality is construed on Luang.  Marshall Sahlins (1985:17) provides an example of the way in which indigenous moral universes  differ from the Judaeo-Christian one when he observes that, ‘many Oceanic societies [...] employ  the aesthetic at the boundaries of the moral’. </page> <page sequence="13"> Of gods and monsters 83 ing presence in the reef environment contributes to a dangerously unstable  and uncertain landscape. For people on Luang, the presence of these power- ful agents also configures a discursive landscape which is redolent with all  kinds of sexual tensions and perversions. These beings are also ascribed a somewhat exuberant sexuality and a  range of gendered identities. At times, these identities can appear to be sin- gular in nature, yet at other times can be quite ambivalent or polymorphic.  For example, Toronlawna, a submerged reef in the Mettriralma complex, is  associated with the presence of an old woman who is likened to ‘Satan’, and  is thus regarded as paling jahat (BI ‘very evil’), particularly at the time of a full  moon. At this time, the gender neutral suangi figure (BI akin to a ‘witch’ or  a ‘sorcerer’) at Watlawna, another point in the reef complex of Mettriralma,  travels across the lagoon to have bestial sex with the old woman at Toron- lawna, mounting each other in the manner of ‘dogs’. This is a dangerous  time to be anywhere near these two places, as it is possible for the voracious  sexual desires of the beings to be turned upon any humans encountered. It is  through these acts of excessive, demonic sex that the beings not only reveal  their animal-like nature but also highlight the vulnerability of humans to their  bestial charms and unprovoked attempts at seduction. For example, at Mo’ora Tawnu, identified at the ‘tip of the [home] reef’ (BI  ujung karang), an ancestral woman from Luang (from the founding village of  Mnyettumjau) is mysteriously impregnated by the semen of a man from Melai  Watukali. He places his semen in a bamboo receptacle and sends it to her across  the sea. After throwing the bamboo container away several times, she decides  to keep it and use it as a pillow. Not long afterwards she has a bastard son.14  Soon after the birth of the child, a perahu carrying the man from Melai Watukali  arrives at what remains of the island of Luang, the mountain of Wu’urplalahwa  (‘Long Mountain’), and moors alongside of it. Evocative of sexual union, the  perahu and the mountain become fused, and what was once deep water (hleta)  becomes land. The perahu is transformed into the mountain Wu’urluli, creating  the twin-peaked form of the current island of Luang, and its anchor becomes  the large rock known as Watgarniha. In the narrative, the woman from Luang  and the man from Melai are also fused together into a single body, one side  male, the other half female. Informants referred to this coupling with the Indo- nesian term for coitus, mereka bersetubuh (‘they became one body’).  In the same reef complex, at the rocky islet of Kokpinidonni, a woman from  Luang repeatedly engages in sex with several men, disregarding the demands  of elders to stop. Shamed by her actions, the elders drowned the woman at  14  Debbora Battaglia (1990:40) notes that on Sabarl Island women believed that they could  ‘somehow become pregnant in the sea’. She suggests that this belief may stem from the image,  associated with ambergris, of ‘congealed father’s blood adrift on the sea headed towards the  shores of the living’ (Battaglia 1990:223). </page> <page sequence="14"> WATLAWNA WEKANAU DARNAU AMMERTAWNU Boundary line asserted by Lunag Barat TORONLAWNA RÉRANLAWNA OTA  PLA LAH WA Boundary line drawn by Dutch LIOT ALI LIWUTENNA HNYARIWARTA HNYARITIPPRU LAI TRANNA MO’ORAU Map 3.

While  the men of Luang engage in banter with each other about the keramat site,  Kokpinidonni, they also realize that succumbing to these sexual temptations  will result in a fatal copulation. One is reminded here of pontiana k (BI), promis- cuous, supernatural female figures which seduce men with their charms and  then castrate them with their claw-like fingernails.16 In the pontianak accounts  I have recorded in village communities in Maluku, these beings are usually  associated with people’s experiences of regional centres. The pontianak stories  are part of a discourse in which cities like Ambon, Tual and Dili, constitute  alienating landscapes, where self-conscious perceptions of social difference  and economic disadvantage intersect and are made all too visible. As Roland  Barthes observed, the city is the very ‘place of our meeting with the other’  (quoted in Jacobs 1996:4).  In the seas of Luang, this sense of otherness is primarily articulated in terms  of the unregulated and ambivalent sexuality of the occult beings. The ani- mated presence of these beings confronts people with the dangerous ambigu- ity inherent in the constitution of their own human identity and that of other  things. In this sense, the world of humans is constantly haunted by images  of similarity and difference, and the possibilities for other kinds of identities.  This idea of ambivalent identity is deeply embedded within the shifting sea- scape of Luang – a valley is a deep-water harbour, a hill is a boat, the summit  of a mountain is an island, an island is an anchor, a rock is an ancestor or a  boat, and so on. Objects and subjects are never quite what they appear to be  in this promiscuous intermingling of identity and order. In this respect, Alain  Corbin’s depiction (1994:14) of the littoral zone as a ‘dangerous area in which  the activities of deities, human beings and animals, living in confused, dan- gerous proximity, threaten to interfere with one another’, equally describes  the troubled seascape of Luang.  In a discussion of the magical potency of witches to create islands and  sea passages, S. Tambiah notes that a common theme in Trobriand narratives  is how these beings are eventually stabilized as rocks. In Tambiah’s words  (1985:303): This stabilisation of the witches, then, allows for their becoming  agents for granting (restricted) benefits, and their locations appropriately  become shrines for propitiation by kula sailors.  15  Cécile Barraud (1985:122) notes that in Tanebar-Evav society in the Kei Islands couples  engaged in incestuous relations were traditionally ‘cast into the sea to drown’. 16  In this respect, pontianak are similar to sundel bolong (‘prostitute with a hole in her’) which  Geertz (1960:18) describes as a ‘beautiful naked woman’ with a hole in her back who seduces men  and castrates them. </page> <page sequence="16"> 86 Sandra Pannell The process of physical stabilization that Tambiah refers to not only applies  to individual witches but to the cosmological accounts which feature these  witches. This is an important consideration, as the representation of these stories  in terms of concrete objects points to a social environment in which inter-subjec- tive communication and understanding is construed as part of a phenomenal  landscape which is both enduring and changing in its very nature.  Like the Trobriand Islanders, people on Luang also recognize the need  to engage with and, if possible, to appease the beings at Toronlawna and  Watlawna. These beings and others like them are regarded as both the original  owners of the sea and the ones responsible for producing a continuous supply  of valuable resources in the marine environment. Similar to the situation Valeri  (2000) describes for the Huaulu of central Seram, human ownership of the  lands and seas of Luang is thus regarded as derivative. In this situation, there  is no sense of total human ownership. To quote Valeri (2000:308), ‘one always  owns as part owner, as part of a superior [occult] ownership; one is forever  an interloper or at best a tenant’. As Valeri points out, this idea of ownership  is far removed from the notion of property as a reified and inanimate posses- sion. Like the Huaulu, for people on Luang ownership entails confronting,  cajoling and pacifying the non-human beings who live in the sea. One cannot  access and use the products of the sea with total freedom and impunity. In this  sense, the right to own and use an area or a resource is contingent upon and  is mediated by a relationship between the user and a powerful being. Given  the fundamental role ascribed to these beings in the reproduction of people’s  livelihood, it is not so surprising that they are primarily spoken of in terms of  the leitmotif of sex. However, the very presence of these beings also highlights  the destructive and fatal consequences of uncontrolled reproductivity,  expressed in the being’s overly exuberant sexuality. The beings and the places they inhabit are regarded as keramat (BI) and there  are a number of taboos associated with them. These beings are identified as  possessing ‘hot’ (BI panas) or ‘heavy’ (BI berat) names, and the indiscriminate  uttering of their names can result in injury or death. As people stated, these  beings are capable of ‘cutting your throat’. In order to publicly say the names  of these beings, and recount the stories associated with them, it is necessary  to sumpah sopi (BI) – a ritualized drinking and spilling of palm spirit which  entails an avowal of truth. When a person’s actions or statements signify a  discontinuity with the truth constructed in local discourse, then the vow acts  like a curse, and sudden death becomes the fate (BI ‘segera jatuh mati’). As  Kenneth George (1996:133) observes in his discussion of ritual violence in  Sulawesi, oathmaking is not necessarily ‘the outcome of powerful emotions,  but of powerful obligations made in discourse’. In order to sail near places regarded as keramat (BI) without encountering  immediate misfortune and death, people avoid wearing red clothing and  </page> <page sequence="17"> Of gods and monsters 87 maintain a respectful silence.17 To emphasize the ‘hotness’ of keramat sites, a  cautionary tale is told about the fate of a fisherman from the island of Leti who,  ignorant of the keramat status of Mo’ora Liwutenna, not only wore a red shirt but  who also spoke the wrong language in its vicinity. According to local accounts, a  large wave suddenly appeared, capsized the boat, and drowned its occupant.18  The association of the sea with what appears to be an uncontrolled and  dangerous sexuality, epitomized by places like Kokpinidonni, also conjures  up related images in the western tradition of mermaids and sirens. In a similar  vein to the Greek myth of the singing sea nymphs, places like Kokpinidonni,  Toronlawna and Watlawna signpost natural features of the reef system which  pose a possible physical hazard to sailors and fishermen. While there is a  temptation to posit a functional explanation for this relationship between  cosmology and geography, I should point out that the most dangerous features  of the reef for shipping, the narrow and shallow passages through the barrier  reef, are not associated with either ‘libidinous’ or ‘dangerous’ beings.  Places like Kokpinidonni, Toronlawna and Watlawna also represent points  in the social landscape where emotions and social values coincide. The sea  worm festival in western Sumba represents a similar conjunction of space and  sentiment. Janet Hoskins (1983:205) describes how in the waxing light of the  moon, the beaches around Kodi in the month of February are awash with the  swarming ‘sexual dance’ of sea worms and humans. While Hoskins invokes  a logic of analogy between the fertility of the sea and human sexual license, I  would like to go one step further and suggest here that places like Kokpinidonni  are focal points in a discourse which produces ‘promiscuous geographies of  dwelling in place’ (Jacobs 1996:5). In speaking of promiscuous geographies,  Jane Jacobs (1996:5) has in mind the ever-shifting negotiations of identity  and difference which arise from the ‘cohabitation of variously empowered  people and the meanings they ascribed to localities and places’. As Jacobs  (1996:5) points out, in this notion of politically-engaged, impassioned space  ‘the categories of Self and Other, here and there, past and present, constantly  solicit one another’.  For the people of Luang, this particular experience of dwelling in place,  epitomized by the solicitous relationship between themselves and powerful  beings, is in a continual state of tension. On the one hand, the features and  actions of these beings suggest that they share the same values and concerns as  humans. Yet, on the other hand, their non-human attributes and often inhuman  17  In many parts of Maluku, particularly in Maluku Tenggara, the wearing of red cloth is associ- ated with warfare, specifically headhunting.  18  The dangerous potential of ‘sacred’ sites for both locals and outsiders is a belief also found  among indigenous people in Australia. For example, Memmott and Trigger (1998:119) report that  there are coastal and offshore ‘Dreaming’ sites that can create heavy rain, strong winds, rough  seas and even cyclones if interfered with by outsiders. </page> <page sequence="18"> 88 Sandra Pannell behaviour points to their transcendence of the human order, or perhaps to the  extremes possibilities of the human condition. By avoiding or minimizing  contact with these beings through the observation of a series of prohibitions  and prescriptions, people on Luang attempt to neutralize the moral effects of  a perceived continuity between themselves and these non-human entities. As  Valeri (2000) points out, taboo in these situations often marks both a relationship  of similarity and effects a recognition of difference. In the dangerous waters of  Luang, the maintenance of this difference, in the form of the social order and  relations of the community, is always a profoundly unstable enterprise. In this ambivalent experience of dwelling in place, the people of Luang  are not alone. They inhabit a landscape which is ‘doubly [and even triply]  occupied’ (Stewart 1997). For in addition to humans, powerful, promiscuous  agents such as the suangi figure at Watlawna, the landscape of Luang is also  inhabited by the ‘undead’. For people in the village of Luang Timur, the island  of Wekanau Darnau is identified as the place of the dead. To get to Wekanau  Darnau, the dead travel along a specific path or straat, as one informant called  it. From Luang they travel to Hu’ulagain, another keramat site associated with  a powerful being, from there they cross the deep waters between Luang and  Mettriralma, to Réranlawna (‘large forehead’), another keramat site, and then  onto the island of Wekanau Darnau. The place of the dead is described in  somewhat heavenly terms; the houses are larger, there is an abundance of food  and, importantly, palm spirit; no one works, and the women are beautiful.  People who suddenly become sick and die soon are said to have dreamed of  Wekanau Darnau and been seduced by its very earthly attractions. The island closest to Wekanau Darnau, Ammwertawnu is identified as the  place of the dead for people from Lakor, while the dead from Luang Barat travel  to the islet of Mo’or au (‘reef where trees grow’), again in the Mettriralma reef  complex. Upon reaching Mo’orau, Wekanau Darnau or Ammwertawnu, the  dead are revivified and, in the words of my informants, become ‘human again’  (BI menjadi manusia lagi), in the process, achieving a state of very un-humanlike  immortality. Thus, it is possible, and not uncommon according to local accounts,  to encounter the dead as they travel across the seas towards the keramat sites  of Wekanau Darnau, Ammwertawnu or Mo’orau or to encounter them at these  islands. As this suggests, the undead do not relinquish their bodily existence  at death, and it is this inability to distinguish the undead and other beings  from ordinary humans and animals which ‘makes them dangerous’ (Valeri  2000:24). While not regarded as dangerous as the beings at Toronlawna and  Watlawna, the undead are capable of distracting people as they sail through  the physically challenging reef environment or of interfering with their fishing  activities, cutting fishing lines and anchor ropes, for example.  For people on Luang, this landscape of named places and powerful beings  is not simply an elaborate sign system for mythological events (see Morphy  </page> <page sequence="19"> Of gods and monsters 89 1995:186). Nor is the landscape just a mnemonic or metaphor for processes that  are really going on at some other level (see Layton 1995:229). As Morphy and  Layton both argue in their respective discussions of Yolngu and Pitjantjatjarra  landscapes in north and central Australia, ‘landscape is conceived within  a cultural tradition’ so that ‘the land itself as socially constituted plays a  fundamental role in the ordering of cultural relations’ (Layton 1995:229). As  this last comment suggests, for Aboriginal people landscape is not so much a  text to be read but the discursive ground for the consummation of ancestral  actions and human experiences. Michael Taussig’s explanation (1980:15) in  ‘The devil and commodity fetishism’ for the revelatory power of magical  beliefs equally applies to landscape – both resonate with the ‘poetic echoes  of the cadences that guide the innermost course of the world’. In the context  of Luang, the cosmological landscape resonates with the social passions and  power struggles of ‘ordinary, everyday life’ (Geertz 1973:443). In this sense,  cosmologies can be viewed, to paraphrase Clifford Geertz (1973:448), as the  ‘stor[ies] people tell themselves about themselves’. However, they are more  than just ‘meta-social commentaries’ on ordinary, everyday experience. As I argue in the following sections, cosmological narratives create, articulate  and, at times, manipulate what E.V. Daniel (1990:27) identifies as ‘epistemic and  ontic realities’. That is, they provide people with a way of ‘seeing and being’ in  the world. Considered as ‘vital form[s] of social action’ (Malkki 1995:105), these  discourses have both reflexive and very real consequences, linked as they are to  ideas about sacrality and local assertions of sovereignty.  Cosmology, sovereignty and the sacred Echols and Shadily (1978:182) gloss the Arabic-derived term keramat as ‘sacred’,  ‘holy’ or as ‘having supernatural qualities’. In the anthropological literature,  the term is often applied to rituals, objects or sites associated with founding or  ancestral figures, linking the potency of an action, a thing or a place to divine  or supernatural power, grace or energy (see Bowen 1993:197; Geertz 1980:106).  This connection between place, ancestors and sacrality is also evident in the  literature from Aboriginal Australia and the Pacific. For example, in Austra- lia ‘sacred sites’ are described as places associated with the travels of ancestral  beings and the transformation of these beings into named places (see Morphy  1995). In the Pacific, Edward Hviding (1995:250) discusses ‘sacred sites’ in the  barrier reef areas of Marovo Lagoon which are ‘connected with genealogically  placed ancestors’ and linked to certain taboos. While in eastern Indonesia,  Andrew McWilliam (1996:154) describes how the concept of le’u, which carries  the ‘sense of sacred or taboo’, is ‘intimately connected to the hidden world of  ancestors, spirits and the supreme being ’ and, at the time of headhunting raids,  was focused upon the site of the ‘hostility’ cult house.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 90 Sandra Pannell In the landscape which emerges in the cosmological accounts from Luang,  the concept of keramat is not just linked to named places and powerful  ‘supernatural’ beings, but it is also positioned at the centre of a discourse on  morality, sexuality and ultimately the nature of sociality. Implicated in this  discursive topography of promiscuity, violence, danger, and power, keramat in  this context represents a peculiar or ‘uncanny’ (Gelder and Jacobs 1998) form  of the sacred. A kind of ‘impure sacred’, to borrow Durkheim’s expression for  the idea that not only ‘God but evil is part of the notion of sacredness’ (Taussig  1992:114). As Michael Taussig (1992:111-4) points out, both fear and reverence,  respect and horror are intertwined in this double helix of the sacred. Going  well beyond Durkheim, and the posturing of the sacred in terms of the double  act of good and evil, he links the ambivalent quality of the sacred not just  to society, but to the ‘cultural practice of Statecraft’ (Taussig 1992:115). For  Taussig (1992:116), it is the inter-penetration of the sacred with the impure  and the erotic, and its link to the ‘trafficking’ between rationality and violence,  which contributes to the attraction and repulsion of the state.  Like Taussig, Phillip Winn (2003) draws our attention to ‘the involvement  of the sacred in local questions of power, autonomy and sovereignty’ in some  of the writings on headhunting in Indonesia. For instance, in his account of  ‘history, politics and headhunting in southwest Timor’, McWilliam (1996:146)  discusses how the: Development of the political domain under Nabuasa leadership was constituted  as both a political and a religious system. The continuing prosperity of the wider  political community was underpinned by an ongoing communication with the  hidden world of ancestors and spirits.  Picking up on this relationship between politics and cosmology, Kenneth  George (1996:69), in his discussion of the cultural politics of headhunting,  argues that ‘cosmographic ideas can shape and take shape from a lived-in  ethnic and political terrain’. Crucial to George’s analysis is the role played by  the ‘grotesque’ in the political economy of ritual headhunting. By ‘grotesque’,  George (1996:92) has in mind: The kind of imagery and discourse that fore- ground the monstrous, the fantastic and bizarre, the exaggerated, the incon- gruous, and the terrifying or awe-provoking. As George (1996:96) remarks, the grotesque imagery of headhunting ‘lies  at the heart of traditional upland ‘official’ discourse and power’. In his work,  the grotesque is foremost a ‘mode of political discourse’ (George 1996:100),  akin in many ways to Taussig’s discussion of the insinuation of the impure  sacred in the cultural practices of the state. In the final sections of this article, I briefly explore this relationship between  the ‘grotesque’/ ‘impure sacred’, cosmology, and sovereignty within the con- text of boundary and marine resource disputes in Luang.  </page> <page sequence="21"> Of gods and monsters 91 Domains of difference, polities of power All of the named places and beings mentioned so far are associated with one  of the eleven polities which originally occupied the summits of the eleven hills  on Luang. In the middle or ‘navel’ of the island (nohophoraraiapnu) was located  Uhutéla’a, Mnyettumjau, Watihli Wattriha (also known as Lettra Wo’ora) and  Lakkamno’a. In the front or ‘face’ of the island (nohulugairierna) was Wet- tagai Lettra, while at the back or ‘tail’ of the island (nohuputnaraitiawnu) was  Watulu Harulu, Mnowaru, Wo’ormaha, Ihlura Watunhora, Melai Watukali  and Noknokamaupéhi.  Often described as kampung lama (BI) or leta tgakmu (‘old village’), the physi- cal remains of these eleven polities are evident as a series of multi-terraced,  stone-walled compounds. According to local narratives, the present-day indig- enous residents of Luang (known as ornoha or orleta, ‘people of the island’ or  ‘people of the village’) are the descendants of the original occupiers of the five  polities which remained on Luang after a period of prolonged warfare involv- ing all eleven hill-top states. As previously mentioned, people from six of these  leta were forced to flee the island due to local hostilities, and the descendants of  these original occupiers can be found throughout the province of Maluku.  People on Luang trace the origins of the leta rahuna (BI soa)19 on Luang,  and their constituent rahuna a’na (BI marga) or ‘house’ groups, to the ancestral  figures associated with the remaining five original states. According to local  narratives, the occupiers of the remaining five village-states descended from  the original leta sites and settled together on either the east or west coast of  Luang, forming the physical and social foundations for the present village  communities of Luang Timur and Luang Barat. Upon leaving the original hill- top leta sites, the original occupiers acquired new names which reflect the  circumstances of their descent and settlement. Today, these names are iden- tified as referring to marga (BI) or ‘house’ groups (for example Romailioha,  Romhadi, Romlawna).  Depicted in narratives as autonomous sovereign entities, each of the eleven  polities asserted authority over specific areas of land (ra) and sea (lora), the  geographic extent of which was cosmologically decreed. The extent of these  domains is marked by named places, and the topographic features, power- ful beings and human-made signs associated with them. As one informant  observed, speaking of the history of the western-most point in the home reef  known as Mo’ora Tawnu, the original polities placed ancestral or other figures  in the landscape to establish the name of a place and to give a physical pres- ence to their assertion of territorial authority.20 These site-specific beings are  19  In the village of Luang Timur, there are four soa; Tuprulu Gérlorna, Pupugéni, Hinléli and  Pépupun Tra’upun, while in Luang Barat there are three: Horupun, Tiataupun and Lewnupun. 20  Dulu Melai Watukali kas turun orang di Mo’ora Tawnu, kasih tanda sebagai hak. </page> <page sequence="22"> 92 Sandra Pannell referred to in the local language as marna watu onni,21 ‘the ones who guard the  stone’, a reference to the stone shrines (nattra) which form the focus of each of  the eleven original polities and those sites identified as keramat. The ‘stones’  and other markers used to indicate the extent of the interests of each of the  different polities are known as ghéra li’ai, a term which is glossed in Indone- sian as sasi (see Pannell 1997b). A local narrative describes the origins of the  different signs used to mark territorial interests, ascribing different signs or  markers to each of the original polities which remained on the island after the  period of the great wars. The name of one of these polities, Ihlura Watunhora,  actually refers to the particular mark used by it to indicate its sovereign inter- ests. The name of this polity can be glossed as ‘the ones who lived on top of  a high mountain and who placed a stone in the ground’. While stones, lontar  leaf containers, and a hole created by an ancestral spear mark the interests of  the different polities on land, in the sea, named places in the reef complex,  which are also associated with various beings, perform this role. It is impor- tant to realize here that as markers of sovereign interests, ghéra li’ai do not  constitute linear alignments of physical objects in space, in the manner of a  wooden fence or a stone wall. Rather, ghéra li’ai are named places in the land- scape which are not only identifiable physical entities but also the products  of discourse. In this sense, ghéra li’ai focus local statements about sovereignty,  identity and history.22  A line in the water: gods and monsters II The relationship between cosmology, geography and sovereignty has been the  subject of on-going disputes and open hostilities between people from Luang  Timur and Luang Barat for at least the past hundred years or so, perhaps even  longer. One of these disputes pivots around the identity of the ancestral being  occupying the northern islands of Wekanau Darnau and Ammwertawnu,  and the geographic extent of the territorial interests and resource rights of  both villages in the reef complex of Mettriralma. A number of people link the  genesis of this particular dispute to increased demands for marine resources,  such as trepang and trochus shell, and identify the intervention of agents of  the Netherlands Indies colonial state in the late 1800s as exacerbating the situ- ation. As one senior informant stated, before the intervention of the Dutch,  there were no boundaries or lines which bisected the reef complex of Mettri- ralma into exclusive regions. While there may not have been a boundary per  21  Informants glossed this indigenous expression in Bahasa Indonesia as penjaga sasi. 22  Interestingly, when translating statements about the sovereign interests of the various found- ing villages, informants also used the Indonesian term sifat, rather than batas, to describe these  named points in the landscape. In the Echols and Shadily Indonesian-English dictionary (1985),  sifat is glossed as ‘quality’, ‘characteristic’ or ‘prospect’, while the meaning of batas is given as  ‘limit’, ‘border’ or ‘boundary’.  </page> <page sequence="23"> Of gods and monsters 93 se, areas of Mettriralma are historically linked to different founding polities  and a number of ancestral beings.  According to some accounts, Wo’orau, an ancestral figure from the vil- lage of Watulu Harulu, is identified as the first being to die and travel to and  inhabit the northern islands of Wekanau Darnau (also known as Lai Riar’i)  and Ammwertawnu. In doing so, Wo’orau established the identity of these  islands as the ‘place of the dead’.  According to another account, however, the islands of Wekanau Darnau  and Ammwertawnu are controlled by a dangerous old woman known as  Rarweru Rarwatu from Watulu Harulu, the same ancestral village as that of  Wo’orau. According to this account, an ancestor from the village of Wo’ormaha  caught the old woman stealing his palm wine. To punish her, the ancestor from  Wo’ormaha decreed that she could only eat from the islands of Wekanau Darnau  and Ammwertawnu, which the village of Wo’ormaha claimed authority over.  In this account, the ancestral occupiers of Wo’ormaha assert a sovereign right  over the entire Mettriralma complex, including Meti Miarang (also known as  Lai Tranna), the sand island in the southern part of the reef complex.  While the two ancestral figures associated with the islands of Wekanau  Darnau and Ammwertawnu are from the same leta, the fundamental differ- ence between these accounts, a difference which lies at the heart of the dis- putes, is the issue of precedence and agency. In the first account, Wo’orau  precedes all others and independently establishes an authoritative and lasting  presence on the island, while in the second account, the connection of Watulu  Harulu to the island is predicated upon the actions of an ancestral figure from  a more powerful polity with prior interests in the island. In both accounts,  however, the territorial interests of Watulu Harulu appear to be confined to  the islands of Wekanau Darnau and Ammwertawnu, and perhaps the imme- diate vicinity.  People who claim descent from the ancestors of Watulu Harulu live in  Luang Timur, while the descendants of the ancestral occupiers of the village  state of Wo’ormaha reside in the village of Luang Barat. These descendants  have inter-married with members from other ‘house’ groups in the two vil- lages, contributing to a situation where proprietary claims to Mettriralma are  primarily expressed in terms of contemporary village identities (as in, Luang  Timur and Luang Barat) and not individual ‘house’ or even ‘family’ identi- ties, as some people argue should be the case. As previously indicated, the  physical extent of the interests of the two villages in Mettriralma has been the  source of considerable contention between the two communities.  In all local accounts regarding the sovereign identifications of Mettriralma,  the keramat site of Liwutenna is identified as the ‘feature’ (BI sifat) which marks  the divergence of interests of the two villages. Situated at the most westerly  point in the reef complex, Liwutenna is described as a ‘very hot’ place, associa- </page> <page sequence="24"> 94 Sandra Pannell ted with an extremely dangerous being. People from both Luang Barat and  Luang Timur acknowledge the potency of Liwutenna and are aware of the  unfortunate fate which awaits those who transgress past this point. Tradition- ally, Liwutenna constituted the only ghéra li’ai in the Metrriralma complex  which exerted a powerful, and limiting influence upon the movements and  activities of villagers from both communities.  At some point in the late 1800s or early 1900s, the issue of the delineation of  sovereign interests in Mettriralma came to a violent head and the Dutch ‘dis- trict officer’ (controleur) for the area intervened. There is some suggestion that  the fighting was triggered by accusations that people from each community  were poaching marine resources, particularly trepang, from the other’s area.  The event which marked the supposed resolution of the dispute consisted of  an interesting amalgamation of state and local ‘native political rituals’ (Sahlins  1981). In true colonial fashion, the Dutch formalized the divergence of interests  of the two communities by introducing a boundary and erecting stone cairns  to mark the western and eastern points of this line in the water.23 In doing so, it  could be said that the Dutch attempted to place their own gods and monsters  in the politically-charged, cosmological landscape of Luang. In selecting an easily identifiable physiographic feature, known locally  as Liotaliota Plalahwa, a large area of ‘deep water’, as signalling the eastern  point of this border of difference, the Dutch effectively cut the reef system of  Mettriralma into two. Luang Timur would control the northern half, while  Luang Barat exploited the southern section of the reef system. Unbeknown to  the Dutch officials, their own cultural practices of statecraft nicely dovetailed  with local political rituals concerning the assertion of sovereign right. The  western point chosen by the Dutch to mark the boundary was the physically  obvious western tip of the reef complex. As previously mentioned, this point  is known locally as Liwutenna, a keramat site implicated in the local land- scape of sovereign power. For people on Luang, the presence of the power- ful being at Liwutenna constituted a far more effective influence on people’s  movements than any stone cairn erected by the colonial state. Interestingly,  the stone cairn that was erected at this point was not seen as desecration of  this site. On the contrary. The stone marker erected by the Dutch at Liwutenna  was regarded as recognition of the keramat status of the site, with the cairn  likened to a traditional ancestral shrine (nattra).  To mark the event, the local government heads (BI orang kaya) from Luang  Timur and Luang Barat, journeyed to Liwutenna and at low tide, spread a  locally ‘woven cloth’ (BI kain tenun) on top of the exposed reef and together  23  As Moore (1996:135) points out in his discussion of environmental struggles in Zimbabwe,  ‘the separation of cordoned spaces sanctioned by property deeds’ is a characteristically colonial  practice ‘critical to state control of subject populations’. This practice, as Osseweijer et al. (2003)  observe, is not confined to a colonial past but is readily invoked by contemporary governments  and non-government organizations.  </page> <page sequence="25"> Of gods and monsters 95 they sumpah sopi (BI). While the Dutch officials may have viewed the ritual  drinking of palm spirit at Liwutenna as a quaint, local conclusion to the cairn- erecting ceremony, for people from Luang the drinking and spilling of sopi did  not mark the end of the dispute. Nor did it signal or celebrate local recogni- tion of the sovereign power of the Netherlands Indies State. Rather, this politi- cal ritual was aimed at establishing whose claim to sovereign authority was  cosmologically authenticated by ancestral potency (compare A. Weiner 1992).  In this search for truth, so one account goes, the orang kaya of Luang Timur  died soon after the sopi ceremony, losing his tongue as a result of a mysterious  cut to it. For people in Luang Barat, the alleged death of the orang kaya from  Luang Timur is interpreted as evidence of the cosmological righteousness of  their claims to the reef system.  The establishment of a state-sanctioned boundary at Mettriralma did  not herald the cessation of hostilities between the two village communities.  Rather, the colonial introduction of a line in the water triggered off new argu- ments about the location of this bureaucratic border and the gods and mon- sters associated with it. The disputes revolve around the site which marks the  extent of the interests of the two villages on the eastern side of the reef. The  marine feature selected by the Dutch, Liotaliota Plalahwa, as signalling the  approximate location of the eastern point in the boundary, is a cosmologi- cally neutral and ancestrally devoid area of water in the reef system. While all  parties acknowledge the ‘occult’ significance and power of Liwutenna in the  west, and there is no suggestion of abandoning this site as a boundary marker,  in the east there are attempts to re-anchor the border to a site which is cosmo- logically empowered in local discourse. Thus, people from Luang Barat argue  that the ancestral interests of people from Luang Timur are confined to the  region of Wekanua Darnau. Accordingly, they stipulate that their interests do  not extend beyond Réranlawna, a dangerous, ancestor-inhabited keramat site  in the northern section of the reef complex. Drawing upon the cultural logic of  previous state territorial practices, as further evidence for this assertion they  point to the existence of a ‘straat’ between Réranlawna and Liwutenna which  is said to be free of rocks and is likened to a ‘main road’ (BI jalan raya), link- ing the two named markers. Indirectly acknowledging the authoritative limits  of their ancestral claim to Mettriralma, people from Luang Timur insist that  Liotaliota Plalahwa marks the boundary in the east. In doing so, they harness  their claims to the cosmological authenticity of another divine power – the  state. Indeed, it is apparent that in the guise of desa (BI) or ‘village govern- ments’, both communities draw upon the ‘mythic power’ (Taussig 1992:122)  or totemic energy of the Indonesian state to further authenticate their asser- tions and actions. In recent years, both desa have been busy erecting and re- erecting stone cairns at Mettriralma in the name of this organ of supreme  potency.  </page> <page sequence="26"> 96 Sandra Pannell Conclusion The sacred and sovereign power enshrined in stone erections (also in stone  objects and monoliths) has long been recognized in Australian Aboriginal  anthropology.24 Writing of oval or oblong-shaped stone objects called ‘Chur- inga’ by Aranda people, Durkheim (1965:141) observed that these objects are  not only ‘eminently sacred things’ but their potency is also intrinsically linked  to the patriarchy exercised by initiated men. The power of these objects is sen- sually communicated to the men by rubbing the greased boards and stones  across the lower parts of their bodies. As Durkheim (1965:143) points out,  these objects are both desired and adored, and their loss is the ‘greatest mis- fortune which can happen to the group’. While Durkheim viewed Aboriginal  religious adoration of ‘Churinga’ as ultimately the fetishization of society, the  sentiments associated with these objects also attach to the ancestral environ- ment which the objects are regarded as manifestations of. While this latter  point is much overlooked in Durkheim’s treatment of Aboriginal totemism, it  occupies a central place in Géza Rohéim’s analysis (1945) of Aboriginal myths  from Central Australia. Rohéim observes that these myths are ‘full of phallic heroes, who march  gloriously and triumphantly across the landscape performing rituals as  they go, rituals whose libidinal origins are evidence by forms of symbolic  sexuality’.25 He argues that through ceremonial participation, Aboriginal  people’s relationship to the environment has been thoroughly ‘libidinized’  (Rohéim 1945:9). According to Rohéim, the libidinization of the landscape  functions to make a virtue out of the necessity of a nomadic way of life in a  ‘harsh’ desert region. While mindful of the limitations of his psychoanalyti- cal approach, and T. Strehlow’s criticism (1971:xlii) that Rohéim was duped  by his informants who ‘liberally’ supplied him with ‘odd’ or ‘unusual sexual  information’, Rohéim’s work does, however, alert us to the explicit sensual  and sexual nature of indigenous (and non-indigenous) cosmologies.26  One is reminded here of Sahlin’s description of the Hawaiian cultural order  as ‘a political economy of love’ (Sahlin 1985:19), where sex is both everywhere  24  For example, in their book, Uncanny Australia, Gelder and Jacobs (1998) discuss how Uluru  (‘Ayers Rock’) is a ‘meta-sacred site’ which stands at the centre of a discourse on nationalism and  Aboriginal land rights.  25  Morton 1988:xx. In another analysis of myths from Central Australia, Isobel White (1975)  discusses the violent nature of sexual relations depicted in these accounts. Arguing that myths  generally can be seen as a ‘charter for the values of society, as represented in desires and fears’,  White (1975:138) concludes that the ‘violence of sexual relations in Central Australian myths [is]  a reflection of the sexual values of a male-dominated society’. 26  One is reminded here of Simon Schama’s discussion (1995) of the ‘primitive’ Arcadian land- scape depicted in Greek myth. Contrary to later depictions, the original myth constructed Arca- dia as ‘the playground of the unchained senses’ (Schama 1995:530), marked by the interplay of  ‘bestiality’, ‘brutishness’, ‘wildness’ and ‘fecundity’.  </page> <page sequence="27"> Of gods and monsters 97 and ‘everything: rank, power, wealth, [and] land’ (Sahlin 1985:26). Both Rohé- im’s notion of a landscape invigorated by a ‘promiscuous sacredness’ (Gelder  and Jacobs 1998:117) and Sahlins’ idea of a kingdom structured by beauty and  sexual attraction takes us beyond the usual male-female symbolism reported  for indigenous cosmologies and, for that matter, beyond the anthropological  tradition of narrowly understood political systems.  References to the sensual, political, erotic, and aesthetic scenery of socio- cosmological landscapes, which we see so compellingly explored in the work  of Rohéim, Sahlins, and others like Simon Schama (1995), are largely muted in,  if not absent from, discussions of indigenous cosmologies from Indonesia and  Australia. Indeed, as Franca Tamisari points out with respect to writings on  Aboriginal cosmologies and epistemologies, it is only relatively recently that  the ‘poetic’, ‘affective’ and ‘experiential’ aspects of the relationship between  Aboriginal people and country (both sea and land) has been considered  (Tamisari 1998:249). She suggests that an anthropological preoccupation with  social organization, together with an approach to ‘land as space rather than a  series of experienced places’ (Tamisari 1998:250), are underlying reasons for  the ‘static portrayal’ of indigenous cosmological landscapes. Tamisari’s com- ments equally apply to the ethnographic situation in eastern Indonesia, where  the study of the ‘poetics of place’ is in ‘early efflorescence’ (Fox 1997:3), while  the discussion of indigenous sea cosmologies is, for all intents and purposes,  still in the bud.  Examination of the anthropological literature on eastern Indonesia reveals  that people’s relationship to the sea is either spoken of as; a physical ‘setting’,  part of a system of folk orientation based upon a land-sea opposition, a range  of economic activities, or discussed in terms of the cultural symbolism of the  boat. While there are a considerable number of ethnographic references to the  meaning of boats and the widespread association of boats with some form of  social organization, by and large, anthropologists have chosen to pass over  the significance of the ‘boat’ in favour of detailed discussion and analysis of  the ‘house’. As I conclude in a recent article, the anthropological record points  to a very ‘unromantic’ view of indigenous people’s relationship to the sea.27  If this is the case, then perhaps the ‘ethnographic blindspot’ I referred to at  the beginning of this article should be extended to include the study of indig- enous sea cosmologies as poetic topographies of the diverse and sometimes  subversive experiences of human life.28  27  Pannell 1994. I use the term ‘romantic’ here to try and capture the kind of sentiments Stephen  Greenblatt (1990) speaks of when using the concepts of ‘resonance’ and ‘wonder’ to characterize  what he calls ‘new historicism’. ‘Romancing the sea’, as an exercise in writing, thus involves cap- turing the mysterious, the sensual, the dangerous, the erotic and nostalgic qualities ascribed to  particular places or spaces. 28  The reference to ‘poetic’ here draws upon the Greek root of this term, ‘poiein’, ‘to make’. </page> <page sequence="28"> 98 Sandra Pannell Acknowledgements This article is based upon approximately four months anthropological research  on the island of Luang.
