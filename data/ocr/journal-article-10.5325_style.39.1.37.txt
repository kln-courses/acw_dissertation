<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Daniel C. Strack The University of Kitakyushu Who Are the Bridge-Builders? Metaphor,  Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 1. Introduction Rudyard Kipling is remembered not just as an author but as a spokesperson for  an era. Perhaps because of his dual status, literary scholars tend to treat Kipling’s  aesthetics and his imperialism as two separate domains. While such a bifurcated  analytical strategy will certainly aid the literary critic in achieving a conveniently  twofold general assessment of the author, this imaginary divide fails to reflect the  subtle ways in which art and ideology cohere in Kipling’s literary works. In this  paper I will examine Kipling’s short story “The Bridge-Builders,” specifically  focusing on how bridge-building serves as a metaphorical expression of imperial- ism. Once I have demonstrated the bridge’s metaphorical role, I will analyze the  metonymies that lend essential interpretive background to this metaphor, thereby  providing a more nuanced understanding of the story. From the critic’s perspective,  analysis of the bridge-building metaphor will reaffirm Kipling’s notorious role as  propagandist for the imperialist cause. Examination of metonymy, however, reveals  another side of Kipling: his idealistic vision for imperial reform. At the theoreti- cal level, this examination of the interplay between metaphor and metonymy will  demonstrate how a reader’s seemingly unprompted understanding of metaphor in  narrative context may actually be decisively shaped by subtle metonymic cues. 2. Identifying Metaphor in “The Bridge-Builders” 2.1. Metaphor in Literary Context Metaphor is not simply rhetorical ornamentation but is part of a conceptual process  crucial to everyday communication. For example, the statement “His path in life  hasn’t been easy” is conceptualized according to the metaphor life is a journey.  Concerning such expressions, cognitive linguist George Lakoff states: “These are  ordinary, everyday English expressions. They are not poetic, nor are they necessarily  used for special rhetorical effect. . . .  Examples like this show that what is involved  is not just conventional language, but a conventional mode of thought” (“Invari- ance” 47). The numerous entailments of a metaphor result in extended metaphor  when used in combination, and analysis of such extended metaphor is common in  cognitive linguistics. If we extend the life is a journey metaphor, we understand  that one’s birth is the beginning of the journey, one’s destination is the goal of  the journey, and the events of one’s life are the path along which a person travels.

Strack Although the theoretical framework provided by Lakoff and Mark Johnson in  Metaphors We Live By is sufficient for analysis of relatively straightforward ex- amples of metaphor in both literature and everyday language, literature in particular  often includes metaphor that may be evident only with respect to a discourse in its  entirety. Megametaphors represent a specific type of extended metaphor in which  fragments of each metaphorical domain are instantiated within a text cumulatively  while overt connections between the source and target domains prove elusive if  not altogether absent. According to Paul Werth, megametaphors are “overarching”  metaphors that express the “gist” of an extended discourse (97). Peter Stockwell  characterizes megametaphor as the situation occurring when “conceptual metaphors  occur repeatedly throughout a text, often at pivotal moments and often in the form  of thematically significant extended metaphors” (111). Megametaphor in extended  discourse is often difficult to detect and confirm because it tends to function sur- reptitiously by way of scattered references rather than overtly through verbally  compact comparisons. Does this mean that empirical analysis of megametaphor in  an extended work is out of the question? Not necessarily. If megametaphor can be  identified in a given work, a close reading of the text may serve to verify its role  and identify the ways in which the metaphorical strategy echoes and elaborates on  other aspects of the narrative. Although the title of “The Bridge-Builders” alone may seem evidence enough  to warrant a closer examination of bridges in the story, a much stronger case can  be made. I have previously given three straightforward criteria for making a pre- liminary judgment concerning likely megametaphors within a work of extended  prose (“Deliver” 98-100). Although a megametaphor candidate that does not satisfy  these conditions cannot be ruled out, affirmative answers to all three questions  may be seen as provisional confirmation. First, is the probable megametaphor  referred to in the story’s title? Second, do key words or concepts relating to the  likely megametaphor appear with great frequency in the body of the text? Third,  do key words or concepts relating to the probable megametaphor appear during  particularly eventful passages or during times of decisive character development?  In the case of “The Bridge-Builders,” all of these criteria are satisfied. As for the first criterion, the image of a bridge is indeed overtly referred to in  the work’s title by use of the word “bridge” itself. In accordance with the second  criterion, the word “bridge,” either standing alone or in conjunction with other  words (as in “bridge-builder”), is mentioned 65 times in the story’s 33 pages for an  average of 1.97 tokens per page. The total word count for the story is 12,582 words,  and so the ratio of bridge tokens to total words comes to 0.005. When pronouns and  other implicit references to bridges (i.e., synonyms like “arch, ” pronouns like “it,”  or terms that refer to specific parts of a bridge like “pier”) are included, the total  number of bridge references climbs to 205 for an average of 6.21 references per  page and a bridge reference to total word ratio of 0.016, meaning that more than  one out of every hundred words in the text refers to a bridge. Statistically speaking,  explicit bridge tokens and bridge placeholder tokens are very profuse within the  </page> <page sequence="3"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 39 text. As for the third criterion, the overall plot deals crucially with the construction  of a bridge and the concerns of every major character center on the bridge. Most  events take place near the bridge, and even during the scene that takes place on an  island downriver, the subject of conversation is still the bridge. Both statistically  and thematically, the bridge has a pervasive presence in the story, a presence amply  reflected in the title of the work. 2.2. A Summary of “The Bridge-Builders”  “The Bridge-Builders,” set in India, describes the final stages of a project to build  a bridge across the Ganges River. Findlayson, his assistant Hitchcock, and Peroo,  the Indian foreman, have each invested three years of strenuous effort in overseeing  the spanning of “Mother Gunga,” as the river is referred to locally. While Find- layson and Hitchcock are confident the bridge of their design will be successfully  completed, Peroo is concerned that its construction will be an affront to the local  deities and that Mother Gunga will see to its destruction. Peroo’s apprehension  seems well-founded as word comes of heavy rains upstream and floodwaters mov- ing toward the bridge. With the nearly completed bridge in danger of being washed  away, Findlayson goes to inspect the works and secure some boats being used in  construction. Peroo, hoping to calm his nerves, offers him some opium, which he  accepts. The effect on Findlayson is greater than he had anticipated, and he falls  into an unsecured boat. Peroo, relatively less affected by the opium, follows him  into the boat just before it is swept away by the floodwaters. Miraculously stranded  on an island downriver, the two drug-addled bridge-builders are forced to weather  the storm until morning. Perhaps due to the opium, they witness a supernatural council of the local  gods, each taking the form of an animal. Coming before the council as a crocodile,  Mother Gunga attempts to persuade the others to destroy the bridge, her own efforts  having been unsuccessful. Some gods agree with her that the bridge-builders have  indeed gone too far and that the bridge should be eliminated. Others, including the  elephant god Ganesh, argue that all human effort is simply digging in the dirt and  will come to nothing in the end, so the bridge is best ignored. The next morning,  Peroo and Findlayson are rescued, but their interpretations of what they had seen  on the island differ greatly. Peroo believes that they had both seen a holy vision,  while Findlayson credits his nightmares to the effects of the opium. Upon their  rescue, Findlayson is relieved to discover that his bridge has weathered the storm. 2.3. Metaphorical Rivalry in “The Bridge Builders”   While thematic and statistical evidence points toward the bridge’s role as a metaphor  in “The Bridge-Builders,” in fact there are few overt signs of this role at the outset.  The story opens with mention of the final stages of the bridge’s construction and  looks forward to its opening: “Now, in less than three months, if all went well, his  Excellency the Viceroy would open the bridge in state, an archbishop would bless it,  and the first trainload of soldiers would come over it, and there would be speeches”  (5). While there are indications that the bridge has been designed to serve at least  </page> <page sequence="4"> 40 Daniel C. Strack some military purpose, the anticipation of crossing by soldiers is not a metaphori- cal allusion but a practical fact. Having said this is not to diminish the passage’s  importance; in fact, just a page later the reader will likely recall this introduction  when trying to make sense of some otherwise ambiguous narrative comments. The first subtle indication that the bridge may be functioning as something  more than simply a generic artifact and prop appears toward the end of the next  paragraph: “East and west and north and south the construction-trains rattled and  shrieked up and down the embankments, the piled trucks of brown and white stone  banging behind them till the side-boards were unpinned, and with a roar and a  grumble a few thousand tons more material were flung out to hold the river in place”  (6). That the bridge, once completed, would “hold the river in place” rather than  simply facilitate crossing seems an observation beyond the normal characteriza- tion of a bridge’s function. That this pinning action is being accomplished from all  four directions, “east and west and north and south,” further accentuates the great  river’s status as victim of some Lilliputian conspiracy. The next paragraph, however,  moves the focus from the Ganges River back to Findlayson, the bridge’s designer: Findlayson, C. E., turned on his trolley and looked over the face of the country that he had  changed for seven miles around. Looked back on the humming village of five thousand  workmen; up stream and down, along the vista of spurs and sand; across the river to the far  piers, lessening in the haze; overhead to the guard-towers—and only he knew how strong  those were—and with a sigh of contentment saw that his work was good. There stood his  bridge before him in the sunlight, lacking only a few weeks’ work on the girders of the  three middle piers—his bridge, raw and ugly as original sin, but pukka—permanent—to  endure when all memory of the builder, yea, even of the splendid Findlayson truss, had  perished.  (6) Findlayson views his nearly completed bridge with a sigh of contentment and  pronounces it “good.” For just a moment, Findlayson’s assessment recalls God’s  reflection on creation in Genesis. Indeed, the bridge-builder seemingly towers  over the bridge in Kipling’s depiction, and such characterization all but forces the  reader to recognize hubris on Findlayson’s part. Furthermore, the mention of the  “Findlayson truss,” a technological advance in bridge-building design, evokes the  idea of “trusses” or bonds as much as it does trestle technology, echoing the previ- ous passage indicating that the completed bridge would “hold the river in place.”  In the same passage, the bridge’s true nature is revealed: it is “as raw and ugly  as original sin.” Undercutting Findlayson’s high opinion of his design, Kipling  intimates that the bridge is somehow tainted even before its completion; although  there is no direct reference to the bridge’s strategic role, the alert reader will recall  the anticipated crossing of soldiers mentioned previously. The bridge’s reason for  existence lies in the subjugation and exploitation of India. Of course Findlayson  understands these sinister aspects; but, immersed in design details and engineering  calculations, he cares little about the actual military and economic functions the  bridge will serve once completed. Soon after, Peroo goes to check on whether the piers of the bridge are  withstanding “the scouring of Mother Gunga” (9). From this point in the story,  Kipling uses Mother Gunga, a local name for the Ganges River, with ever greater  </page> <page sequence="5"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 41 frequency and, perhaps not coincidentally, the river begins to show more and more  “personality.” The use of the name Mother Gunga (twenty-four times in the story)  allows Kipling to make observations about the temperament and “actions” of the  river without having to resort to more contrived metaphorical allusion. Since the  “mother” metaphor does not originate with the narrator, this recurrent example of  anthropomorphism in the text seems natural and unforced, as if Kipling’s attribu- tion of human personality traits to a river were for no other purpose than to add  local flavor. In typical conceptual metaphor formulation, this metaphor would be  formulated as a river is a woman; consequently, when the great Ganges River is  being “held in place” by the bridge, a proud and revered mother is being bound  and forcefully restrained. This image will recur throughout the story and in much  more explicit terms. In a passage soon to follow, Peroo twice expresses the desecration of the holy  river by the bridge. Addressing Findlayson, he states:  “Nay, Sahib. It is thus. At sea, on the Black Water, we have room to be blown up and  down without care. Here we have no room at all. Look you, we have put the river into a  dock, and run her between stone sills.”  Findlayson smiled at the “we.”  “We have bitted and bridled her. She is not like the sea, that can beat against a soft  beach. She is Mother Gunga—in irons.” His voice fell a little.  (11) By this point in the story, the metaphorical subjugation of the river by the bridge  will have become clear to the reader through repeated allusion. That this subjugation  may be standing in for some larger asymmetrical relationship, specifically the Brit- ish Empire’s subjugation of India, may be understood generally with reflection on  the bridge’s military purpose and upon the great religious and cultural significance  that the Ganges River has in Indian tradition, but this connection has not yet been  made explicitly. To the contrary, Findlayson is mildly amused by Peroo’s overawed  assessment of the situation. The river is not sacred to him, nor does he recognize  the claims of those that may think of it in such terms. The turning point in the story, the point at which Findlayson’s self-satisfaction  with his bridge turns to genuine concern over its continuing structural integrity,  occurs immediately following Findlayson and Hitchcock’s rather condescending  discussion of Peroo’s conflicted religious observances. After mentioning that he  prays to Mother Gunga when in India and prayed to St. Paul’s Cathedral while in  London, Hitchcock remarks:  “He told me that the first time he went into the engine-room of a steamer, when he was  a boy, he prayed to the low-pressure cylinder.”  “Not half a bad thing to pray to, either. He’s propitiating his own Gods now, and he  wants to know what Mother Gunga will think of a bridge being run across her. Who’s  there?” A shadow darkened the doorway, and a telegram was put into Hitchcock’s hand.   (12) This telegram informs the two men of mounting floodwaters. Thereafter, Mother  Gunga begins to take an “active” role, and Findlayson and Hitchcock can do little  except patiently wait out her fierce attempts to throw off the offending bridge. Upon  </page> <page sequence="6"> 42 Daniel C. Strack learning of the river’s sudden change in disposition, Peroo is unsurprised: “The  bridge challenges Mother Gunga,” said Peroo, with a laugh. “But when she talks,  I know whose voice will be the loudest” (15). The bridge is now portrayed as an  active conspirator against Mother Gunga, but the broader metaphorical implications  of its adversarial presence are still not explicit. As the floodwaters crest, the anthropomorphized battle between Mother  Gunga and the bridge reaches its crescendo. Kipling seems reluctant to miss any  opportunity to personalize the conflict: “the face of the river whitened from bank to  bank between the stone facings,” until Peroo called out for Mother Gunga to fight  hard, “for it is thus that a woman wears herself out” (16-17). In the five paragraphs  describing the river’s sudden upsurge in activity, Mother Gunga is described as  making “haste,” lifting “herself bodily from the river,” “plucking and fingering  along the revetments,” and “licking the throat of the piers.” The bridge’s response  is no less anthropomorphized: “There was a shriek above the roar of the water, the  complaint of the spans coming down on their blocks as the cribs were whirled out  from under their bellies” (16). At the end of this depiction, Findlayson and Peroo are swept toward an island  downstream after falling into a boat they had unsuccessfully attempted to secure.  In the thick of their opium trance, they perceive local deities in the form of animals  gathering for a conference. In this scene, the two domains of the megametaphor,  imperialism and bridge-building, are finally linked. First Mother Gunga bellows,  “Hour by hour the water falls and their bridge still stands” (23). She mentions the  bridge as “their bridge” without saying exactly who “they” are. Indeed, her speeches  give little indication that she recognizes the work of individuals like Findlayson  or Hitchcock. Her repeated complaints against “them” eventually culminate with  an impassioned plea: “The justice of the Gods on the Bridge-Builders!” With this  curse, it becomes even more apparent that she is referring to a larger group. Kipling  has capitalized the term “Bridge-Builders” and, in so doing, implicitly has extended  the term to include everyone involved in the venture, from the local workers to the  London financiers. Her complaints are leveled against the entire imperial project  and all of its participants. Seen in this light, “bridge-building” becomes synonymous  with empire-building and the megametaphorical connection, although somewhat  tenuous and difficult to detect, is established. Later in the conversation, the god Hanuman, the ape, confirms the reader’s  suspicion that the term “Bridge-Builders” is now referring to a group that does  more than simply build bridges. Remarking on the apparent futility of belatedly  resisting the imperialists, he says: Ye should have slain at the beginning, when the men from across the water had taught our  folk nothing. Now my people see their work and go away thinking. They do not think of  the Heavenly Ones altogether. They think of the fire-carriage and the other things that the  bridge-builders have done, and when your priests thrust forward hands asking alms, they  give unwillingly a little.  (31) While the term “bridge-builders” is no longer capitalized, the context shows that  the people in question came “from across the water” (across the ocean) and are  </page> <page sequence="7"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 43 responsible for the “fire-carriage” (railway locomotive). In Hanuman’s speech, we  find unambiguous confirmation that the term “bridge-builders” is being used as a  synonym for imperialists generally. With this passage, the megametaphorical roles played by the bridge and  Mother Gunga, respectively, become evident. As Mother Gunga complains to  the council about the bridge, it is simultaneously a complaint by traditional India  against intruding imperialists who bring with them foreign technology and new  ways of thinking. From Findlayson’s perspective, bridge-building exemplifies the  development of India’s transportation system being graciously provided by the  British Empire. To him, the Ganges River is nothing more than a powerful “hill-fed  sewer,” embodying all that is negative about Indian culture. Paranoid, superstitious,  illogical, and intransigent, Mother Gunga stands for India’s irrational resistance  to cultural “progress.” Kipling’s combination of metaphors attempts to assure the  reader that the difficulties to be overcome by bridge-building (imperialism) are  perennial problems that stem from the nature of India itself. 2.4. Bridge-building and Imperialism in Cognitive Linguistic Context As objects, bridges are often visually compelling. In artificially uniting areas that  would otherwise be separated, they are philosophically compelling. Sociologist  Georg Simmel remarked, “The bridge becomes an aesthetic value insofar as it  accomplishes the connection between what is separated not only in reality and in  order to fulfill practical goals, but in making it directly visible” (67). In this sense,  conceptualization of bridges stems from understanding not only how bridges func- tion but how that function is perceived spatially. Such interdependency of form and  function results in just the type of highly evocative image that artists and authors  tend to exploit. This being the case, when an author uses a bridge in a narrative and  that bridge seems particularly evocative, is the evocation accomplished through the  word “bridge” and its lexical associations or through the nonverbal associations  the word may happen to excite within the mind of the reader? Cognitive linguist  Ronald Langacker has observed that language is “inextricably bound up with  psychological phenomena that are not specifically linguistic in character” (12).  Because literature inheres in language, literature will also access phenomena “not  specifically linguistic in character.” Echoing Simmel, I will assert that bridges as  objects are exceptionally suited to tap into such extralinguistic aspects of cognition. Bridges share basic orientational similarities with the English preposition  “across,” a closed-class form mentioned by cognitive linguist Leonard Talmy  (207-25), which results from “schematic pictorial representation” of transverse  movement from one distinct area to another (165). Put differently, the preposition  “across” is crucially linked to the extralinguistic spatial understanding necessary for  navigating the world we live in. Before going “across” a bridge, we must identify  the bridge itself as having the physical characteristics necessary for crossing. For  the very reason that bridges are visually recognized by way of schematic pictorial  representation, they may be understood and utilized independently of language. The divergence between imperialism as a concept and its objectified image  </page> <page sequence="8"> 44 Daniel C. Strack as a bridge stems from certain characteristics of bridges that are discordant with  the idea of empire. Functionally speaking, bridges are quintessentially egalitarian  objects in that they allow freedom of movement to any who care to cross them. To  the extent that bridges represent a tangible manifestation of human volition, they  stand for the possibility of overcoming barriers in life, and so bridges are decidedly  optimistic entities in their abstract form. The fact that the bridge is typically seen  in such positive terms surely weighed heavily in Kipling’s choice of metaphor to  express an optimistic view of imperialist ambitions. In literature as in life, however, context cannot be ignored. Although a bridge  may be egalitarian in performing its function at a specific location, both its pres- ence at that particular location and the role it plays there have been preordained to  provide maximum benefit for the constituency that planned it, whether that group  is a village, a nation, or an empire. If the bridge is a response to local needs and  has been constructed with local resources, there may not be a problem. If the cost- benefit analysis has been calculated from afar, however, the seemingly egalitarian  bridge can become an instrument of oppression. Furthermore, if bridges are con- crete expressions of human will generally, large bridges express human will writ  large. In the final analysis, empires build bridges because they serve the purposes  of empire and in so doing simultaneously assert confidence that the ideological  challenges presented by stable contact with other societies will be met. This is the  optimism that saturates “The Bridge-Builders” and motivates Kipling’s minutely  detailed description of bridge-building in the story.  2.5. Kipling the Bridge-Builder and Conrad the Boat-Traveler Philosopher Max Black has remarked that drawing “attention to a philosopher’s  metaphors is to belittle him—like praising a logician for his beautiful handwrit- ing” (25). In literature, calling attention to an author’s metaphors is usually not so  problematic, but when a critic goes to great lengths to expose a writer’s political  views, it is usually not to praise them. This is especially true in Kipling’s case,  which is why his proponents tend to emphasize aesthetics while his detractors focus  on ideology. Still, whether praising Kipling or burying him, critics cannot ignore  his metaphors. For his proponents Kipling’s metaphors are critical in an aesthetic  sense because they demonstrate his ability to select compelling images and control  nuances within a complex work. For his detractors, on the other hand, careful at- tention to Kipling’s metaphors will bring the author’s ideology into sharper focus. It is worth noting that, at the time of his writing, Kipling’s bridge-building  metaphor was a relatively unfamiliar one in the Indian cultural context. Because  India’s great tributaries tend to be wide, have unstable banks, and are prone to  catastrophic flooding, India has never been a particularly bridge-oriented culture  (Strack, “Miyamoto” 102). Historically, Indians have used ferries to cross rivers,  and so India tends to be a “boat culture” rather than a “bridge culture.” Perhaps  owing to this fact, while Indian Buddhist teachings use the metaphor “crossing the  river” to express the struggle to attain enlightenment, this crossing is explicitly by  boat or raft, rather than by bridge. Metaphorically speaking, crossing a river by  </page> <page sequence="9"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 45 boat represents unstable and transient interaction rather than ongoing connection.  Interpreting intercultural relationships by way of a boat-crossing metaphor would  have very different connotations from seeing them in terms of the stable connection  afforded by a bridge. Furthermore, from the everyday perspective of local Indians,  rivers were seen more as destinations in themselves or facilitators of transport than  as obstacles along the path of a journey (Terada 117). So why did Kipling choose the metaphor “bridge-building” to express British  imperial ambitions? The obvious reason is that he knew something about it. As a  reporter in India, he had covered the imperial expansion of India’s transportation  infrastructure and “wrote stories about the building of major bridges in the Punjab,  and in one of these, . . . the material specifications of Findlayson’s bridge are almost  exactly anticipated” (Pinney xxvi). Bridges are closely associated with empire- building in that bridge-building was prerequisite for railway construction, arguably  the key method of land transport in many of Britain’s colonies around the time of  Kipling’s writing (cf. Kaur xviii). Indeed, imperialism being as much an economic  venture as a military one, the colonial system generally required new transporta- tion systems to accommodate the export of goods and allow for the influx of labor  to the areas being developed, thereby attracting commercial investment (Kaur 8).  For this reason, Kipling might just as easily have placed railroad construction at  the center of his story. The reason he didn’t do so should be obvious: the bridge  served his metaphorical purposes. While the building of a railroad is a suitable index of imperial development  and economic exploitation, in its most essential form, a railway line is a continuum  between two distant points over uninterrupted land. In the abstract sense at least,  the barrier that needs to be overcome is great distance alone and so, metaphori- cally speaking, no great ideological or cultural divide would be conveyed by using  railway construction as a metaphor for empire-building. The bridge, on the other  hand, represents not a point-to-point continuum over solid ground but the creation  of a physical connection between two distinct and separate areas where there was  none before. To the extent that Kipling intended to describe the British Empire  and India as two distinct and seemingly incompatible frames of reference, bridge- building is a metaphor well-suited to the story’s ideological premises. It is not necessary to speculate on how a continuum-oriented metaphor would  function in a narrative on imperialism because Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness  (1902), first published serially in the year following the publication of “The Bridge- Builders,” uses just such a metaphorical technique to express a more pessimistic  view of empire-building. The two stories are similar in that they both contrast  seemingly reasonable portrayals of civilized European society with the suppos- edly irrational aspects of uncivilized “dark” societies. This common chauvinistic  undercurrent props them up as easy targets for postcolonial critics. Nevertheless,  by metaphorical contrast, the two works are seen to be antithetical in their expres- sion of empire-building. In Conrad’s narrative, the central theme is travel by boat on a river (another kind  of continuum scenario), and as Marlow moves gradually upriver, he experiences  spiritual darkness and moral degeneracy that culminate in his meeting with Kurtz.  </page> <page sequence="10"> 46 Daniel C. Strack Although Marlow’s trip into the Congo is portrayed as a unique and isolated event  in the imperialist venture, it becomes representative of the whole no less than the  bridge-building enterprise portrayed by Kipling. Conrad’s imperialism lacks both  dependable technology and reliable individuals to implement it and so nothing  stable is created on Marlow’s journey and no lasting changes occur except within  the imperialists themselves. Furthermore, whereas Kipling’s bridge-building is  linked with “honor” and becomes an ennobling enterprise for all who undertake  it, in Heart of Darkness imperial aspirations are seen to debase and corrupt those  who embrace them. The veneer of a civilized person’s comportment diminishes  with distance from civilized society until finally, in the heart of darkness that lies  upstream at the primordial headwaters of human prehistory, empire-builders show  themselves to be no less savage than those they are attempting to subjugate. This pessimistic view of the imperial effort could not be more different from  Kipling’s portrayal. Narrowly avoiding the dangers of personal pride (opium) and  external anarchy (Mother Gunga), Findlayson emerges from the project with his  patina of moral and intellectual superiority intact. That empire-builders accomplish  their “day’s work” largely unaffected by their endeavors and return home, their  reputations and consciences undamaged, is one subtext of the “The Bridge-Builders”  and as such it is as much propaganda for imperialism as Conrad’s work is polemic  against it. The fact that Kipling’s story displays his ideology even in his choice  of metaphor should not be surprising and goes far in explaining why Kipling’s  literature elicits such strong responses. Kipling’s metaphorical strategy in “The Bridge-Builders” is seen to be quint- essentially imperialist, and his role as an imperial propagandist, although perhaps  never seriously doubted, is further confirmed. Having analyzed the implications  of Kipling’s choice of metaphor, I will now reexamine the story, keeping the  metaphor’s two domains specifically in mind so as to detect Kipling’s strategy for  incorporating them into the text. In fact, Kipling has used metonymy to accentuate  and prefigure the moment when cross-domain linking is finally achieved and the  megametaphor’s meaning becomes overt. 3. Identifying Metonymy in the Bridge-Builders 3.1. Metonymy and Cognition In his acclaimed paper “The Metaphoric and Metonymic Poles,” Roman Jakobson  asserted that an individual’s personal style, verbal predilections, and preferences  result from tradeoffs between metonymy and metaphor as an individual makes  compositional choices based on similarity or contiguity. Contrasting the emphasis  on metaphor in the literary schools of Romanticism and Symbolism on the one hand  with Realism on the other, he states: “Following the path of contiguous relationships,  the realist author metonymically digresses from the plot to the atmosphere and from  the characters to the setting in space and time. He is fond of synecdochic details”  (43). Although Jakobson recognized the pivotal role metonymy plays in literature,  cognitive poetics has, until now, primarily focused on metaphor. As suggested by  </page> <page sequence="11"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 47 cognitive linguist Antonio Barcelona’s recent work on metonymic motivation for  metaphor, however, metonymy may turn out to be the more pervasive of the two.  By enhancing relatively inconspicuous metonymies, the author can surreptitiously  manipulate a reader’s predisposition to accept a certain metaphor before actually  exposing it to direct analysis. The existence of such a strategy diminishes somewhat  the consequence of Jakobson’s correct claim that realist authors prefer metonymy;  in fact, they may simply be using metonymy as a way of incorporating metaphor  more discretely. When an author instantiates a metaphor in a text megametaphorically, various  mirrored aspects of the two domains are subtly woven into the fabric of the narra- tive. In offering this generalization, I do not mean to imply that all authors will use  megametaphor in the same way. One author may choose to omit any overt linking  up of the domains so as to allow the reader to perceive similarities spontaneously,  leaving the job of recognizing the metaphorical potential in the mirrored domains  entirely to the reader. Alternatively, another author may set up cross-domain compari- sons so that the reader cannot avoid them, a metaphorical trap along the metonymic  garden path. Some megametaphors may function entirely at a level impervious to  direct analysis, concealed so cleverly in the details of the plot or characterization  that the artifice will remain hidden despite its subliminal effect. From a realist  author’s perspective, megametaphor is useful precisely because of its low profile. Differing approaches to megametaphor aside, the metonymic relationships in a  single domain, then, cohere within what Lakoff has termed a “cognitive topology”  (“Contemporary” 215), which is simply the domain’s “inherent image-schematic  structure.” The cognitive topology of one domain is matched up against the cogni- tive topology of another through metaphor. Having recognized the importance of  cognitive topology as the metonymic staging area for metaphor, let’s revisit earlier  passages of “The Bridge-Builders” to analyze how Kipling gradually fills out the  cognitive topologies so as to prepare the reader in advance to make the broader  megametaphorical connection. 3.2. Metonymy in “The Bridge-Builders” It has already been mentioned in passing, but the difference between a positive and  negative view of bridge-building lies entirely in the bridge’s context. developing a  relationship is building a bridge is an extremely common metaphorical extension  that occurs when the metaphor an intersection of discrete states is a bridge is  applied to interpersonal associations. The relationship may be between two indi- viduals or between two groups, but the gist is the same: efforts made to create a  friendship or improve mutual understanding may be seen as “bridge-building.” On  the surface, then, the building of the Kashi Bridge in the story seems to indicate  the development of a positive, amicable relationship between the Empire and In- dia. That this is not actually the case is revealed by looking more closely into the  cognitive topologies of the metaphorical mapping. The first aspect of the story’s cognitive topology to be highlighted in Kipling’s  narrative is the relationship of the bridge to the British Empire’s political, religious,  </page> <page sequence="12"> 48 Daniel C. Strack and military presence in India. Upon completion, the bridge would be officially  opened by His Excellency the Viceroy and an archbishop. By juxtaposing these  political and religious representatives of the Empire with the bridge, Kipling uses  metonymy to define the bridge’s larger context: it is a public manifestation of  the Empire’s collective will. Furthermore, using part for whole metonymy, the  “big guns” incorporated into the bridge’s structure establish the bridge’s role as  an extension of the Empire’s military power. All of these metonymic associations  prefigure the more overt metaphorical association that will be established in the  speeches by Mother Gunga and Hanuman on the island at a later point in the story. Details of characterization also contribute to the metonymic development of  the story’s cognitive topology, closely linking Findlayson with the Empire and  Findlayson with the bridge. From his introduction as an official of the Public Works  Department in the initial paragraph, part for whole metonymy links Findlayson  to the bureaucratic structure of the Empire. In building the bridge, Findlayson is  performing his duty as a trusted representative of the Empire, acting on its behalf  and making use of its vast financial and political resources. With respect to Findlay- son’s association with the bridge, the producer for product metonymy and the part  for whole metonymy function in tandem. On seven occasions the narrator refers  to the bridge as “his” (Findlayson’s) bridge and in two more passages Findlayson  himself refers to it as “my” bridge. Furthermore, the “Findlayson Truss” and the  “Findlayson bolted shoe,” two technological innovations that Findlayson himself  has devised, are incorporated into the bridge’s construction. This persistent linking  of Findlayson’s name with the bridge’s design and assertion of his ownership of  it combine to thoroughly integrate the character of the bridge with Findlayson’s  character. Through these metonymies, the reader recognizes Findlayson’s bridge  design as an extension of his own personality: while dependable and technologically  sophisticated, the design nevertheless reflects its designer’s arrogant and uncaring  attitude toward India.  In this way, the story’s metaphorical undercurrent is prefigured by way of  metonymy. The similarity-based metaphorical relationship between bridge-building  and empire-building has been anticipated by two contiguity relationships: a direct  contiguity relationship in which the bridge is seen as an extension of the Empire  and an indirect contiguity relationship in which both the bridge and the Empire find  intersection in the character Findlayson. Through this elaborate system of interlock- ing metonymies, the reader recognizes that the British Empire is underestimating  the depth and sophistication of Indian traditions in the same way that Findlayson is  misjudging the powerful forces of the Ganges, and all this even before the explicit  metaphorical formulation is in place. Upon reflection, we realize that, despite the fact that the story as a whole  represents a critique of imperialism, Kipling’s narrator offers no candid appraisals  of Britain’s imperial project. Were this to happen, Kipling would risk sounding  didactic or moralistic. By allowing the metonymies incorporated into the narrative to  inform his metaphor and make his points for him, he avoids the necessity to critique  </page> <page sequence="13"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 49 imperialism overtly. The nature of his criticism is most transparent during Peroo’s  reflections on ideal bridge design. In contrast to Findlayson, whose “authoritarian”  bridge design relies on restrictive “trusses,” Peroo imagines a more enlightened  bridge that accomplishes the same practical function while leaving the flow of the  mighty river unaffected. Rather than twenty-four bulky stone piers that challenge  the river directly, Peroo envisions a “sus-sus-pen-sheen [bridge] that [flies] from  bank to bank” so that flooding would pose no threat (10). From a practical view- point, his giant, single-arch bridge would probably have been difficult to fund, but  Peroo’s idealistic hopes for a different bridge design represent a counterfactual  cognitive topology to rival the one built up around Findlayson’s bridge. As Kipling  temporarily replaces Findlayson’s design with Peroo’s, the producer for product  metonymy projects Peroo’s own character and attitudes onto his hypothetical  bridge thereby altering the bridge’s relationship to both the British Empire and  Mother Gunga. This counterfactual cognitive topology expresses nothing less than  Kipling’s vision for a less humiliating imperial effort. While Findlayson is intensely  proud of his design because it is able to withstand the turmoil of the Ganges, he  never asks himself whether it might be better not to challenge the river in the first  place. Kipling’s point about imperialism, made clear through Peroo’s philosophy  of bridge-building, is that rather than taking pride in one’s deftness at authoritarian  control, it might be better to create a more humane system and take pride in that. Given the contrast between Peroo’s and Findlayson’s differing cognitive topolo- gies, the fate of the bridge may be seen to represent Kipling’s verdict concerning  the prospects for Findlayson’s version of imperialism. If the bridge were to fall at  the end of the story, the problematization of the existing imperialist model would  be complete. In the final analysis, however, Kipling’s guarded optimism concerning  Britain’s imperial agenda is seen in the fact that the bridge is not washed away by  the flood. He does not intimate that the bridge will never be washed away. Indeed,  Kipling recognizes that eventually the bridge, and by extension the Empire, will  fail. Nonetheless, the fact that Mother Gunga was not able to destroy the bridge  within the story’s timeframe reflects Kipling’s faith not only in technology and the  individuals who implement it but in imperialism itself. 3.3. Rudyard Kipling: The Man Who Would Be “Kim”  Kipling’s depiction of Peroo as an intermediary figure in the story cannot be suf- ficiently stressed. As a Lascar (a native Indian seaman) who has traveled to many  parts of the world, he possesses a background decidedly cosmopolitan. The story’s  circumstances have also cast Peroo as a capable and trustworthy colleague who does  not fail to express his internal conflict concerning the bridge-building effort. As a  foreman, Peroo is positioned between Findlayson and the Indian laborers. In this  way, he understands both the problems Findlayson experiences as an administrator  and also the difficult working conditions of the “untrustworthy” underling laborers.  He represents a relatively neutral viewpoint in yet another important way. Unlike  Findlayson, he respects both technology and local traditions. In the duel between  Findlayson and Mother Gunga, Peroo would ideally allow Findlayson his bridge  </page> <page sequence="14"> 50 Daniel C. Strack while simultaneously allowing Mother Gunga to run her course unrestricted. That  he superstitiously fears the power of Mother Gunga seems humorous at the begin- ning of the story, but by the end, Findlayson is the one who comes off looking  naïve. Peroo’s balancing act between technology and tradition even extends to his  religious observances. While he regularly consults a guru, he has also “prayed to  the low pressure cylinder” aboard a ship. These details are telling in that Kipling’s  literature demands proper acknowledgement of the roles played by both technol- ogy (cf. Kipling’s “McAndrews’ Hymn,” 1890) and traditional religious belief (cf.  Kipling’s “The Mark of the Beast,” 1894). In this way, Peroo’s attitudes reflect  Kipling’s hopes that imperialists will temper their pride in the Empire’s technologi- cal superiority with proper respect for Indian culture and traditions. Just like Peroo, Kipling surely saw himself as straddling two cultures. From  either direction he was viewed as an inhabitant of the other. Although educated in  England and British by nationality, Kipling, who was born in India, did not really  have any choice concerning his associations with India. He was tied to India in ways  that a person like Findlayson never would be. Indians and non-British saw Kipling  as merely another British imperialist, while readers in England read his books with  voracity for what they perceived to be the “authentic” Indian features of his works  (Ozawa 243). When Peroo reveals his personal opinions on bridge-building in the  story, he becomes a mouthpiece for Kipling as he attempts to mediate between the  two groups and so validate his own existence with respect to them. Kipling’s fic- tion is replete with such mediating characters. In “The Man Who Would Be King”  (1888), the narrator who relates the story is a relatively disinterested reporter. In  Kim (1901), the main character is the Irish-born, Indian-bred Kim O’Hara, who  uses his extraordinary talents and dual cultural status to conspire for the Empire’s  geopolitical advantage while simultaneously affirming Indian traditions and spiri- tuality. Kipling undoubtedly valued these characters because they offered at least  the impression of objectivity when seen against the collision of complex value  systems depicted in their respective stories. In contrast, Findlayson, who seems to  be working in India temporarily, does little to understand the finer points of Indian  culture. He simply wants to get the bridge finished and move on. Kipling was not without internal conflict concerning imperialism. In contrast  to the utter confidence of his notorious poem “The White Man’s Burden,” his en- thusiastic support for British imperialism is tempered by concern over imperialist  arrogance in “Recessional.” This poem warns against “frantic boast and foolish  word” that result from being “drunk with sight of power” (259). Kipling, disheartened  by the calculating, unreflective imperialism of the sort exemplified by his fictional  character Findlayson, is not hesitant to offer criticism; the idea of empire-building  was not problematic to Kipling, but the actual British attempt was. In many respects, around the year that Kipling published “The Bridge-Builders,”  the world was nearing a high-water mark for empire generally and for the British  Empire in particular. Looking around the globe, one would have noticed many  apparently vital empires, including Turkey, Tsarist Russia, and Austria-Hungary.  </page> <page sequence="15"> Metaphor, Metonymy, and the Architecture of Empire 51 Britain’s system of organization and control, in contrast to the others, may have  appeared thoughtful and humane by standards of the day. This sort of generous  appraisal is possible, however, only if one is willing to compare different types  of imperialism and say that, all things considered, the colonial subjects of Britain  were lucky compared with those under the yoke of Tsarist Russia. The violence  at Amritsar in 1919, however, more than perhaps any other event, exposed British  imperial policy to public scrutiny and created an image of imperialism in stark  contrast to the positive metaphors of Kipling: control exerted by the few over the  many through the swift and unflinching application of deadly force. Lacking the  extensive presence necessary to rule judiciously, an undersized occupation force  ruled capriciously. This calculating attitude towards the well-being of individual  Indians served to turn the tide of public opinion, a turn that eventually led to India’s  independence.  Ideologically, there are two ways that Kipling can be understood: as an impe- rial propagandist or as an imperial reformer. Undoubtedly, he was both. Although  Peroo is often portrayed humorously in “The Bridge-Builders,” his sober regard for  both traditional India and the Empire make his reflections much more compelling  than those of Findlayson, the consummate imperial insider. To identify Kipling  only with Findlayson is to sell him short. He was exceedingly idealistic; it was just  that his idealism was walled in by the narrow worldview he shared with many of  his generation. Edward Said remarked that Kipling “could not imagine an India in  historical flux out of British control” (340). This is somewhat true, but the flood- ing of Mother Gunga in “The Bridge-Builders” represents nothing if not Kipling’s  “imagining” of India struggling to be “out of British control.” More accurately,  what Kipling could not imagine was a world without empires. Kipling’s idealistic response to the moral dilemmas faced by the imperial- ists did not require ending the system, merely reforming it from within. In “The  Bridge-Builders” in particular, the author suggests the necessity to make imperialism  more humane and also more respectful of local traditions and beliefs. Through this  work and others, he enthusiastically brought the problems associated with empire- building into the public consciousness for the purpose of imperialist reform, but  in so doing he may have helped speed the general recognition that imperialism  was fundamentally flawed and so hastened its demise. In a sense, Kipling was the  Gorbachev of British imperialism. As imperialism requires a certain lack of ideal- ism to be sustainable, in applying high ethical standards to it in a public manner,  Kipling positioned it to fail. 4. Conclusion Wayne Booth offers the following assertion on receptivity to metaphor: “To un- derstand a metaphor is by its very nature to decide whether to join the metaphorist  or reject [him or her], and that is simultaneously to decide either to be shaped  in the shape [his or her] metaphor requires or to resist” (65). Because Kipling’s  metaphorical strategy attempts to force the reader to interpret imperialism by  way of an ideologically freighted frame of reference, “The Bridge-Builders” is  </page> <page sequence="16"> 52 Daniel C. Strack bound to provoke fierce ideological resistance. Analysis of metaphor in the story  exposes Kipling’s surreptitious literary strategy, namely to incorporate a positive  metaphor for imperialism that is difficult to identify as euphemism. Nevertheless,  close examination of metonymy lends credence to the viewpoint that Kipling was  not simply an imperial propagandist but also an imperial reformer. Lacking the  ability to picture a self-governing India in an age when empires were the rule,  Kipling expressed hope for a more humane form of imperialism. That such ideals  were never realized is a point beyond dispute. Nevertheless, the fact that Kipling  became a spokesperson for his era is no doubt due as much to his reflective stance  within imperialism as to his advocacy of it.
