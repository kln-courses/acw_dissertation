Banerjee A tryst with witchcraft Ipsita Roy Chakraverti, Beloved Witch, Harper Collins Publishers India, New Delhi, 2000, pp 283, Rs.295/ Here is a story of how 'even Homer nods'. Mahatma Gandhi's call for Satyagraha was once flouted by an excited crowd who had burnt the Chouri-Chera police-station and indulged in sundry violence — irked by the excesses of the Raj. Then came the devastating earthquake of 1934 that destroyed Monghyr district and the surroundings. Gandhiji immediately announced that it was divine retribution against the erring people of Bihar: to punish them for their misdeed. Rabindranath Tagore took up the cudgels and roundly condemned any idea of linking natural phenomena, which have their own laws to follow, with human doings. Obviously, Gandhiji had tripped. In the book under review, the author Ipsita Roy Chakraverti similarly recounts what she calls 'Sweet Revenge'. She was contesting an election from Hooghly on a Congress ticket and Sonia Gandhi had agreed to come to West Bengal which would involve Hooghly. But some rivals arranged her trip to the nearby Serampore and she was to make a touch-down in her helicopter there to attend a grand rally, thereby excluding Hooghly. I kneiv that Wiccan revenge was at hand, recalls Ipsita, and later, I know that thepozvers were afoot. And they were about to shozv certain politicians that they ivere displeased - Serampore lay shrouded in its white and grey folds. My part of Hooghly was sunny and bright. Since the helicopter went back without landing, it was Ipsita's sweet revenge with mother nature taking her side! We need another Tagore to tell Ipsita that, like the Mahatma, she too had tripped. The book, on the contrary, has earlier recorded how much dedication Ipsita had when, just past her teens, she had joined the Society for the Study of Ancient Cultures and Civilisations in Montreal, Canada. There, in a chalet in the Laurentian moun ains, she, along with a group of erudite women, pored over old texts and crumbling manuscripts to seek knowledge in many</page><page sequence="2">150 / India International Centre Quarterly forgotten and even forbidden ar eas. The medieval art and science of witchcraft possibly covered a hazy past when Wicca was consid ered a valuable branch of learning. Along with Isis in Egypt, she re fers to other patrons of Wicca in Sumeria and Greece, but she again trips by including Kali in the Indian sub-continent. Among the manifestations of the Mother Goddess — dating back to the pre Vedic times — Kali is credited with the mythological feat of destroy ing a particularly fierce demon, but witchcraft is not her forte. Perhaps Ipsita wishes to allude to the Tantric cult of the late first millennium, with its awakening of the feminine energy as Kula Kundalini, but this finds no men tion here. The autobiographical text is at its best when Ipsita chooses to fight the cause of women pursued relentlessly by avaricious men. Although the blurb talks about the dedication of her life to removing the stigma attached to xvitches, what she has valiantly done is to defend women mistakenly labelled witches — but who are no witches at all, just a hapless part of femi ninity preyed on by the male vul tures of the patriarchal society, out to grab money, property, jewellery and anything valuable by ruth lessly removing those women. The reader wishes for more such exposure to Ipsita's commend able work and is at a loss when she, in the middle of her narra tive, proclaims that she would go for other callings. This one voca tion of hers —which only she could so competently do —was worth all the callings on earth. Ipsita has, no doubt, an absorbing yarn to spin and she has done it rather well, with superb crafting and flawless turns of phrase. Her proclaimed love for English (in story-telling) and algebra (in its structuring) both come through radiantly, but where she trips yet once again is in her penchant for 'purple prose' in self-indulgence. The instances are many —like her holding age still against the passage of time, her physical beauty having smitten one and all, her prowess of understanding and expression surpassing others, and her capabilities to be ranked indubitably high. These are narcissistic passages and hardly behove Ipsita's otherwise rare craftsmanship. Some humility would have suited her — reminding one uncharitably of Tagore's immortal couplet: The false diamond intones its own high worth, and hence predictably I suspect that it is a fake. In the entire narrative, Ipsita crosses many lanes and by-lanes of mystery, and evokes the aura of things little understood and less cared for. Again and again,</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews /151 she falls back on nature and the phenomena of fog and mist, ob jects of trees and stones, and events that only she could com prehend and even control. These are uncharted areas where angels would fear to tread, and Ipsita's rushing into them could only make us wish her well —by giving her the benefit of the doubt. Her relationships with her confreres in the Montreal society are touchingly described, some followed through to their logical conclusions. But her association with Elvis Presley — bordering on an entanglement on Elvis's part— could leave one in some doubt, as would her relationship with Sonia Gandhi. This is particularly be cause the other side of the story is not easily available, but again she is entitled to her piece of cake. What is not so acceptable is again her preponderant tendency to suggest that she is a great judge of personalities, going to the ab surd length of saying that those who fell out with her have suf fered one and all, and those who abided by her advice have done uniformly well in latter life. This is quite ridiculous as she cites ref erence to their life's events in lat ter days when she could have no say, let alone have control, on their destiny. This goes back to the Bihar-earthquake-being-God's revenge-on-people-deserting Sah/agraJta syndrome. It just does not happen and could be called sheer vanity. Such bravado does not suit one of Ipsita's given com petence, skill, knowledge and achievement, and should have been skipped. One last word. The Vedas sing paeans of praise for the elemental and natural forces, but not for anthropomorphic gods, nor do they visualise temples of worship. The anthropomorphic images came later. Perhaps, just perhaps, an acquaintance with the Indian scriptures and divinity —for one who has specialised in ancient cultures and civilisations—would help her save some more trippings.</page></plain_text>
