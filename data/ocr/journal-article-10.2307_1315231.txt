<plain_text><page sequence="1">The World's Disorder and the Word's Design in Two Poems by Frost Paul A. Orlov Both literary tradition and the etymological origins of the word "poetry" sup- port the idea of the poet as a "maker."' Indeed, in an important passage in his De- fence ofPoetry, Shelley quotes Tasso to the effect that, "None deserves the name of creator except God and the poet."2 In the same passage, Shelley explains the par- ticular value of the poet's creative force for the human enterprise as a whole: All things exist as they are perceived; at least in relation to the percipient .... But poetry defeats the curse which binds us to be subjected to the accident of surround- ing impressions. And whether it spreads its own figured curtain, or withdraws life's dark veil from before the scene of things, it equally creates for us a being within our being. It makes us the inhabitants of a world to which the familiar world is a chaos. .... It compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to imagine that which we know. It creates anew the universe. . . 3 However necessary the power of poetry to create an inner realm of being "to which the familiar world is a chaos" may have been to the Romantic poet's time, it must be far more so to a modern era of unprecedented uncertainties in increas- ingly chaotic experience. In Poets of Reality (1965), J. Hillis Miller (in pre-deconstructionist days) iden- tifies "a central tradition of modern literature" that acts as "a countercurrent moving against the direction of history. In this literature, if not in our culture as a whole, nihilism has gradually been exposed, experienced in its implications, and, in some cases, transcended."4 Those writers whom Miller discusses, faced with a world fragmented and nihilistic (due to the dominant forces of late nine- teenth- and early twentieth-century experience - loss of religious faith in the rise of post-Darwinian science, urbanization, mechanization, militarism), all boldly created works of affirmation rather than despair: "In their work reality comes to be present to the senses, present to the mind which possesses it through the senses, and present in the words of the poems which ratify this possession."5 Miller observes that from this possession of reality in words comes a "new poetry" in whose space "the world is contracted to a point"; in this new art, he notes, partly echoing Wallace Stevens's famous phrase, the "poem is 'not ideas about the thing but the thing itself,' part of the world and not [merely] about it."6 Although he is not one of the "poets of reality" cited by Miller, Robert Frost shares with them the making (for all their dissimiliarities as artists) of a poetic tradition - a tradition in which language embodies the "possession" of real- ity-peculiar to the twentieth century. My purpose here is to show how Frost poetically transcends nihilism in two of his most vital works. 30 Frost</page><page sequence="2">Of course, the question of Frost's artistic modernity (of his responsiveness through technique and/or theme to the burden of "modern" experience) occa- sioned much debate for a remarkably long time. But a quarter century has now passed since that famous night in March, 1959 (at the testimonial dinner honor- ing the poet's eighty-fifth birthday) when Lionel Trilling affronted all views of the beloved Bard of New England as a quaintly simple "nature poet," calling Frost "terrifying" in his poetic treatment of man's place in the modern uni- verse7-and since, in the aftermath of the resultant uproar, key critical studies such as those by John Lynen and Reuben Brower began illuminating Frost's achievement as a complex, modern artist.8 Diverse as interpretations of the poet have remained since that turning-point in Frost criticism - perhaps because of the complexities of the man recently revealed in the authorized biography by Thompson9- they have essentially agreed in recognizing Frost's poetic sophisti- cation. Critical recognition of thematic emphases in Frost's poetry - the relation- ship between the individual and nature, the isolation indwelling in the human condition, our troubled search for a sense of connection with the spaces we in- habit-has helped confirm that the author's world-view, and not merely an acci- dent of personal chronology, makes him a twentieth-century writer. A focus on his use of language in the two poems I will here discuss, "Design" and "Desert Places," suggests that Frost is sometimes a modern poet in manner as well as in matter. Wallace Stevens-who for Hillis Miller and others is the quin- tessentially modern poet in maintaining that poetry is a vital part of the world, and not only about the world-writes of the "Blessed rage for order . . . The Maker's rage to order words of the sea."10 Stevens's sense of poetry's purpose finds confirmation in these works by Frost, which manifest a "rage to order" ex- perience through the words that both create and convey it. Frost once defined literature as "words that have become deeds"" and a writer's style as "the way he carries himself toward his ideas and deeds."12 But de- spite the references to "deeds," his work is neither didactic nor doctrinaire; and the ideas discoverable within his poems offer no consistent "philosophy." For as Lawrance Thompson says, "Frost is too cussedly nonconformist to trust even his own words as texts five minutes after he has uttered them. His mind is too sea- soned, too humorous, to relish the owlish solemnity of dicta and dictations. He trusts [only] his poems as poems, as metaphors spread to catch meaning. ... ."13 A skeptic in an age of skepticism, Frost rejected all restrictive theories, literary as well as political, affirming that "poems are all that matter."14 While "truth" always seemed uncertain or changing to this stubbornly individualistic thinker, he unalterably believed, like Stevens, in the power of imagination - given verbal substance-to give shape to the experiential world. Poems are "all that matter" for Frost, yet we know from an oft-cited passage in his prefatory essay "The Figure a Poem Makes"15is that poetry effects limited, though essential, realizations of meaning amidst uncertainty: having explained Paul A. Orlov 31</page><page sequence="3">that a poem "begins in delight and ends in wisdom," the poet defines that wisdom as "a clarification of life-not necessarily a great clarification, such as sects and cults are founded on, but . . . a momentary stay against confusion."'16 In "Neither Out Far Nor in Deep," Frost uses a view of people gazing out to sea to express symbolically mankind's undying-if largely unattainable-quest for un- derstanding of life: "They cannot look out far / They cannot look in deep / But when was that ever a bar / To any watch they keep?"17 And in "For Once, Then, Something," a poem both humorous and poignant in its combined criti- cism of dogmatists and self-deprecation, Frost depicts himself as a kneeler at "well-curbs" who never quite sees deep enough into "the well" of things to be certain of Truth.18 Because the "stay against confusion" can only be "momen- tary," and because the poetic pursuit of meaning is for him as irresistible as it is imperfect, the poet - like the "oven bird" he describes in another poem - uses his song to "frame" the "question . . . what to make of a diminished thing."19 It is quite apt that in the "philosophical" poemsjust referred to, Frost employs the metaphor of man gazing at or into water to describe our endless quest for necessarily ambiguous Truth, since such an idea is markedly Melvillean. And Frost's poetry, like Moby-Dick (in Chapter 99, "The Doubloon" and the whole "whiteness of the whale" motif, in particular), is partly about ways of seeing and interpreting Reality. As Frank Lentricchia shows in an important essay on the literary theory underlying the poet's work, Frost holds that our mental acts "constitute the world of our experience" - not by creating objective realities, but by informing their chaos, through perception, with "structure and meaning."20 In the interplay of "subjectivity with its environment,"21 of the self and all it per- ceives, Frost finds that it is "we who reveal the world . . and by so doing we re- veal the revealing self."22 When Frost gives us his poetic perception of that "dim- inished thing" which is the world of modern man, he simultaneously reveals himself as a source of ordering consciousness and recovers for us, if but momen- tarily, a sense of controlled relation to our natural and metaphysical environment. He does so, as we can see in "Design" and "Desert Places," by creating a tension between poetic subject and poetic substance-a tension between the disorder of the world and the design of the words with which it is interpreted. On a basic thematic level, "Design" (first published in 1922) is a twentieth- century retort to the "argument from design" of Christian belief. Having ob- served an instance of nature's cruelty, the poet ponders the darker implications of the scene: the death of the moth, killed on the flower by the spider, resulted from the conjunction of the three at one point in time and space, and from their corres- pondence of color; this recognition raises troubling questions about the causes of things, since the conjunction might well have been harmless without the corres- pondence, and that congruity of color "ought" not to have existed; so, in turn, the mysteriousness of the plan that seems manifested in this "natural" event makes one wonder what forces underlie the unfolding dramas of human circum- 32 Frost</page><page sequence="4">stance. Writing in an age whose religious faith had been shaken by post-Darwin- ian science and the disillusioning terrors of industrialism and global conflict, the poet moves from his observation and consequent questions to two equally dis- turbing implications: either we inhabit an often amoral world without actual de- sign, or a design that is evil (rather than beneficent) can inscrutably shape our lives. A poem, of course, can never rightly be reduced to such a basic paraphrase of "meaning" as this; "Design" is "about" Frost's way of seeing and saying his sub- ject quite as much as it is about that subject itself, since the latter is in fact in- separable from the former. Only in its perception and expression by a shaping self (especially a poetic seer/sayer) does the world-external reality-have actual shape and meaningful substance. This fact at once illuminates the perfectly paradoxical nature of the tension between world and words inherent in the poem's very essence: in order for the disturbing disorder of "things" implicit in the natural scene described even to confront us, it must be bodied forth and given significance in Frost's carefully designed creation. Thus in aesthetic terms, the poem implicitly contradicts the central idea it ex- plicitly communicates. In the opening words of the work, "I found a dimpled spider,"23 there is an instant-if indirect-reminder of the poet's crucially creative presence. For although Frost may indeed have observed a spider (whose existence did not literally depend on him) before writing, his poetic perception alone allows us to find, with him, a "dimpled" spider. This surprising descriptive label, along with the subsequent adjectives "fat" and "white," makes the creature in question seem infant-like or even cherubic. And these touches are just the first of a series of word-plays infusing the account of an arachnid, an insect, and a flower with anthropomorphic attributes: the moth held up by the spider looks "like a white piece of rigid satin cloth," perhaps suggestive of bridal gowns, and even more, of shrouds or casket linings; all three natural elements in the scene seem "Assorted characters of death and blight" in a miniature drama; in their blending into an event of seemingly evil intent, these characters are "Like the in- gredients of a witches' broth," an image of a magic whose blackness is both be- lied and accentuated by its aura of whiteness; and the "witches' broth" suggests (more than an allusion to Macbeth) a grotesquely tragicomic breakfast ceremony, since its "ingredients" of "death and blight" appear -in a line that oddly echoes a cereal jingle-"Mixed ready to begin the morning right" (and, by innuendo, mourning rite). This pun-capped line overtly expresses the poet's ironic playfulness covertly conveyed by his manipulation of metaphorical language throughout the first eight lines. Indeed, the insistence upon poetic play with reality underscored by all the similes and metaphors of the opening section, makes it very apt that the final figure likens the focal part of the grim scene, the moth, to an emblem of man's many games-"dead wings carried like a paper kite." And as Frost keeps his own "kite"-the imaginative construct of the Paul A. Orlov 33</page><page sequence="5">poem -in flight before us, we are reminded that the "characters of death" in the observed natural scene have paradoxically gained life by being significant to ("mixed ready" for) the observer's poetic perceptiveness. Moreover, the particular setting and circumstantial context of the poem's scene emphasize how our way of seeing colors-and thus in one sense, deter- mines-all meaning in the nature of things. When the poet makes his morning discovery that a spider has trapped and killed a moth during the night, the spe- cific setting of the drama seems to accentuate ironically its sinister suggestiveness: the death-darkened event has occurred not just on a flower, intrinsically an image of gentle beauty, but on a heal-all, of all things-and a white one at that! That nature's cruelty should become manifest in a place presumably symbolizing her munificence-a plant reputed to have healing powers for our flesh as well as soothing effects for our spirits - is disconcerting enough; that the "heal-all" plays this seemingly unnatural part by being, unnaturally, white (rather than its usual blue), is still more disturbing to our sense of the universe. For these facts, repre- sentative in their implications, unmistakably upset all assuring assumptions about the natural and symbolic order of things. It isjust the point, of course, that humanity has traditionally ascribed therapeutic powers to a plant or moral mean- ing to a color, in its insistent urge to appropriate natural phenomena as compre- hensible aspects of a divinely designed creation. And Frost, paradoxically, uses these carefully controlled elements in his poem to express the elemental uncer- tainties of Nature and Creative Origins in a world without familiar faiths. As various critics have noted,24 "Design" dramatizes the ambiguities of our condi- tion by using whiteness, in a Melvillean manner, to emblemize the inscrutability (at best) or immorality (at worst) of Nature. But while subverting the supposed symbol of goodness in benignant Creation, Frost more essentially makes the flower's whiteness epitomize the ultimate indifference of Nature to man's means of seeing It. Thus Frost's work is the epistemological equivalent of the poem by Stephen Crane in which the Universe, having heard a man's statement that he ex- ists, replies, "The fact has not created in me / A sense of obligation."25 Except, of course, that in the special way of knowing the world which is his poem, Frost himself uses the color symbolism to give shape to reality! Most fundamentally, the ironic interplay between matter and manner in "De- sign" is revealed by the very form of the poem: Frost employs the highly ordered structure of the sonnet to give artistic substance to dread disorder. Literally, the bipartite division of this Petrarchan sonnet complements the poem's purpose of applying the specific scene observed to a generalized metaphysical meaning. The universally human associations developed through the figurative language of the octave prepare (by common sonnet convention) for the thematic thrust of the sestet - the idea that in the ultimate view, the individual observer himself/herself is a "thing so small" in Nature. Simultaneously, however, both the question- and-answer form of the last six lines and the typical sonnet movement toward a 34 Frost</page><page sequence="6">resolved problem or solaced yearning26 enhance the effect of the octave's meta- phorical manifestation of imaginative "control" over experience. At bottom, Frost's own closely designed poem opposes the very doubts about order it de- scribes, in the process affirming the poetic designer's power, at least momentarily, to "govern" things. Like "Design," "Desert Places" (1934) shows how Frost achieves a "momen- tary stay against confusion" by poetically subverting the grim modern subject his own poem is "about." But this poem is still more bleak, for it lacks the earlier work's playfulness and concerns the very void that looms beyond disorder. Frost, notes his longtime friend Louis Untermeyer, is characteristically "disillusioned about progress" and "distrustful of science, which has taken man deeper and deeper into matter, further into space, and further away from the spirit."27 And just such distrustfulness underlies "Desert Places," where the "I" finds in the heavens above only what those other modern men in Crane's "The Open Boat" find - a high cold star on a winter's night."28 For the implicit intellectual context of the poem is the poet's ironic perception that modern scientific "progress" has left us spiritually impoverished: the more men have exercised their will to power over Nature, seeking to attain empirical and material mastery of things, the less they have retained a sense of meaningful relation to their realm, fulfilling their need to belong to the spaces they inhabit. As outward acquisitiveness has thus been purchased at the price of inner emptiness- through alienation from human Others, the natural world, and spiritual values, in a mechanized mass society with materialistic gods-all "places" have become "desert" to sensitive eyes/I's. So for Frost, the wintry landscape of the snow-shrouded field symbolizes the coldly indifferent universe in which one stands essentially alone-a universe given us by the scientists who are (in line 13) the "They" exploring, ironically, the "empty spaces" of other, distant stars. The pervasive whiteness of the snow has (says line 12) "no expression, nothing to express" for the representative man in a field by the woods. But the existence of the poem creatively contradicts this idea, manifesting what results because the man is also a poet. With Frost seeing the scene, "nothing," the chilling void, in- deed becomes something "to express"; and that expression is remarkable, as Trill- ing said of all the poet's "terrifying" works, because of "the energy with which emptiness is perceived."29 That the "I" looking into the field (in line 2) is as much a force as the emptiness itself, is immediately indicated by the intricate effects of his words in four quatrains, each of which has an exact rhyme accenting the first, second, and fourth lines. Verbal repetition and insistent alliteration make the opening stanza an onomatopoetic mirror of the moment described, especially in line 1: "Snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast": word and sound repetitions here help suggest the fact of falling and the sounds of snow as it hissingly hits the ground. In the second stanza, the essential idea of nature's impersonality toward the "absent-spirited" observer is designedly dramatized by the triple invocation Paul A. Orlov 35</page><page sequence="7">(in line 5) of the impersonal pronoun "it" -which itself reminds us that the ob- server is in the process of making apparently absent spirit poetically present. The tension between overt theme and actual effect is intensified with most art by the manipulations of language in the third stanza. Ostensibly, the confrontation with nothingness - the "desert places" without and within-comes to its climax here: in lines 9 and 10, the alliteration of "1" sounds and verbal repetition underscore the idea expressed (the loneliness / Will be more lonely ere it will be less-"); and while describing how the "blanker whiteness" blankets all in nullity, lines 11 and 12 themselves verbally mimic their message, as "no expression" and "nothing" are piled upon the "blank"-ness, em- phasizing the way negation-the "no"-sits, phonetically as well as themati- cally, amidst the "snow." Nonetheless, Frost obliquely opposes all nay-saying in accumulating accents of affirmation: aptly, the rhetorical antithesis in line 10 ("Will be more lonely ere it will be less-") is undercut by the antithetical thrust of the repeated verb "be." Because the poem as a whole illuminates experience, slyly subverting the poet's punning portrayal of himself as "benighted" in the snow, this word's negativeness is also offset by the point of its prefix. And the best evidence that Frost stresses the verb "to be" to help suggest his art's indirect affirmation of meaning in life-while that art addresses the theme of nothing- ness-appears in line 14. For each line of the carefully constructed poem except this one contains ten syllables; and the extra significant syllable, calling attention to itself and ending the line with emphasis, is "is"! In his essay "The Figure a Poem Makes," Robert Frost states that, "The artist must value himself as he snatches a thing from some previous order in time and space into a new order" to gain art's original kind of knowledge.30 Ultimately, the poet (almost phoenix-like) "snatches" the new order of poetry from the ear- lier world's decay: as John Lynen put it in his early recognition of Frost's mod- ernity, poetry is for Frost a way of "preserving within the disorganized world . . . the sense of order and unity a meaningful life requires" and a means of reas- serting "the value of individual perception against the fragmenting of experi- ence. . .31 Thus the lines "I have it in me so much nearer home / To scare my- self with my own desert places" literally assert the possession of a world that art achieves; implicit in each act by which the poet faces the force of "no" is the counterforce of his creative quest to "know." In two of the most famous lines in all of modern literature, W. B. Yeats (whom Frost greatly admired) conveys the quintessential experience of twentieth-century man: "Things fall apart; the cen- tre cannot hold; / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. ... ."32 Responding to this experience in his own poetry, Frost, as "Design" and "Desert Places" im- pressively illustrate, creates a constant tension between the world's disorder and his words' design, in the process dramatizing, as well as describing, the struggle for meaningful order.
