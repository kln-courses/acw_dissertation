<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kant and the Closure of the Epoch of the Metaphysics of Presence DAVID B. CORNAY Louisiana State University In taking up the question of Kant and the metaphysics of presence, I am, of course, situating Kant in a topology first uncovered, opened out, and made accessible to questioning by Heidegger, Gadamer, and Der- rida. Metaphysics, in this extraordinary sense, has the unity and con- tinuity of a tradition, of what is passed down and passed on as always already decided before any decision which we might make, because, living always out of it, it is the horizon from which every decision re- ceives its orientation. It is not itself a standpoint or a stance or a theory which one freely decides whether or not to adopt (the alternative to it is lacking), for it is the fundamental orientation toward and under- standing of what-is which first opens me to myself and to other beings and so makes available to me the alternatives of free choice and of decision. The metaphysical tradition, in this sense, has the horizonal character of language as a structure or a virtual system, a character ex- hibited and in a degree scientifically falsified in structural linguistics.1 And the metaphysics of presence, the constant horizon of all subsequent thought, indeed has its "origin" in the critique which is accomplished in and against the Greek language in Parmendes' thought. I In pre-Parmenidean Greek the primary verb "to be" is einai , deriving from the IE r *es-, and preserving from it a systematic plurivocity, such that it means at once to be temporally-duratively present, to be loca- tively present or situated (a sense with a close affinity to the IE roots reflected in "sit, stand, state, status, stay" ) in a place, to be present in lightedness or unconcealment or nonlatency ( aletheia ), and to be vitally present among the living (i.e., not to have gone down into the darkness and concealment of death- a sense reflected in the Sanskrit derivatives as , dsu , cisura, life, the living, that which moves and rests in itself, the self-standing) .2 39</page><page sequence="2">Einai also follows *es~ in being a "defective" verb, having only a single present durative stem on which all tenses are formed, in lacking an aorist and a perfect stem, such that "to be" is aspectually restricted to "be present/be there/endure" and is contrasted with "come to be/ arise/take place." Like other IE languages Greek supplemented the aspectually defective system of derivatives of *es - with derivatives of *b/iu- and *gen-, physis (nominal form) and gignesthai , "to arise, be powerful, emerge, come forth, grow, come to be," in order to provide thereby a borrowed aorist for "to be." But, unlike other IE languages, Greek did not absorb these borrowed derivatives into the forms of the system *es - (see, for English, the O.E.D. article "Be"), for, in spite of their proximity to the vital sense of "to be," they were always held in a relationship of opposition and tension to that system, were always an excluded supplement.3 That tension is founded both in the aspectual opposition and in a difference inherent in einai and its derivative forms themselves. For these forms- including the participles eon , on, ousia , which were classed and named participles by the first grammarians, in the Platonic Academy, who consciously appropriated to them Plato's term for the metaphysical relation of participation of a being to its being- express a belonging together in difference (Heidegger's onto- logical difference) of being in its nominal sense, what is present, what Heidegger calls the ontic, and in its verbal sense, as the presencing of what is present, what Heidegger calls the ontological or, in the earlier works, the transcendental ( for presencing is not itself a present being but transcends everything that in any sense is as its condition of possi- bility) . It is to the verbal sense of the presencing of what is present that gignesthai/ physis belong as excluded supplement, for they address presencing as an emerging into the lightedness and nonlatency ( aletheia ) of standing-abiding presence. As such an emerging, they are not themselves present but are absent and conceal themselves in all coming to presence. Heraclitus says it in Fr. 123: physis kryptesthai philei , in emerging into the lightedness of standing presence, physis loves to absent, withdraw, conceal itself. To thus think the verbal presencing of what is present from the non- surpassable latency of self-absenting physis is to think presence as limited and measured (Anaximander's "ordinance of time" or Hera- clitus's Fr. 52, " aion [life, lifetime, time] is a child playing . . .: a child holds the sceptre") by the double absence of not yet and of no longer, such that physis as emerging power is an in itself unlimited striving to preserve itself in presencing a while4 and thereby gathers or collects itself (the ontological force of legein /logos , cognate to Latin colliegere , from which the sense of "understanding," Latin intellegere , or of "speech, 40</page><page sequence="3">language, assertion" is derivative: only in being gathered or collected into the whole do I see and understand the collectedness of the whole and thereby declare of it how it is ) or brings itself to a stand or to a position through op-position to what stands over against it in presencing a while in the thereby common lightedness of a kosmos .5 And, in the measure that a thing brings itself to a stand (i.e., is) and has its own integrity and self-identity only through the op-positional character of physis (the hidden jointure, harmony, attunement- Heraclitus, Frs. 54, 8- of each self-absenting physis emerging, gathering, or collecting itself into self-repose- Fr. 84a- through its op-posite, so that the logos is common ) , for man to strive for the full presence or absolute nonlatency of an aletheia which did not preserve the mystery of latency and absence in itself (i.e., to strive to grasp or com-prehend presencing as itself fully present) would be a hybristic act of violence (see Heraclitus Fr. 112) against the self-repose and inner integrity of what-is. The Parmenidean argument which founds the metaphysics of pres- ence is such an act of violence, founded in the implicit anthropocen- trism of Parmenides' understanding of mind as an erotic striving or quest for the real, intentionally committed to the real but distant from it,6 where Parmenides offers a transcendental argument (usually mis- read as a logical argument- which is not to suggest that the argument is "illogical" but only that it first opens out and discloses the possibility of the ideality of the logical) for the conditions and criteria of possible satisfaction of that desire. Man's eros for the real can attain satisfaction (go "as far as desire might reach," Fr. 1. 1-2), fully traversing the path or route7 which leads to the consummation of its quest for the real, only if it can, in advance, define, delimit, discriminate, decide, separate off, be certain of the telos of its hodos or path or route, the point in which the route comes round (the etymon of telos meant "to turn"- see Fr. 5) to its goal and circles back into itself. Such a critical ( krinai logo , Fr. 7. 5)8 discrimination (for logos as an ingathering or an assembling, perhaps of legumes, also selects out: see the Latin cognates seligere , eligere9 deligere, neglegere) in advance of the telos of its hodos looks beyond, meta , that hodos in order thereby to see the end or goal or "object" which defines and delimits the path to it. Such a critical dis- crimination in advance is a meta hodos , methodos , method, and it for the first time polarizes the open cosmic free space of aletheia into the relation of "subject" to "object," departing from the striving of a "subject" who quests for the absolute self-responsibility and self- certainty of being under way toward an "object" which is itself translu- cently accessible to mind, is itself fully decided and certain. And for the "object" to have the certainty which would make it fully available to 41</page><page sequence="4">mind as the final satisfaction of minƒès erotic quest for the real, it must be absolutely present in a now which has no past and no future (Fr. 8. 5 : "Nor was it ever, nor will it be, since it is now, all of it together" ) , excludes all absence (and, thus, all emerging into presence) ; and it must through itself alone preserve its own atomic identity and integrity, standing fast, abiding in its proper place.9 Remaining thus "the same in the same" (Fr. 8. 29), it is "like a well-rounded sphere, nicely circular from every side" (Fr. 8. 43), perspectively neutral, showing itself as ever the same no matter from which direction mind might approach it, admitting only differences of proximity and of distance. And mind, in- sofar as it consummates its quest and comes round into the telos of its hodoSy is about the real, perfectly proximate to it in an absolute pres- ence, absolved of all absence, perceives it in the fundamental sense of capere , "to take in one's hands, to contain" (although it would seem doubtful that in such a final consummation sufficient distance, space, free play would remain for mind to hold the real in view ) . Language, logos , is itself decisively transformed through this decision or crisis which founds metaphysics and the ideality of the (merely) logical. In the methodic movement of the "subject" toward final com- prehension of the real as intentional "object," speech is itself, finally, about the real and is, in its movement toward that final consummation, a pro-positional (for the real is what holds fast to its station or position) holding fast of what-is in order to say something about it, in order to assert of it what it is- for Parmenides himself, to say of it that it "is." Logos is here no longer the self-gathering into presencing a while of a self-absenting physis, or the hidden harmony (Heraclitus Frs. 54, 8) in which each physis op-posing (Frs. 53, 62, 76, 80, 126) itself to the other, all are gathered or collected into presencing together in the open light- edness of the kosmos , where all things steer themselves or are steered10 through all. For the Parmenidean crisis- "is or is not"- reduces logos to logic, and pro-positional assertion becomes the primary locus of truth or falsity, in the measure that assertion does or does not correspond to the real which statically awaits it as its goal. It is only within this meta- physical decision which reduces speech to a means or a tool or an activity mediating between the "subject" and an atomic "object" pro- positionally held fast over against it, where the propositional intention seeks its own final silent dissolution in perfect perceptual presence to the real, that the metaphysical quest for a decision between a proper- literal and an improper-metaphoric meaning of terms deploys itself, displacing the free play of living logos. Thus, extraordinarily, the Parmenidean argument, which unfolds in and is everywhere sustained by the richest and most "metaphoric" language, turns against its own 42</page><page sequence="5">source and origin, opposing to it the original definition of the logical, the distinction of the ideality (pure repeatability, hence, like the real, independence from the parts of time) of logical-conceptual form and of cognitive matter, and the metaphor of the literal or the proper. And because this movement against the origin, a movement which founds and deploys the metaphysics of presence, is itself a decision concerning language which is also an event within the Greek language, it is a covering over of the ontological difference preserved in the Greek einai (for the final telos of mind's intentional commitment to and erotic striving for the real would admit of no difference between presencing and what is present, in a highest being, absolutely present, absolved of all absence) and a radical exclusion of physis (such that Parmenides consigns the term, always with its original sense of dynamis , to "Doxa," but in its absence it everywhere shows itself in "Aletheia" as the ex- cluded alternate route, the inchoate, vague, unsettled, unconsum- matable Heraclitean "route" of physis as opposite) as its borrowed supplement. The Parmenidean crisis is thus a methodic movement beyond physis9 a meta physis , a metaphysics. Metaphysics, as such, has its roots in the essential nonnaturalness of man as essentially belonging to the open place of and freedom for the differentiating of ontological difference,11 such that man, gathered into the open lightedness of presencing (the open of the kosmos- see Heraclitus, Fr. 16- into which physis every self- gatheringly rises and back from which it sets itself, as the self-concen- trating inner integrity of the thing, its reposing in changing, Heraclitus, Fr. 84a), is uniquely free for (and also from) the pressure of what is present, for (and from) nature. Metaphysics, as the oblivion of onto- logical difference, endeavors to appropriate and comprehend and fix that effaced nonnaturalness as something positive (an ethical or moral value) which is proper to man as a being among other beings, as a human nature. II The fundamental question of Kan≈•s Critique of Pure Reason is itself, for Kant, a metaphysical question,12 directed toward discriminating the ground plan of metaphysics as a science, that is, as a complete and systematic body of clear and certain synthetic a prion knowledge or- dered through a fundamental idea or principle.13 It is my interpretative intention to locate Kan≈•s critical project of a scientific system of meta- physics in a topology of the metaphysics of presence in order to decon- structively make visible what belongs to Kan≈•s metaphysics as unsaid 43</page><page sequence="6">and unthought, precisely in that it self-absentingly sustains, guides, and measures Kant's thinking and saying. In departing thus from Heideg- ger's notion of a nonsurpassable latency, self-concealment, absence, or leihe which belongs essentially to the lightedness, nonlatency, or un- concealment of aletheia as such, I hope that the notion of the "unsaid and unthought" will not be too precipitously taken as something other than, outside of, external to or surreptitiously imported into what Kant did say. The horizon and measure for such a deconstructive hermeneu- tics is, instead, the anonymously comeant infinity of what Gadamer calls "the living virtuality of speech, that brings a totality of meaning into play, without being able to express it totally."14 The play of expres- sion is thereby a being played, for that "totality" is self-absentingly present in everything that is said, supplementing, sustaining, guiding, and measuring all saying as the sleeping-sedimented intentional hori- zons which Husserl has taught us to see as comeant in every act of meaning whatever. As Derrida puts it: "The writer writes in a language and in a logic whose proper system, laws, and life his discourse by defi- nition cannot dominate absolutely. He uses them only by letting him- self, after a fashion and up to a point, be governed by the system."15 Our primary concern in orienting ourselves in the domain of Kan≈•s thought must then be to understand what it is which Kant has in view in the idea of a systematic and certain science of metaphysics and in what sense that idea requires and unfolds itself into a critique of pure reason. Metaphysics is itself, again, in its "origin" the transcendental definition of the conditions of possibility for the final satisfaction of mind's intentional commitment to and eros for the real, and that "origin" is itself already a critique (the krinai logo of Parmenides, Fr. 7. 5 ) , a quest for certainty ( as a mode of being, of presence ) , a methodic discrimination in advance of the telos which makes visible the route or path to it as a route or path (rather than a backward-turning wandering in outer darkness, lost beyond all tidings) . If the telos is to methodically delimit the path to it, it must itself be certain, decided, self-contained, self-identical through itself alone, wholly visible and fully accessible to mind, static in an absolute present ab-solved of the absence of not yet and no more, such that mind may methodically-logically-pro-position- ally hold it in view, correspond to it, and, in the consummation of its quest, be fully present to it, be about it. This original critical methodic discrimination of the real, of being as an absolutely present highest being, is mediated to Kant by the ontotheology of Christian metaphysics, modeled on a particular read- ing of Aristotle, which takes its departure from his implicitly anthropo- morphic analysis of physis on the model of techne (Ph. 199A. 8-19) . 16 44</page><page sequence="7">In Christian ontotheology, which denatures nature ( physis ) into a product of a divine techne and so prefigures a modern will to techno- logical domination of the earth and the conversion of nature ( including, finally, human nature) into a human product, the being of what is in the whole, of man and of the world, is thought through and grounded in the absolute Parmenidean present of the pure actuality of the divine creative mind. The ens creatum , fashioned from nothing, is needy ek- static, ex-sistent,17 is almost nothing, and, standing out from nothing, it also inclines toward nothing in the pure transition of a now which is between the nonbeing of a not yet and of a no more. It is thus not present or intelligible through itself alone but is in itself and in totality a sign pointing beyond itself to the creative and sustaining presence of the mind or ratio of God, who posits and preserves a thing in the finite actuality of its essence. Insofar as Goƒès essence is the pure, unlimited, infinite act of exist- ing,18 an absolute self-position in permanent presence, and thus does not have existence but is existence, Saint Thomas asks how it is that God can know particular creatures which have a participated existence proportioned to the limitations of their particular essences. He answers: The divine essence contains in itself the excellences of all beings, not indeed by way of composition, but by way of perfection. Now, every form, both proper and common, considered as positing something, is a certain perfection: it includes imperfection only to the extent that it falls short of true being. Wherefore Goƒès understanding can com- prehend within His essence what is proper to each thing, by under- standing wherein each thing imitates His essence, and wherein it falls short of His perfection: for instance, by understanding His essence as imitable in respect of life and not of knowledge, it con- ceives the proper form of a plant . . . But the types of things in the divine understanding are neither multiple nor distinct, except insofar as God knows that things can be like Him in many and diverse ways.19 Essences and the eternal truths of essence are thus not in themselves plural or distinct, but they are to be distinguished from one another only in relation to the multiplicity of created finite actualities of which they are the essences, as man's finite created participation in the ratio of God perfects itself by ascending by the "natural order of knowing" from the existing created thing to knowledge of its essence. But an essence would be fully knowable and known only in the final term of that ascent, reabsorbed into the unity and simplicity of the divine ratio itself, for it is the principle, measure, and guarantee of knowability (even if it not itself naturally known by the finite intellect) . 45</page><page sequence="8">But of course the limits which Thomas sets to man's natural reason, limits which preserve the ineffability and radical transcendence of his God as a maker, producer, technites- limits which analogically promise and defer access to that transcendental truth which grounds human cognitive truth (adequation or correspondence of judgment to the thing) and makes it possible- defer the difficulty of the nondiversity of the eternal truths. We cannot in this life, in this world, know the divine essence as it is in itself, but only as it is represented in creatures which persevere in presence by a participated and thus finite act of existing - creatures whose logical and cosmological hierarchical order- ing presumably represents the relations of essences among themselves and to their hidden Parmenidean ground in the unity and simplicity of God's infinite self-positing in permanent presence. It is about this hidden center that the Cartesian revolution in meta- physics turned (and turns, for our present is still haunted by the absence there), as Descartes moved even beyond Su√°rez, who held that the eternal truths are not eternal because God knows them but that they are known by God because they are eternal ( Disp . meta. 31. 12, 40) . In Descartes's extraordinary view, expressed openly and publicly only in his unguarded reply to Gassendi, the Fifth Set of Objections,20 essences or eternal truths of essence are created by God and so are extrinsic to the simple infinity of the divine essence: "I do not think that the essence of things, and those mathematical truths which may be known about them, are independent of God; yet I think that because God so wished it and brought it to pass, they are immutable and eternal."21 It is this view which, alone, sustains and perhaps renders intelligible the extreme of Descartes's methodic doubt in the First Meditation: "how can I be sure that [God has brought it about that] I am always mistaken when I add two and three or count the sides of a square, or when I judge of something else even easier?"22 Here doubt would be possible, if at all, only by imagining "a god who can do everything." And only the final assurance in the Third and Fifth Meditations that God, upon whom all things depend, has indeed created 2 + 3 to be 5 and is no deceiver, permits him, in the Fifth Meditation, to conclude that a clear and distinct mathematical demonstration is necessarily true, certain, indubitable. The point I wish to make here is that the epistemological "indubitable" is bound up with but does not perfectly gloss the Cartesian sense of "necessarily true" or "certain" (and only if these terms are misread epistemologically, as they usually are, will the argument of the Meditations seem viciously circular), for these terms have for Descartes, and for the metaphysical tradition extending from him through Kant, an ontological force which is in perfect keeping 46</page><page sequence="9">with the full title of Descartes's work, Meditations on First Philosophy. Certainty has here its Parmenidean sense, that a being is identical through itself alone, fully decided and discriminable, fully visible and knowable, absolutely and perfectly present. That is, the eternal truths of geometry, discrete and plural because posited extrinsic to the ineffable simplicity and infinity of the divine essence, are fully accessible and can be made perfectly present in an absolutely grounding and translucent (the "light of knowledge," the interiorization of the Platonic sun) self- evidence in which they are perfectly self-given, are intuited.23 There are, accordingly, "pure and simple essences, which either our experiences or some sort of light innate in us enable us to behold as primary and existing per se, not as depending on any others."24 Thus, he remarks ironically in the Principles of Philosophy ,25 the most perfect science of creatures would be through knowledge of the creative divine essence on which they depend, but our finitude and Goƒès infinitude preclude that path, leaving open to us only the intuition of discrete but fully certain simple essences and eternal truths. In thus domesticating essence and making it the proper object of a finite mind, which, thereby, becomes autonomously self-responsible, Descartes was aware that he was on difficult theological ground, mak- ing problematic at best the medieval conception of Christ as mediating divine Logos (a move comparable to the almost contemporary humani- zation of Christ by the Socinians). A consequence, as Leibniz saw in rejecting Descartes's view here, was to deprive the doctrine of divine creation of all pretension to rational content, making it indistinguish- able from a positivistic blind necessity- as, in effect, Newton (who, it may be recalled, fell under the antitrinitarian influence of Socinianism in its diffusion after the Minor Church of Poland was crushed in 1658) will do, refusing, on the basis of a voluntaristic occasionalism, to have God's free will constrained by Leibnizian rational necessities or by scien- tific hypotheses about gravitation as a universal essential property in- herent in bodies as such, since he hopes to find in the current state and laws of the physical universe a clue to Goƒès ineffable and always changeable will. Since he so closely guarded his theological motives, he in fact directly prepared the way for the purely scientific positivism of his French and German successors. But the motive for Descartes's own extraordinary view on eternal truths itself lies concealed in the emergent project of mathematical physics and the correlative need to make finite mind autonomous, self-illuminated by an innate lumen natural , which nonetheless proceeds from and returns to God. As Kant rightly remarked (KdrV B. 13), that "light broke in on all investigators of nature" with the pathbreaking work of Galileo. That 47</page><page sequence="10">pathbreaking into the lighting of modern nature shows itself in Galileo's formulation of the principle or axiom of inertia in his Dis- courses of 1638: "I conceive in the mind ( mente concipio) something movable thrown on an horizontal plane and every impediment ex- cluded. The result ... is that the motion of the body over this plane would be uniform and perpetual if this plane were extended infinitely." The conception thus formed in the mind is, properly, as Heidegger has already noted, mathematical- not because it uses number or the numer- able to order, accumulate, store up, and calculate positivistic perceptual data but because it is a methodic project which springs over all per- ceiving in advance, is a spontaneous freedom from dependence on the parts of time (for its evidences are freely producible at any and every time) and of what is contingently-perceptually given only in and through the unfolding of time. In the principle, or, as Newton will later call it, the axiom of inertia, the mind freely and autonomously, prior to and independent of per- ception, proposes, brings to a stand before itself, or projects, throws over against itself, a determination of the movability of any and every body as such. The spatial manifold of this project is an empty, isotropic, in- finite continuum, an idealized-formalized space which is, because freed (to such an extent that the idealized preconditions of inertial motion cannot be realized physically, even in principle) from all relation to what is materially-perceptually contingent, fully re-presentable in a free formal spontaneity through which it can be made fully present to mind at any and every time as identically the same. In such a space- represented in a free spontaneous springing-over of the evidences of perception which thereby frees a place for them, overthrowing the principles and self-evidence of all preceding physics- every position is reduced to formal equivalence to every other position, and every motion (as change of position), to every other motion. But to conceive such a space, to freely and spontaneously present it to oneself, and to posit in it a unique isolated mathematical mass point is to posit in advance in a fundamental pro-position or axiom the very being of the movable, setting the movable on its foundation or ground in advance of all ex- perience. For, clearly, if the point be at rest or in uniform rectilinear motion (where rest and uniform motion, the traversing of equal dis- tances in equal times, can themselves be physically defined only by supposing the principle of inertia itself), then there can be no suffi- cient reason why it should accelerate unless acted upon by an external force. The fundamental principles or axioms of motion (Newton) dis- close the very essence (the sufficient reason - which Kant only managed in 1763, following Crusius, to distinguish from real or physical causal- 48</page><page sequence="11">ity) of body as movable and so make all bodies uniform according to idealized relations of space, time, and motion, such that things must be determinable in accord with an idealized universal measure, i.e., the numerical-mathematical. Kant saw and said as much when he observed ( KdrV B. 1 1 3 ) that the investigators of nature learned that reason only gains insight into what it produces itself according to its own projects ( was sie selbst nach ihrem Entw√ºrfe hervorbringt); that it must go before with principles of judgment according to constant laws, and constrain nature to reply to its ques- tions, not content to merely follow her leading-strings. This pro-jective constraint is the stance of modern man in the midst of nature, the way in which he brings it to stand before him. It speaks still in our English "experience/' "experiment/' "expert." All derive from Latin experiri , to try out, to put to the test (the LL experimentare having also the sense of try or test by torture), from L peritus, akin to Greek peira7 a trial or an attempt, and peirates , a robber at sea. Kan≈•s German term for experience, "erfahren" to ascertain, reconnoiter, or gain information about while passing through, goes back to the verbal root *per-, represented in Greek perir√≤ , peirar , peras, poros- and peira. The sense of the earlier forms is of motion in a forward direction or of the term or limit at which that motion ceases (peras) . Thus Aristotle, in surveying the early philosophy with regard not for its lisping expres- sion but for the way in which it was compelled by the undertaking itself (Meta. 984A. 18-19) or by aletheia itself (984B10), concludes that, while no one who is not physis-blind (see Ph. 19 3A. 4ff.) fails com- pletely, "no one is able to attain to aletheia adequately" (992 A. 32); and so his predecessors have inevitably left matters full of aporiae (998B. 20, 993A. 25-26; see 99 3A. 11-17 and 1028B. 2ff.), where aporia is a lack of free passage (poros) through to one's goal. Such an aporia of mind, he says, points to a "knot" in the thing (995A. 31i. ), and the solution (lysis) of the difficulty and clear or good passage through (euporesai) requires that we draw up the difficulties and so see the knots which obstruct our path or route or hodos through to the goal. As Aristotle shows by contrasting apeiron with diezodon (Ph. 204A. 6) , way or passage out or through, and by giving as its synonym adiezitetos (204A. 14), what cannot be traversed to the end, it is within this system of spatial "metaphors" that he understands Anaximander's self- absenting (since it comes to presence only in and through what it is not, the limitedness of elemental opposition) apeiron physis- there is, with respect to it, no clear passage through to the end. But in "experience," "experiment," "expert," and " Erfahrung. /' there is nothing which ob- 49</page><page sequence="12">structs or can obstruct free passage through, for mind in its methodic mathematical pro-ject, by an act of piracy, constrains what-is in advance of its being given. And, insofar as mind can thus freely give itself in advance the very essence of the movable, mind is a re-praesentare , it posits or puts or places something over against itself which thereby is as being present toward mind. But as able to direct itself in advance to what is thus representatively present toward itself, mind is also present to itself, is an apperceptive "I think" in all perception, present to itself in all repre- sentative making-present. It is thus capable of being brought to clear and distinct evidential self-presence in the lumen naturale through the Cartesian "Cogito, ergo sum," which is not an inferential but a per- formative self-presence,26 Descartes following Aquinas in holding that the intellect knows itself not by its essence but by its act ( Summa Theologiae i. Q. 87, art. 1). As immediate performative self-presence, setting itself in act, mind is in and through itself something certain, absolute being, even if, in the transition from temporal present to temporal present, it shows its finitude and its need for a final grounding in the perfect certainty and perfect presence of the dazzling and re- splendent divine source of the lumen naturale. The universal triumph of Cartesianism, which rules and governs as a sleeping sedimented horizon for all subsequent thinking, realist and idealist, "metaphysical" and mathematical-"physical," shows itself in the inversion of sense which now exchanges once and for all the mean- ing of the term "objective," a late medieval coinage (in general use only by the time of Duns Scotus ) meaning to throw over against ( ob-iacere ) , and the meaning of the pair "subjective-formal." For the formal reality of a thing was its intrinsic essence as a creature posited in finite act by the creator, such that it could be substantia or subiectum7 such that in the ontological realm it had its own participated act of existing through which it was present and could underlie, sustain, and support attributes present in it, such that in the logical realm it could be pro-positionally held in view as the Parmenidean self-identical subject of predication and judgment. Obiectum , then, characterized that which mind holds over against, the mental image through which it directs itself toward the extramental formal-subjective reality of the thing, where it is finally the creator who grounds and guarantees the correspondence of objec- tive to formal-subjective reality. But in Descartes mind is itself certain in its luminous self-presence in clearly and distinctly representing to itself the eternal truths of essence, such that it is itself preeminently subiectum (subiacere9 to throw under- neath, provide ground or reason for, was the model on which obiacere/ 5¬∞</page><page sequence="13">objectum was coined) as full and substantial self-presence and as that which throws or posits itself underneath, as ground, in every pro- positional holding of something before or over against itself. It can thus out of itself guarantee to itself and ground the truth of that which it objectively holds over against itself in a mathematically clear and dis- tinct representation, and the question of the formal reality of an objec- tive idea lingers in Descartes only as the question of the rational proof of the existence of God- that the circle of the natural light be closed by man's rationally (i.e., by his ratio) demonstrating the certainty of his grounding in the radiance of the divine perfect present. It is this understanding of man's critical-decisive position in the midst of what-is, his assumption of the role of Parmenidean meta- physical ground from the divine mind of ontotheology, which condi- tions the school definition of metaphysics which still speaks in Kan≈•s project of a scientific system of metaphysics. Following Wolff's defini- tion of philosophy as "the science of the possibles insofar as they can be," Baumgarten, in number 92 of his Metaphysica, writes: "Meta- physical truth can be defined as agreement of what-is with the first most universal fundamental principles ( principia catholica) ,"27 i.e., principles which axiomatically pro-ject the being of what-is in totality, grounding that project in man's self-certain self-presence in represen- tation, in man's ratio , and in man's finally grounding rational knowledge of God (who actualizes the best system of possibles ) . If Kant, in an epochal decision, transgresses, in the moment of ap- propriating it, this school concept of a system of metaphysics, and there- by at least implicitly transgresses the metaphysics of presence as such, it is because, quite apart from and prior to any supposed influence by Hume,28 he comes slowly to the recognition of an absolute difference in kind between the intuitive and the conceptual- through his own efforts to reconcile the physics of Newton with the pretended systemic cer- tainty of physico-theology (see KdrV A. 826i. -B. 855i.), following Leibniz; through his work in logic;29 and, perhaps, through conse- quences of Lambert's work in mathematics.30 For it was perhaps Lam- bert who first brought it to Kant's attention that, contra Leibniz and Wolff, a non-Euclidean geometry would not thereby be self-contradic- tory (see, at KdrV A. 220-B. 268, the example from a Riemanian geometry, a surface enclosed by two straight lines ) , so that the unique status of Euclidean space cannot be logically grounded through non- contradiction in God's eternal comprehension of all possible worlds as necessarily Euclidean, such that Euclidean space should be a pheno- menon dei. Lambert already proposes that the future of metaphysics depends upon a clear distinction between logical-conceptual form and 51</page><page sequence="14">perceptual matter. The distinction of form and matter, rooted in both the metaphysical doctrine of the proposition and in Aristotle's para- digmatic and implicity anthropomorphic analysis of techne, of a making or a producing (a bringing forth into and setting in the visibility of ergon) of something in the light of an intended end which prescribes the matter or stuff and the appropriate disposition and forming of it in order that it may be used up and may disappear in pure serviceability, serves to make sense and thought radically discontinuous for the first time in the whole history of metaphysics. Thus the decisive formulation of the critical problem, comes in the essay of 1763, The Only Possible Ground for a Proof of the Existence of God , where Kant, after nine years of reflection, saw that the great finally grounding ontological proof of Cartesian metaphysics fails because "existence is not a predicate or determination of anything whatever," for "the concept of positing or asserting ( Position oder Setzun) is completely simple and identical with that of being in general" (see KdrV A. 598-B. 626). Given the difference of thought and intuition, that positing is, of necessity, intuitive and not discursive or conceptual (i.e., the predicate of a possible judgment). Then that something is does not provide a ground or reason that defines and de- limits, makes visible and knowable, a consequent existence of some- thing else. This holds, as he notes in an essay on negative quantities (1763), even for the relation of the will of God to the existing world- to form a concept of God does not permit one, depending only on the principle of identity or noncontradiction for the logical analysis of what is already contained in that concept, to provide a real ground for the existence of the world, and to speak of the will or the power of God is to beg the question, since "this word power already denotes the relation- ship of a real ground to its consequence, which is precisely what I should like to have explained to me."31 "Power": a word which stands for and holds open the empty place of the inexplicable, inconceivable, and in- comprehensible real relation which might link one existence to another. Can we not still hear in it the effaced trace of physis , supplement of the "defective" verb "to be," excluded in the methodic movement of the metaphysics of presence- a movement whose route and goal are them- selves defined and delimited by that exclusion? Insofar as Kant continues to define rational knowledge through a Cartesian cognitio ex principiis ,32 the question which confronts him is how it is possible for the Galilean-Cartesian-Newtonian sub-ject to pro-ject in advance of and independent of intuitive experience the principles, axioms, or fundamental pro-positions which define the ob- jectivity of the object, as, for example, inertial, given that existence is 52</page><page sequence="15">not conceptual, judgmental, pro-positional but rather simply positional, tied finally to the positing of the intuited in a singular representation as (spatio-) temporally present. Thus, again, given that something is, the intuitive positing of an inertial mass at a given time, it is impossible to understand how the existence of something else- its intuitive positing at a later time and in the same or a different spatial position- follows, can be conceptually grounded and made visible and knowable. But the Euclidean manifold of that positing is itself differentiate from other noncontradictory possible geometries by being the only one constructi- ble in (a priori) intuition. Space is thus not a phenomenon founded in the mind of God (Leibniz), but in the finite mind of man: "We can therefore only speak of space, of extended things, etc., from the stand- point of a man" ( KdrV A. 26-B. 42 ) . Ill Kant's response to the crisis in metaphysics is a critique of pure reason, a transcendental argument on conditions of possibility which is in- scribed in that given by Parmenides but which, for the first time, at least implicitly transgresses his methodos. And that transgression is not bound up with the more peripheral issue of Kan≈•s subjectivism or idealism, for the perfect differential correlativity and binary opposition of subject and object everywhere fundamentally conditions and orients the linguistic-conceptual system of the metaphysics of presence, and the question of the relative methodic priority of the one or the other is a question internal to that system. The Parmendiean (and Platonic transcendental argument from eros and the conditions of possibility of its final satisfaction indeed express an implicit anthropocentric sub- jectivism (articulated and enriched as it was mediated to the later tradi- tion through the ontotheological divine mind) in the methodic primacy of eros (even as, oddly, it is Kant who perhaps first frees us from the exclusivity of the subject-object opposition for the more fundamental horizon of the temporality of presencing) . The Kantian critique remains faithful in its intention to the onto- logical orientation originally laid down in the krinai logo of Parmenides: it is to critically discriminate and decide pure reason and thereby lift it up into the autonomous certainty of its essence, the presence of mind to itself in the representation of its object. Reason is here "pure," be- cause in the self-certainty of its self-critique, concentrating itself in its essence, it frees itself from all that is heteronomous (see KdrV A. 751- B. 779): reason's self-critique is a task of "self-knowledge" (KdrV A. xif.), deals with "nothing save reason and its pure thinking" (A. xiv; 53</page><page sequence="16">see B. x) and "what reason produces entirely out of itself cannot be concealed, but is brought to light by reason itself" (A. xx; see B. xxiii) . How does pure reason in its autonomy thus define and delimit itself, raising itself up into, establishing itself within, and appropriating its proper horizon,33 bringing itself forward and to a stand in the circle of its own light, self-certain in a self-produced absolute unconcealedness or nonlatency in critical self-presence? Kan≈•s answer, already carrying within it the critical (in the sense of excluding and limiting) distinction of thinking and knowing, is that reason thinks itself or pro-poses itself to itself as intuitive. For, given a distinction of intuition and thought, it is in intuition that mind, in general, is in immediate perceptual proximity to what is present (A. 320-B. 377; A. 19-B. 33), positing it (see the repeated use of " setzen " in B. 67), and the consummation of the Parmenidean quest for perfect perceptual proximity to the real in an absolute present absolved of the double absence of not yet and no more34 could belong only to divine or infinite mind (B. 72), an absolutely positing (see B. 145) archtypical (A. 695-B. 723) intuitus originarius (B. 68, 72, 135, 138i., 159) : 35 With the recognition that being is nothing conceptual and the correlative failure of the ontological proof, the grounding function of the absolute Parmenidean present of the divine mind of ontotheology- that what-is should have its ground and reason in a highest being, be present and be through the perfect present of a highest present being- exhibits itself here purely negatively, as an empty limit concept, as that which finite mind is not. But that difference between an inaccessibly absent perfect present and the finitude of our mind (although by B. 150 Kant recog- nizes that the argument extends universally to any finite intuition as such ) will define, in Kant, the obligation and the infinite task of ideal- ity, of a striving toward unconditioned and in-finite self-presence under both the speculative and the moral ideas of reason. In the Critique of Pure Reason , for finite mind to critically delimit it- self through appeal to the limit concept of an in-finite intuitus originar- ius is to posit the heteronomy of radical alterity at the heart of the autonomous self-certainty of self-presence. For finite mind to think through its difference from the empty limit concept of an in-finite intuition is to think itself as derivative, not originary (KdrV B. 72) and as, thus, nonspontaneous (B. 68), not "immediately self-active" (B. 69), a receptive being-affected in which something is given (A. 19-B. 33, A. 44-B. 61, A. 50-B. 74, A. 93-B. 126, A. 100, B. 150). But if finite intuition is thus differentially defined through the meta- physical limit concept of the absolute present of a spontaneous- 54</page><page sequence="17">originary divine mind, so must the intuitively given differentiate itself in accord with the respect in which it is given- a divine e-ject (Heideg- ger's Ent-stand ), wholly present in an absolute now in which the divine mind originally gives itself the thing (B. 145) in spontaneously- creatively intuiting it, and as ob-ject ( Gegenstand ) held over against a dependent finite-receptive intuition. As Kant expresses the essential belonging together in difference of what is thus distinguished, in the Opus postumum: The distinction between the concept of a thing in itself and that of appearance is not objective but merely subjective. The thing in itself ( ens per se) is not another object, but another respect ( respectas ) of the representation with regard to the same object.36 Similarly, in the "Preface" to the second edition of the Critique (B. xxvii; see A. 38-B. 55, A. 391 ), he speaks of the critically necessary dis-' tinction "between things as objects of experience and those same things as things in themselves" (emphasis mine: Dinge als Gegenstande der Erfahrung , von eben denselben , als Dingen an sich selbst). He con- tinues in the same sense: . . the object ( Objekt ) is to be taken in a twofold sense , namely as appearance and as thing in itself."37 As a Rezeptivitat (A. 19-B. 33), a recipere (from capere , to take in one's hands, to contain, to take, IE r *kap~, *kep-)y finite intuition is a gathering or taking of something offered. If that which is offered is (for a finite thinking which would autonomously define and delimit itself through the limit concept of an infinite intuitus originarius) the same object perfectly present in a spontaneous divine intuition, but in an- other respect, then the respect in which we finitely-receptively take what is offered in intuition must differ from a perfect divine intuitive having of that same object by the mode of presence. Only the creator, Kant holds, can perceive ( vernehmen : to perceive, literally to use up or to continue through to the end the appropriation of a thing, laying abso- lute hold upon it) the substance of an other thing.38 Intuitive presence is not, for us, a Parmenidean perfectly present perceiving, but is rather a temporally extended receiving of what is offered, in one singular rep- resentation ( repraesentatio singularis )39 after another, as the spacing0 of the pure successivity or pure ecstatic "outside itselfness" of a temporal manifold or a temporal horizon-- that temporality is a continuous transcending of the present (i.e., of that which alone is, if to be is to be present) into (the primal absence) of just past and just coming, and an originary re-presentative (i.e., to make present again) return out of just past and just coming into a present which is and is positable as such 55</page><page sequence="18">only in this return into itself from the alterity of being beyond itself: . . . the representations of the outer senses constitute the proper material with which we occupy ( besetzen ) our mind, but because the time in which we set these representations ( Vorstellungen setzen), which is itself antecedent to the consciousness of them in experience ( Erfahrung ) and which underlies them as the formal condition of the mode in which we posit ( setzen ) them in mind, itself contains only relations of succession, coexistence, and of that which is co- existent with succession, the enduring. . . . Since this form does not represent anything save insofar as something is posited (gesetzt) in the mind, it can be nothing but the mode in which the mind is affected through its own activity (namely, through the positing of its representations), and so is affected by itself. [B. 67] Time, taken as a pure form of self-affection, in and of itself, is nothing ("This form does not represent anything save insofar as . . .," it is the form of the activity of positing what is received, nothing in itself-even as the Analogies of Experience will turn on the premise that "time cannot itself be perceived" [A. 177-B. 219; see B. 207, A. 172-B. 214, B. 233, A. 192-B. 237, B. 257] ), for it is a pure (transcendental, trans- cending every thingly determination) ec-static being-free-for or open- for being affected, a being open toward (a "toward" which is the hidden ground of the intentionality of consciousness in all representatien, so that an intuitive singular repsesentation is already "in itself" an appear- ing-of, points beyond itself toward its object both as appearance and as thing in itself: "Appearances are not things in themselves; they are only representations, which in turn have their object" [A. 109]) what is offered or given. Insofar as that intuitive freedom-for is essentially finite, receptive, "the complete absence of reality [not actuality, but quality or determinate sensory-material content] from a sensible intui- tion can never be itself perceived" ("Anticipations of Perception," A. 172-B. 214), and a pure intuition is itself an empty limit concept, the empty thought of a lower limit (o = negation) of an intensive con- tinuum: "From empirical consciousness to pure consciousness a grad- uated transition is possible, the real in the former completely vanishing and a merely formal a priori consciousness of the manifold in space and time remaining" (B. 208), where thought spontaneously represents "one and the same time as filled and as empty" ("Schematism," A. 143-B. 209), and "the absence of sensation at that instant would in- volve the representation of the instant as empty" ("Anticipations," A. 167-B. 209). "Pure" reason critically raises itself up into the autonomy of its essence by thinking itself in the binary opposition and 56</page><page sequence="19">difference of finite/infinite intuition, where the infinite functions as a defining limit concept. But inscribed within that oppostion we find now another, that finite mind can autonomously define and delimit its finitude (receptivity) only by freely-spontaneously representing the sensory content of "one and the same" abstracted moment of temporal receptivity as an intensive continuum which can be thought to descend from the impurity of the empirical to the purity of a lower limit of emptiness (which is, in turn, an openness for the impurity of the em- pirical). Only as thus abstractively freed from the heteronomy and impurity (see the two sentences of A. 11 stricken from B. 24) of sensory otherness would time and space be, properly, pure forms of intuition, so that the binary opposition of pure and impure originally defines the difference of sensible form and of sensory matter. The spontaneous representation of that pure limiting emptiness accordingly reflects the finitude of intuition: it is an empty limit concept, for no pure (i.e., empty, uncontaminated by the alterity of sensory matter) present is possible, but mind can (and must, and in the ec-stasis of temporaliza- tion continuously does) transcend the alterity of present sensory matter in its freedom to represent its absence. As pure self-affection (or the form thereof), time is an ec-static transcending of the present toward just past and just coming (indeed contains "nothing but relations of succession"), opening out through that inner alterity a temporal horizon or free space in which what is determinately not-nothing may intuitively offer itself in a temporally extended manifold of singular representations, may come to presence. But because the temporal present is only through the inner ec-static alterity of a re-presentative return (out of past and future) toward it- self, "mind" can thus itself act on or affect itself, be present to itself, posit (L poner e, to put or place or set, to bring to a stand, to stasis) it- self, be, only through alterity (the "relation" of the present to the double absence of not yet and no more, and the impurity of what, as sensory matter, is posited as present), only through the positing (in and as the present) of what is received: "intuits itself not as it would repre- sent itself if immediately self-active, but as it is affected from within (wie es von innen affiziert wird), and therefore as it appears to itself, not as it is" (B. 69; see B. 152i., 157-59). "Mind" is thus "unable to determine its existence as that of a self-active being" (B. i58n.), and so is "a dependent being, dependent in its existence as well as in its intui- tion, and which through that intuition determines its existence solely in relation to given objects" (B. 72 ) . Determining its existence by posit- ing what is received in a passive self-affection, it originally differentiates the forms of inner and outer sense, opening out over against itself and 57</page><page sequence="20">its temporal self-presence the spatiality of locative presence, of a free space over against me in order that what is offered may be offered (back) toward me. By virtue of the inner alterity of temporalization itself, the "outer" is always already within the "inner" (which Kant will himself make explicitly in the "Refutation of Idealism"), has always already compromised the purity of its self-presence. But if we are in any sense to have the object, locatively and duratively present, then such a temporally extended manifold must be run through and gathered together, a spontaneity or activity oriented by the differ- ential contrast between an infinite and a finite intuitive presencing of the object toward the ideal limit of fully adequate presence (an ideal in principle unattainable, because of the essential absolute difference in the modes of intuitive presence- in a temporally extended manifold, more of the object is always being offered, but all of it can never be given, as Kant showed for the world and as Husserl showed for tables, chairs, and trees). The spontaneity of discursively running through and holding to- gether is a concipere (to take together, to contain, to gather; a synthesis as a positing or a bringing to stasis together of that which is successively posited as present in singular intuitive representations). Knowledge through concepts is not immediately intuitive, but is rather, in contrast to the nondependent and nondiscursive spontaneity of a divine "in- tellectual intuition" (B. 68; B. 72; A. 256-B. 311), discursive (A. 68- B. 98 ) , resting on a function, defined as "the unity of the act of bringing various representations under one common representation" (A. 68- B. 93) . Finite intuition must thus, by virtue of its finitude, derivatively, discursively, conceive. That is, it must also think: "Intuition is that through which mind is in immediate relation to them [objects], and to which all thought as a means is directed" (A. 19-B. 33) . As finite intuition I am in some sense present to myself in re-presen- tation, affecting myself by positing or placing or bringing-to-a-stand-as- now what is intuitively received. But I thus affect myself, am present to myself, and am only as the openly endless passive-receptive being be- yond itself of the temporal manifold. The spontaneity or activity (act, actuality, energeia, that which is established, produced, or set forth in work, in ergon , standing upright, decided, and certain in the lighted- ness of aletheia , thus discriminable, visible, knowable) through which I am an intelligence (B. i58n.), a mind (even if finite-dependent), is not able to intuitively present itself to itself and be, for my apperceptive self-presence is an in itself empty concipere : "The consciousness of self (apperception) is the simple representation of the 'I,' and if all that is manifold in the subject were given by the activity of the self, the inner 58</page><page sequence="21">intuition would be intellectual" (B. 68). If I were thus self-active, I should be immediately intuitively present to myself in self-affection, should present myself to myself in an absolute Parmenidean present, should be a self-constitutive in-finite intellectual intuition, in no way finite, dependent, open to and free for the reception of that which offers itself: ". . . in the . . . original unity of apperception, I am conscious of myself, not as I appear to myself, nor as I am in myself, but only that I am. This representation is a thought , not an intuition" (B. 1 57) . Kant's point is Cartesian, that the certainty of the cogito is performa- tive, but Kant- having recognized that being is not a real predicate, is not conceptual but intuitive, and that my intuition is finite-dependent -sees that in that reflective certainty I am "conscious . . . only that I am" and do not know myself either as I am in myself (what I would be as perfectly present in an in-finite intuition ) or as I appear to myself (passively-receptively affecting myself by positing what is intuitively given as now, in an openly endless manifold of nows) . As Kierkegaard, following Hegel, will say of Fichte, in his master's thesis "On the Con- cept of Irony," one finds here a certainty which is devoid of truth. As a finite-dependent spontaneity or act, I can be present to myself and be, can affect myself, only in being receptively affected, can act only in a temporal manifold of being acted upon. I reflectively represent myself to myself as self-identical self-certain spontaneity or act or self- affection; but I am present to myself only in being affected, only in and through the inner alterity of time. As spontaneous self-affection (or the necessity of thinking itself as such, as an intelligence), time, which it- self "does not change" (A. 143-B. 183; A. 182-B. 225), is the self- representation of the "I" in its self-certain self-identity, that at any and every time it can say "I" of itself (A. 108; A. 113; A. 116; B. 131i.),41 an "I" which abides and does not change ( A. 123) . But as the self-affection of a finite-receptive being, not immediately self-active, time is a pure or empty form of self-affection, for only through a receptive being affected (that which is contingently materially intuited in the inner alterity of time, is posited in time) can mind spontaneously act on or affect itself: mind, as imite act , can no longer find its ground (and continuity) in the perfect actuality of the god of Aristotle ( as telos ) or of ontotheology ( as creator), can represent its own unity and self-identity only in syntheti- cally positing or bringing to a stand a receptively given and successively posited manifold or many "within itself." Conceptually representing itself to itself as pure unity, but present to itself only as a temporally extended manifold or many, finite mind must reflectively reduce what is manifold to the unity of one consciousness, reflectively pro-posing (B. 135) itself to itself as an originally unifying 59</page><page sequence="22">unity, which is not categorial- judgmental but grounds and rules them as functions of unification (B. 131). It is, in a sense significant for Kan≈•s moral philosophy, a will to be unitary and self-certain, fully present to myself in the uprightness and decidedness of my being. It is thus an oriented activity of unifying what is posited as manifold in the pure and purely relational (for a now is what it is as successor to a past and pre- decessor of a future, as a transcending of the present toward past and future in order to horizonally relate them one to another) form of time. This continuously achieved unity or identity of consciousness "in re- spect of all representations" is a "necessary condition of the possibility of all representations" (A. 116)- for representations would otherwise not belong to the unity of one consciousness and would be nothing in relation to one another or for me. For consciousness would then frag- ment into successive purely present momentary atomic intuitive con- sciousnesses (see A. 122; B. 134), which, lacking the distance and free space of a transcending of the now (and the "impure" material density and, if you will, pressure of its present sensory content) into the open relational horizon of past and future, would be without relation to one another and would admit of no distinction between consciousness and its intuited content, would admit of no space for the opposing of an object (a meaningless and undifferentiated Parmenidean unity of per- fect perceptual proximity to the object, but at the level of atomic sense) . So this syn-thesis or reflective concipere is itself always already bound up in the primitive positing as present of each singular intuitive represen- tation : "Every intuition contains in itself a manfold only insofar as the mind distinguishes the time in the sequence of one impression upon an- other" (A. 99). Thus if one with Kant abstractively (B. i6of., n.; see A. 99i.; A. 107) isolates sensibility, sense of itself involves a synopsis (A. 94, 97), a seeing or holding or taking together of the manifold as manifold (A. 99), of a many within the unity of one consciousness. It thus corresponds to a syn-thesis, and thus to the imagination (A. 78- B. 103) as "the faculty of representing in intuition an object that is not itself present" (B. 151), the making-present of what is absent, the transcending of the present into the double absence of not yet and no more in order that, returning into the present, mind may affect itself by positing the present as present. Thus to hold the manifold as manifold is to introduce into each singular representation a "transcendental con- tent" (A. 79-B. 105), is to intentionally animate the present so that it intentionally signifies the double absence of no more and not yet and in and through that relational-horizonal connexity signifies an object which stands over against mind, progessively presenting itself in the unfolding of that temporal horizon. 60</page><page sequence="23">I can be (be present to myself) and be self-certain in synthetically reflectively reducing what is manifold to unity only if, in synthetic activ- ity, I can be conscious of or know what I am doing (see the example of drawing a line, A. io2f.; B. 127i., B. 154, A. 162-B. 203), be conscious of "the unity of the act of bringing various representations under one common representation" (A. 68-B. 93). Mind can achieve itself as a temporally continuous identity because the "I" that spontaneously pro- poses itself to itself as originally unifying unity and the "I" that intuits itself by affecting itself in positing as present what is received are identi- cal in difference (B. 155), and "the unity of apperception ... as a func- tion corresponds to the receptivity of inner sense" (A. 145-B. 185) . Now mind can "have before its eyes the identity of its act" and be certain of itself as originally unifying unity only if it can pro-positionally hold over against itself and op-pose to itself a pure representation of unity: Now we find that our thought of the relation of all knowledge to its object carries with it an element of necessity; the object, which is op- posed ( was dawider ist), is viewed as that which prevents our modes of knowledge from being haphazard or arbitrary, and which deter- mines them a priori in some definite fashion. For insofar as they are to relate to an object, they must necessarily agree with one another, that is, must possess that unity which constitutes the concept of an object. [A. 104] The "abiding and unchanging T " (A. 123) holds in view, conceives (A. 105), its own unity by op-posing to itself the pure unchanging ("always one and the same," A. 109) unity of a transcendental object in general = X and thereby methodically constrains itself, pro-posing itself to itself as identical in all positing. That transcendental object "is nothing to us" (A. 105), for it is a pure and necessarily empty represen- tation of the over-againstness ("something that has to be distinct from all our representations," A. 105) of ob-jectivity in general (the ob- jectivity of any possible object, the Kantian analogue of Aristotle's on he on, Meta. 1003A. √¨gflF. ) , a pure Parmenidean methodic orienting of the relational transcending and being beyond itself of the free space of temporal receptivity, orienting it toward recognition in a concept. The self-constraint by which the "I" holds continuously in view the unity of its own act by thinking the pure (empty) ob-jective unity of an object in general = X is itself the Kantian analogue of the Parmenidean con- straint that the real as telos imposes on mind in its intentional striving (that, remaining the same in the same, it compels mind to think it as it is and, finally, be about it). That pure identity is "nothing to us" be- 61</page><page sequence="24">cause Kant recognizes its absence to be nonsurpassable, because it is, properly, ideal, deferred to infinity. But by orientedly holding open the over-againstness of objectivity, it makes it possible for the "I" to achieve its unchanging self-identity by referring each singular representation successively posited as now in the unchanging (A. 143-B. 183, A. 182-B. 225) horizon of time to an object as an appearing of it and so to hold the present (in apprehension, reproduction, and re-cognition) in relation to what is just past and just coming as manifold sequential appearings of an identical and unchang- ing object. Only by the spontaneous freedom of referring (in accord with the unity of a rule) every intuition to an object as an appearing of it can mind assure itself of the identity of its own act in the manifold- ness of temporal succession and so be free for what is positable as now in a present which is successively manifold. The free spontaneity of thought, although derivative from and directed toward determining the finite freedom of intuitive receptivity, itself provides the oriented free space (of over-againstness) which makes it possible. Accordingly, "Unity of rule determines all the manifold, and limits it to conditions which make unity of apperception possible. The concept of this unity is the representation of the object = X" (A. 105; see A. 250), where that object is itself "one and the same" in all knowing (A. 109, A. 253), even as the "I think" is "one and the same" in all consciousness (B. 132). Pure concepts or categories (i.e., ontological predicates determ- ing the transcendental object in general-X, A. 251, and thereby de- terming in advance what can be present and be as ob-ject) are then specifications of that pure op-posed unity, determinate expressions of and rules (or, finally, schemata) for the reflective reduction of what is manifold to unity, concepts of the activity of reducing to unity and of the unity of the act (see B 153; "the unity of the act, of which, as an act, it is conscious to itself" ) of synthesis itself-that the function of reducing what is manifold to the unity of one consciousness should itself in that activity ( Wirkung of understanding on sensibility, B. 152, whereby it is itself in act, actual, in work, energeia ) be unitary; that, in the successivity of the doing, as in drawing a line, I should be present to myself in the continuity of being at every possible point of time certain of what I am doing. Since consciousness can only pro-pose itself to itself as unitary by op- posing to itself the transcendental object as a rule of unity, it follows that every singular intuitive representation which can belong to any possible empirical consciousness must have an intentional-relational- referential-significational structure and be a representation-of or ap- pearance-of, must have an horizon intentionality in which what is 62</page><page sequence="25">absent is itself held in the present positing (the transcendental affinity/ associability of the manifold). The relation between pro-position (transcendental apperception, ground of both the analytic-logical and the synthetic unity of consciousness) and op-position (transcendental object) is such that all position or positing ( setzen ) is necessarily in- formed by it, and every singular intuitive representation posited in and through the form of time must be in itself intentional-significational, a present differentially defined through absence (the absence of the thing in itself; the double absence of just past and just coming; the absence of the transcendental object, placeholder for the absent thing in itself, and itself nothing to us because it is op-posed to all our representations ) . If time is a transcending being beyond itself and so a being open toward or free for what is (noumenally) offered, then the transcendental object serves to make that freedom a determinate orientation-toward (onto- logical knowledge or transcendental truth, the determinate freedom for and condition of possibility for that correspondence which is empirical or ontic truth), such that every singular intuitive representation is posi table as present only as appearance-of an empirical-phenomenal object, an object which is primarily external, spatial, public ("Refuta- tion of Idealism"). One can see in this the sense in which the noumenal object (in its problematic positive sense, the thing in itself posited as perfectly present e-ject in a divine in-finite intuition; and with it, the proper negative- limiting sense, that the finite-dependent spontaneity of our thought is knowledge only in the referring of the intentionality of each singular intuitive representation to the transcendental object in general = X as correlate of the "I think") and the phenomenal-empirical object (always horizonally coming to presence, never fully and perfectly present) are not two different objects but the same object taken in two different respects. For the unchanging identical transcendental object = X in a sense "stands for," means, signifies, refers to, and holds open the place of the absent noumenal object (see A. 277-B. 333, A. 494-B. 522, A. 538i. -B. √ß66f.), even as, in the synthesis of the itself unchanging temporal manifold (as abiding substrate of that which successively alters in it) by the abiding and unaltering "I," the empirical object, an unchanging substance exhibiting itself and presencing through the reciprocity of the relations of force to all other substances with which it stands in the universal community of a world horizon42 or a nature fully open to finite mind because constituted by it (A. 125i.) is itself con- ceived through the transcendental object in general = X and its "rela- tion" (that Kant can at A. 52 3 strongly distinguish them, but at A. 288- B. 344, A. 494-B. 522, and A. 6134-B. 641i. identify them) to the noumenal thing in itself. 63</page><page sequence="26">IV What is accomplished in Kant is, indeed, a metaphysics of experience, of Erfahrung , a path or passage through to the being, the presence, of what is present, a path without aporia 43 because mind in its methodic mathematical pro-ject, by a piratical act of violence, constrains what-is in advance of its being given. The violence of that pro-ject, which radically informs and deforms man's relation to himself and to a "nature" which he gives himself (for only the creator of a thing can fully know a thing) and which is thus unlimitedly available to him as raw material for self-objectification (Marx) and for technological pro- duction and consumption (applied metaphysics), is not Kan≈•s per- sonal-subjective doing. For the metaphysics of experience is in this respect already inscribed in the Parmenidean methodic metaphysics of presence, the original transcendental argument to delimit in advance the conditions of possibility for the final satisfaction of mind's inten- tional commitment to and erotic quest for the real. What at least im- plicitly transgresses the tropes of that methodos is Kant's openness for the essential finitude of experience and for the primacy of the ekstasis of temporalization over every thesis, even if his own understanding of that finitude continues to be everywhere ruled and governed by the sleeping-sedimented horizons of the metaphysics of presence and its understanding of being, continues to be oriented through it toward the now absent, deferred, merely ideal Parmenidean telos of a perfect per- ceptual presence of mind to the real: divine in-finite mind and its e-ject (the problematic positive concept of the noumenon), time as an homogeneous and itself unchanging horizonal substrate of change, the "I think" and its pure correlate the transcendental object in general = X as self-identically abiding and unchanging, the permanence of sub- stance and the unchanging "inner world" of reciprocal community (A. 212-B. 259) in accord with scientific law (provisional approxima- tions to the ideal eternal proposition) by which it exhibits itself (A. 688f.-B. 674i.) in the interplay of forces (A. 265-B. 321). But insofar as mind is, in re-presenting the object, present to itself and able to affect itself and posit itself as present only through the radical alterity of an horizonal-temporal transcending (which is ecstatic rather than thetic) wherein it is free from immersion in and pressure from the present in order that it may be free to intuitively- thinkingly orient itself toward it, finite experience has the character of life. Hegel saw this when, in the Phenomenology of Spirit , his treatment of the Kantian inverted world of understanding, substance, and force unfolds itself into and concludes in the phenomenon of life, which in 64</page><page sequence="27">the next chapter shows itself to be "the truth of self-certainty." For what is living of itself differentiates itself (and is inner difference or infinity) from and op-poses itself to otherness, in and from which it lives by the assimilation of what is other, so that it itself mediates for itself its reality through alterity, appropriating what it itself differen- tiates from itself as alien.44 Self-consciousness, that life should be present to itself and affect itself in and through alterity, derives from this movement of what is living toward itself, the movement of reflec- tion into itself out of otherness (that life is for itself individual and moves toward comprehensive self-presence) . More fundamental than the performative self-presence of the "I think" and the correlative unaltering and unchanging objectivity which it holds over against itself is the finitude of lived and living experience (by which I do not mean Husserl's Kantian limit Idea of the " Lebenswelt "), the transcending of the "Immediacy" of presence into the absence and alterity of just past and just coming, first opening out the horizonal free space of presencing as such. And such a temporal horizon is not in itself fundamentally the constant homogeneous suc- cession of now point upon now point, the time of the pro-ject of mathe- matical physics, but the finite transcendental open ( aletheia , kosmos) which makes such a linear spatializing of time possible through the being-beyond-itself and "spacing" of temporalization itself. For life, in moving toward self-comprehending self-presence, is never and can never be present to itself in a Parmenidean present without past and future, absolved of all absence, for it ever absents and defers45 itself precisely as movement toward itself. For what is living has its own time,46 in that, as a transcending of the present into its past and its future in order to be free for its present, its present and its future are continuously modified by a past which is not an homogeneous con- tinuum but which "becomes ever more and more," even as its future frees it for the present appropriation of that past. Its present is an epochal closure of a past which is essentially nonrepeatable, for each experience modifies the horizonal setting of every subsesuent experi- ence and is, as such, radically new. And death belongs to the finitude of the experience of what thus, as living, has its own time, because in the epochal self-closure of its time it continuously, as it were, accumulates behind itself- the sense of that uncanny observation by Alcmaeon of Croton (Fr. 2) that "human beings therefore have to die because they have not learned to connect the end with the beginning." Life aims at itself and at self-comprehending self-presence, moves toward a circular return ( telos , in its etymological sense), moves toward the circular identity of arche (the governing origin of a process of development) 65</page><page sequence="28">and o√≠ peras (as terminus of forward motion), but in that movement it also always ecstatically distances itself from itself, defers itself, absents itself, and so unfolds itself in otherness until it loses itself in the abso- lute alterity of death. That epochally self-closing self-unfolding of finite experience, its movement toward an impossible self-comprehending self-presence, is a dialectic (a legein , a gathering or collecting, by running through) of transcendental and empirical truth, ontological and ontic knowing, a self-unfolding inter-play of identity in difference of presencing (as physis , logos, and aletheia ) and of what is present (whether that being which I am or those beings which are other than I am ) .47 There can be no perfect present, absolved of absence, in which the originary differ- ence between presencing and what is present would itself be finally transcended. For finite transcending of the present in order to be free for it takes over its own past in a dialogically received tradition which is not an object of knowledge but is rather what Gadamer has called an effective moment of one's own being and yet, as a freedom for the radically new, continuously epochally modifies that tradition in ap- propriating it. That essentially dialectical and dialogical finite freedom of experience, more fundamental than being a self, since it horizonally conditions all presence and self-presence, is what it is to have language and to have a "world," to be gathered or collected into the open lighted- ness of a kosmos (which is not a thing or a totality of things but the free space needed for anything to be present and be). For language is not fundamentally an eternal pro-positional appropriation of what is per- fectly perceptually present, an univocal instrumental means by which a mind aims at a transcendent signified in order to come into perfect and perfectly silent perceptual proximity to it- although language may itself in some contexts, as in a court of law or in the mathematical sciences, properly aim at that impossible ideal.48 There are neither sub- jects nor objects, neither atomic propositions nor atomic perceptions, neither a transcendental signifying subject nor a transcendent signified, exempt from the inner difference, deferral, and absence of living language as the metapherein of the inter-play of ontological difference. Language is indeed most fully itself as living language, freeing itself from the dead constraint of its sedimented past (a ready familiarity with what is to be said which speaks anonymously in every instrumental misuse of language as a means or tool for the univocal transfer of infor- mation ) , freeing itself into its own inner infinity and difference, freeing itself for the originary saying of that for which, in its newness, the language is not yet there, that which is still- and ever- subject to aporia. For it is in the nonnaturalness of language that self-absenting and self- 66</page><page sequence="29">concealing physis, the self-emerging and self-unfolding power of life and the excluded supplement of Greek einai , speaks and comes to presence. Language, as the nonnatural transcendental openness or freedom for the wordly presencing of self-absenting physis is the every bounded free play of a metapherein , even (or perhaps most of all) in the self-effacing metaphorics of methodos, of the logical, of the proper-univocal, of the logically proper name, of the pure perceptual fulfillment of a subject's propositional holding of an object before and over against itself. To recall physis as arche or governing origin is not to repeat that origin, which is impossible, but to more fully appropriate and experi- ence our own past and present, the tradition of the metaphysics of presence, so that in its epochal self-closure we may find ourselves free for what of itself draws near as future. As in psychoanalysis, only the appropriation of the past first frees us for it as something past, so that we are free from its compulsion and open for what approaches. One may perhaps say, with Eliot in the Four Quartets , "In my beginning is my end" ("East Coker," i.i.i),but, "The end of all our exploring/ Will be to arrive where we started/ And know the place for the first time" ("Little Gidding," 5. 2. 240-42), for we can never connect the be- ginning to the end in the absolute self-responsibility of a self-closed circle. Our approach to the "origin" of the metaphysics of presence is itself conditioned by what still lay concealed and unthought in it and which unfolds its hidden power in our present. Dwelling more atten- tively in language and what speaks in it, we may yet appropriate the tradition more fully and therein find ourselves beyond its epochal self-closure, able to think and to say finitude nonmetaphysically. NOTES 1. The falsification lies in the methodic reduction of the virtual infinity of living language to a closed synchronic system of binary opposition and internal difference of arbitrary signs, giving language the closure and determinateness necessary for it to be the material object region ( in the sense defined by Husserl and still preserved by Heidegger in Being and Time) of a science. 2.

Such a view is most visible in Anaximander and then in Heraclitus, for whom 67</page><page sequence="30">logos and op-position ( enatios : the warrior, who is such by taking up a position and bringing himself to a stand over against his op-ponent) or strife are, paradoxically, the same (see Heraclitus, Frs. 8, 10, 51, 53, 80). Kosmos was here, I submit, a transcendental sense (see Heidegger's discussion of "world" in "The Origin of the Work of Art") : the open lightedness of aletheia within which what it is free to emerge into and abide in presencing a while together, an open which is not itself ontic (recall Heraclitus, Fr. 108, that the one thing that is wise is "separated from all things," hoti sophon esti panton kechorismenon) because it is itself the condi- tion of possibility of being present (i.e., of being) and of being known. Only in the ontotheology of Christian metaphysics has it for the first time a fully ontic sense as the closed totality (i.e., "world" in Saint Paul's sense) of creatures posited extrinsic to the transcendent creator. 6. See A. P. D. Mourelatos, The Route of Parmenides (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1970) . 7. "Route," hodos , is a one-way, goal-directed journey, a task to be accom- plished stage by stage, where, as Mourelatos shows, the image is under the control of the motif of Odysseus's return home. 8. IE r * krie-r to separate, to decide, is reflected in L cernere , to pass through a sieve, to distinguish or discern, to decide, with pp. cretus , from whence the adj. certus : decided, fixed, appointed, determined, sure. From the Latin, E derives cer- tain, concern, discern, dis crete, discriminate, and crime (compare Gr. krisis, a sifting, a trial, a judgment, with adj. kritikos , able to discern, to judge, and krites, judge - which, while post-Homeric, suggest *krei- might already itself have had a legal-juridical force); crisis and critic derive to E from the Gr.; and E criterion derives from Gr. kriterion , a judgment. Only in the light of the precedent of the Parmenidean legal action against what-is are we able to understand the quid juris of Kant's deduction of the transcendental-logical categories or Aristotle's kategoria , from kategorein, to accuse or bring someone to task for something in the presence of everyone, itself from kata. f against, and agoreuein, to harangue (from agora , assembly, ult. from ageiny to drive, to do, from which E act and agent derive) . 9. The real must be (if it is to be finally satisfactory to mind) akineton , for kinesis would be an ek-stasis, a staying or standing out or away from its proper place. Kinesis as ecstatic egress from proper place (i.e., a sense opposite to that of the Parmenidean hodos as route home, so that Aristotle, trying to make physis visible as genesis and as arche of kinesis , tries to subvert the Parmenidean trope by treating physis itself as a hodos, Ph. 193B. 2) . like L existere/existentia (Kahn, "The Greek Verb To Be' and the Concept of Being," p. 256), falls to the Parmenidean critique: one could not consummate such a "route," leading to what is not, because "you could not even single out the goal" (2.8). Only when the being of what-is comes to be understood as a transcendent creator's producing a thing out of nothing, to which the creature ever tends by its finitude, is "existence" an appropriate way to understand the presence of what is present. 10. The verb can be read as either passive or middle - the logos is at once the op-positional self-gathering of each thing and, as common (Frs. 1, 2, 50), the transcendent measure of all. 11. See Heidegger, "The Way Back into the Ground of Metaphysics" (1949) and "Letter on Humanism" (1947), now in Wegmarken , Gesamtausgabe , 1.9. 12. The point has been too long obscured by the mistaken tendency to misread Kant epistemologically, as a response to Hume, taking far more seriously than we should the remark in the Prolegomena (the regressive analytic method of which begs the Humean question, while the radically different synthetic method of the 68</page><page sequence="31">Critique itself does not centrally address itself to Hume at all, such that he is present mainly as an example of dogmatic skepticism) that it was Hume who awakened Kant from his dogmatic slumbers. Examinations of Kant's precriticai development (see de Vleeschauwer, The Development of Kantian Thought , and Polonoff, Force , Cosmos , and Monads) suggest, rather, that he awakened himself. He in a way announced his own awakening in 1766 in Dreams of a Spiritseer Ex- plained Through the Dreams of Metaphysics. 13.

A. Hofstadter (New York: Harper and Row, 1971), pp. 25-30, sees in this analogy of physis and of techne as a human production of a thing of use, where material is formed and used and used up in accord with the end or use man holds in view in advance, and in the way in which hyle and eidos are are distinguished and interrelated through this analogy, yet another assault upon the integrity of the thing. Aristotle, also, of course, thought physis as an autonomous given which is itself erotic, is itself a hodos (Ph. 193B. 12) toward full Parmenidean being, pro- ducing or setting itself in work, ergon, energeia (with time, place, and motion a measure of its self-consummation ) . The divine is, there, pure Parmenidean being, holding its telos in itself, entelecheia , purely circling back into itself and so moving things only by being the object of eros (Meta. 1072 A. 26-29; 1072 B. 3). 17. Kahn, "The Greek Verb 'To Be' and the Concept of Being, pp. 255t. See above, n. 9. 18. Aristotle's Greek cannot, of course, express a distinction between essence and existence (for "to be" is of itself to be definite, delimited, a what): see A. C. Graham, " 'Being' in Linguistics and Philosophy: A Preliminary Inquiry," Foun- dations of Language , vol. 1 (1965), pp. 223-31; Fr. J. Owens, The Doctrine of Being in the Aristotelian Metaphysics (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1963), pp. 289, 292, 309, 359. The distinction, in Thomas, partly reflects the radical dislocation of sense occasioned by translation from Greek to Latin - translations which were often mediated by Arabic and were always oriented toward the earlier-known logical treatises. Thomas also, of course, used the distinction of essence and existence polemically, to safeguard the radical transcendence of the creator. 19. Summa Contra Gentiles , I. 54.4.

With this concept-metaphor, appearing already in the essay on differentia- tion of regions of space ( 1768) , Kant anticipates the Husserlian analysis (differently developed in Heidegger, Gadamer, and Derrida) of intentional-act horizons and their correlative object horizons of determinate determinability, interlocking finally in the world as horizon of all horizons.

It should be noted that Kant does not in these passages, or m the passage from the Opus postumum , say that the Ding an sich is the Gegenstand taken in another respect. He carefully uses, instead, Ding and Objekt , and he has something very different in view in B. xviiin. when he speaks of viewing the Gegenstand from two different points of view. 38.

See Heidegger, Hegel's Concept of Experience (New York: Harper and Row, 1970), where Heidegger is clearly sympathetic to the Hegelian phenomeno- logical method, apart from its culmination in a translucently rational self-presence absolved of finitude, providing a fully Parmenidean telos for history as the hodos to that consummation, such that history would be thereby made visible as a closed rational whole. 48.
