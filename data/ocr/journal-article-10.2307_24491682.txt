<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anthropology of Death: A Preliminary Overview Tong Chee Kiong Department of Sociology, National University of Singapore Anne L. Schiller Department of Anthropology, Ithaca College, USA I Writing in 1913, anthropologist W.H.R. Rivers remarked that "few customs of mankind take so firm a hold of his imagination as his modes of disposing of the bodies of his dead" (1913:480). Rivers' observation continues to be borne out by an ever-expanding ethnographic record. In past and present-day societies, from the most technologically simple to the most complex, the majority of the world's peoples appear to have devised some type of ritualized response to the physical cessation of life. Archaeological findings have revealed that even very early men possessed techniques for disposal of the dead. The archaeological record, for example, includes evidence of Neanderthal burials, which incorporated the interment of animal bones and flint tools alongside corpses (Campbell, 1992:419). In many cases, bodies were arranged along an east west axis, perhaps suggesting a possible association with the rising or setting sun (ibid:422). Soil samples collected in the late-1960s at one 60,000 year-old burial at the Shanidar Cave in Iraq also led some archaeological researchers to other unforeseen breakthroughs. The samples revealed extremely high levels of pollens yielded by varieties of flowers that are employed for medicinal purposes by peoples of the region today. It was later determined that the pollen distribution could not have been random; masses of flowers had been arranged in the grave, presumably by the dead man's companions. On the basis of evidence from the Shanidar site, as well as from several locations at which men and women were buried in foetal positions, some scholars have suggested that early man may not only have practised burial rites but also that he might have associated these rites with beliefs in an afterlife as well: the Shanidar blossoms may have been added to the grave to restore the buried man's health in the next life, and the arrangement of corpses in foetal positions may evidence a belief that the deceased would be somehow "reborn" (ibid:424). Advances in technology generally have often seen the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques for the preservation of corpses. Archaeological research on the celebrated mortuary rites of Egyptian royals of the Old and New Kingdom Periods, specifically the practice of mummification, has revealed the importance that members of these societies placed upon processing remains in an attempt to accommodate the deceased's supposed needs in the afterlife. For example, extra heads made of painted stone were sometimes left in tombs; if the deceased's natural head fell off due to decay, he or she would have a readily available "spare" (Wenke, 1984:296). Tomb paintings suggest that human hearts were left inside torsos in anticipation of a moment when the organ would be weighed against a feather, revealing whether the deceased's sins weighed too heavily to render the deceased</page><page sequence="2">2 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science eligible for eternal life (ibid:297). In the modern West, in particular the contemporary United States, where techniques for the chemical preservation of bodies have eclipsed even the best Egyptian efforts, many early manufacturers of embalming supplies, including the "Egyptian Chemical Company" and the "Egyptian Embalming Company", sought to be identified with those less advanced but more romanticized traditions (Habenstein and Lamers, 1955:348). At the same time, however, interest in the mechanics of those ancient techniques has not entirely lapsed: Summun, a company based in western United States recently applied to patent a mummification process that its inventors claim will "allow you to leave this life in as beautiful a manner as you came in". Corpses are not only preserved, they are also protected in decorated containers known as mummiforms. For those individuals who seek to forestall decomposition entirely, still other methods of preservation are available. As part of the "cryogenic" process, corpses are dipped in liquid nitrogen shortly after death, then stored in extreme cold for prolonged periods with the goal of the body's eventual reanimation. Interestingly, in both these cases, attention appears to be directed almost entirely away from the fate of the deceased's soul. Thus, the rather dramatic attempts of the members of some societies to preserve physical remains poses a provocative counterpoint to the practices of other cultures, including several Hindu and Buddhist ones that avow the complete destruction of corpses as a means to liberate human souls. Just as death and treatment of the dead have captured the popular imagination generally, so too have they held an especial appeal for the distinctly sociological one. Social scientists and historians have long sought to understand the deeper social and cultural implications of these most private, and at the same time most public, of human experiences. Sociologists and anthropologists, in particular, have insisted that man's myriad varieties of eschatological beliefs and methods of disposal can only be understood as generalized social responses that render the experience of death more manageable and more interprétable. These specific social responses are in turn themselves interpreted by students of mankind. So fruitful have researchers in these two sister disciplines found the study of death and mortuary practices that "death as a social problem" has lately enjoyed a veritable ground swell of scholarly attention. Nevertheless, it is important to note that for both sociologists and anthropologists, current ethnographic interest in death is less a new direction of study than it is an exciting time of bringing fresh analytical paradigms to bear on a facet of human existence that has in many ways consistently proven central to both disciplines. Human deathways have long commanded a prominent place in the development of social theory. At least since the latter years of the nineteenth century, social scientists have published specifically and extensively on the topic of death. Several early theorists, in fact, accorded death and treatment of the dead extremely prominent places in their theoretical enterprises. One was Edward Tylor, author of Primitive Culture (1873). Another was James Frazer, who in addition to his well known volume The Golden Bough (1890), subsequently wrote The Belief in Immortality and the Worship of the Dead (1913) followed by a three volume set on The Fear of the Dead in Primitive Religion (1933-1936). While both men's theories may be classed into the broad category of social evolutionism, they nevertheless sought to use data on death and death-related practices to make somewhat different points. According to Tylor, who had a particular interest in the evolution of religious belief, attempts to</page><page sequence="3">The Anthropology of Death: A Preliminary Overview • 3 explain death and to account for death-like states, such as sleep and trance, were crucial to the origins of religion among primitive peoples. In Tylor's words: "It seems as though thinking men, as yet at a low level of culture, were deeply impressed by two groups of biological problems. In the first place, what is it that makes the difference between a living body and a dead one; what causes waking, sleep, trance, disease, death? In the second place, what are those human shapes which appear in dreams and visions?" (1891). To account for these conditions, Tylor hypothesized that savage man developed the notion of the "ghost-soul", then subsequently extended it to include animals and objects. From further contemplations with regard to the fate of souls, primitive men developed the notion of providing the dead souls with goods that might be useful to them in the next life. Eventually, as part of man's efforts to provision souls, rituals of human sacrifice evolved: "Men do not stop short at the persuasion that death releases the souls to a free and active existence, but quite logically proceed to assist nature, by slaying men in order to liberate their souls for ghostly uses. Thus arises one of the most widespread, distinct, and intelligible rites of animistic religion, that of funeral human sacrifice for the service of the dead" (ibid:13). Frazer was interested in certain commonalities in the religious practices of savages and civilized men, namely the practice of propitiating the souls of the dead. In his view, "the worship of the human dead has been one of the commonest and most influential forms of natural religion, perhaps the commonest and most influential of all" (1913:113). Another focus of his investigations was the relationship between the deaths of so-called "divine kings" and beliefs concerning the fertility of the communities from which they originated. Early British anthropologists' interests in the "psychological" dimensions of eschatological beliefs and mortuary rites, i.e. their intellectual and emotional appeal for individuals, was paralleled by the emerging interests of French social scientists in their social import. According to Emile Dürkheim, rituals, including mortuary observances, had the primary effect of revigorating social cohesion and renewing common social values. While death-related issues figured only marginally in his classic volume on The Elementary Forms of the Religions Life (1915), he did draw from ethnographic data on the mortuary customs of Australian Aborigines in suggesting that the concept of the soul and participation in ancestor-cults may have been modelled after indigenous notions of divinity, rather than the reverse (1961:81-82). It was left to Durkheim's students to exploit the fecund topic of death more directly. One of these students was Robert Hertz. The manner in which Hertz went on to develop his mentor's theories concerning the relationship between rituals and social cohesion has had tremendous influence on many subsequent analyses of death-related behaviours. Hertz focused his attention on the practice of secondary disposal of the dead, which usually implies an initial burial, a later exhumation, and the eventual reburial or reinterment of remains in ossuaries or elsewhere. In relating mortuary practices to popular eschatology, Hertz made the important observation that in some societies, death is considered a process rather than an instantaneous occurrence. To some extent, the beginning, and certainly the end, of this process is socially defined. While recognizing that different societies place varying degrees of emphasis on various stages in this process, Hertz himself accorded particular attention to the "transition period" of the rites, a stage known in the work of his contemporary Van Gennep as the "liminal" phase of rites of passage. As Huntington and Metcalf</page><page sequence="4">4 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science suggested in their illuminative study entitled Celebrations of Death, Hertz's essay offered dual points of analytical departure, pointing at once to the "societal crisis" provoked by a death, particularly the death of socially important individuals, as well as to a certain parallelism between the condition of the body and the condition of the soul (1979:65-67). Later scholars who seized upon and expanded the functionalist side of Hertz's argument have included Goody (1962) and Bloch (1971). Scholars who have teased out and applied the symbolic side of Hertz's argument in subsequent studies have included Douglas (1970), and Huntington and Metcalf themselves (ibid:16). Yet another important addition to the anthropological literature on death came with the publication of Bloch and Parry's edited volume on Death and the Regeneration of Life (1982). In their challenging theoretical introduction to that volume, the authors drew upon older sources, in particular Frazer and Hertz, in novel ways that synthesized and expanded upon much of what is useful in both the British and the French sociological traditions with regard to the study of death. Bloch and Parry's basic thesis is that in many cultures, death is interpreted or understood to be a source of life, and mortuary observances are therefore often permeated by symbols of rebirth and regeneration. At the same time they note: "Neither that which is regenerated nor the symbolic means by which regeneration occurs can ... be taken as self-evident" (1982:9). Their novel insight leads the authors to take many provocative stances with regard to the analysis of mortuary symbology, arguing, for example, that biological reproduction serves as a rather ambiguous symbol, and that sexuality, in particular female sexuality, may, in fact, be ritually elaborated as a phenomenon that is antithetical to fertility (ibid:19). Generally speaking, in developing approaches to the study of death, ethnologists and ethnographers have cast their nets widely, incorporating data from a wide range of cultures. Readers of the present volume may be most interested in those studies which concern Southeast Asian societies specifically. Of the sources cited above, only the accounts by Hertz and by Metcalf deal with Southeast Asian deathways in a sustained fashion, although it should be noted that Bloch worked among a Malagasy people which apparently had ancient historical ties to Southeast Asia. Within the past 25 years, however, the number of scholars of Southeast Asian studies who have contributed to the ethnography of death, either through monographs or articles, has indeed grown rapidly. Clearly, not all can be mentioned here. Nevertheless, interested readers are referred especially to the works of Boon (1974), Fox (1973), Geertz (1973), Metcalf (1982), Rosaldo (1984), Traube (1986), and Volkman (1985). The present collection seeks to enrich this ethnographical effort even further. II This volume comprises a collection of eight papers united by the common theme of Southeast Asian mortuary practices. It is entitled Social Constructions of Death because death, as noted by Huntington and Metcalf, cannot merely be understood as an event marked by a haphazard assemblage of ceremonies and activities. Rather, it is one followed by reactions that are both meaningful and expressive. Beyond being a natural fact, death is a culturally-constructed idea: "In all societies, regardless of</page><page sequence="5">The Anthropology of Death: A Preliminary Overview • 5 whether their customs call for festive or restrained behaviour, the issue of death throws into relief the most important cultural values by which people live their lives and evaluate their experiences. Life becomes transparent against the background of death and fundamental social and cultural values are revealed" (Huntington and Metcalf, 1979:2). Within the geographical context of Southeast Asia specifically, this collection presents contributions dealing with the deathways and eschatological beliefs of peoples of Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam and three of the islands of Indonesia. Despite wide variation between the cultural practices of the groups described herein, we have nevertheless identified certain oft-recurring themes within these papers, including the association of death with birth and marriage, the continuity of life, transaction, the social consequences of ritual behaviour, and ritual change. The first of these themes, the close association between birth, marriage, and death, expresses itself in a variety of culturally distinct ways. For example, among the Rembong, marriage and death have an analogous relationship, as both are integrally tied to the creation of a complete being. Similarly, among the Nage, death is viewed as an inversion of birth. Among the Chinese of Singapore, birth rituals seem to follow patterns similar to death rituals: just as corpses are buried, so, too, are placentae. The Chinese conception is one that understands death as the release of a soul which is then reincarnated into a new life. A related concept is embedded in the birth and death rituals of the Vietnamese. The notion that death is related to rebirth is not unique to Southeast Asian societies, of course. As Bloch and Parry suggest, the promise of rebirth is often used in many cultures to negate the finality of death. Fertility symbols are prominent in death rituals because of the conception of death as a source of life. Through a manipulation of the ambiguous concept of time, death can be successfully harnessed to ensure regeneration (ibid:10-ll). The second of the aforementioned themes, continuity and the constant recycle of life, is embedded in virtually every contribution to this volume. The Chinese, for example, conceive of a homologous relationship between the worlds of the living and the dead, and events in one world have repercussions in the other. Likewise, the Rembong believe that a person has two souls, a concrete soul which is the social person, and an abstract soul which is a part of the collectively of Rembong afterlife. For the Ngaju, the ritual of tiwah, or secondary burial, transports the dead to an Upperworld where he or she may continue to exert an influence on descendants' lives. Death indeed bears upon the living. As Waterson succinctly notes in this volume, "Death is the quintessential expression of sociability". Death rituals must therefore be viewed as culturally heightened activities; they conflate, refract, and highlight a people's most important values. Even those values which are not always immediately apparent, explicit, or understood are revealed. Here one might recall Leach's suggestion that rituals denote the communicative aspects of behaviour. Rituals "say things" about how society conceives of itself: "Ritual action and belief alike are to be understood as forms of symbolic statements about the social order" (Leach 1965:14). For anthropologists, much of what is interesting about death rituals is that they help us understand the social organization and institutions of the living. The rituals not only reveal social relationships but also their very enactment mediates the dynamics of group relations, allowing members to define and redefine their allegiances within the group. Thus, in Torajan society, the elaborate pig exchanges and buffalo</page><page sequence="6">6 • Southeast Asian journal of Social Science sacrifices are part and parcel of economic arrangements in the world of the living. Similarly, the various papers in this volume show that death for the Chinese, the Rembong, and the Ngaju, is part of a status game played out by the living. Death must be consistent with the larger socio-cultural value system of a society, whether in kinship, marriage, or economic networks. It is only within this context that the elaborate and often very expensive rituals make any sense. To extract oneself from performing these ceremonies is not just to sever a relationship with the dead, but more importantly, to risk excommunicating oneself from the community. Death rituals must be understood within the context of the total transactions in a society, and not merely as isolated events. These transactions occur at two levels: first, between the living and the dead, and second, between individuals and groups within a society. In many of the papers presented in this volume, whether dealing with the Torajan or Nage, Chinese or Tai, we observe a preponderance of gift-giving and countergifts between the living and the dead. This idea of reciprocal relationships is vital, as it functions to provide corporateness to the group and contributes to the maintenance of continuity. Several papers included here deal with the social consequences of ritual behaviour for the individuals and groups within societies. Death rituals unite social groups by bringing them together for a common purpose: to bury the dead. The rituals thus invoke the conventions of exclusivity, delineating the group from outsiders. At the same time, as can be seen clearly from the examples of Rembong, Torajan, and Chinese death rites, the very enactment of the rituals allow for the social differentiation of the group and the articulation of divisions within it. Treatment of the dead, whether among the Rembong, Nage, Torajan, or Chinese, has an instrumental quality; an attempt to manage the soul and to bound the spirit in such a way that they can be used by the living. Correctly managed, death can offer great benefits to the sponsors of ritual. Thus, while it is true that rituals are intended to expiate the sins and pollution of the dead and to transfer souls to the Afterworld, the whole process is enacted for the benefit of the living. It is not, however, purely instrumental. While it can be argued that ritual behaviour and the conception of the afterworld is anthropomorphic and egocentric, rituals must be understood as attempts to deal with the constant tension between individual self-interest and the maintenance of ethical and moral imperatives of what is considered to be good for society. Finally, many of these papers deal with ritual and social change, from the impact of canonical religions on indigenous practices to the role of the state in trying to manage religious groups, and to the impact of modernization and tourism on ritual behaviour. Different groups have adopted different strategies in dealing with change, modifying, adapting, deleting, and reinterpreting their rituals to reflect evolving or new social structures. III The contents of this volume are as follows. First, Maribeth Erb explores the analogous relationship between marriage and death among the Rembong of western Flores. She argues that marrying and dying are in actuality part of the same process, involving an initial separation of an individual from encompassment on the one hand and the</page><page sequence="7">The Anthropology of Death: A Preliminary Overview • 7 individual's eventual reabsorption into the collectivity on the other. Looking at the death rituals as a process of exchange, the Rembong use rituals to manipulate status/ power relationships within the community, as well as to ensure the continuity of both the individual and the group. Rembong society, due to the seeming structural dis continuity of asymmetrical marriage alliance and achieved rather than ascribed status, is in a state of constant tension between "equality and hierarchy", and "individualism and holism". These tensions are played out and resolved through ritual performance. Employing the concepts of concrete (individual) and abstract (community) souls, Erb demonstrates that for the Rembong, death and life have to do with extracting a person from the community (separation), differentiating him as an individual (freedom and equality), and finally reabsorbing him into the collectivity (community and hierarchy). Rituals provide the vehicle for creating a "complete" being. The second contribution is from Greg Forth. In discussing his work among the Nage, another people of Flores, Forth deals with many of the same themes as Erb. Like the Rembong, the Nage envision death as a process of separation and reincorporation. However, the Nage rituals, unlike those of the Rembong, emphasize separation rather than incorporation. The Nage view dead souls as undesirable entities which, through ritual cleansing, marking boundaries, and discarding objects, must be removed from the community. There is also a lack of eschatological ideas in Nage society regarding the soul's final destination. Through an analysis of number symbols and directions for placement of the dead, Forth suggests that Nage death rituals represent completion rather than continuity. Part of the reason, he argues, may be linked to the Nage idea of the close association of death and newly-dead cannibalistic witches, as well as the implicit identification of dead souls with malevolent free floating spirits. The death rituals of the Toraja of Sulawesi have lately been the subject of much attention by Indonesianists. The rituals have also generated a great deal of interest among tourists to the island. In writing about contemporary death feasts of the Sa'dan Toraja of upland Sulawesi, Kathleen Adams incorporates a discussion of tourism's important impact on the enactment of these rituals. She describes how the celebrants' growing familiarity with government bureaucracy, their exposure to the mass media, and their encounters with tourists, and even anthropologists, have fostered a rethinking of traditional mortuary observances, leading to changes in popular notions concerning what comprises a successful funeral. Roxana Waterson, too, writes about the death rituals of the Sa'dan Toraja. Her focus, however, concerns how the rituals provide contexts for social relationships and for economic arrangements among the living. According to Waterson, the analysis of Sa'dan death ritual lends insight into the kinship structure that undergirds Torajan life. She suggests that pig exchanges and buffalo sacrifices are integral features of a ceremonial credit and debt system that is a part of Torajan social identity and underscores relationships from which one can only extract oneself at the expense of severing kin ties. Funerals are therefore quintessential expressions of sociability — games of status played out by the living over a long period of time. Anne Schiller's paper confronts the relationship between politics, society, and religion among the Ngaju Dayaks of Central Kalimantan, Indonesian Borneo. Using the example of a controversy, which was sparked by an article on headhunting and death ritual that appeared in the Indonesian newsmagazine, Tempo, she discusses</page><page sequence="8">8 • Southeast Asian Journal of Social Science the role and impact of a newly-recognized religious bureaucracy in resolving disputes concerning religion. Through an analysis of tiiuah or secondary treatment of the dead, she illuminates the dynamics of religious transformation and offers insight into the changing cultural identity of the Ngaju Dayaks. She suggests that among the Ngaju, the reinterpretation of the religious past, in particular of former elements of religious practice, is insinuated in a growing cultural awareness movement in interesting ways. With H. Leedom Lefferts' paper, our geographic focus moves from the Indonesian islands to other regions of Southeast Asia. Lefferts is interested primarily in the appeal of Theravada Buddhism to the common people of Southeast Asia. Drawing upon the techniques of ethno-archaeology, he compares Tai-Dam and Tai-Lao funeral rituals to shed light on the reasons behind, and the behavioural consequences of, the adoption of Buddhism. In Tai culture, textiles are key symbols used in death rituals as well as fundamental items of consumption. Lefferts examines the production, use, and exchange of textiles in rituals in order to understand the social organization of Tai-Dam and Thai-Lao societies, as well as their cultural transformations. While Buddhism is often described as a male religion, Lefferts suggests that women many have an important role in the conversion of some Tai groups to Theravada Buddhism, as women are the producers of ritual cloth. Tong Chee Kiong raises the issue of why a purportedly pragmatic people, the Singapore Chinese, spend great amounts of money to enact funerary rituals. By examining the material and ideal interests of the different individuals and groups involved in the performance of the rituals, it becomes clear that mortuary observances are integrally tied to the transfer of property, authority, and status. Moreover, it is not simply the inheritance of property but also the potential for greater benefits that motivates descendants. Ancestors are active participants in their relationships with the living; failure to ensure the comfort of the dead will incur displeasure, whereas correct propitiation will result in gifts of wealth, prosperity, and good health. Tong argues that while there is clearly calculated self-interest in the performance of rituals, ethical imperatives, too, are often invoked. He suggests that rituals must be understood as means to mediate the constant tension between the desire of an individual to achieve egocentric ends and the individual's attempt to fulfill his social obligations to the family group and community. Finally, Chanh Long Phan's contribution examines the onthology and divine powers of human souls as well as rituals associated with birth and death in order to lend insight into the daily lives and philosophy of the Vietnamese people. The Vietnamese concept of the souls is one of self-motion, incorporeality and immortality. Chanh suggests that this concept of the human souls is uniquely Vietnamese as, unlike Buddhism, there is an absence of notions of karma, rebirth and salvation in Nirvana. Rather, the Vietnamese soul is believed to return to the realm of the ancestors following the performance of death rituals, and because of their divine powers, continue to affect their descendant's lives.
