<plain_text><page sequence="1">SECTION i PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS By T. jV. Ramachandran Joint Director .General of Archaeology . I am grateful indeed to the Executive Committee of the Indian History Congress for electing me as a President of Section I (Ancient History) of the nineteenth session of the Congress. We are on the threshold of rediscovering ourselves. The gaps in our knowledge of India's past are shrinking, thanks to many-sided efforts of archaeo- logists and scholars and the frontiers of our knowledge are ever on the increase. During the past three years many important discoveries have been made in the domain of prehistoric and protohistoric archaeo- logy. But as time would not permit me to refer to them all, only the most outstanding ones are being mentioned here. The efforts of Messers. H. D. Sankalia, M. N. Deshpande, S. R. Rao, V. S. Wakanker and K. V. Soundara Rajan have brought to light a large number of palaeolithic sites in the State of Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh; Dr. Subba Rao has explored the Mahi Valley in Gujarat and put on the map several paleolithic and microlithic sites; Shri K. V. Soundara Rajan has shown that the Nagarjunakonda valley in Andhra-desa, otherwise famous for its Buddhist remains, was also occupied by the Palaeolithic Man. However, the most remar- kable is the discovery of chopperchopping tools of the 'Sohan' type in the valleys of the Beas and Sutlej, made variously by Shri Olaf Prüfer, Drs. D. Sen and Y. D. Sharma and Shri B. B. Lai. Shri Lai has not only collected a larger number of specimens, but has worked out their correlation with the local river-terraces and has also indicated that future work in the region is likely to place these tools in a well-defined Glacial and Interglacial sequence. That the par- tition of the country in 1948 did not leave any site of the 'Sohan' type on our side of the border need not upset us any more !</page><page sequence="2">54 INDIAN HISTORY COtfGRÈSS Prof. Zeuner's study of the microliths from the Teris of South India has clearly established that they belonged to about 4000 B.C. or even earlier. In Eastern India Shri B. B. Lai has brought to light a very important microlithic industry at Birbhanpur in West Bengal, which is both non-geometric and pre-pottery - factors which point to its high antiquity. The same scholar has shown, on the basis of typology and associated pottery, that the Neolithic culture of Eastern India was different from that of South India. In the domain of protohistory many discoveries of far-reach- ing significance have been made. Excavations at Lothal near Ahmedabad by Shri S. R. Rao and explorations in the neighbour ing region by him, Shri P. P. Pandya and others have established beyond doubt that the Harappa culture extended to the south-east much beyond the confines of the Indus Valley. Likewise, Dr. Y. D. Sharma's work in the Sutlej valley has shown that Kotla Nihang was only one of the many Harappan sites in the north-east. His excavations at Rupar have not only revealed the existence of a large Harappan township, with a cemetery close by, but have provided a firm sub-stratum for the dating of the Painted Grey Ware culture . One may also recall here the discovery of several Harappa and Painted Grey Ware sites in the Ghaggar valley made by Shri A. Ghosh some years ago. All these discoveries enabale us to understand the extent and diffusion of the Harappa culture in a much better way than it was possible in the early fifties. In Central India, the work of Drs. Sankalia, Deo, Dikshit and Subba Rao and of Sarvashri Thapar, Deshpande, Wakanker and Banerjee has brought to light a chalcolithic culture characterized by black-on- red pottery, microliths and a few objects of copper or bronze. Of the several sites belonging to this culture, particular mention may be made of Maheshvara, Nevasa, Prakash, Bahal, Jorwe, Tripury Nasik and Nagda. Though much more work is necessary to fix Up the chronological horizon of this culture, available evidence goes to show that at its maturity it was post-Harappan. In the upper Ganga valley a firm sequence of protohistoric cultures has been established as a result of the explorations and excavations carried out by Shri B. B. Lai. In the first place, he has shown that the</page><page sequence="3">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 55 copper hoards, consisting of swords, harpoons, anthropomorphic figures, etc., belonged not to the Aryans, as Professors Stuart Piggott and Heine Geldern believed but tò a non-Aryan people who were in occupation of the valley before the arrival of the Aryans€ More interesting, however, is the evidence regarding the Aryans themselves. And here one may recall briefly the main results of the excavation carried out by Shri Lai at Hastinapura on the banks of the Ganga. At this site five occupational Periods were identified. From bottom upwards, Period I was characterized by an ochre-coloured ware, which, on the basis of evidence from other sites like Bahadarabad, Rajpur, Parsu, etc., seems to be associated with the Copper Hoard culture of the pre-Aryans. The prominent industry of Period II was the Painted Grey Ware-bowls and dishes of fine-grained grey ware with designs painted in black pigment. The- people dwelt in houses made of mud or mud-bricks: they lived mainly on agriculture and breeding cattle, amongst which particular mention may be made of the horse (Equus caballus ). Copper was the chief metal, and cylindrical weights of chert and jasper were used for weighing co.iimo dities. As time passed, there occurred a large-scale flood in the Ganga, as a result of which a considerable portion of the townsnip was washed away and the site was abandoned for some time to come. On the basis of pottery, coins, etc., found in the subsequent periods the Painted Grey Ware culture at Hastinapura has been dated c. 1100 (or earlier) to c. 800 B.C. The Painted Grey Ware has been found by Shri Lai at over fifty sites including Panipat, Kurukshetra, Mathura, Indraprasta, etc., most of which are associated with the Mahãbhãrata story. Again, the flood at Hastinapura finds a mention in the great epic. Painted Grey Ware settlements have also been found by Shri A. Ghosh along the banks of the Ghaggar - the Sarasvati of the Vedic literature. Thus, all evidence goes to suggest that the Painted Grey Ware culture belonged to the Arynas who entered India some time in the second half of the second millennium B. Gě) if not earlier. Indeed what has been achieved is but a fraction of what still remains to be done. For example, it is essential that a few Painted Grey Ware sites should be çxcavated totally so that we may get a</page><page sequence="4">56 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS more detailed picture of these Aryan settlements. Again, extensive explorations are necessary in order to locate sites which may throw light on the inter-relationship between the Painted Grey Ware and the Chalcolitnic ware of Central India. Equally essential is to ascer- tain the evolution and diffusion of the black-and-red ware of Ahar. It is hoped that these problems will be tackled as early as possible. In 1955, Dr. H. D. Sankalia continued the excavations at Nevasa and explored the Godavari and the Pravara valleys at several places. The explorations on these rivers have given a definite proof of two Stone Ages, viz., the "Early" Palaeolithic and the "Middle" Palaeo- lithic. It may be noted that this is the first time that such a well stratified evidence is available for the succession of these two Stone Age cultures. The excavations at Nevasa have given a succession of cultures from the Chalcolithic up to the fourteenth century. The important things in this cultural sequence are the fact that the Cha- lcolithic culture of Nevasa is identical in many respects with that of the polished-axe culture of Brahmagiri. As in Brahmagiri, the children adults were buried right in the habitation floor and at Nevasa so far 30 burials have been secured of whicr (2l are of children and 3 of adults. This is the first time tnat such evidence is available about the burial habits of the Chalcolithic people from this part of India. Another important feature which was detected in this season's excavations was a stratigraphical break suggested by weathered layer between the Cnalcolithic and the Early Historic (Sātavāhana). The Sātavāhana culture was not only well documented by a variety of finds, but this year Dr. Sankalia got further evidence of the Roman and Indo-Parthian contact in the shape of a copper or bronze dish with an ompholos in the centre and terracotta masks. Similar ob- jects have been found from the Indo-Parthian city at Taxila. Nevasa seems to be a very rich site, both in the Early Historic and the Chalcolithic cultures and if it is horizontally excavated, it is hoped full details about the way of life of people at these two periods shall be obtained. The excavations at Lothal in Ahmedabad District undertaken by Mr. S.R. Rao during the last two years have established beyond doubt that the Harappa culture extended as far south as the northern</page><page sequence="5">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 57 reaches of the Bombay State. More than a hundred Indus Seals and Sealings bearing animal motifs and Indus Script have been found at Lo thai. Painted pottery and other typical Harappan objects such as copper and bronze tools, beads of stone and gold, and chert blades and weights recovered in the course of the excavations indica- te the wealth of material equipment. Lothal was a full-fledged Harappa settlement (2500 B. G. to 1500 B. C.) on the Kathiawad coast carrying on extensive trade with Indus Valley Cities. The inhabitants manufactured terracotta sealings on a mass scale. The results of the excavation at the neighbouring site of Rangpur have shed new light on a dark age of Indian History. A continuous cultural sequence from 2Q00 B. G. to 800 B. G. without any break, has been obtained thus linking up the Harappa culture with the Black and Red Ware culture of the pre-Buddhistic period. Another contri- bution of Rangpur excavation is that it has demonstrated how a great flood was responsible for the destruction of the Harappa settlement. All the dwellings were built over brick platforms. Unlike in the Indus Valley itself, the Harappa culture in Saurashtra lingered on in a degraded form from 1500 B. G. to 1100 B. C. Subsequently it transformed itself by 1000 B. G. into another culture known as the Lustrous Red Ware Culture which still retained certain features of the Harappa culture. A distinct ceramic industry viz., the Black and Red Ware was also present as a variant of the Lustrous Red Ware. The latter Ware lost its lustre in due course as is demonstrated at Mota Machiala and both the wares moved in course of time into Central India and the Deccan. It has now become possible to establish a relationsnip between the Ghalcolithic cultures of the Deccan and Malwa plateau on the one hand and the Harappa culture on the other through the Lustrous Red Ware and Black and Red Ware cultures. Rangpur has thus provided missing links in the devolu- tion of Harappa culture and thrown new light on the circumstances leading to its survival in Saurashtra for four more centuries up to 1 100 B. C. gradually undergoing certain changes until at last it merged in the form of the Ghalcolithic cultures of the Kathiawad Peninsula, Central India and the Deccan with certain local variations, But all of them come from the same stock,</page><page sequence="6">58 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS Extensive exploration of Gujrat, Saurashtra and Kutch under- taken in the course of the last three years has resulted in locating as many as forty Harappa and post-Harappa sites in this region. These sites can be classified into four main groups based on the cultural phases of Rangpur, viz., Rangpur IIa (2000 - 1500 B.C.- - Harrappa Culture), Rangpur IIb (1500 B. G. - 1100 B. G.- Late Harappa), and Rangpur III-(1000 B. G. - 800 B. C. - Post-Harappa Lustrous Red Ware Culture). With the destruction of the main centres of their civilization the prosperity of the Harappans declined. This is revealed by the poor material equipment unearthed at late-Harappa sites like Lakhabaval, Amara and Somnath (excavated by the M.S. University and Saurashtra Archaeological Department). The Lust- rous Red Ware and the Black and Red Ware came into promi- nence between 1100 B. C. and 800 B. G. In the beginning of the first millennium B.C. the successors of Harappans who used copper and bronze axes, parallel-sided blades of chert, etc., and ceramie wares such as the Black and Red Ware and the Black-on-Red Painted Ware settled down at places like Ahar, Nagda, Prakasha, Jorwe, Nasik and Ujjain. Mr. N. R. Banerjee's excavation at Ujjain in 1955 was to obtain further evidence of the early periods of India's past in general and of Ujjain in particular. Ujjain's continuous history is known from the Rãmãyana , the Mahãbhãrata , Buddhist and other literature, the Periplas and from inscriptions. Its glory was sung by Kālidāsa. Above all, it is of singular interest to the archaeologist being located on the bank of the Siprā, a tributary of the Chambal CCharmanvatī) on the peripheral region of the currently known frontiers of the chalco- lithic culture. Such an ancient city could not but be affected by the chalcolithic settlers of the surrounding regions. To obtain evidence of its prehistoric or protohistoric past and in the hope of forging a link with the Indus culture, which as we saw above now extends as far south as Lothal in Saurashtra, excavation was taken up here as well as at Nagda, on the bank of the Chambal, 35 miles away from Ujjain. Work at Nagda revealed it to be an extensive and possibly fortfied outpost of the chalcolithic folk. And Ujjain, the famous ancient city, being so near could not, reasonably, have escaped the in-</page><page sequence="7">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 59 fluence of the inherently virile and expansive chalćolitbic folk. Work at Uujjan showed that the site was indeed occupied from about circa 700 B. G. to the Medieval Muslim period. Evidence of the chalco- lithic culture was rather straggling and inadequate in the excavated area proper, but the occurrence of chalcolithic culture in the region was not thereby ruled out, but positively indicated instead. Indian Art has been described as opening a simple yet delight- ful way into the timeless domain of the Indian spirit. Indian Art has an individuality of its own, one of rare aesthetic sense, combining skill, beauty and craftsmanship with durability and utility. The creations of Indian Art are not only noted for quantity but also for their quality. Indian Art-products are the results of man's urge to express himself or his divine self. Indian Art has a hoary past. The Indus Valley Civilization of the third millennium B. C. which is in fact the oldest civilization of India so far known by excavations, reveals a well-designed and highly artistic culture already at an ad- vanced stage of development, when stone and copper were used side by side. That the artists of the Indus Valley had fully grasped the essential elements of form and decoration is apparent in the patterns of painted pottery based on geometrical and animal forms and also in tne statuary figures of steatite, faience and clay. The art of metal casting as well as carvings in stone had also attained skilled development. At Mohenjo-Darö the earliest known Indian bronze statuette was discovered, which represents a remarkable figure of a dancing girl. Both sculpture and bronze were developed as charac- teristic art-forms at the very outset of Indian history. The creations of Indian Art, such as images, sculptures, seals and sealings as at Mohenjo Darò, are only the external manifesta- tions of internal experiences. Such being the case, as in language and speech so also in art, certain modes of expression or record were depicted. The most important among these methods are three, which have been continuing through the ageS-- (1) the Symbolic Method, (2) the Synoptic Method and (3) the Narrative. At the dawn of Indian Civilization as reflected in the Proto-Historic Art of the Indus Valley, we find that not only the Symbolic but also the Synoptic methods were so very popular that both are employed in plastic art</page><page sequence="8">60 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS and in pictograph and script. In Indus culture animals get the limelight. The seals and sealings from Mohenjo Darò and Harappa represent amidst pictographs animals special to India, such as the humped bull with its profound dewlap, the majestic elephant, the buffalo, the tiger, the rhinoceros and the antelope. The Vedic literature, whatever be its date, is still the earliest known literature of India. The Rig-Vedic idea that the bull does all the roaring to proclaim Dharma-Vijaya is caught up by the Mohenjo-Daro seals and sealings re- presenting the bull with its characteristic dewlap. That such a bull with its powerful physique bellows for all time to come the advent of a Great God ( Maho-Devah ) is the spirit of a few sealings from the Indus Valley of the third millennium B. G. where the bull is shown with three heads, one of the heads looking back, the second head which is centrally placed looking down and the third head looking ahead or stretched forward. The head looking behind indicates in synoptic language that the bull had roared and this relates to the past. The head looking down means that it is roaring and this indicates the present. The third head stretch forward or looking ahead means the bull will roar and this indicates the future. Thus the past, present and future stages of time are suggested by his three- headed bull. That this bull does not look up brings out the idea that it is concerned with the mortal world. This seal combined with another seal wherein the anthropomorphic figure of a God supposed to be Rudra as Mahâyogî seated amidst animals such as bull, elephant, rhinoceros, tiger, antelopes and among men and birds and fish brings out forcibly the ideas contained in the Rigvedic hymns. 4 'The thrice-bent bull goes on roaring that the Great God (is no longer in some invisible heavens but) has actually completely entered the mortals.' Such is the purpose in posing the God in the centre of the seal amidst the rhinoceros, the elephant, the buffalo, the bull, the tiger, antelopes, men, birds and fish and characterising it, or labelling it on the top by- pic tographic series. The seated God in this is cross-legged. He is Urdhavaretas in the state of penis erectum which stands for virility and poten- tiality. There are, stripes all over his body as we find to-day in the case</page><page sequence="9">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 61 of worshippers of Śiva or on the orientation of a Šyena-chiti altar. The God has more than three faces, perhaps four were meant, as we can clearly make out, and over these heads is set up a pair of buffalo's horns. Another Rik from the Rigu e da throws furtner light on the iconography of the God of this seal. ^ttïïî īrf^rt wwm I ïïSTFTt Sft*T: II c 'Brahma among Gods, a leader of poets, a Rishi among sages, a buffalo among animals, a hawk among vultures, axe among weapons, over the sieve goes Soma with a roar.' Such a Rigvedic description of the God, who among the Gods is the greatest, namely, Brahmā, who among the wise is an Arch-Rishi, who among animals is the buffalo, etc., is what we find echoed later on in the Puranic period when Lord Krishna in the Great song Bhagavad-Gitã (10th adhyãyá) announces his Svampa as 33PTT sfrfą: I vcķ m: I *TÏÏ°TÎ ^ I qftRf i ÏÏST^T*TÎ ^ ^ft I ŘWt W: I The fact that roaring or bellowing eternal truth for eternity was function assigned to the bull {Vrishabha) in Indian Art, is carried through the ages and immortalized by depicting it in MohenjoDaro seals and in the third century B. G. at Rampurva on one of the Asokan pillars and again depicting it on Jayastambhas of the Historic Period and crystallising it in the conception of the never failing announcer or attendant of the Gcd Rudra or Paśupati by making the bull the permanent vãhana of no less a God than Siva, who is also Rudra and Paśupati. Evene to-day when a temple God is taken out in procession a stud-bull issues out in front with a pair of drums on itś back announcing as it were by beat of drum the advent of the great God. As we walk through the ages, the bull emerges</page><page sequence="10">62 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS as an inevitable associate of the God Rudra. The God on Mohenjo- Daro seals has been described by the Vedas as ^5": THH h ^rf^TTfcT : The same has also been described in other hymns of the Rigveda as Brahma- by virtue of his possessing more faces and as Mahisha by virtue of his po- ssessing buffalo's horns. When we come to later times, the God has been deprived of nis horns but the bull wnich announced his glory has been made a never-failing associate. A visit to all Saivite shrines in Inc-ia will prove this. The penis erectum stage of 'Rudra Paśupati God of Mohenjo-Daro continued through the ages and took shape as the regular linga standing for Siva or the anthropomorphic form of Siva superposed on the background of a linga, such as we get in the lingo of Gudimallam of the second century B. G. The rhinoceros is yet another interesting animal of the Indus Valley Culture in association with this Pasupati cult. We must remember that rhinoceros is special to India. In the same way are the elephant, the tiger and the humped bull noticed on the seals. The rhinoceros is obviously the Vedic Var aha or the Tajna Varãha .■ who is described as the arch-router. The Vedas say in regard to mother earth that she was routed or pulled up by the Varāha CS V3 means 100 man-power, which can easily be attributed to the rhinoceros. Tne massive strength of the rhinoceros which lies in its snout and the conception of Yajna-Varãha as Ekašringī suggests that it was the rhinceros (Rhinoceros unicornis - the rhino with a single horn on the tip of its snout) that was contemplated and not the wild boar or pig as later iconography has describe^ and depicted, for the latter has only two side tusks from the gape cf its jaws. The occurrence of the tiger on the Paiupati Seal is significant in that it is also an Indian animal not known to Sumer, Elam, Mesopotamia and other WTest Asian contemporary cultures. The elephant also occurs on the Mohenjo-Daro seals and it is a very popular animal in Indian Art through the ages. The Vedic hymns described the elephant as an lb ha standing to announce the glory of the King:</page><page sequence="11">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION l) 63 In the third century B. G. we find that Emperor Aśoka makes use of the elephant by carving its figure boti: at Kalsi and at Dhauli, in the former as defiant and in tne latter as submissive to rhyme with the respectivr spirits of the places. At Dhauli the submissive mood of the elephant is because the King is lamenting the folly of his military expedition to Kalinka which resulted in bloodshed. At Kalsi the elephant is defiant with le^s slightly raised and trunk twisted because the spirit is one of putting down animal sacrifices for which the area was celebrated, as ancient Mashņār of the Aitareya Brāhmaņa. Other interesting finds relating to Indus Valley Culture that have a bearing on Hindu ritual and icono- grapny are the statuette of Tajamāna or the Performer of sacrifices like / isvamedha , toy carts and perforated pottery jars. The Tajamāna figure which obviously related to a royal performer of horse sacrifices shows the king as shaven in the upper lip, wearing new cloth ycjnopaoïta-wise, deco rated with circular gold discs ( rukma ), one on the head, another on the right, hand and a third on the neck as prescribed in the ritual of Vedic sacrifices. The toy-cart discovered at Mohenjo-Daro is neither big enough to be a regular cart nor small enough to be a toy-cart. It is a medium size such as would be utilised for carrying Soma plants into the Tajnašālā during the course of sacrifices. It appears that the biomorphs, natural and fanciful, of the Rig-Vedic poets, -wherein we have to include representations combining human and bestial forms -are replicas of tne zoomo rphs of the Indus valley seal engr- avers, modellers and sculptors. Indus valley seal designs nd figurines appear to be embodiments of the fancies of the Rig-Vedic poets. The minds of the Rig-Vedic people and the Indus valley people appear to have thought out on the same lines, as much in accepting animals, birds and beings as they are in realistic study as in integrating the. xi into āvešas or 'chimeras.' A pertinent example is the Maho-deva seal from Mohenjo-Daro described above. The Rig-Vedic pnet and the Indus valley artist have fancied and fashioned alike. Comparison with the ancient West Asian treatments of biomorphs not only emphasises that the differnće between the West Asian (Egyptian and Mesopotamian) conceptions and the Indus valley and the Řig-Vedic are fundamental but also establishes that the similarity of the Indus valley and Rig-Vedic conceptions is close and consequently certain,</page><page sequence="12">64 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS We noticed the statuette of a dancing girl at Mohenjo-Daro. That dance was a mode of expression of joy and had been a note-worthy feature of Indian Art through the Ages and this gets crystalized in the conception of Śiva as Natarāja. The most outstanding example of Indian bronzes is that of Natarāja illustrating the process of the creation and dissolution of the world in terms of dance and rhythm. The Natarāja image is one of the greatest pieces of Indian Art, the perfect visual image of Becoming , and an adequate completment and contrast to the cross-legged Mahāyogī&gt; Rudra &gt; Paśupati type of Being. The movement of the dancing figure is so balanced that while it fills all space it seems nevertheless to be at rest. Kalidasa, the immortal poet, who gave us the standards of life mentions that dance was to the Devas an ocular sacrifice, to the Great God Rudra it meant the division of his body into two and the location of Goddess Urna in one half, and to the world of variety and diversity, it was the sole s j urce of eternal delight. The Mohenjo-Daro dancing girl is secular in all respects but the bronze images of the later Periods are mostly inspired by religion. Between the proto-historic art of the Indus Valley and that of the Mauryans (4th century B.C.) there is a big gap awaiting to be filled by the actual remains of a material cuļture. A refined court art and archaic religious art came into being in the third century B. G. To the Guptas we owe a Golden Age of Indian art and the greatest creations of Indian art such as Naranārāyaņa, Gajedramokhsaudha Šeshanārā)£rja. South India abounds in megalithic monuments and urn burials which fjrm a distinct feature of its cultural heritage. Surface exploration in the District of Ghingleput having been completed, excavation of a few typical sites in Ghingleput District undertaken by Messers. V.D. Krishnaswami, K. R. Srinivasan, N. R. Banerjee K. V. Soundara Rajan and others at Sanur, Amirthamangalam and Kunnattur revealed interesting features in the construction of the megalithic tomb, the furnishing of the sepulchres and the modes of the disposal of the dead. The megalithic burial was a post-excarnated fragmentary and multiple burial. The grave goods included iron implements of offence and defence, objects of daily utility and ornaments, decorated shell ornaments, carnelian and terracotta beads besides the usual black and red pottery ware. Who the megalithic builders were, what their material culture is, to what period they do belong and whence they came are still problems awaiting solution. Though the dates pf these burials are ascribed to circa 2nd century B.G. at Brahmagiri, it</page><page sequence="13">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 65 quite possible they are of earlier origin and the recent results of excavation in the South afford ample evidence to their being ascribed to a much earlier date, say to 8th century B.C. Excavation of a few more sites might enlighten us in this regard. Exploration along the Cauvery basin by Sri Ballabh Saran eariy this year brought to light several sites including an Indo-Roman trading centre at Nattamedu in South Arcot District and a number of urn-burials (with and without megalithic appendages). A short exploration by Sri K. S. Ramachandran, in November 1956 along the Vaigai basin around Madurai brought to light a number of urn-burials without any apparent megalithic appendage and abandon- ed habitations. Notable among them are Palangunattam, a hamlet of Madakkulam near Madurai, Samanaitam and Nattamedu near Dom- bucherry, Madurai District. At Samanattam and Dombucherry unmis- takable black and red ware and megalithic black ware in association with painted black and red ware (and painted black ware at the former site) were discovered for the first time. The designs are poor imitations of the wavy lines of the Goimbatore megalithic wares and of the Andhra painted pottery unearthed at Chandravalli in Chitaldrug District, Mysore State in 1947. Since very near Nattamedu are to be found rude stone cairn circles and urnfields, we may in all probability be able to correlate the habitational sequence of Nattamedu with that of the prehistoric burials nearby and try to arrive at a sequence dating for the megalithic burials of Madurai District. The preliminary exploration of Asvamedha sites at Jagatgram (30 miles to the north west of Dehra Dun, Uttar Pradesh, and within a couple of miles from the rock-edicts of Asoka at Kalsi), where a king called Śila- varman, of the third century A. D., performed for the fourth time are Asvamedha sacrifice, was noticed in 1953. Subsequent excavations here by the Exploration Branch of the Department exposed remains of three sites where the king performed Asvamedhas . In addition to well-designed bricks in the orientation of the Syena hawk or eagle, with spread wings, bricks from the first site bore Sanskrit inscription in the Brāhmi script of the third century A.D. acquainting us with the information that the king left at the place the Chiti or the architectural remains of his fourth horse- sacrifice.</page><page sequence="14">66 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS The second site brought out a number of inscribed bricks containing verses in correct Anushtubh metre in the same language and script. The verses reveal the personality of the king as Vãrshanganya Yugešvara or Yugeśa and the lord of Yugaśaila. Varshanganya proclaims him as of Vrishahgaņa - Gotra, which is the sixtyninth Gotra referred to by the gra- mmarian Pāņini. The word Yugeśa means cthe lord of a Lustrum* and implies purification by sacrifice. The Brihat-Samhita refers to twelve such Yugesaś beginning with Vishnu and ending with Bhaga. It is therefore, interesting to note that by virtue of his performing the Aģvamedhas the king ranked himself with Vishnu and other Yugeśas as a fitting Yugeśa of this Yuga. Also, his performing the sacrifices at least four times brings out the comparison with the Greek or Roman Lustrum , which, as we know, was performed perio- dically (once in five years) for the purification of a nation or people. The term Yugaśaila , (Kalsi?) of which Šilāvarman is described as the king, was probably the name of his capital. The third site, showed the relics of another horse-sacrifice, performed bv the same king, in the shape of bricks arranged as a rhombus some of of which were again inscribed and bore his name. The sites face the Himalayas and the river Yamuna in its first descent from the mountain. This circumstances perhaps inspired the name of the king's capital as Y ugaśaila. The place seems to be the ancient Mashnar of the Aitareya Brāhmaņa The inscriptions on the bricks read as follows. 'This brick is from (belongs to) the Aśvamedha of (performed by) Š/lavarman, king of Uugaśaila and Yugeśvara or lord of Lustrum , faiïïïtà 5Í1*M4«I: II o 'This is the altar of the fourth horse-sacrifice performed by king Šīla- varman, who was of Vrishangana-Gożra and was sixth in descent from Poņa or of Poņa ( Vamśa ?). The word Poņa-Shastha may mean 'sixth in descent from Poņa.' Poņa being the first member of the Vamśa : - alternatively, it may mean the sixth</page><page sequence="15">ANCIENT INDIA (SECTION i) 67 Pona of the dynasty, five other earlier kings having borne the same name. Who this Poņa was, if it is a proper name, or what this Poņa dynasty was, if it refers to a dynasty, are problems requiring attention. The palaeography of the inscriptions clearly points to a transition - stage in the career of the Brāhmī script, when both earlier and later forms of ma and associative^ occurred side by side. This would place Šīla- varman as a post-Kushan and pre-Gupta king, i.e., between A.D. 250 and 300, and as one who gave, presumably in association with other dynasties, the death-blow to the Kushan power in north India. Following the decision of undertaking an intensive and extensive pro" gramme of excavation of the famous Buddhist remains in the Nagarjuņa- konda valley , prior to its submergence under deep water as a result of an elaborate irrigation project excavation which commenced iiere in 1954- 55 on large scale at different spots laid bare a few monasteries, Stupas and temples, one of which was a hill-edifice dedicated to the Buddhist mother- Goddess Hāriti. The accelerated excavation here carried out in 1955-56 uncovered additional Buddhist establishments, together with a few significant ins- criptions and other relics, and an elaborate flight of steps leading down to the . river. Recent excavations have revealed important epigraphical data bearing on the history of the Ikshvākus and supplying four generations of the Ikshvāku Geneaology starting from Chāntamūla and their successor Brihatpal āvana Srlvarmā. A new name of a warrior, Kulahaka Chā- ntamūla, is also furnised. Another inscription records the gifs of Buddhapãda made at Dharańa Vikāra by Mahāvihāravāsins- - one of the sub-sects of the Ceylonese Theravāda Buddhism. An inscribed frieze dated in the 24th regnal year of Ehuvala Chāntamūla is completely in Sanskrit and is, therefore, very important from the point of view of fixing the date of the advent of Sanskrit as a State language in this part, while the inscription records the consecration of a stone image of Buddha by one Kumāranadī, the Chief of Chandakaparavata with whom his wife as well as his son Esvaranandi are associated. Besides local wares of utilitarian types and decorated storage jars, specimens of the de-luxe wares like the 'black and red,5 the polished black and the polished red or buff sprinkler types of pottery and a few inscribed sherds have been avai- lable. These would cumulatively suggest a period of 3-4th centuries</page><page sequence="16">68 INDIAN HISTORY CONGRESS A. D. of antiquities, human and animal figurenes of terracotta material are by far the most prolific and of many varieties. Also were exposed monastic structures with variations within a standard monastic ground plan design, apparently for different ritualistic purposes, chaitya shrines with pillars laid in apsidal disposition and temples (as different from Buddhist shrines), in one of which was a sculptured slab of Shakti of Mahāsena (Skanda) revealing its significance and relationship with the Ikshavāku kings who were ardent devotees of Sri Mahāsenapati. An important epigraphical discovery of 1953-54 was an inscription of Asoka on a rock at Rajula-Mandagiri in District Kurnool. It is a Minor Rock-edict of the Emperor, and its contents are almost identical with those of its counterpart at Yerragudi, 20 miles away in the same area. A Brahmi inscription found at Amaravati, District Guntur records the gift of a coping stone for the railing of the famous Stupa by a princes Sammali. A stone obviously forming part of the top-frieze of the exterior surface of the drum of the Mahãchaitya at Salihundam, District Srikakulam, bore the inscription Dhamma-RanoAsoka-Sirino in second century A.D. characters. The identity of this person is puzzling. In 1954-55, an outstanding dis- covery was made at Gujarra in Vindhya Pradesh. It is a version of the Minor Rock edict of Asoka, who is here mentioned by name as at Maski. Some pasages found here are not found in any other version of the Minor Rock-edict. Other new records are Kushan inscription from Matnura which narrows down the gulf between the hitherto-known dates of Hu- vishka and Vasudeva to four years only and an inscription from Orissa which tells us that the Sailodbhava Mādhavavarman II performed an Ašoamedlv ' Of the important epigraphical discoveries in 1955-56, the most important was a damaged version of the Ninth Rock-edict to Asoka from Sopara, already known as the findspot of a fragment of the Eighth Rock-edict. Sopara contained, therefore, a complete set of the rock-edicts of Aśoka. Another was a record on a wooden ceilingrib of a cave at Bhaja which confirmed the date of the cave as the second Century B. G. New names introduced to history by some other inscriptions are Ār ya- V iśakhamitra, a second-century ruler of East India and Śatru- damana, a fifth century chief of south-east India. A survey of the archaeological material studied by the Indian Archaeo- logical Delegation during its two month tour of Afghanistan in 1956 is</page><page sequence="17">Ancìént india (section i) 69 mentioning here. An Indian Archaeological Delegation was fitted out by the Ministry of Education , Government of India for exploration work in Afghanistan. Its main object was to collect first hand knowdege of the archaeological wealth of Afghanistan. No excavation was contem- plated and only a rapid reconnaissance of the antiquarian material of Afghanistan has made, particularly of such material as revealed ancient contacts of India with her north western neighbour. Its task was to visit the river-valleys of South Afghanistan and to study evidence of Hellenic contacts, specially with reference to coins, sculptures and other objects spread over the entire country and also collected in the Kabul Museum, Kandahar Museum, Herat, Mazarisharif and Kunduz Museuiiis and private collections. Within the limits öf these objects it carried out its assignment, remaining in Afghanistan for 2 months and making a. thorough job in a difficult terrain. On indifferent roads it covered a distance of over 4000 miles. The Department of Archaeology has now information as to which areas are promising for detailed and systematic exploration particularly on sites which reveal close relation oflndia with her nortn western neighbour. A systematic study of temple arcftitecture with reference to evo- lution chronology and regional or dynastic styles was initiated in 1955 by the Depertment of Archaeology and is yielding fruitful results. Two officers, one each for north (Sri Krishna Deva) and south India (Sri K. R. Srinivasan) were appointed for the purpose. We shall be getting for the first time full descriptions of the various temples under study in accordance with the architectural terms used in the Śilpa texts of the different regions, living traditions of sthapatis and śilpins and inscription, as also an illustrated com- pilation of such important architectural terms with reference to the parts of the structures. The survey of work described above would show an all round activity to unravel India's ancient past, thanks to team work and competitive zest in which Universities, Department of Archaeology, Research Societies and Institutions have taken part. It is a matter of joy to note that such an activity has also opened a vista of en- couraging research in countries outside India, such as Afghanistan</page></plain_text>
