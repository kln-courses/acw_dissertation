<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PADDLER AND THE CANOE: A SEXUAL IMAGE IN POLYNESIAN POETRY Margaret Orbell University of Canterbury Nearly everywhere in Polynesia the people were intimately acquaint ed with the sea, depending upon it for their survival; on the atolls fish was the staple food, along with coconuts, and it was of great importance even on the larger, richer islands. The sea was the place where the men tried their strength, where they faced the unknown, braved its dangers and showed their skill and endur ance. No wonder, then, that deep-sea fishing was exclusively a male adventure, forbidden to women. And no wonder that the ocean, always a most potent source of imagery, should have been an especially powerful element in the shaping of Polynesian thought. One of the images derived from the Polynesian experience of the sea was that which identified male sexual activity with the act of paddling a canoe, and the female with the canoe itself. Partly this must have been a matter of shape and function, since paddles can readily be seen as phallic in form and canoes as resembling the vulva, and the paddle's use is appropriate. But this image must also have been closely related to three other ideas concerning the sea, and these should be kept in mind, though their depths cannot be plumbed here. First, there was the close association of women with water and the sea, which finds expression in the widespread myth of Hina, a woman who is the first, archetypal wife and mother; in one episode she takes an eel as a lover while swimming in a pool, and in another she swims across the o ean for many days to reach the man who is to become her husband. Behind this there lies the idea that the sea is a dangerous, unstable, non-human, inferior realm, as opposed to the human, superior realm of the land;3 one must remember in this connection that sexuality is regarded with ambivalence in all cultures, in many circumstances being felt to be potentially weakening to the individual and threatening to society, and that until very recently women have everywhere been considered to be vastly inferior to men. And lastly there is the image which identifies victims of any kind, especially people defeated in battle, with fish that have been caught. Here again the man in his canoe is seen as triumphantly asserting himself; and women of course can readily be thought of as conquests and prizes.4 The image of the paddler and the canoe has not been recorded in every island group, but it is widespread. In Western Polynesia, which consists of Tonga, Samoa and a number of small island groups, a boisterously performed dance-song from Tuvalu praises young women at the expense of older ones:5</page><page sequence="2">56 Away with sagging breasts oi ee, Only girls have pointed breasts oi ee! Put out to sea in your canoe, And if the paddle breaks, the rope snaps, Just wait a little, wait a little! Your canoe is good, it is good! Just wait a little, wait a little! The canoe is a girl. If the man has any problems making love to her, he just has to take it easy and everything will be fine. A similar song comes from Tonga. It is said to be a 'chanty', or work song, so it may have been sung by men who were actually paddling canoes. Again it makes good-humoured reference to a sexual difficulty and offers a solution:6 Woman, you must go where you will For at paddling I have no skill. Satisfy yourself how you may. I am steering, but making no headway! The two missionaries who were responsible for the publication of these songs could not have understood their meaning, or they would surely have rejected them. Generally in the poetry of Western Polynesia the emphasis is on celebration rather than lamentation, and songs of praise and boasting are common. Many songs of this kind were recorded in the 1930s on the tiny atoll of Pukapuka in the far north-west of the Cook Islands. In this magnificent poetry a canoe is sometimes praised as being like a woman, as when a village group boasts of its fine canoes:7 I cut my log, and the wood fits well, lies straight My canoe is like a woman's sex! And in the songs of praise that men composed for their sweethearts, a woman's genitals were sometimes spoken of as a well-made canoe. In one song this comparison was especially appropriate because the woman for whom it was composed was descended from people who had come from Lakawanga, an island famous for its beautifully decorated canoes:8 Lash the sennit above, Thatch the house, with smooth sides: When the seas pound, it is splendid! With pearl-shell to starboard It is splendid, a canoe from Lakawanga! Let its bow be torn open, Torn wide in the doing! Lightning dazzles my eyes. Make it well of puapua, The stripe-grained wood from Lakawanga!</page><page sequence="3">57 I fit the flanges together: There are four holes, five, Like the pearl-shell holes from Lakawanga! The sennit hangs thick, fringing The red kalaka seeds cast up from the east. Oh it is perfect! In Eastern Polynesia the image of the paddler and the canoe appears in Hawaiian poetry and in that of the New Zealand Maori. There is also an interesting piece of evidence from Easter Island, where the people possessed beautiful dance staffs which are shaped like paddles and are anthropomorphic in form, with the upper part repre senting a head and the lower part, below the blade, ending in. a penis.9 Easter Island's traditional poetry and thought are not well understood, and it is not known whether the act of paddling was identified with the sex act or whether it was regarded in a rather more general way as an expression of masculine strength and assertiveness. Perhaps these two things are so closely related as to be inseparable. Certainly the ceremonial role of these anthro pomorphic paddles shows the importance attached to them. The image is quite common in Hawaiian poetry, which has been well recorded. A bawdy song from a puppet play celebrates a high-born ancestress named Wewehi and her many lovers: Oh Wewehi ke ke, Wewehi herself ke ke! She's couched above ke ke, She makes the paddlers ke ke Sit on th.e canoe.ke ke On t.his canoe ke ke, On that canoe ke ke! Here Wewehi is seen as sitting at her ease upon.the pola, the sheltered platform on.a double canoe which was for the use of chiefs and other people of distinction, while below her the paddlers keep toiling away. The words 'this canoe' and 'that canoe' must refer to the ship's twin hulls. The collector of this song, N.B. Emerson, tells us that at puppet plays there was much byplay and buffoonery, with songs that 'may be characterized as gossipy, sarcastic, ironical, scandal-mongering, dealing in satire, abuse.,. hitting right and left at social and personal vices... [Theyl might be compared to the vaudeville in.opera or to the genre picture in art'. In other poetic genres in Hawaii the image is used rather less provocatively, as when a poet, in a song concerned.with. sexual attraction, speaks of a woman's body as her 'canoe-shed', that which houses her canoe.11 In another song a woman has offended the king and he has ordered his men to put her to d.eath, but the men take pity on-her and tell 'the canoe' they will allow her to run away, and she does so,12 sw-imming across a stream. Here the woman's status as a 'canoe' must be regarded as relevant because</page><page sequence="4">58 she is about to cross the water--a double meaning of a kind typical of this witty, riddling poetry. In New Zealand a great many texts have survived, more than in any other area. Most Maori songs dealing with relations between the sexes were composed by women, whereas elsewhere in Polynesia they seem usually to have been by men, and most of them were laments. In particular the waiata aroha, or 'song of yearning', was a rhetorical, complex, fairly short song in which a woman publicly complained of unrequited love or the trouble her lover or husband had caused her, and sometimes dealt as well with the gossip and insults to which she was being subjected. As well as relieving her feelings the poet could sometimes improve her situation by appealing to her listeners in this way, and it seems that she could in any case save face through the very act of composing and singing a clever song. Waiata aroha were often sung later by other people, sometimes with words adapted to fit new circum stances.Li In these songs the lonely woman quite often speaks of herself as a canoe that lies stranded, or broken, on the shore:14 My longing will not last for only one night. A second night comes, and it rises up! Oh how can I reach my sweetheart? I am a canoe that is cast up on the rocks! This image was all the more appropriate because in other contexts also the shore was seen as the place where things that had once belonged to the sea--seaweed,seafoam, driftwood, old nets--lay stranded and useless, out of their element.15 In one song at least, two co-wives are spoken of as a double canoe. Chiefs generally had several wives, and there was often trouble as a consequence. A woman whose husband had promised never to take a second wife, reproached him for breaking his word: It was you who told me I would remain alone Not a double canoe, lest [it] mount the surface Of Taumata-wharangi! Taumata-wharangi was the name of a place with high surf on the coast near Waitara; its stormy waters represent domestic strife.16 Though the Maori did not usually build double canoes, they did sometimes lash two single-hulled ones together for greater stability. Occasionally a 'canoe' could be seen as being happily paddled, but only in retrospect by one who now had cause to complain. A woman jealous of a younger co-wife used this idea in a ealing to her husband and recalling their earlier life together:</page><page sequence="5">59 This canoe was yours to command on the river! The image of the man as paddler is usually introduced rather in directly, as will be seen below, but a few poets use it boldly in passages claiming that their lovers are to blame:18 Te Kawau, you are the man who mounted me To paddle, and whose mark [is on me]! And Whenu, who paddles my hips, Your sign is raised up here! Sometimes in such songs there seems to be a certain sense of enjoy ment. And whatever the poet's motives, others might sing her song for entertainment: Go right along the seashore, and you'll come to Huri-rakau! That's- where my fathers are talking, their lips are never tired! It wasn't my fault, a penis came seeking to paddle! Twenty times it plunged, and left me in such trouble here! Whether or not the woman who composed this was really unhappy, other people must have enjoyed singing her song or it would not have been preserved by the learned man who recorded it in his manuscript book.19 Because the themes and images of the waiata aroha were so familiar, images and other ideas could be juxtaposed and compressed in a manner which in English poetry would result in a mixed meta phor. This does not show confusion on the part of the Maori poets; it is simply their way of proceeding. One poet combines the canoe image with another in which her first lover, whom she names, is said to have gutted her like a fish:20 Koromaki, he who opened me in front, Gutted that which blocked the canoe If many go on board, it will be broken! A similar juxtaposition of ideas occurs when the image of the discarded woman as a stranded canoe is combined with the idea, often expressed in such songs, that she can now do nothing but sit idly in her house:21 Now the canoe lies always at anchor, Stranded in the house! There is no incongruity here. The two ideas have a separate existence, and they also reinforce each other. The same thing must be happening in the many passages which refer to the man's departure. When his journey is by water, as it frequently is, he is described as paddling, and there often follows a reference to the relationlship he has had with the poet:22</page><page sequence="6">60 ...In vain I followed Your paddle thrusts, Hao, to be taken To the headlands sheltering the bays There at Te Kotuku! Yes, go away To your wife! In such lines the theme of the man's journey, introduced as a way of speaking of the lovers' separation, serves a second purpose as well by providing an opportunity for the discreet, well-mannered introduction of the sexual image of the lover as paddler, a kind of double entendre. Sometimes the theme is varied so that the man's absence rather than his actual departure is remarked upon:23 I do not see your spray spread about, Whare! You are far away! Enough! There is longing within me! And there are references to places where the man habitually plies his paddle:24 Listen to the tide lamenting as it flows, Breaking on the headland at Te Uruhi The place where your paddles plunge, Te Hiroa! It was you who pinched me, bringing me sorrow! Such ingenious variation and compression of conventional ideas was an essential part of the poetic process, well understood and much appreciated by the poet's audience. In Polynesian poetry this image of the paddler and the canoe is one of several that are known to have been widely employed. It may in fact have been present everywhere, remaining unrecorded in some places, or it may have been replaced in certain areas by other 25 sexual images, in particular one associating fire and sexuality. Since the cultures of Polynesia were quite closely related it is probable that the image was not invented independently in different places but that it passed with migrants from one island group to the next; on the other hand it is the expression of such basic beliefs and universal experience that it could well have emerged independently on a number of occasions. In each cultural area it was treated somewhat differently, its use reflecting the attitudes, manners and social conventions which prevailed in the people's lives and shaped their art forms.</page><page sequence="7">61 Notes 1. Most of the Maori texts discussed here are taken from an un published thesis presented for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Anthropology at the University of Auckland. The thesis contains some further material also; see Orbell MS 1977: I, 192-203. I wish to thank Professor Bruce Biggs, who was my supervisor, for his stimulating discussions of this material. I am also much indebted to the recorders of these sangs, and to those who have translated them previously. 2. For Hina see Luomala pp. 101-20, and for the episode with the eel, Kirtley. It would be interesting to know whether ships are generally regarded as female when they play a symbolic role. Certain ly they are spoken of as 'she* in our own culture. 3. There has been little scholarly analysis of the land/sea dichotomy in traditional Polynesian thought, though the subject is touched upon briefly in a number of works. Some of its functions in Maori thought are discussed in Chapter Five of Orbell in press. 4. For some Maori uses of this image, see note 20 below. 5. See David, p. 72; the text was translated by the Rev. S. Ella. Tuvalu was formerly the Ellice Islands. This is the whole song: Te a ese ia oe le susu tautau, oi ee, Gata i teine susu tutu, oi ee?

See Emerson p. 255. 13. There are also closely similar waiata whai?ipo, 'songs about lovers', which are sometimes complaints about unrequited love by women who still hope to get their men, and sometimes bold songs, often not meant to be taken seriously, in which the poet lists several men she claims to love. In addition there are unrhymed couplets called pao which are often concerned with love and sex, are often more cheerful, and were composed by men as well as women. 14. The text which follows is an entire song. The original was collected by Richard Taylor and is in a manuscript in the Auckland City Library (Taylor GNZMSS TAY 22, no. 4). I am indebted to the City Librarian for permission to publish it:</page><page sequence="9">63 Kore au e aroha i te rangi tahi. Ka p? rua, ka hara-mai au, ka konaki!

While the image of stormy waters sits appropriately alongside . the previous one, so that one can visualise a double canoe being thrown about in rough seas, each of these images has an independent existence also. See the discussion of juxtaposed images later in this article. 17. See Ngata, pp. 120-1, also Orbell MS 1977; II: 360-1: Niu te waka nei, he whakahau ki te awa! 18.

In the last line twenty is a ?round number', for the Maori used to count in scores. 20. That is, it was he who broke her hymen. This is a special ised development of the image, mentioned above, which equates fish with victims; see Orbell MS 1977; 1: 240-3. The poem is in McGregor 1905, p. 73:</page><page sequence="10">64 I a Koromaki, nana nei taku aro i waere, Te tuaki atu i te puni o te waka? He maha ki te utauta, ka hara-mai ka pakarul 21.

Pinching and scratching are often mentioned in songs and stories about lovers. 25. This may, for example, have happened on the Tuamotus, where a considerable number of songs about love and sex were recorded; the fire image (see Koskinen and Hatful1) occurs quite often in the published texts, but the paddler and canoe image appears to be absent. Most missionaries did not collect love songs, and most of the anthropologists have had no interest in them. When texts have been recorded, they have often been left untranslated and unpublished.</page><page sequence="11">65 References Beaglehole, Ernest and Pearl Beaglehole.
