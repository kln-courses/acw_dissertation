This divide between empirical research and the- ory is impoverishing the understanding of amateur cinema, and I suggest that the cur- rent gulf between data and theory needs to be narrowed. In the study of professional cinema, David Bordwell has noted that "being empirical does not rule out being theoreti- cal," and has made a powerful case for what he calls middle-level research.2 The inten- tion of this particular study is therefore to argue for middle-level theorizing as the preferred practice in the study of amateur cinema. It is clear that due to the limitations of the current debates, misconceptions about the amateur ciné movement and its relevance to contemporary film studies abound.3 While the films made by both individuals and groups over a fifty-year period were varied and unpredictable, scholarly research has been surprisingly myopic in its focus. The three main trends of thought that recur again and again in most analyses are the domestic, the oppositionell, and the more recent development of the evidential. These mark the dominant positions that scholars have recourse to when trying to understand what amateur cinema is. They function as tools for understanding what this particular mode of cultural production can do, as well as for its legitimization. It is important to grasp these basic positions, so that work can begin on the areas unconsidered by analyses that develop from these well-established vantage points. Attention to these overlooked aspects will form the second part of this article, when I argue that theoretical frameworks developed for the analysis of home movies are insufficient to cover amateur film production as a whole. For the past thirty years, schol- arly attention has focused stubbornly on home movies at the expense of films that have a closer "fit" with the theory and analysis that scholars within film studies pursue. This bizarre situation, I suggest toward the end of the article, is the direct consequence of problems of critical categorization that require refinement. However, first it is necessary to outline the well-established perspectives and how they function within contemporary film theory.</page><page sequence="4">ИНН 39 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA THE DOMESTIC AND THE NONPROFESSIONAL One perspective ¡dentines amateur cinema with the ethnography of domestic family life. The work of Richard Chalfen, a scholar who is mainly interested in the communicative function of home photography, brought these cultural documents to the attention of the academy during the 1980s. Chalfen also extends his empirical research and analysis into a chapter on the social use of home movies and suggests a methodological framework to understand the social functions of these films.4 Drawing on Sol Worth's work on filmmak- ing practices that developed when people on Navajo reservations were given access to camera technology, Chalfen sees home moviemaking as one method of reinforcing pre- existing social relationships, this time within the nuclear family.5 As a social scientist, he is interested in how these films are used within this context. The major innovation in Chalfen's study, Snapshot Versions of Life, is the intro- duction of the category "home mode" to describe this process of social communication. He writes, "The 'home mode' is described as a pattern of interpersonal and group com- munication centered in the home."6 He continues, "this concept of 'mode* is not equated with a specific medium of communication. The same mediums- writing, painting, draw- ing, photography, film, videotape- can be used for both mass communication and home mode communication."7 The home mode is neither defined by the medium nor the tech- nology used: home movies can be made with 35mm, 16mm, or 8mm cameras. In short, the home mode is not a genre of amateur cultural production, but rather an exhibition space where self-produced materials are shown to the intended audience of family and close friends. Within this mode, Chalfen introduces terms such as "Kodak Culture" and "Polaroid People" to describe its characteristics and agents. The former describes "whatever it is that one has to learn, know, or do in order to participate appropriately in what has been outlined as the home mode of pictorial communication."8 These rules tend to be communicated to users by instruction manuals. It is notable that a corpora- tion's name is the signifier of instructional culture, a choice that indicates the centrality of a few major companies in defining the debates. Later writers on amateur film would develop the implications of these nomenclatures. The latter "is used to provoke an inven- tory (or 'topography') of specific people, places, and things that regularly appear in the photograph collection."9 This would include activities in domestic family life, such as games in the garden, birthdays, and holidays. All of these activities also provide typical scenes in home movies. For Chalfen, these terms construe the home mode of communi- cation as a prime site witnessing the transformation of the real world into the "symbolic</page><page sequence="5">world" of film language. It furnishes images that aim to shine happiness back onto the participating family, preserved against the degradations of time: These patterns of patterned change remain stable through time. And so, while photographic collections document changes, these changes are predictable, stable, culturally expected and approved. In this way photography maintains a culturally structured status quo.10 By tending mostly to record moments that capture the process of healthy growth, successful achievement, and happy family moments, a certain picture of family life begins to emerge from home moviemaking. These selective representations are not intentionally misleading; they merely perform the specific social function of projecting an idealized ¡mage back onto the participants. The analysis of how these representations are con- structed formally continues in what might be considered a contradiction in terms: detailing the formal characteristics of a filmmaking practice that is not in the least interested in form. The breakthrough of Snapshot Versions of Life is to question assumptions con- cerning acceptable aesthetic practice in films made for the domestic environment. While professional filmmakers criticize home moviemakers for poor use of technique, this ignores the specificity of the home mode of communication. According to Chalfen, the most popular form of writing on amateur filmmaking, "How to Do It" manuals, are also based on the same misunderstanding.11 As Chalfen notes, "Interviews with home moviemakers revealed an undesirable conflict between the ideal of spontaneity and the good intentions of planning a movie."12 This conflict could be for any number of reasons, including a naive belief that editing manipulates a filmic record unnecessarily, when home moviemakers set out to "reproduce a reality" in real time.13 A more plausible argument is that planning "may represent an unwelcome intrusion of 'work* into what is classified by most people as 'play.' "^ This observation is useful in highlighting the spe- cific social reasons why home movies apparently display such a lack of interest in formal aesthetics. While Richard Chalfen's work has certainly pushed the debate forward, the approach is not without its limitations. As he is working within the scholarly conventions of social science, specifically visual anthropology, his research priorities are not neces- sarily those that would be favored within the humanities. For example, he notes, The present study has developed from a relatively static synchronie look at pic- torial forms that actually record changes in peoples lives. Much work remains</page><page sequence="6">ИНН 41 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA to be done on how conventions, sanctions, and related behaviours change diachronically- through time- and how technical, social and cultural factors contribute to such changes.15 His study privileges the synchronie over the diachronic, providing a static snapshot of home moviemaking within the family at a particular moment. The most obvious direction in which this work could be developed was in the aforementioned diachronic direction, by providing a historical context to home movies, all the way back to aristocratic families using 35mm cameras at the turn of the twentieth century. Chalfen also acknowledges that his study focused only on visual evidence provided by a very narrow section of the community, namely the middle-class of the American Midwest. Future researchers into home movies would do well to ask how representative this material might be. However, the material of the home movie could also be analyzed in relation to questions of per- sonal and familial memory: an approach much more suited to the methodologies of humanities scholars. Toward the end of Snapshot Versions of Life, Richard Chalfen comes to some bitter conclusions about the ethnographic value of these particular home movies. A piece of writing he quotes by Denise McCluggage, from an issue of American Home (December 1972) on the cultural value of snapshots, makes this point well: Future anthropologists, if they studied our culture from home photo albums alone, would probably conclude that this breed of man lived mostly at Christmas, indulged in a ritual with colored eggs at Easter, graduated from institutions frequently, celebrated birthdays mostly while young, and had lots of small animals. Further, they would conclude, children were usually fresh scrubbed, and spent a great deal of time standing around squinting into the sun.16 Richard Chalfen concurs as he quotes Margery Mann: "Few of today's amateur snapshots would provide a future anthropologist with any insight into the culture that produced them."17 It is on this melancholy note that Chalfen concludes his study. However, while the home movies scrutinized may not be especially useful anthropologically, he sug- gested a new approach to home movies, where the power of explanation moves from the family who made the movie to the scholar who studies them. Crucially, in the present context, Richard Chalfen scarcely confronts the latent issues of what it means to be an amateur who makes movies. Mostly he avoids the use</page><page sequence="7">of the term "amateur" altogether, preferring the less loaded designation, "nonprofes- sional."18 This slippage suggests the real problem of constructing the home mode as a metonym for amateur cinema in general. Despite his value to this study, Chalfen was not directly addressing questions of amateurism; rather he was studying only one sphere of nonprofessional cultural production, the family. Amateurism in Chalfen's work became synonymous with domestic life, but this forms a limited definition that needs to be chal- lenged, as the next section will make clearer. AMATEURISM AS AN OPPOSITIONAL PRACTICE The critical position that tends to be the one adopted most frequently by writers on ama- teur cinema is that of the mode as oppositionell practice. This is perhaps understandable, given that amateur cinema seems to offer the opportunity to experiment and subvert from outside the commercial mainstream. From this perspective, amateur cinema poses a direct challenge to the conformity of mass-movie making, and "democratizes" the means of cultural production. Most of the debate in this context so far has centered on critical studies of amateur f''m journals rather than actual film production, so these ideas are traced in this context. The arguments that can be recovered, through articles written by practitioners such as Maya Deren and Jonas Mekas, gave voice to oppositional impulses that were put into practice in their filmmaking activity. Writing within the context of the artistic avant-garde during the 1950s, their work was published in small-circulation, specialist arts, and film journals such as Film Culture. Their readership centered on the artistic community, not the general public, so the cultural values and reference points tended to be from painting, poetry, and literature rather than from consumer culture. In fact, they were actively hostile to mainstream culture, which they viewed as full of artistic compromise and inherently degraded: the only alterna- tive being to construct a "purer" alternative film practice.19 From this perspective, amateur filmmaking gives voice to areas of concern that are repressed by the status quo. One of the main concepts deployed by writers who were part of the avant-garde movement was freedom. Maya Deren talks about two forms of freedom, the first of which is freedom in the artistic sense. From her point of view, the main benefit that the amateur has is freedom from sponsorship and the expectations that corporate funding brings to the final film. As Deren notes, Artistic freedom means that the amateur filmmaker is never forced to sacrifice visual drama and beauty to a stream of words, words, words, words, to the</page><page sequence="8">НИИ 43 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA relentless activity and explanations of a plot, or to the display of a star or a sponsor's product; nor is the amateur production expected to return profit on a huge investment by holding the attention of a massive and motley audience for 90 minutes .... Instead of trying to invent a plot that moves, use the move- ment of wind, or water, children, people, elevators, balls, etc. as a poem might celebrate these. And use your freedom to experiment with visual ideas; your mistakes will not get you fired.20 Low-budget film production has always been seen as the place where artistry can poten- tially flourish. From the European art cinema to the B-movies of the Hollywood studio system, critics have often noted that when working outside the heavily regulated produc- tion line, stylistic experiments can be pursued without interference. Here Deren is acting as an advocate of a nonindustrial mode of production, with the amateur as the true patron of artistry in the cinema. This passage, in its commitment to an aesthetic of silent filmmaking, also demonstrates the archaic quality of writing on amateur cinema during the 1960s. While professional cinema had integrated sound into its symbolic system, amateur filmmaking was still being seen as a potential site of resistance: preserving a visual style for the amateur, which had long since been superseded by sound technology in other cinemas. The mainstream's innovations leave a space for the amateur to exploit. Here amateurism is synonymous with artistry. The second way Maya Deren talks about freedom is in the physical sense. The New York avant-garde embraced the new cheap cameras and projectors that came on the market. In these mass-produced technologies, the artistic avant-garde invested their Utopian hopes and desires for a future filmmaking practice: one that broke with the practices of the past.21 In particular, they championed the lightweight technology of 16mm, and more especially by 1965 (when the article "Amateur Versus Professional" was published), the 8mm cameras that were available to many middle-class families in the United States. Filmmakers and critics such as Deren were writing in a polemical way to discourage people from using these cameras functionally, i.e., the documentation impulse of home movies, and instead to encourage the use of the technology in a non- practical artistic fashion. Her writings show how excited she was by the possibilities of developments in "sub-standard" film technology in the hands of an artist: Don't forget that no tripod has yet been built which is as miraculously versatile in movement as the complex system of supports, joints, muscles and nerves which is the human body, which, with a bit of practice, makes possible the</page><page sequence="9">enormous variety of camera angles and visual action. You have all this, and a brain too, in one neat, compact mobile package.22 The movement of the camera during filming was a controversial subject of debate within amateur circles. While most amateurs were advised not to draw attention to the camera by excessive movement or unusual camera angles, here Deren advises the very opposite. She encourages the amateur to make full use of the lightweight camera and to forge an aes- thetic practice that the professional would disapprove of. Anthropomorphic camera move- ment here becomes the signature technique of a filmic practice that is defining itself in opposition to the smooth and controlled locomotion of professional film style. This points toward a dichotomy that has been influential on much later writing on amateur cinema. The title of the article is "Amateur Versus Professional," which in itself is revealing of an antago- nistic attitude. This theoretical opposition has been unproductive in the long run, as is evi- dent from the ways in which these debates have developed as they entered film studies. The first scholarly monograph on amateur film was Patricia Zimmermannes Reel Families: A Social History of Amateur Film.23 This book was based on her PhD thesis, entitled Reel Families: A Social History of the Discourse on Amateur Film 1897-1962.21* The change of title is significant and telling. Without it, the impression is created that Zimmermannes study aims toward a complete history of amateur film, when her work is actually an examination of the ideological discourses running through American amateur film journals and other primary documents. While this has been a major contribution to scholarship on amateur cinema, it has to be seen in the larger context as a small part of a mostly unexplored domain. While earlier writers such as Maya Deren and Harry Alan Potamkin influenced Reel Families, key ideas alluded to within the Deren article are taken in a more scholarly direction. Zimmermann performs a much more rigorous analysis of journals and docu- ments on amateur film than had been accomplished outside of film studies. She situates amateur cinema within an industrial and socioeconomic framework, which enriches the considerable primary research on written documents, and also pushes the work in the diachronic direction that Chalfen had anticipated. However, the general conclusions of her work are not beyond criticism. The central thesis of Reel Families is summed up in the following extract: From 1897 to 1962 amateur-film discourse incrementally relocated amateur film- making within a romanticized vision of the bourgeois nuclear family, thereby amputating its more resistant economic and political potential for critique.25</page><page sequence="10">ИНН ¿с THEORiZINÜ AMATEUR CINEMA Now, while the first part of this statement is most likely true (whilst still open to empirical question), the second part of this passage does not necessarily follow from the first. Here Zimmermann sees amateur filmmaking in general as being constrained by the nonoppo- sitional practices that most people pursue in their home moviemaking. However, the one does not necessarily have a negative effect on the other. Avant-garde practices still per- sisted as a minority activity well into the 1970s, even while the majority of amateurs showed no interest in this form of filmic activity. The popularity of home movies does not mean that histories of the amateur avant-garde cannot also be traced. The misleading nature of this thesis is perhaps a result of Zimmermannes focus on prewar amateur cinema. In her studies published in article form on the avant- garde and its writings, she focuses on the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s.26 This was a period when avant-garde writers and filmmakers were particularly active in the United States. Such articles were published in monograph form. However, there is no research on whether this activity persisted into the postwar era. Instead, judging by the evidence of amateur film journals, and under the spell of the Frankfurt School's culturalism, Zimmermann concluded that the corporations of America con- spired to frustrate avant-gardist ambitions. The adoption of this pessimistic political model blinds her to the variety of film production that actually took place among post- war amateurs. The problem, however, is that Zimmermann displays little interest in the rela- tively mainstream cinema that these amateurs produced. Running through her writings is a deep suspicion of the dominance of Hollywood on the formation of an amateur film aesthetic. Like Chalfen, she objects to film journals and manuals advising amateurs to make their films into coherent narratives, seeing such prescription as indexing-dominant commercial ideology intruding into properly "free" leisure pursuits. This suspicion of the ideological effects of narrative was once common among film theorists, but has been replaced by a more nuanced understanding of popular culture than political modernism allowed. The confusions that result from this "oppositional" stance can be seen in the contradictory attitude Zimmermann takes toward home movies. They are dismissed as reproductions of bourgeois ideology; yet later she mounts a counterargument to reclaim home movies as symbols of resistance to conventional film aesthetics. The spontaneity of the home movie is celebrated in opposition to the control of Hollywood productions: Compositional technique was also a site of ideological struggle in home-movie discourse: on the one side, a controlled, static camera emulating the most</page><page sequence="11">WÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊKIÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊÊmmSm ^ mundane studio film; on the other, a mobile, intimate, and tripod-free style that exalted in lightweight amateur gear.27 In a similar vein, the labor-intensive nature of professionalism is contrasted with the lack of labor in the most indolent film activity. The passage echoes Maya Deren's article, only this time it is home movies rather than the avant-garde that is being defended. Similarly again, in line with currents of contemporary feminism, the domestic space is defined against the public space, and this therefore becomes the privileged site of oppositional impulses in gender politics. At each level, such a critical practice takes the most seem- ingly conservative cultural object, the home movie, and asserts that it contains a latent subversive critique of dominant ideology.28 This argument once again reinforces the common view that amateur cinema consists of nothing more than home movies, and also that the value of the amateur lies in its service to ideological critique. Despite the differences between the approaches to amateur cinema from domestic and oppositional perspectives, they share the recognition that both home movies and the amateur avant-garde are significantly individualist practices. As Zimmer- mann writes, "Professionalism moulded middle-class workers into interchangeable parts; amateurism served as a safe haven for the ragged remains of bourgeois individu- alism."29 It is perhaps productive therefore to reposition these writers as working with a less subversive and more romantic tendency than has previously been acknowledged. Theoretically, both Chalfen and Zimmermann are excited by the possibilities of individu- alist filmmaking, but are ultimately disappointed by the films they find. Their analyses then represent an attempt to come to terms with this apparent schism. Neither can see any amateur practice beyond the domestic, a limitation that impoverishes both their studies. The myopic focus on the avant-garde and home movies effectively ignores other amateur filmmaking practices that have now been mostly forgotten. An article published in 1992, "Home Movies of the Avant Garde: Jonas Mekas and the New York Art World" is the logical outcome of the dominance of these two scholarly paradigms.30 TELEVISION AND HISTORICAL EVIDENCE More energy and vitality characterize the ongoing debates on amateur cinema within the archive sector, where curators and restorers have taken the responsibility of pushing the debate forward, in the relative absence of any significant academic developments. While not being as prominent in the study of amateur cinema as the previous variant, their mainly evidential perspective nonetheless plays a significant role in nonacademic uses</page><page sequence="12">НШННННННН! 47 THE0Ri7iNG AMATEUR CINEMA of amateur film. However, these archival concerns have recently entered academic debate via the study of television. Nonetheless, this debate has tended to proceed along predictable lines of enquiry, with some notable exceptions. When film studies scholars study historical issues, it is usually in relation to changes in production and style. Films are understood within their historical context, but this is mobilized to understand the film itself, with the historical account subservient to the analysis of the film. In contrast to this approach, archivists and social historians find amateur nonfiction films a useful source of visual evidence.31 Researchers using this approach can consult a single film to access a particular aspect of its pro-filmic world, or adopt a compare and contrast strategy, in which the historian examines footage of, say, a place, then compares it to film ofthat same area thirty years later. This process reveals the changes, not just in film style, but the diachronic changes that the passage of time has had on the landscape.32 In this way, film almost becomes a scientific tool for the recording of moving images and objects that will be of interest to the retrospective viewer in years to come. However, this method requires supplementary material for the visual evidence to become historical knowledge. Without knowledgeable commentaries from people who can interpret the images, the film in itself can become relatively meaningless.

In contrast to earlier television programs on amateur cinema that aimed to be a stimulus to production, such as Cine Club (BBC, 1950-51), Cine Holiday (Associated-Rediffusion, ITV, 1956), Personal Cinema (BBC, i960), Take a Cine Camera (ATV Network, ITV, 1972), and Happy Days (ITV, 1983), these contemporary television programs are more interested in reminiscence. Their format tends to intercut firsthand witness interviews on the issues under discus- sion, with visual evidence often taken from amateur (and sponsored) films that have been deposited in national and regional archives. The films being used for "apparently" evidential purposes are not named, and are largely subservient to the memories of the interviewees. This is especially true of Nation on Film and Scotland on Film, where moments take priority over the integrity of the film as an integrated whole.33 While the less well-known Scottish program The Way It Was used amateur film for memorial activ- ity, both Nation on Film and Scotland on Film tend to use them for a merely illustrative function. Such evidential usage of amateur film synchronizes efficiently with the forma- tion of archival policy and organization. Consulting the Scottish Screen Archive catalogue gives a useful insight into how these films are being indexed and graded at an institutional level.34 The basis of this indexing is a category called "historical value," a clear demonstration of the legitimizing power of the evidential perspective.35 Each film that is accepted into the archive collec- tion (not all films are) is judged using a system that goes from Grade 1 (most important) to Grade 3 (least important). The collection policy states that Each title acquired is to be given a grade for its historical/archive value, from 1-3. This grade is to indicate the value of a particular film for: a) Its rarity b) Its historical/social significance c) Its importance to the access department of the Archive.36 Instructions go on to list the attributes of a film to be catalogued under Grade 1, including "Amateur footage which is credited as having been entered in the Scottish Amateur Film Festival" and "Footage of a particular industrial/agricultural process which we hold noth- ing of." The status of fiction films in relation to rhetoric around the evidential discourse (and the privileging of nonfiction) is revealed when films that contain "Footage which is unique and of interest in its own right, e.g. an experimental film, or amateur fiction film,</page><page sequence="14">ВВП 49 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA A collection of film reels from the Scottish Screen Archive. Courtesy of the National Library of Scotland. but which does not fit the Criteria for Grade 1" are iden- tified as suitable only for cataloguing as Grade 2. Films tend to be confined to Grade 3 because they contain ". . . footage of any of the above subject areas, of which the archive holds a significant amount, but which still contains enough footage of historical interest." This brief docu- ment reveals the tough decisions that have to be made about which films it is in the national interest to preserve.37 Such policy documents indicate the privileged status visual evidence is deemed to possess in the eyes of the general pubic, and how this justification for the costs of retention is mobilized to legitimize the nonprofit institutions that, after all, are</page><page sequence="15">ННЯ1 co funded by public money. In this regard, television programs such as Scotland on Film and Web sites such as Scottish Screen's Archive Live perform mediating roles between the public and the national institution responsible for preserving these films. As these television programs are currently the most consistent users of amateur films preserved within the archive, it is not surprising that evidential functions are prioritized over other criteria, and exert strong influence over future preservation policy. In today's cultural environment, when the general public is increasingly suspicious of the importance of funding nonprofit organizations, Scottish Screen's role as the guardian of Scotland's filmic heritage benefits from aligning itself with television programs of this type. This partly explains the privileged status of nonfiction within the Scottish Screen archive. However, while it makes practical sense to align the archive with these television pro- grams, such a policy can condemn the vast amount of amateur fiction material, precisely the films that would be of most interest to film scholars, to second-class status unless they were entered into the amateur film festival. As indicated earlier, these developments are now beginning to register within the academy. Journals such as The Moving Image: The Journal of the Association of Moving Image Archivists and Film History have recently been leading the way in forming dialogues between film archivists and film scholars, within the American cultural context from the late 1990s onwards.38 Moreover, there have been examples of scholars from the rest of the world engaging with the use of amateur film as visual evidence for television, Jane Simon's recent article "Recycling Home Movies" being a case in point.39 Her analy- sis focuses on an Australian television series entitled Homemade History (SBS, 2003), which uses amateur film in a similarly evidential function as the television programs discussed above. Interestingly, following an outline of what is referred to above as the oppositional and domestic perspectives, she notes that these theoretical frame- works do not fit the films used in the program, due to the differences between American and Australian amateur film culture; a distinction that should be questioned. She goes on to write, The narratives of Homemade History defy generalization into any kind of coher- ent history. The episodes of Homemade History do not represent a cohesive domestic vision of the nuclear family, although a few do contain these ele- ments. The footage includes a diverse range of events, settings, and people.40 Simon's observation points toward the fact that amateur filmmakers did not just focus on the domestic environment; they made films on a variety of topics. To illustrate their</page><page sequence="16">ННИ 51 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA interviews, the makers of Homemade History were somewhat opportunistic in their use of archive film. As long as the footage worked as supplementary material, or provided an interesting visual window into the subject, amateur films made under very different circumstances were freely used. This is evident from the varying formal qualities of the films, as Simon notes: The footage of Homemade History is sometimes overexposed, scratched, shaky, and jumpy. It is also sometimes perfectly exposed, composed, and smooth. It offers a pertinent example of how home movies are capable of being both a practice zone of Hollywood style while inflecting the footage with per- sonal and social details.41 The contrasting stylistics of the films to which Simon draws our attention suggests that these programs do not just focus on home movies. As the title of the program perhaps implies, they also used films made outside of the domestic environment along with the home movies. This is also the case with both Nation on Film and Scotland on Film, pro- grams that draw upon the visual evidence of professional, sponsored, or amateur films interchangeably and out of context. For example, in the feature Scotland on Film- The Movie, premiered at the 2006 Edinburgh International Film Festival, this lack of concern about the origins of the material was demonstrated in the use of footage from the ama- teur fiction film Smart Boy Wanted (Enrico Cocozza, i960) to illustrate the sequence on memories of sweet shops in Scotland.42 The evidential impulse in television producers, therefore, does not hesitate to use fictional material when the footage suits its purposes. It should be noted that this example is an exception to the privileged status of nonfiction material as a source of visual evidence, both within these pro- grams and within the archive sector. BEYOND THE HOME MODE The outline of a new framework is per- haps suggested by the limitations of the theoretical models that have been outlined so far.

The problem is that most amateur filmmakers involved in cine-club production occupied an ambiguous position between public and domestic exhibition strategies; they were not making films for their own private use, nor were they seeking to engage with an avant- garde subculture. These filmmakers are often misinterpreted as those who could not make it into the professional industry; their works are read as records of various attempts at crossover that were never successful. Similarly, reading the outcomes of scholarship on amateur cinema, as it exists at the moment, would give the impression that only cultural bohemians or patriarchal fathers ever made amateur films. This was clearly not the case. Richard Chalfen's work, pioneering in many respects, however, does not attempt to account for the amateur ciné movement as a whole, nor does it take account of the meaning and function of amateur ciné culture. Like Zimmerman, his work proceeds via a dichotomy, when he contrasts the "home mode" with the "mass mode": For instance, feature films (whether shown in movie theatres, on national tele- vision, or on home video recorders) are examples of mass modes, whereas home movies and travel film represent the home mode; still photographs pub- lished in popular magazines, newspapers, and books exemplify mass modes, whereas snapshots collected in family albums are part of home mode visual communication.43 These concepts seem initially useful, if somewhat limited in their application. Similarly, Zimmermanns economic definition of a mode of filmmaking as "semiprofessional" does not capture this ambiguity, because it implies amateurism is merely a form of preprofes- sional training, rather than a more autonomous pursuit, centered around the making of films as a hobby. The shortcomings of these two approaches, when confronted with ama- teur films that do not fit into either category, start to become more obvious, as in a foot- note to an early article outlining the principles of the home mode; Chalfen is unsure how to account for this ambivalent film practice: We may speculate that when people begin to plan their filmmaking (versus moviemaking) they are leaving the home mode and entering an "amateur mode." Readers should notice that this shift may have nothing to do with camera technology.44</page><page sequence="18">HHHHHI^I^H co THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA In this brief footnote, we see both the value and the limitations of Chalfen's framework. Home movies are amateur films as well; however, this distinction implies that they no longer are. In this regard, the "amateur mode" as a category proves misleading. Because the current terminology used to describe cine-club filmmaking seems evasive, I propose a new term: the community mode. This formulation addresses and acknowledges the limited public exhibition context enjoyed by these filmmakers, without implying that they are simply home moviemakers, or attempting entry into the mass mode. Over the years, filmmakers working within the community mode have made many films on many subjects outside the concern of home movies or the avant-garde, which have involved little monetary exchange. Nor is the com- munity mode defined by film gauge, and includes work by both individuals and cine- clubs; it is defined rather by the ambivalent exhibition space it occupies between the home and mass modes. Filmmakers working within the community mode include those who belonged to film societies and entered their group-made films into the annual film festivals that were held all around the world, as well as travel filmmakers who toured with their films, and also more locally based civic filmmakers who rented town halls and other available exhibition spaces. In the episode of Nation on Film, discussed above, over a shot of a program of the Empire Amateur Film Festival, Elyne Hoskin of the South West Film and Television Archive notes, "All of these people are showmen, these amateur filmmakers craved an audience." Ironically enough, the episode was entitled, "Private Passions"; nevertheless, the point is that their films were made not for just artists or family members, but for a general audience. Yet this was still a limited space, as 16mm film was a format that could not be used in a commercial exhibition space, without the expensive transfer to 35mm prints. These factors made it difficult for the amateur sector to become a potential rival to professional cinema, yet there are isolated examples of crossovers into the mass mode of commercial theatrical exhibition and television screenings.45 As this television program demonstrates, the gulf between archivist and academic writing on amateur cinema is indicative of the misconceptions that can accumu- late over the years when there is so little dialogue between two institutional zones. The archivists, coming into day-to-day contact with amateur films that do not fit into either the home or mass modes, are leading the way in this debate. As Laraine Cookson notes, The collective efforts of a well-equipped cine-club may produce a film much closer to accepted "professional standards" than the shaky, out-of-focus</page><page sequence="19">camerawork of many home movies. Although both types of film may be classed as "amateur" each must be evaluated in different ways.46 This simple observation is key to the future development of theorizing on amateur cin- ema. Only by acknowledging the aesthetic differences between the home mode and the community mode, and confronting the issues of amateurism, can the debate move forward. Contrary to the recurring invocation of the freedom of the amateur, films made as part of cine-club culture were usually subject to more highly organized artistic regimes than home movies. Richard Chalfen and Patricia Zimmermann both note a divergence between amateur film journals/manuals and amateur film production. Even a strong critic of these models, james Moran, a video theorist, disputes a correspondence between amateur discourse and actual production. However, this can be explained as the result of his focus on material also produced within the home mode.47 By con- trast, I want to argue that there was strong convergence between discourse and pro- duction within the community mode. This tendency has been long overlooked by film historians/theorists working on amateur cinema. Cine-club films are part of a film movement, now largely forgotten, that have their own unique history. As the documentary filmmaker Lance Bird tentatively outlines, Cinema clubs are a phenomenon that began in the early 1930's after the introduction of 16mm film. They grew steadily in the late 1930's; peaked after the war in the late 40's and early '50s; suffered a decline in the late '50s; were rejuvenated by the introduction of super 8 film in the *6os, and died with the widespread use of VCRs in the mid '70s. Some few still exist today.48 These clubs were heavily results orientated, usually making at least one film a year for the express purpose of entering this work into amateur film festivals. These exhibition spaces were subject to the processes of evaluation in a way that neither the avant-garde nor the home movies ever were, precisely because their audiences consisted of people beyond sympathetic and indulgent family members. Issues involving how to keep these audiences entertained were constantly debated in amateur film journals and manuals throughout the years. What becomes clear from these sources is that writers within these journals and manuals were themselves heavily involved in the active creation of an amateur film aesthetic. This amateur aesthetic was both parasitic upon professional practices and innovative toward amateur practices at one and the same time. This was after all a deeply divided film movement.</page><page sequence="20">ННННННИНН1 55 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA Broadly speaking, amateur fiction films drew on and adapted recognizable genres such as fantasy, comedy, and action films, while nonfiction films developed more according to documentary tradi- tions and the unique conditions of the amateur film sector. The existence of more specific amateur film genres, traceable through amateur film jour- nals and interviews with participants, is an ¡deal case in point of the important role criti- cal debate had in the formation of practice within this parallel film culture. The variety of genres that were an acknowledged part of amateur film culture for over forty years pro- vides a stark contrast to the limited number of films that are currently the focus of aca- demic studies. When these generic practices are established within the study of amateur cinema, debate will become infinitely richer. Below, I offer a number of practical and methodical points to help toward establishing this dialogue. Research on films made within the community mode will mostly have to be pursued through the archive sector. Unlike the avant-garde, which at least has a small but dedicated audience within the mass mode, or the home mode, which is available through private sources, work in the community mode is much more elusive to would-be researchers. While many cine-club films have found their way into storage, the influence of evidential perspectives has meant that these films are not high-priority candidates for the production of viewing prints or other access copies. As we saw, with films used in television programs regarded as being of higher priority by archive criteria than fic- tion films, club films often have to wait. Since many films made within the community mode were in fact fiction, this effectively means that these films cannot be studied simply because up until this point there has not been a demand for them. Film scholars more actively engaging with archivists in this area would mean that they would have the possibility of influencing these decisions. Without the intervention of film scholars, the debate will continue as it is and access to films will continue to be a problem. Work on amateur cinema is presently much easier to conduct with reference to nonfilmic sources than it is to extend through the viewing of the films themselves. The national press might have been geared more toward the mass mode, but at the height of its popularity, short reports of locally based amateur film festivals often found their way into the pages of the daily newspapers. These reports, often published after the conclusion of the festival, are useful for establishing the prizewinning films and film- makers, as well as finding out what the judges had to say in general about the standards of the entries. However, while reports in national newspapers are useful for research- ing film festival winners, the most productive research into amateur cinema can be</page><page sequence="21">НННННИНИИИННБшш!! c¿ conducted through the local press. Amateur films do not have to be prizewinners to get extensive coverage within the local newspapers; they just need to be of local interest to the newspaper's readers. Therefore, far more articles covering amateur films were printed and can be recovered, as long as film scholars are willing to make the trips to local libraries. This point builds on the emphasis put on local film exhibition by previous film historians: It is a large and hitherto virtually untapped source of original film historical investigation. Rather than merely sift through the interpretations of others, the local researcher has the opportunity to find and use a great variety of primary materials. Since so little has been done to document film-going at a local level, it is possible to make a contribution to the state of film historical knowledge.49 This spirit should inform research into amateur cinema. However, the key difference between the form of historical investigation advocated by Allen and Gomery, and research into amateur film, is that the research agenda moves from local film exhibition to local film production. Amateurs interested in film did not just show films at meetings of their film societies; crucially, they also made their own films. In this way, appreciation fed into cultural production, a model example of how people on the ground shaped pop- ular culture to their own particular uses and agendas. Rather than having to endlessly "sift through the interpretation of others" as Allen and Gomery put it, the problem for theorizing on amateur cinema is that there is not a mountain, but a paucity of interpretations. Unlike other areas of film study, amateur cinema is a hugely imder-theorized domain. However, some work has emerged in recent years: for example, Mark Neumann's "Home Movies on Freud's Couch," which theorizes amateur film from a psychoanalytic perspective.50 As he notes, "In this essay, my aim is to explore a critical and interpretative approach to home movies and amateur films that falls outside the boundaries of what might otherwise be considered their historical and archival value."51 Opportunities exist for a large amount of work to be done in this area, so instead of just focusing endlessly on home movies, or dismissing amateur films that do not provide a radical aesthetic, there is now an opportunity to evaluate amateur films using methods more developed within film studies than in neighboring academic disci- plines, in order "to open up the possibilities of interpretation."52 It is clear that debate about the community mode could initially focus on the relationship between film journals/manuals and film production. Certain key issues</page><page sequence="22">ИНН 57 THEORIZING AMATEUR CINEMA overlap quite naturally with work on professional cinema, such as authorship and genre. Amateur films made according to the cine-club model can provide examples of an author- ship that has more in common with the Hollywood studio system than it does with avant- garde film or the home movie. Both individual filmmakers and cine-clubs produced films that are much more amenable to the interpretative practices within film studies than has been acknowledged up until this point. The aesthetic history of amateur cinema is now waiting to be written. Appreciating these films requires an evaluative approach to films altogether different from that advocated by previous writers. As Noel Carroll notes, "A great many problems about film evaluation could be resolved, if only we had a way to fix the correct category or categories for evaluating the film in question."53 This is the crux of what needs to be done with theorizing on amateur cinema, as Laraine Cookson realized: to use methods of analysis that are appropriate to the film under scrutiny. The introduc- tion of the term "the community mode" has been suggested with this intention: as an effort to correct the problems inherent in using categories that do not fit the object of analysis. Since the organized activities of cine-clubs are of growing interest to film schol- ars, work should now begin on the films that they actually made.
