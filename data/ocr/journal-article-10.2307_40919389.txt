Fragmenter afrejsens mytolqgi: Odysseus-myten hos Homer og i den senborgerliße litter atur. Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 1979. of many critics who have recently attempted to characterize postmodernism is Bent Haugaard Jeppesen in an article enti- tled uDen postmodernistiske slugvornhed." His description includes the following passage: Postmodernismen er principielt inklusiv, alle cv&amp;rdiery oß 'sandheder' er lißc ßyldiße - tiler lige forkerte. De store metafysiske helhedsskabende samment&amp;nkningers tid er forbì, synteserne, systemerne, mytoloßierne oß ideoloßieme er alle til höbe dede som sild i tender. Ver den erfragmentarisk oß uoverskueliß, forskellene oß modsißtlseme er afyerende oß uflytteliße. (62f.) (In principle postmodernism is inclusive, all 'values' and 'verities' are equally valid - or equally invalid. The period of great metaphysical totalizations is over, the syntheses, systems, mythologies, and ideolo- gies are all dead like sardines in a tin. The world is fragmentary and unpredictable, its differences and contradictions are decisive and irre- movable.) And the article ends with this more personal confession: indtil andet Ußgesfrem, viljeß vove at pasta, at postmodernismen i den form, vi til i daß kender den herhjemme, er i dyb oß inderlißpagt med alle</page><page sequence="2">Johannes V. Jensen 97 gode nykonservative tendenscr i dette land, n&amp;sten demonstrativt ufarlig for det, der er - 'kendsgerningen,* som Johannes V. Jensen sagde. (64) (until proven wrong, I venture to claim that postmodernism, as we know it to this day in Denmark, is deeply and intimately in conformity with every good, neo-conservative trend in this country and almost ostentatiously harmless to whatever is - the 'fact of the matter,' in Johannes V. Jensen's manner of speaking.) That Haugaard Jeppesen makes mention of Johannes V. Jensen is quite appropriate. For one thing, it resumes the thread from the inception of his article, where uDengotiske Renaissance og tilsvarende skrifter, som Johannes V. Jensen udsendte i de folgende àr" (The Gothic Renaissance and similar works published by Johannes V. Jensen during the following years) are depicted as "lettere euforisk, lobskkoren- de og totalt accepterende pra-futurisme" [58f.] (slightly euphoric, run away and totally accepting pre- futurism). But it also calls attention to Haugaard Jeppesen's book on Johannes V. Jensen og den hvide mands byrde (1984) as one of several recent texts in which Jensen can be followed on the move from the original position of a pre-futurist lyric poet to the more consolidating position of an early postmodernist narrator. Evidently, it is the traveller in Jensen who makes him the forerunner of postmodernism. In the latest principal work of Danish literary history Ib Bondebjerg says of Jensen that det mods&amp;tningsfyldte forhold til modernitetens verden og de brudstykker til en socialdarwinistisk historie- og menneskeopfattelse, som man kan laese ud afforfatterskabet op til 1907, blevfra 1908 sammenfattet i den seks bind store, mytiske, historiske roman Den lange Rejse, der ferst var afsluttet i 1922. (96) (the self-contradictory attitude to the world of modernity, and the fragments of a socio-darwinistic conception of history and man, that are discernible in the authorship prior to 1907, were after 1908 compounded into the six-volume mythical, historical novel The Long Journey y which was not completed until 1922.) To reconcile Den lange Rejse with the above notion of postmodern- ism then amounts to assuming that the novel's "sammenfatning" of Jensen's otherwise contradictory and fragmentary relation to moderni- ty is, indeed, as dead as "sild i tonder." Or more precisely, we must be led to believe, as Bondebjerg has also stated, that "fra den disharmon-</page><page sequence="3">98 Scandinavian Studies iskc konfrontation med modcrniteten i det tidligere forfatterskab bev- aeger Johannes V. Jensen sig mod en utopisk dram om landet, der ikke findes" [99] (from the disharmonie confrontation with modernity in his earlier works, Johannes V. Jensen later moves toward a Utopian dream of the land that doesn't exist). Apparently "sammenfatningen" is dead, namely in the sense that it has failed to do away with the contradictions, fragmentations, and other thorns of disharmony in its flesh. Yet, it is this incapacitated effort to synthesize which preserves modernity not as modernism but postmodernism. Disparate reality is being certified by harmonious Utopia. The intrinsic tension between Jensen's pre-modernism before Den lange Rejse and his pre -postmodernism in Den lange Rejse and later works is also suggested by Ib Bondebjerg: "Mens den forste del af forfatterskabet forsogte at gore void mod drifterne og kvindeligheden i kendsgerningens, materialitetens og maskulinitetens navn, sá soges det fortrangte nu genoptaget som sublimeret laengsel" [99] (while in his early writings he attempted to violate sexual desires and femininity in the name of facts, materiality, and masculinity, he now attempts to reinstate in the form of sublimated longing what was earlier subdued). Unlike Jörgen Elbek who saw, without reservations, Jensen transform the sublime nihilism of his youth into his later writings' so-called positivity of lower order, Ib Bondebjerg more warily leaves the possi- bility open that not all of Jensen's youthful desires and female traits were efficiently cowed and that only those which were in fact subdued would later reappear in sublimated form. However, in his manner of mapping the very processes here at stake, Ib Bondebjerg is no less uncompromising than Elbek. Our author, according to the former, is firmly intent on curtailing his inspiration, and to the extent his inten- tions come true, sublimation is the one consolation left behind for his readers. In his critical assessment of this interrelationship between the younger and the older Johannes Jensen, Ib Bondebjerg seems to side with Jörgen Elbek in dissociating himself from the sublimated longings of Den lange Rejse. Still, his most pronounced concerns remain with the young Johannes Jensen's fear of his own desires (which detriment Bondebjerg considers the prime mover of the ensuing reduction, if not mutilation, of Jensen's artistic creativity). In this respect his critical position is more commensurate with Mads Thranholm's essay on Jensen 's travels around the world, at least insofar as the psychoana-</page><page sequence="4">Johannes V. Jensen 99 lytical slant of his method is concerned. Thranholm deals only with Di¿fte (1906) and with the way Jensen's verbal inventiveness accounts for the alleged suppression of libido and femininity in the six prose poems, whereas Ib Bondebjerg takes Jensen's later production, nota- bly Den lange Rejse, into consideration too - and quite kind consider- ation to boot. Thus, for the most part he views the novel's deficiencies in the light of earlier works, in which perspective they display a taxing heritage rather than notorious malfunctions of their own. At this point it is useful to envision Den lange Rejse more as a work in its own right as did Oluf Friis. To make an outline of Friis's early, sympathetic observations is to secure the broadest possible frame of reference for current discussions of Jensen and for attempts to narrow down e.g. the problems of postmodernism in Den lange Rejse (to which our time has tended with remarkable caution). Most recently Sven H. Rössel in his Johannes V. Jensen (1984) has testified to their existence in this exceptionally non-novelistic novel without the slight- est mention of postmodernism. In Friis's exposition art is life - i.e. time, space, man, things, nature, eternity - resurrected in memory and recollection. He abstains from discussing the expenses, in terms of oppressing, sublimating side effects involved in this transformation, thereby leaving the impression of quite a glossy and respectable process. Altogether, Oluf Friis's flair for complexity and totality rests on an aptitude for adding up virtues rather than detracting vices. Not the nuanced psychological analysis in itself but the way in which it conforms to the overarching synthesis of visions is what singles out his Johannes V. Jensen for distinction as a psychol- ogist and portrayer of human life. While individuality and variety - the infinitely small - warrant the illusion of factual development, it is the type or the infinitely big - that which is common or the norm behind the variations - that warrants the potential development. The unifying mode or genre is here the myth, which allows for synthesis, the crossing of borders, humanization - or cultivation - within nature. Travel in space becomes travel in time; everything always occurs here and now; consequently, eternity is always present. And not the animal in man, but the image of man is the basic revelation at the end of Den lange Rejse's artistic procedure. The traveller and the dweller, the explorer and the exploiter, the horizontal and the vertical operations are intertwined. In fine, the objectives of the book are essentially humanistic: to treat formations of human beings</page><page sequence="5">100 Scandinavian Studies and their activities with imagination so as to secrete and secure the inherent idea of man (in Jensen's manner of speaking!). As mentioned also by Bondebjerg, the historical watershed dividing the periods of natural and cultural development was an ice shed as depicted in Brsen from 1908. This volume was conceived (of) as the original wing of Den lange Rejse's six compositions. The young wanderer Jensen becomes the mature architect of the entire complex, which in turn becomes the arch over his wanderer life and its repository of memories. While Friis and Bondebjerg largely agree on the chronologi- cal facts, Bondebjerg again dissents from Friis's simple way of transform- ing the life of the traveller into that of his travelling companion, his six- piece work of literature. Bondebjerg chooses to talk about Den lange Rejse as the fictive form of a historical development which includes both qualitative, psychological leaps and a mythological model of coalescing fragments from earlier works. And in terms of today's or yesterday's intellectual climate, he prefers to explain the historical process of development as a projection of the psychological process of individuation. To Friis, as Den lange Rejse's contemporary, the problem that Johannes V. Jensen aimed at solving was how to better bring modern science into serving humanity and humanistic pursuits. That later critics have disapproved of such a noble explication of Den lange Rejsé* s objectives reflects a crisis of humanism to which not only recent examples of postmodernism but also essential traits of the very Jensen work in question bear witness. I can think of no other major piece of Danish literature that has so defiantly rejected and yet so inadvertently recorded the downfall of ude store metafysiske helhedsskabende sammen- tsenkningers tid." It endeavors to substantiate historically and update scientifically the legacy of Western European humanism, but what it has accomplished is humanistic self-revelation, at best. The scenario becomes clear when one looks at an author such as Albert Dam (1881-1972). Homegrown and independent, to say the least, this sturdy visionary has nonetheless acknowledged a precarious attraction to the works of the young Johannes V. Jensen. Perhaps for this reason it was not until a new generation of wild men stood by the Danish escutcheon (or on the Parnassus) in the 1960s that the "Line of Man" in Dam's production obtained any recognition to speak of. By comparison, Jensen's own line of man in Den lange Rejse^ obtained Nobel Prize winning recognition long before this breakthrough of</page><page sequence="6">Johannes V. Jensen 101 Danish modernism occurred and long after Jensen's own modernism had turned postmodern. The death of the former -ism seems to go with the first breath of the latter - and vice versa. And between Ib Bondebjerg and Oluf Friis we have a range of critical profiles - spanning from Thranholm to Haugaard Jeppesen and on to Rössel - with merely one thing in common: Jensen's long journey in life and art. It is the foremost achievement of these more or less incompatible critics to have encircled by different means Jensen's most persistent inclination yet perhaps also his most elusive source of experiences. This review, by contrast, is tenaciously intent on articulat- ing what the critics under scrutiny have reserved for silent representa- tion in their texts, namely some conspicuously absent consequences of their (dis-)joint ventures. I am referring to an implied notion of modern humanism and to an estimate of Jensen's work on the basis of that notion. Thranholm's book extends from the early myth of Odysseus in Homer to corresponding myths and revolts against myths in late bourgeois literature such as Ibsen, Jensen, Rifbjerg, and Joyce, and Frisch. In the spirit of Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectics of Enlight- enment, Thranholm examines the outcome of demythologization in the wake of European Enlightenment. His assumption is that rational control of the world requires similar rational control of the self for which purpose knowledge becomes a powerful tool. Especially if shared only piecemeal with subordinates, it enables the power holder to rule his world with negligible resistance. Only capitalism appears to possess the full capacity for disseminating knowledge yet keeping it under superior control. It is, presumably, the only system of rules which cannot itself be ruled. Even so, with enlightenment turning autonomous concurrently with the decline of the unknown, the new matching forms of knowledge become increas- ingly unknown themselves. From the outset a liberator, the enlight- ened mastermind winds up alienating its own achievements. Thranholm makes the point that enlightenment and its capitalist forms of consciousness are foreshadowed in Homer; but he also claims that their more blatant manifestations stay dormant until the dawn of the late bourgeoisie, the period of literature which includes Jensen's body of texts as one of its centerpieces. What we see in Jensen is how</page><page sequence="7">102 Scandinavian Studies after decades under the thumbs of enlightened forms of consciousness the myth eventually returns with the ideological authority of an irre- pressible, repressive voice of the past. The prose poems from 1906 are exercises in demythologization on the one hand but exercises that are conditioned by the mythology they denounce on the other. A case in point is the myth of man as it obtrudes itself on the perception of men and women as a potent phallus at odds with verbal commitments to the emancipation of all humans. While in itself the linguistic strategy is quite progressive, it presupposes reactionary and regressive mainte- nance of precisely the same mythological patterns from which it initially departed. To Thranholm the propelling force behind poems of travel like these is not simply curiosity or a spirit of exploration; it is a foolhardy bent for adventure, if not pure and simple defeatism. What happens, basically happens upon return from the journey when the castration and amputation of the traveller's whole undertaking is confirmed by the way he settles for an idyll with marked modifications. The incapacitated ego has now sublimated his desires, "skudt potensen op i halsen," (forced his potency up into his throat) and taken it out as verbal energy (Thranholm 71, 112). Thranholm's book presents a mixture of commendable and reckless daring. The author's target is literature as a gateway to cultural problematics, and he contrives a refreshing cross -disciplinary approach to his material. Also, the overall perspective afforded by his analyses is quite coherent. At the same time he stretches his arguments beyond the breaking point. His conceptual contraction of centuries of literary history under the two labels "enlightenment" and "myth" brings about superficial clarity to the disregard of confidence-inspiring probe. And his bridge over the gulf between Homer and Ibsen is merely a wobbly catwalk, all the more so because his exposition of the catch- words "enlightenment" and "myth" only weakens Horkheimer and Adorno's already disputable usage. Concerning Thranholm's ana- grammatic analyses of individual poems, in particular, the reader is advised to face them as instances of provocative humor. Should a reader decide instead to read them as unintentionally comic, let alone earnest, propositions, that reader is destined to find them in violation of minimal critical standards.1 All the same, they undeniably entail some 1 A case in point is Thranholm 88-89, on the poem uAt Lunch," where 'violinist' is associated with 'violence'; where 'harpiks' ('resin') allegedly equates 'har pik' ('has penis/cock' ); and where the italicized letters in "Sna/&gt;s af den «kolde Flaske" ( 'a snaps from</page><page sequence="8">Johannes V. Jensen 103 very pungent formulations of literary phenomena, and with all their imperfections they have proven amazingly harmless to Thranholm's total picture of the young Johannes V. Jensen's poems - which appears to be as follows. Before aVed Frokosten" (At Lunch) expands Jensen's mytholog- ical conflicts into a veritable dramatic staging à la Sophocles, the poem "Interferens" (Interference) categorically evinces the idea of a universe subjected to ahistorical laws with suffering as the accepted condition of life. The I of the poem is reduced to a registering entity deprived of every ability to act; its space is an eternally life producing female aspect, and its time an eternally life denying male ditto. Within this universe the Oedipus myth and the submissiveness in the wake of it prescribe disparagement of libido and castration of the self as the prerequisites for attaining durable masculinity. The myth is reiterated as we are told that a conflict-free relation between father and son depends on the bonds between son and mother. It is a painful reiteration, and its artistic form is a sublimated, painful scream. In "Afsked" (Departure), the desire to rid oneself of these traumatic bonds is tempered by an awareness of the impossibility of breaking away. Columbus, who is identified with the Flying Dutchman and his discontented longing, is not an auspicious travelling companion. Like- wise it is the country of gray and rainy days which the poetic ego leaves behind him in "Det rode tra" (The Red Tree). The claustrophobic space of Faust and Don Juan consists of menacing masculinity con- densed into a tiny, hard ball; for the safeguard of ego mobility, this compression is indispensable. Still, it is to no avail for the I as he gets stuck in the exotic quagmire with his "melancholic swamp heart." Although he gets around well geographically, he fails to depart from his home bound mental structure. This leaves him at Memphis Station (Pâ Memphis Station) with an unpleasant alternative: either settle down in Memphis and renounce his quest for spiritual mobility or maintain his integrity in a state of permanent homelessness. Finally in "Hverdagene" (Everyday), the journey as a way of life is dismissed and deproblematized entirely, and unpretentious everyday life given its place instead. But the transition is showy and verbose, stifling the cumbersome longings with dramatic the ice-cold bottle') is said to evidence the poetic ego's return from his meal to a selfsufficient hold on his penisi</page><page sequence="9">104 Scandinavian Studies gestures. The poem gives birth and liberty to man but in the form of a rash agreement with death insofar as "snakketojet har gjort det af med livsdriftens blodende forlaengseP [Thranholm 112] (his gift of the gab has done away with the bleeding longings of Eros). What comes to the fore here at the end of Jensen's young, modernistic period is an alleged poetic humanization along with a step by step withdrawal from physical and mental borders. Thus it is not a humanis- tic breakthrough such as Jensen later was inclined to view it. The process of humanization is not concurrent with or in consequence of his original crossing of borders. On the contrary. In order for the poetic ego to travel into its image of man, it has to discharge its accumulated experiences from previous journeys. Jensen's humanization becomes a fitness for overruling his self-comprehension or, in a different manner of speaking, for yielding its right of way to dehumanizing conditions. He transmits his modernistic experiences as a break-through for an image of man; in reality his interpretation is a break-down of its own strategy sending the image back onto the impulses that once brought it to bear with the implied message that only artfully and with lukewarm compromises can art depict any such image of man. What remains from Jensen's attempt to travel through modernism is a presage of postmodernism, an inability to subsume the conditions of modernity under humanistic values combined with a precarious ability to go on with life and art as if that restriction never occurred. Thranholm in his essay from 1979 on Digte characteristically bombards his reader with arguments that demonstrate the former part of this compound (or the inaptitudes underneath the poet's verbal exuber- ance). Jensen in his long journey after this point was to resume, on a much larger epic scale, his efforts to heal the bleeding wound which was so abruptly bandaged in his shorter and earlier lyrical poems. In Rossel's and Haugaard Jeppesen's two books from 1984 there is little or less fixation with this aspect of Jensen's problematic modernism or with problematic (psycho- )analyses thereof. Hence, we are more likely here to find evidence of the latter part of Jensen's project, his later years' truly elaborate attempt to elevate his modernistic youth and to masquerade the incompleteness of his recreation. His goal is a compre- hensive modern humanism; his means to reach it an Olympic ability to hear the grass grow; and the result of his efforts a majestic preview of today's postmodernism.</page><page sequence="10">Johannes V. Jensen 105 We should keep in mind here the fact of which Jean-François Lyotard has repeatedly reminded us, namely that postmodernism is one specific mode of modernism, not one of its alternatives.2 He describes it as the paradox of pre-future/pre-futurism, the before future or future perfect conditioned by deliberate anamnesis. Postmodernism, then, is (past-)future perfect or the abandonment of the present in the alleged interest of the present. Whether it be profoundly realistic or superficial- ly hissez faire in the final analysis, it essentially signifies a state of time or rather a state of subject and temporality in which the subject never comes up to its expressly projected identity, its dream of a timely existence. Jensen on his long journey and in Den lange Rejse could well hear the grass grow. But from his Olympian standpoint, he either heard it by way of an echo or by way of forceful anticipation. He wanted so much to hear it that he gave up hearing in order to do so. Obsession with modernity, with the (im-)possibility of grasping the now, is a wild- goose chase for which Jensen found no relief in modernism. In the manner of postmodernism, though, he tried to make himself and his readers believe that he could have his goose and still be chasing it. Let me propose a clue to the slightly ambiguous scenery by first assuming that modernity is a sense of simultaneity that modernists and postmodernists agree to consider an essentially disorderly sensation. In a world out of order like this, modernists tend to seek confrontation with the unruly moments (and any other disorder, for that matter); their experiences are truly sensational - and yet to be retained. In postmodernism, like in many of Jensen's myths, the unruly moments appear to be points of departure for wi(l)der, yet quite orderly identi- fications. Seemingly such sensations are no less transient; more obvi- ously, they are less of the senses, if not less sensational. One may well be inclined to chase them although one already has them. Haugaard Jeppesen's treatise deals with exoticism and imperialism (cf. its subtitle) in a broad selection of Jensen's texts read chronolog- ically from the standpoint of ideology and with the "part-time" assistance of other current critical methods. "Imperialism" in Jensen is directly related to the author's travel motif. The term refers most directly to Anglo-Saxon expansionism, but historically and mytholog- 2 See e.g. Zagorka Zivkovic's interview with Lyotard.</page><page sequence="11">106 Scandinavian Studies ically, it originated in the romantic period of the Nordic past. The longing and desire to reach the south and warmth has subsided only recently as an archetypical recollection motivating imperialistic initia- tives. Jeppesen's book admittedly is not a dispassionate work sorting out Jensen's intellectual complications. In siding with the author's artistic and linguistic genius, he feels justified in passing unequivocal value judgments on Jensen's oftentimes obnoxious philosophical and racial biases. A certain measure of self-criticism on the critic's part is meant to modify his own partisan angle of incidence, but, except for occasioning a more readable tract, it does not suggest impartiality in his rendition of Jensen's imperialistic views and attitudes. What it offers is a feel for built in contradictions in Jensen's discourse including the double-dealings and double entries to which his early postmodernism is largely indebted. Why did Jensen travel? What were his incentives, and what did his travels mean to him and his art? In chronological order they brought him from the dream of a Gothic Empire to the actual conquest of the Far East. And here they brought him a notion of mythic consolidation later to be replaced by the experience of imperial collapse. The fairly harmonious journeys of the Nordic race eventually dissolved into cultural heterogeneity and chaotic pluralism. The Gothic Empire and later the United States and England were like parents to Jensen. Identification with them came to constitute his identity as a man. But the relationship is ambivalent. Submissiveness and defiance walk hand in hand. He is tantalized by facts, science, and progress, and suspicious of everything else, particularly aesthetics and words. Nonetheless, and at variance with the natural sciences which he strives to emulate, his method is intuitive and instinctive and his reverence for civilization is not without regrets for the Western disre- gard of primitive cultures. His hatred of mixed blood people is unmistak- able, yet he hails the cross-breed of Germans and Jews as a cultural fortune. On the other hand, his most merciless and unrelenting por- trayals of people are his most captivating artistically. For being an imperialist spokesman, Jensen was overly sensitive and multifaceted. His condescending attitudes apply to blacks (biological- ly), to the proletariat (socially), and to his own female-poetic proclivi- ties. As to the working class, he recommends hunting in fresh air - so its problems will vanish with the wind! Conversely Jensen's devotion to Theodore Roosevelt - the monumental, masculine American - is consis-</page><page sequence="12">Johannes V. Jensen 107 tent with his stylistic celebration of the Russian- Japanese War and with his ideological promotion of an international rural culture. With sweep- ing Gothic declarations, his program for a modern humanism attunes an array of diversified subjects. The history of Denmark personifies the history of civilization and modern culture, and the American nation epitomizes the revival of the lost land, the myth of a self-assured empire on earth. Compared with Oluf Friis's finding of a "realistic" concept of humanism in Jensen, Haugaard Jeppesen identifies quite a "nomi- nalistic" feature. Presumably it denotes a surface structure, loosely rooted in human deep structures, but all the more accorded with structures of postmodernism. Hjulet (The Wheel) is the novel in which Haugaard Jeppesen discerns the embryo of Den lange Rejse^ Jensen's principal imperialistic configuration of victorious Nordic Man and civilization. Once the words were made flesh, in Br&amp;en, it becomes apparent that civilization progresses through man's wrestling with nature. The cold is Dreng's foremost opponent, but his dastardly friend Gjuk is an adversary as well, since he represents regression and decline of cultural dignity. Murder- ing the Brother, therefore, stipulates the necessary condition for Dreng's cultivation as a human being; his struggle against the climate is merely the sufficient condition for his acculturation. Thus his representation of modern humanism is characterized by the fact that his calling is an exercise in the art of the impossible, not the possible; and simulta- neously, his killing of Gjuk marks the border from which most men would recoil, but over which someone has to step lest the battle for civilization be lost. He makes a priceless expansion of his reign - at a high price. Fraternizing with the women of the retarded southerners typically is deemed indecorous if not an act of sacrilege. And deviant relatives like the émigré badgers of Latvia (or monkeys and modern intellectuals) are considered yet another detriment to civilized values and worthy only of slavery in the pursuit of others' cultural fulfillment. According to Jeppesen the discrepancy between the towering types of cultural predominance and the violent idylls of their immediate surroundings is ideologically precarious. And Jensen's liberal center position outside his fiction made it no less precarious. A friend of defense torn between chauvinistic warriors and nihilistic defeatists, Jensen stayed an imperialist, but one whose ideals became increasingly problematic as some of their pre-fascistic ramifications came into view around 1914. In Skibet (The Ship) Haugaard Jeppesen recognizes /m-</page><page sequence="13">108 Scandinavian Studies de -sie ele desperados and bohemians on their staggering search for danger and challenge, but he also finds a lack of redemption in this variety of Nordic spirit transplanted to the south and warmth. First in England, where a sense of reality masters the principle of lust and libido, does self- realization occur and a well-functioning Viking empire comes to fruition. The ideology is still imperialist and designed to browbeat any static and defensive, female and artistic attitudes of the time. But a change is under way which will somewhat allow Jensen to adjust his predilection for feudal peoples and lands to an out-and-out social interpretation of his ideals of evolution. This "up-to-date feudalism" will grant even to lower levels of civilization, under the aegis of higher cultures, a role in the system of cultures. As discussed by Jeppesen, it is an idea of trusteeship hinging on a specific code of humanization, namely one's obligation to defend the wild ones against themselves. Even now the ideology is not foolproof, though. Elegiac and nostalgic tones never cease to compromise the signs of modern, rational control of the world. Purposeful travels run into despair and disillusion; the childish- ness of the easterners and the lousiness of the southerners repeatedly impinge on the maturity of the westerners and the nobility of the northerners. As a malady, this disruption of the natural order of things breaks out with the Great War between the imperial powers of England and Germany. Confusion prevails in the form of an intractable mixture of ethnic prejudice, idealistic views of a world entrenched in material reality, and personal experiences of travelling this world in a state of deep isolation. Eventually this deadlock in the shadow of the war finds expres- sion in Norne-Gœst. the character by this name is a mystic observer of the shift from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age to the Iron Age and the to Viking Period - a remarkable symbol of evolution in that he himself does not change. The whole book entitled Norne-Gsstis a spectacular narrative in which nothing really happens. Gaest in his entirety is the northern European cultural imperialist and the spokesman for the ideology of trusteeship: undoubtedly he was meant to be Jensen's monument to development. As such he is truly petrified! It is never clearly pronounced, yet it is prevalent throughout Jeppesen's book, that the one thing Johannes V. Jensen cannot come to terms with is the one thing he most desperately wants to grasp, i.e. the cultural meaning of evanescent moments and times.3 Den lanße 3 See my review of Oluf Friis's Den unge Johannes V.Jensen.</page><page sequence="14">Johannes V. Jensen 109 Rejse brings out the climax of his efforts in that respect. Its embryonic postmodernism has its monument precisely where its exertions lie in state. The postmodern condition of an incessantly accelerating technological development encountered by an incessantly powerless (or simply ineffectual) apprehension of cultural drawbacks has been eloquently diagnosed in Den lange Rejse. Furthermore, once its progress, as it were, has been brought to a halt - as Jeppesen shows us - Jensen's artistic imagination - not unlike today's postmodernism - purports to circumvent that brutal fact. Thus the anachronism of Det tabte Land, (The Lost Land) should be understood as a matter of humor deployed to persuade the reader that development has taken place (cf. the tension between narrative time and narrated time). In Christof er Columbus, on the other hand, circumvention owes its success primarily to the editor, Aage Marcus, who has zealously suppressed the book's mediating layers of trustee- ship ideology. With only reminders of insensitive colonialism left behind - uncontested - Jensen's idealistic folk school moralism has had to give way to an atavistic notion of Columbus's personal redemption. Circumvention assumes the forms of regression and nostalgia, and the "wild ones" become a category between the white man and the wild animal. In Cimbr ernes Tog (The Raids of the Cimbri) this retrogression in response to development at a standstill reaches a discomforting all- time low. The imperialist outreach is no longer tempered by any ideological moderation; on the contrary, it is associated directly with the ultimate, collective craving for "Blut und Boden" or a shelter in Mother's womb. The negative motivations for the imperial ventures have replaced the positive; southern evil, perversion, and decay are ubiquitous, and even southern assets like philosophy and politics meet with contempt. To vanquish the "other" part of the world has become the white man's burden. Imperialism deprived of development is running sour. Jeppesen has trod his path of interpretation through passages from Jensen's imperialistic texts with some authority. On second thought, the quality of his contextualization and his conceptualization is not perfectly reassuring. Yet taken with a grain of salt and some precaution, they seem to corroborate the following conclusion: Whatever synthe- sizing practice Jensen later entertains, his inability to comprehend the individual point in time, alongside his failing attempt to acknowledge this shortcoming, consistently derails his efforts. His capacity and</page><page sequence="15">110 Scandinavian Studies integrity are too great to provide systematically for an edifying way out of the impasse. But they are hardly great enough to amend his given frame of mind and to forestall his imminent frustration. This dilemma was to become yet another unmistakable part and parcel of the post- modern condition, and so are the concomitants to be classified. The supermarket of indigestible contradictions, compensations, and reiter- ations includes enthusiasm for civilization intermingled with worship for primitivism, bulldozing pragmatism entrapped in melancholic res- ervations, admiration for American technology interspersed with rejec- tions of capitalist anonymity, and an image of the man of the world travelling around the world so as to find a simple point of rest and gravity within himself. As cultural antagonisms turn mellow, dialectics as an antidote against monomania, on the other hand, become less effective. This is the background against which the potent imperialist- turned-modern-humanist is finally turning into a burdened skeptic. With hell being the many (or the others) and paradise the family (or the few), Jensen, in the eyes of Jeppesen, falls shorter and shorter of explanatory clarity the longer he travels in order to find it. As a product of his restless and bewildered times, the later Jensen was not on par with his undaunted youth when he unswervingly admitted to existential problems while using his skepticism to escape their solutions. Now he resigns himself to the opposite priority by permitting his youthful feelings of inferiority to define the most restrictive norms for adult fulfillment (to be chased with neurotic tenacity). To insinuate that Jensen herewith has "settled" is not to accuse him of cowardice, however. To accept that "out" is the way to "home," or that unrest is the way to peace, is merely to usher in a state of modernism later to be referred to as postmodernism. The original experience of modernity has been outweighed and lost its originality; yet it has not been rendered superfluous. It rather requires to be dealt with second-hand - as past future perfect or modernity (re-)considered after the event - which is obviously quite a taxing set of living conditions for modernists to abide by. If the general impression is one of bewilder- ment in Jensen, it is also one of significance, signifying very precisely our cultural scene to this very day. Rossel's book on Johannes V. Jensen is the final - most pared but also most voluminous - volume to be published in Twayne's Series on Scandinavian literature. Its short preface prepares the reader for an</page><page sequence="16">Johannes V. Jensen 111 inviting dialectical structure of composition. After an informative, comprehensive overview of Jensen's "Life and Works" in Chapter I, Chapter II singles out introspection (or introversion) as the dominat- ing and most challenging aspect of the young Jensen's life and works. In reply to this trend, which is most radically represented in Jensen's novels from the 1890s, his Himmerland stories from the turn of the century along with his novels from the next decades (from Mudarne D'Ora, to Gudrun) express an extroversion or "an acceptance of the present and concrete"; this phase is the subject of Chapter III. Last but definitely not least, Chapter IV presents "a mythic unification of these two elements - a sublime synthesis constituting the absolute climax in Jensen's writing." It follows that Rössel has endeavored to submit a balanced, sympho- nious solution to the antagonisms marring Jensen's artistic develop- ment. Taking into account its introductory responsibilities vis-à-vis an English speaking audience, his book's layout combines pedagogically a certain chronological progression with a certain view to Jensen's genre priorities during the process of his artistic "maturation." Ros- sel's decisive emphasis on the mythic genre, e.g. with recurrent disclo- sures of Jensen's mythic visions (8, 45, 57, 60), sometimes strikes the reader as chiefly a self-sustaining strategy. Also it intimates a discrete polemic against younger critics of recent years who have largely dis- missed the preponderance of Jensen's mythic writings from serious consideration. On the one hand, the bulk of Rossel's favorite words of acclaim ("exquisite" and "brilliant[ly]") have invaded his Chapter IV; on the other hand these dissenting younger critics - be they Marxists, psychoanalysts, or existentialists - are either conspicuous by their ab- sence (Thranholm, Giersing, Westergaard-Nielsen, Wivel) or given rather thumbs-down mention (Elbek) in his text. In a formal sense this type of preferential disposition is debatable, i.e. with respect to the introductory objectives of a book like this. In another sense, though, it is precisely the book's alternative focus on travels and journeys, notably Den lange Rejse, that sheds light on Jensen's cosmopolitan stature. Apart from being of general interest to an international readership, this preference entails an explicit discussion of Jensen and America: of novels and stories dealing primarily with Americans or Danish-Americans, of journalism portraying American life and press, and of various ambiguously differentiated images of the land and its people ( 9-10, 19, 27, 62-64). Rössel in his approach to this issue clearly enjoys the direct support of Jensen (2, 16).</page><page sequence="17">112 Scandinavian Studies In so many words, the travelling motif is the elucidating leitmotif of Jensen, stretching above and beyond the book's dialectical structure as depicted above. Listings of journeys and sojourns are second only to events of publication in the opening table of "Chronology"; and travels still occupy the central stage in Chapter I, the focus of which is expressly on the interplay between mental production and change of geographical position. From here the motif extends into the extensive Chapter IV with its lengthy commentary on Den lange Rejse (clearly Rossel's most painstaking discussion of any single composition by Jensen). On this commendable background it is unfortunate that Jensen's lyric poems have been enisled for consideration in a separate chapter. It deprives the lyric material, otherwise held in fairly high esteem by our critic, of a profitable share in his critical design at large. Rössel is fond of facts and reluctant to have his coverage pass over any factual detail. Even the most inferior texts are taken into dutiful account - sometimes with the acceptable purpose of showing the great Jensen's limitations as a writer. But whatever the purpose of rushing the reader's attention from one ultra-short description to another, the inevitable conse- quence is a deplorable sacrifice of profound analyses. The elliptical character of many of Rossel's textual commentaries is even more regrettable because a veritable stronghold of his book is its consistent production of aesthetic-comparative information and evalua- tion. Readers are likely to find this book very helpful in guiding them to the inspiration Jensen received from Swift's misanthropy and in- stilled in his own reflections of World War II (35), in demonstrating the impact of the Faust motif on Dr. Renault (78), the models of Sterne and Heine behind Intermezzo (54), not to mention the broader issues of Jensen's relations to Kipling and Hamsun (6), and the character of his particular contribution of genres such as "Himmerland stories" (66) and "myths" (84-87). But with the analytical commen- taries so conspicuously concerned with minute data, the potential strength of Rossel's comparisons and aesthetic expositions is only infrequently released - especially in Chapter Vwhere e.g. the characteriza- tion of Dißte has little to offer but a vague appraisal of its formal, rhythmic innovation of the poetic -lyrical genre. Strange as it may sound, I am making these critical points in defense of Rossel's book. Unlike Annegret Heitmann in her review in Scandi- navica [(1985): 90-93], I do not find Rossel's so-called "artistic treatment" of Jensen necessarily repugnant to a historical reading of</page><page sequence="18">Johannes V. Jensen 113 the author. To be sure, while other critics, say Jeppesen, have distanced themselves from, say, Den lange Rejse, Rössel gives praise to a text like this on his formal-aesthetical grounds. But to take offense at the implied controversy by repudiating RossePs position would be jump- ing to conclusions. Rather his dissenting approach should merit our attention as an opportunity for critical réévaluation of Jensen's histor- icity - perhaps in terms of the aforementioned postmodernistic (past) future perfect or "hindsight simultaneity." My reservations concerning Rossel's book at least are centered entirely on the shortage of argu- ments behind its many interesting aesthetic judgments and sugges- tions. Moreover, with a considerable part of its analytical substance allotted the discussion of Den lange Rejsey his book on this point exhibits no shortage of nourishing food for thought along the earlier line of argument in this article. Like his fellow critics Rössel is an attentive student of Jensen's ambivalences and ambiguities and of the bearing these intricacies have had on his art as a whole. Travel is connected with longing in a problematic relationship. Longing to travel is longing for faraway places but also longing for home (18, 32). Encompassing Wanderlust as well as homesickness (104, 107), it is depicted as an exposure to new stimuli in an attempt on Jensen's part to overcome the excruciating self-centeredness of his youth (54). As he vacillates between home and abroad (20), his curse and his blessing intermingle (18). In art this personal dilemma, according to himself in Rossel's rendition, has been reflected since the Old Norse sagas as a combined sense of reality and migratory instinct (34); and in Jensen's own works as the motif of Columbus, "the Viking and visionary who leads the migration from Europe to the new continent" (22, quoted directly from Jensen; see also Rössel 72). We find this longing to travel in the character of Mikkel Th0gersen as a longing for happiness or expansion of the soul (55); and echoes of longing can be heard in Jensen's most popular songs (116, 120, 158, 159) Here we begin to sense a harmonizing treatment of the ambivalence, which becomes very apparent in Jensen's glorification of modern technology teams with a professed concern for peasant traditions. This is his artistic outfit for longing for foreign lands while dreaming at the same time of his Himmerland home (see the novel Gudrun, cf. Rössel 56, 65, 81-2). In the character of Lee we find a preliminary represen- tation of this positive solution; Lee is Jensen's alter ego in American</page><page sequence="19">114 Scandinavian Studies disguise (70) and with affinity to the American culture of living and doing (74). And in Den lange Rejse Jensen has ensconced his most sublimated perception of reality - incorporating even the artistic imag- ination rejected by Lee (75). Ultimately the history of technology and the human spirit are ready to meet; their encounter in Braen and the way it was to turn the entire Den lange Rejse into a (pseudo- )scientific substitute for the Bible (116-17). In the above mentioned article by Friis, one of RossePs elected affinities, the meeting ground was called a modern humanism. Rössel elsewhere cites Jensen directly for the more timely term, "Darwinism, in the true, humanistic interpretation of this doctrine" (43) - after having earlier reminded us of Jensen's student familiarity with human- istic education (4). What this synthesis means becomes debatable, though. Rössel cites another passage from Jensen: "The various periods are then seen in the light not of past world views but of that which the present is able to apply them, whereas the spiritual horizon of the past is nevertheless preserved, a mythic method at once both exact and intuitive" (115). In commenting on this quotation, Rössel wonders about the extent to which Jensen based "his epic on a synthesis of the longing motif and his Darwinian theories" or was "to follow one or the other of these possibilities" (115). He opts for interpreting Jensen's testimony in favor of the latter alternative - thereby trying to be loyal to Jensen's declaration of intent. But I wonder if this instance of allegiance is not one of those in want of supplementary discussion. The gamut of concepts enlisted in the quote is presented in a circuitous manner. The past - and its views of the world - are to be seen in the light of the present, whereas the past - and its spiritual horizons - are to be pre- served. Since it is called a mythic method, at once both exact and intuitive, one would normally wonder if the coalescence was premed- itated and the double usage one of simple synonymity. But no wonder: Jensen still just wants to have his wild goose and chase it and wants to have his modernism as postmodernism. "Sâdan er det. Modernismen lsenge leve! I postmodernismens navn," (That is the way it is. Long live modernism. In the name of postmodernism,) says Hans-Jorgen Nielsen in "Midt i en efter-tid" (In the middle of a post-time), his contribution to a round table discussion</page><page sequence="20">Johannes V. Jensen 115 of postmodernism at the Louisiana Museum of Modern Art (64-65). But he also says that, i almindelißhed implicerer post-snakken sâledes et m&amp;ßtißt tab of Historie i den store - overordnede oß totale, udviklinßsoptimistiske oß emfatiske forstand. Oß det vil oßsa siße: Tab af et samlende centrait perspektiv. Centralperspektiv, slet oß ret. (64-65) (in general the post-talk thus implies a gigantic loss of History in the magnificent - superior and total, optimistic, and emphatic sense. Which also means a loss of a unifying central perspective. Central perspective plain and proper.) Notwithstanding Jensen's efforts in Den lange Rejse to establish precisely a total and superior, evolutionary, optimistic, and central perspective, to label him an early postmodernist equals considering his most deliberate intentions for being in vain, in fact strikingly counter- productive inasmuch as they fall under the spell of the very same modernity which they endeavored to suppress and control. RossePs book is tacitly consistent with this hypothesis; and the fact that it does not openly refer to postmodernism only supports the argument. The idea, of course, is not to market conventional wisdom in a more fashionable manner, but to direct attention to hitherto obscure compli- cations in Den lange Rejse's composition and treatment of issues of temporality. I have already cited Rössel concerning his mention of Jensen's dilemma of basing his epic on the longing motif or on the evolutionary theory - or on a synthesis of both. Later Rössel asserts that The Long Journey "is a collection of mythic texts, lyrical fantasies with inserted essays, held together not by a pervasive plot but by a leitmotif (138). He even goes as far as to call it, "completely irrelevant to regard Den lange Rejse as a novel with a traditional plot development centered around the adventures of a hero. If one were to speak of a hero it would have to be the very longing incarnate in various persons, with its symbolic climax in the Norne-Gaest/Columbus figure" (139). So we have "longing as a point of departure for the described expansion in time and space and as an existential matter, a basic condition of life" (138). But what do we have in between the basic condition of life and the departure for a better life? Basically, "repeti- tions of certain episodes . . . where the very repetition emphasizes their universality" ( 1 39). There is no reason to expostulate with Rössel,</page><page sequence="21">116 Scandinavian Studies as did Heitmann, about his juxtaposition of "universality " and course of events in Den lange Rejse. At least the term "universality" captures the absence of "real" historical development in the book, and I believe that if the concept were more gingerly tagged so-called "universality," the postmodernist^ problematics that I have addressed above would emerge quite readily from RossePs analysis. First Rössel insists on Jensen's "formidable ability to identify with other periods and conditions from an intuitive point of departure" (139); but secondly he admits to a certain fatigue on Jensen's part, which nonetheless applies to neither the mythic portions of his book, nor to its passages of pure description of nature. In fact, within these particular types of text "Jensen's artistry reaches unsurpassable quali- ties" (139). In other words Jensen's genius is his sporadically occur- ring intuitiveness. Conversely, what he himself described as "the unifying point of view . . . the theory of evolution applied to the past as well" (Rössel 1 1 5), is either repetitious and exhausted in its presence or directly conspicuous by its absence, according to Rössel. Hence, the intensity of narrative time, the hypostatized moments, rests on the breakdown of narrated time, the asserted development. The presence of the former is, indeed, what signifies the absence of the latter. The narrative thus yields to a situationalism only pretendedly capable of replacing it. For example, Jensen is from the outset expressly anti- Nietzschean, anti-violence, anti-lust-for-power, while in favor of peace and progress. Yet, despite the author's many proclamations, both Nome Gaest and Columbus are children of the 1890s, personifying the long journey and animating the spirit of travel as Nietzschean loners, like Fyr and Dreng and Hvidbjorn before them. The substance and only certainty of the Columbus myth is its impermanence. Anything distant was close to this Flying Dutchman on his Phantom Ship; on the other hand, his paradise was just a dream. Everything is transitory but the fact that transitions - travels - will never cease. Darwinian humanism, which was to balance Jensen's longing, only sets it free, like modernism is being freed by postmodernism's attempt to absorb it. The experience of time in Den lange Rejse is not insepara- ble from that of development, but it is all the more inseparable from a sense of the past which development ought to have left in the dust. Thus we come back to the (past) future perfect where the future is precisely what throws our perception back to the past. This applies to Fyr who considers progress defenseless against the implacable time (Rössel 1 18), but it applies to Columbus too. Whether in the old world</page><page sequence="22">Johannes V. Jensen 117 or the new world, the young man runs away from life (time) whereas later in life it is the other way around (Rössel 126). Jensen's "man in time" is endowed with an ideological, ideological frame of mind, but the future he longs for all the same becomes identical with the past that preempted his longing for this future in the first place. Jensen's modernism as an instrument for opposing modernity by surpassing it, or being with it while being against it, becomes postmodernism or part of modernity as it becomes ui pagt med historiens gang, samtidig med at de[n] [modernism] bevseger sig baglaens" [Nielsen 65] (attuned to the rhythm of history, while at the same time [modernism is] moving backward). Retreating to the past becomes less painful - and less histori- cal - if not less forgivable when the inducement is an orientation to- wards the future. So, while modernism was a clash with modernity, postmodernism is less pretentious in that it accepts modernity as that with which modernism has clashed. In Den lange Rejse^ travel never leads to the kind of meaningfulness its characters set out to find. It never puts impermanence or longing for fulfillment to rest. In return, this very fact is what constantly relieves the travellers of an even worse experience - that of inescapable meaning- lessness in Memphis, Tennessee (or any other place). In conclusion: the postmodern quality of Jensen's later myths, especially Den lange Rejsey is their aptitude for recognizing modernity while circumventing it. Darwinian travel through the centuries and species gets the imperma- nence across. Already Dreng was yearning beyond the limits of his own existence (Rössel 120). He was the first to reminisce about the past with some sense of the future - or to have found a way to escape the present without looking like an escapist. Perhaps without even being one. Jensen's humanism in Den lange Rejse is an ideology promoting the idea of man - reborn in nature and with the mark of divine development on his forehead (Friis 263-64); in less poetic formulations, however, it combines the longing for the lost land and the journey to reclaim its territory with an unholy alliance of technological optimism, imperialist self-righteousness, and racist prejudice (Bondebjerg 98-99). A flawed humanism, even its positive expressions have proven self-contradictory. Essentially it included a dream about ending the long journey with a view to travelling on location instead and with a pledge to grow - up and in depth - rather than simply expand. All the same it remains an umbrella under which a boisterous or otherwise peculiar group of</page><page sequence="23">118 Scandinavian Studies topics have assembled: "dansk almuekultur, engelsk-amerikansk fri- luftsbevaegelse, Theodore Roosevelt, Grundtvig, Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci, en tysk storvildtjaeger og kanonfotograf i 0stafrika, Niels Finsen og meget andet tset sammenhsengende" [Jeppesen 99] (Danish rural culture, English -American open-air movement, Theodore Roosevelt, Grundtvig, Darwin, Leonardo da Vinci, a German big game hunter and street photographer in East Africa, Niels Finsen, and many other closely related subjects). One might say that Jensen's humanism subscribes to the qualitative growth of man with such restless vigor that the very idea runs itself down. There was to be no such growth because there was to be no end to the long journey. A well-intentioned slogan, humanism nonetheless fails to reconcile Jensen's comprehensive view of the world with his records of actual human experiences. I have earlier referred to the constitution of progress within Den lange Rejse's history of mankind as a matter of mastering the art of the impossible. But the art is one thing; implementation thereof is another. For mastering the former the idea of development will probably do; for enforcing the latter, the achievements of men in their struggle with nature, only the reality of myth will suffice. Development is fine, but do people develop? And if so, do they simply develop? Both Dreng and Hvidbjorn in Braen partake in Jensen's dilemma. Living in the moment like an animal is inconsistent with progress. However, only Dreng takes up the gauntlet and counteracts the natural course of events. His obstinacies make him the artist of the impossible and the first man. But regardless of this attitude all of his efforts are aimed at avenging the expulsion of the lower creatures from the lost land of childhood. Even though his own conduct is contrary to his fellow animals, his "childhood" is the same as theirs. While in place of their spontaneous life in the moment he enjoys access to cognition, if not cogency, the ties between his cultural stage and the natural condi- tions of animal life have been subconsciously preserved. Man's cultural alternative to nature is more than competitive: it is supposed to make up fully for this vestigial precursor of culture. Only need will trigger the art of the impossible; on the other hand man's potentials are without any preconceived limits. His initial belief in a tangible enemy, the Cold, recedes from his imagination, leaving simply the fight for a better place than this one as the impetus of his activities. To illuminate the perplexity caused by the discovery of the fire, this cultural victory over nature and cold, Den lange Rejse unfolds a</page><page sequence="24">Johannes V. Jensen 119 threefold mythic vision (135-41). The fire brings back life and time, but to whom? Has the land of childhood actually returned? And if so, who is receiving the donation? Am I, Dreng, the recipient? And if so, am I the one I am or the one I was? In the inserted visions we first relive the endless "now" preceding Dreng's appearance with his conscious feel for time. The background is an underwater vision of the boundless moment called eternity, the depth of time within the depth of nature. The foreground is an opening of this timeless past into a future perfect. Secondly, and before eternity evaporates, mankind arises; and with the momentary "now" displacing the endless past, the most primitive forms of existence yield the right of way to forms of human nature. Thirdly, and at the end of this latter vision, the primordial image of eternity seems to rebound with an anthropomorphic complexion. From eternity to humaness to humane eternity - Jensen's formula for Prometheus unbound has come full circle. On a different level, Hvidbj0rn acts in continuation of Dreng as he takes himself and his people across their borders against their will. His particular longing is aroused by an image of the sea, representing the infinite but at the same time barring human pursuits. Hvidbjorn ven- tures a Solomonic solution to the problem by staying where he is while spawning plans for moving away. In order for him to fathom the ends of his longings, the land and the woods he has lost, he has to look through the mirror of his life: to detect the core of his character he must look beyond its present limits. As one might expect, his efforts come to naught as his woods disappear both literally and figuratively (162). Unlike his woman, he feels he has everything to gain by travelling. He can only become, never be; the cornucopia of nature precipitates him to set out and never settle. His encounters with paradise only make him prophesy the experience of Columbus that paradise is not the home for man. In the final analysis he is left in a conflict with himself. The good things he purported to want he wants to leave; yet when capable of setting his plans afloat he decides to stay. The very idea of travelling, while steadily suspended between topical circumstances, is only consum- mated under pressure from necessity. The galley ship becomes the perfect symbol of the long journey across European shores and even further, since at the same time it takes the traveller back home to the birthplace of his Nordic culture, the starting point for his wider spiritual journey. His limits are imposed not by the world but by himself (195). At this juncture Jensen's humanistic vision collapses. He elevates his characters to divinity, and Hvidbjorn, for one, only accedes to benefac-</page><page sequence="25">120 Scandinavian Studies tions from higher powers. Unlike Fyr, who defied the gods, Hvidbjorn is favored by them. But they both believe in them. And while Dreng concluded that nothing stood in his way, he himself became like the god Odin. Similarly Hvidbjorn is reminiscent of Thor. This is humanity growing up(wards), not down(wards). In contempt of the fact that travelling in this world may be brought to a close, the reader is granted a cosmic image of travelling going on forever (190). At the end (literally at the end of Bmen), time gets struck from the record of Jensen's Denmark. Travelling on the spot and gaining momentum by subjecting the elusive moment to eternity is the capstone of Jensen's promulgation of modern humanism. The fact that augmentation of human experiences is insignificant unless it leads away from this world into a world of religion, myth, and irrationality, uncovers a strictly artificial upper hand with existential matters on our author's part. His composition of wholeness, development, and cosmic poise merely alleviates perturbing ordeals and artistic expressions of these. Jensen has erected his most imperative constructions on the basis of his most insurmountable stumbling blocks. Let me be even more specific and cite from Asbjorn Aarnes's article "Humanisme idag?": Humanisme, slikjeßser det, kommer ikke av seßselv, ved at vi blott oß hart lever oß virker i tiden. Den nevner en ranß vi knytter til det a v&amp;re menneske, en betingelse vi stiller ; en verdi vi stadf ester. - Afskriver vi ideen om rang, betinßelse oß verdi - ut over det à eksistere oß overleve, star det for meß som nihilisme. (15) (Humanism, as I perceive it, does not follow by itself, by the simple fact that we live and work in the course of time. It signifies a rank attached to our existence as human beings, a condition we impose, a value we affirm. If we write off the idea of rank, condi tionality, and value - beyond our mere existence and survival - we have in my view subscribed to nihilism.) It seems fair to say that a crucial incentive behind the long journey has been Jensen's aversion to ethical relativism and nihilism. But it also seems fair to add that precisely the countermeasures he has taken in Den lunge Rejse are destined to end in his own goal. Den lange Rejse* s conception of "rank," "conditionality," and "value" is largely para- doxical and problematic: either ideologically forceful and artistically superficial or vice versa. What comes out of Jensen's grandiose show- down with nihilism and other offshoots of modernity is not the</page><page sequence="26">Johannes V. Jensen 121 forbidding strength of these "qualifications" per se, but their capacity for resisting the antidote of his outspoken "metafysiske helhedsska- bende sammentaenkninger." Consequently, the long journey as the ideological metaphor for mankind's innermost quest for growing by doing the impossible becomes an impossible art(ifice) in a much more treacherous sense. As a journey of travel it comes to a final halt, while as a journey of longing it continues indefinitely. In other words, the execution of growth takes place in a sphere of artistic freedom where the moment can expand into eternity, where the future can command the past, where the experience of transgressing borders can be obtained on location, and where progression and regression band together. With a view to the fact that in this sphere everything and nothing can happen, the concept of humanism here becomes the respectable tool for handling modernity as if it were no longer modernity but already/only postmodernity. In this paper I have so far seen fit to invite three recent critiques of Jensen to bolster - with their complementary testimonies - the above scenario. That they do not appear to follow suit at first glance is not surprising considering their individual objectives. Thranholm and Jep- pesen have the same recourse, although with different emphases (psycho- analytical patterns and socio-historical factors, respectively) and their shared concern is chiefly with Jensen's debilitating escapes from modernity. By contrast, on aesthetic grounds Rössel gives reason to believe that some of these manoeuvres are, indeed, indebted to Jens- en's artistic capacity. My point has been that we are facing two sides of the same coin and that we should tend to the matter accordingly. Heitmann in her review of Jeppesen and Rössel gives credit to the former's side at the cost of the latter's. Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen in his review holds the opposite view. It has not been the purpose of my own perusal to engage in such disagreements, rather to make the three scholars under review communicate beyond their self-imposed confines so as to generate a dialogue that may sound like a postmodern supermarket of disparate parlandos but underneath its surface is genu- inely responsive to succinctly modernistic dilemmas. Without pretending to review our authors' sins and virtues in excess of what this undeclared exchange merits, I should like to sum up my discussion of Thranholm, Jeppesen, and Rössel by briefly mentioning a couple of technical findings. On the one hand Thranholm's critical stance has penetrated even his layout with its sloppy bibliography, casual references, inadequate notes, etc. A haphazard but quite weighty</page><page sequence="27">122 Scandinavian Studies selection of post-Freudian psycho-sociology confronts a most rudimenta- ry observance of previous research in Jensen. The tendency of Thran- holm's book is unmistakably clear. On the other hand, the meticulous notes, index, and annotated bibliography in RossePs book is not only indicative of a different kind of work ethic and a different audience (and culture of reception), it also betokens a different set of intellectual priorities. I have already tried to tackle some specific priorities of his; suffice it to add that in terms of preferences, his monograph with its frame of reference exclusively determined by the canon of Jensen scholarship is in marked contradistinction to Thranholm's essay. ( Jeppesen with his quite elaborate use of secondary literature on Jensen and his rather moderate reliance on other walks of humanistic research defends a methodological middle ground.) Essentially I want to pass this tempting opportunity to spell out criteria for evaluating critical texts. Certainly the many typos in Thran- holm and the few in Rössel should not allude to different levels of sophistication - on any level. Rather, these instances of dissimilar critical practices might facilitate a tentative distinction between critics holding the author accountable for things that happened behind his back, his intentions, and his language and critics with an ability to heed his intrinsic merits: aesthetical, biographical, and comparative procedures are here at issue. After all, it should not be forgotten that drilling the root canal and crowning the tooth with gold can be integral parts of the same dental work. Nor should the fact fall into oblivion that Jensen did not transform sublime nihilism into positivity of lower order. His positivity was not of lower but of later order, post-order. And he did not transform but confirm the subtleties of his nihilism. As an early case of postmodernism it remained a part of his modernism. In other words, his humanism begins where his self-revelations end. As Lyotard pointed out, modernism is inescapable and postmodernism is the proof of this rule, not the exception that confirms it. It is tempting, therefore, to read Jensen's long journey through the history and pre-history of mankind as a foreboding good-bye to the historical dimension - an unwitting verdict by a man at his wits end. While this reading has been quite loyal to the premises on which the above Jensen studies rest, Erik M. Christensen in his article "Jensen anarkist?" is admittedly at absolute variance with scholars like Bonde- bjerg and Jeppesen. The reason is that he, unlike these precursors,</page><page sequence="28">Johannes V. Jensen 123 considers Jensen's poetics to be aimed at influencing the reader to act politically rather than merely representing the poet. This is to say that poetic influence is a matter of moral value; moreover, that the moral value is meant to be activated in the reader and not simply to be viewed in the eye of the beholder. In short, literature by Johannes V. Jensen is a deliberate provocation, "Ultimately, you write in order to make something happen." The philosophy of life embedded in this poetics should be labeled "anarchistic " inasmuch as it combines the maximum degree of individ- ual freedom with the full potential for human community and fellow- ship. It is superior to racial and national differences which, in turn, are superior to class differences and struggles - capitalists and proponents of socialism consuming the same meal in the image of the same bird of prey. And it repeatedly emphasizes the actual reality in the process of human development - with due respect to the law of change. To reconcile my own reading of Jensen with that of Christensen - and I do believe our different expositions of recent Jensen scholarship warrant such reconciliation - let me resort to Jean-Paul Sartre's second philosophy, especially as it is rendered in his book Revolt i dikt. Applying Sartre's "method" to Christensen's article appears to provide a meeting ground, administered by dialectics, for anarchism and postmodernism. Unlike Kierkegaard but much like Jensen in Christensen's analysis, Sartre is keen on ridding the individual of solitude, and incorporating her in a system of social relations. To understand that position, however, is more than a matter of responding to artistic expressions; it is to accept an inducement for social and political action. Man is the subject and the object of history, and Sartre is intent on reconciling these two historical dimensions. His project is to totalize historical conditions in such a manner as to make the total exceed the sum of particular ingredients and yet make this sum available for analytical mapping. Within this anthropology, life is perceived as dynamic praxis, i.e., as constant activity and development, whereby e.g. accomplished acts of human creativity, "expressions" or "le práctico-inerte," as it were, incessantly tend towards sub-totalizations. In the process of further totalization, this assemblage of, say, artistic expressions, is typically subjected to another author's "reinteriorization," leaving yet a third author with an "impulse" for influential transmissions addressed to author number four, etc.</page><page sequence="29">124 Scandinavian Studies With regard to Christensen's idea of Jensen's anarchistic project, this analysis seems to highlight the significance of Jensen's writings as provocative contributions to human praxis. But at the same time it underscores that praxis is not a matter of cause and effect but a question of final conceptualization. It includes political propositions, indeed, but never distinct from artistic expressions. What appears to be a call for political action at a certain level is a moment of self-expression on another, and only within the dialectic process of totalization are the two dimensions historically meaningful. Jensen's early postmodernism and late anarchism are part and parcel of the same historical property and discourse. As far as the progression of human creativity is concerned - the subject dimension - transformations of the perfect (det gestaltade) into the present participle (jjestaltandet) is at stake. But as far as the regression and neo-conservative trend of the process goes, the future perfect, readily taking us from the past to the future through historical oblivion, is the focal point. This brings me back to my earlier conclusion that Jensen's long journey through the history and prehistory of mankind was a forebod- ing good-bye to the historical dimension. According to Brandell's Sartre, the historical dimension is indispensable for human understand- ing, because any other angle of incidence falls short of its concept of totalization. Jensen in his Den lange Rejse has opted for precisely this dimension for precisely the same reason but nevertheless fallen short of its dialectical requirements. Its full scale efforts allegedly aspire to add up a series of sub-totalizations, but eventually they amount to merely a postmodern verdict. I spoke earlier about a verdict by a man at his wits end. I might well and with due respect to Christensen have said a man at the end of his anarchism. More important, though, than replacing one wording with another, is the inclusion of the reader's experience alongside the author's expression of himself in the total comprehension of the literary process. Putting Jensen into this position has elicited a foreseeable controversy between philosophically distant partners of the critical enterprise. It is all the more appropriate, therefore, to view the disparity of scholarly and critical contributions from a totalizing standpoint. Unless we recognize the prevailing dimension of postmodernism in this major writer, while maintaining the historical dimension as our frame of reference, we are likely to cause his unsuccessful concern with human- ism and history to prevail upon us as well.</page><page sequence="30">Johannes V. Jensen 125 Support for this scenario seems available also in the most recent book-length contribution to Jensen scholarship, Poul Bager's analysis of Konsens Fald (The Fall of the King). It deals explicitly with its text as a historical novel by further discussing Oluf Friis's extensive documentation of its sources and the implications these must have for Jensen's work. Like Thranholm in his chapter on Jensen, but unlike the rest of the preceding critiques on Jensen, Bager confines himself to a particular segment of Jensen's production. This means that despite their almost opposite conclusions, Thranholm and Bager both deliver rather compact presentations of Jensen's dichotomies. In Kongens Faldy according to Bager, Jensen thus confronts an old, logocentric world subjected to eternity and absolute truths with a modern world of facts and disillusionment, and in subsequent works his torn perceptions pivot directly on the travel motif and the Columbus character (Bager 18-19). Konsens Fald has set the stage for an endless longing for other places and for the lasting conclusion that after that longing has finally faded, homelessness is all that man has left. The manner in which Bager negotiates the historical dimension of this novel with Jensen's apparently modernistic inclinations is well in tune with the discussion of Jensen's early postmodernism entertained in this paper and with the inferences drawn from the totalizing stand- point of Christensen's article. Furthermore, Bager's monograph is suited to underscore the course of arguments leading to the overall perspective, although the scholar himself has refrained from such trans- monographic outlooks. If indeed he presents the genesis of Jensen's postmodernism in a nutshell, which I believe he does, he apparently does so implicitly, if not inadvertently. To begin with, Bager (59-60) comments on the genre of Kongens Fald by appreciating the proposition that it is not a historical novel at all but rather a gathering of myths, radiating from a shared inspiration (a characterization which is even more commonly ascribed to Den lange Rejse). While this idea serves the allegedly disjointed and incomplete configuration of the text at hand quite well, Bager deems it incompat- ible with more recent revelations of Jensen's sources (presumably Oluf Friis's and his own) and with the many novelistic potentials it has in store. One might say that its historical framework provides for a modernistic novel, but that its discourse is on the verge of the genre and inclining towards postmodernism. This discrepancy unfolds as Bager investigates the main character of Mikkel Thogersen.

(70) (a constructive and progressive novel, prosecuting Troels-Lund's idea that the world after Copernicus has changed and become inconceivable beyond those small, animating facts [which man is uniquely able to fathom or. which are the only facts man can fathom?]. But this is not the way Jensen has worked it out. Rather, he has turned Konßens Fald into a critical - and complicated - novel, opposed to the atmosphere of defeat and the spirit of the 1890s or to what he was later to identify with "the destiny of the Danes." Mikkel Thogersen's recent insight thus does not come to fruition. In fact, Jensen makes him relapse into the old idealist, dreamer, climber, and assailant, who is defiant - if only painfully - of his senses, and of time and death, in this order of appear- ance. Jensen himself, on the other hand, perceives his character in the light of the insight just mentioned, and this is what brings about the distance between the character and the author and what enables Jensen to visualize and criticize his own spiritual background with all its good and bad qualities.) Save for the redundant and ambiguous sentence (translated in brackets above), this is quite a forceful mapping of the interrelationship between modernism and postmodernism in Jensen. Konsens Fald is based on traumatic and conflicting modernistic experiences, but it holds the potential for liberating itself from these experiences without discarding them. Its discourse is truly situated between modernism and postmodernism. In his final remarks (152), Bager briefly widens his perspective to address other works by Jensen from the turn of the century. In more programmatic form Jensen here submits the view that incurable long- ing for eternal values and lost lands is not merely an empty transcen-</page><page sequence="32">Johannes V. Jensen 127 dcncc but a potential propellant for work and expansion within reality here and now. As mentioned earlier, proposals of this nature were firmly rejected by Jörgen Elbek as calls for positivity of lower existential order. Whether or not Bager would accept the verdict on Elbek's own premises is not clear. His concerns are more historical, and while he probably does not dispute the historical lessons to be learned about the climate of the 1890s in Konsens Fald as it stands, he obviously feels compelled to remind us that frustration was not the only conceivable response to the circumstances under Jensen's artistic scrutiny. In other words, as also mentioned earlier, postmodernism in not modernism of a lower order but of a different order. That said, the fact remains that Jensen's postmodern visions, even when enshrined in works of fiction, rarely escaped programmatic idioms. Relaxing from the imposition of history remained an artificial and opinionated maneuver in Jensen's case, and his postmodernism was merely one under way. The irony at this post postmodern writing is that our dilemma has become his in reverse: not deliberately to refrain from history but deliberately to reclaim it. And the ultimate irony is that, at least thus far, our efforts have been no less artificial than his were.4 4 The remarkable number of scholarly and popular books on historical subjects that has reached the public in Denmark and other countries in recent years seems to confirm rather than contradict the dismissal of the historical dimension.</page><page sequence="33">128 Scandinavian Studies Works Cited Aarnes, Asbjorn.
