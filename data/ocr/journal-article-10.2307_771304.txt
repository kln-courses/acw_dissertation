<plain_text><page sequence="1">PARNASSUS - THE TREE OF JESSE AND ORIENTAL PARALLELS BY ANANDA K. COOMARASWAMY HE chapter on this subject in Arthur Watson's admirable and long awaited monograph on the Early Iconography of the Tree of Jesse (Oxford, 1934) is of particular in- terest. Let me say in the first place that although the formula appears rather suddenly in Christian art in the eleventh cen- tury, I have no wish to demonstrate or even to argue for an Indian or otherwise specifically Oriental origin at that time, my view being rather that we have here a single example of the many close parallels between mediaeval Christian and Oriental thought and symbolism which are best understood by an ulti- mate derivation of both from a common source (of which our earliest knowledge is, perhaps, Sumerian); diversities of formulation representing as it were the dialects of one spirit- ual tradition common to humanity. From this point of view there is no difficulty in assimilating Isaiah, XI, 1-3 to the Vedic texts cited in my "Tree of Jesse and Indian Parallels or Sources" (Art Bulletin, Vol. XI), without suggesting any derivation of one text from the other. In just the same way Exodus XIV corresponds to Rg Veda III, 3 3 and VII, 18 (in both cases the chosen people cross the Waters in chariots, the Waters lending themselves to easy passage, while the enemy attempting to follow is destroyed by the returning torrent); and Genesis, 1, 2, especially as understood by some mediaeval writers, e.g. Ulrich Engelberti "the Spirit of God moves ovet the Waters warming (fovens) and forming all things,"' with Aitareya Aranyaka, II, 4, 3, "He glowed upon the Waters, and from the Waters that were set aglow a form was born," and ib. II, 2, 1, "He who glows is the Spiritus." Parallels of this sort could be indefinitely multiplied, and cannot be acci- dental.2 Certain of the problems can be very profitably envisaged from this point of view. We hold for example that the Vedic Tree proceeding from the navel of Varuna (deity preemi- nently of the waters), the Mahabhdrata3 conception of the Birth of Brahma (and corresponding iconography, the lotus rising from the navel of Nirayana, who rests in and upon the Waters), and the Biziklik representation (in which the lotus-Tree rises directly from the Waters)4 are all true par- allels to the Tree of Jesse, which presents an analogous range of variations and if none of the latter (unless possibly Wat- son's P1. II, which in any case exhibits "the tree as having a deeper root than Jesse himself") shows the Waters, the same applies to the Burmese representation (Watson's P1. XXXIX) and some others where there is no express indication of the underlying Waters. Needless to say that the Waters stand for potentiality as distinguished from act, and it makes little difference whether the roots of the Tree are represented as outspread in the Waters themselves, or in a Ground, whether anthropomorphic or otherwise, that rests upon or in the Waters; in either case, both Ground and Waters are to be understood. The variety in formulation in this respect appears already in the Rg Veda; in I, 182, 7 "the Tree stands in the midst of the Flood" (this corresponds to the Haoma- tree that is in the midst of Vourukasha, where the kar-fish swims, in Zoroastrian tradition, Bundahi' XVIII, Yasna, XLII, 4, etc.); in I, 24, 7 "its Ground is above," its oriflames or branches tending downwards, upari budhna here, and ird- hva mzla in Katha Up., VI, 1 corresponding to Bocccacio's "Genealogical Tree of the Gods" in celum versa, radice cited by Watson, p. 45, and to the Zohar passage at the beginning of the section Beha' Alotheka, "Now the Tree of Life ex- ii lit Nit puilg. sl ism.. can M, in MAN ij T *i:?il Tri:i- s!lil: _w__ WK 4N.

Ulrich Engelberti of Strassburg died A.D. 1277. 2 As the point is of importance, I give one more instance of what is meant by a parallel that need not, and generally speaking, does not imply "influence"; compare Nitya Sistra, II, 5 (Indian, ca. 4th century A.D.) "All the activities of the angels, whether at home in their own places or abroad in the breaths of life, are intellectually emanated; those of men are put forth by conscious effort; therefore it is that the works to be done by men are defined in detail," with (1) Plotinus, Enneads, IV, 3, 18 "Souls in the Supreme operate without reasoning . . . all their acts must fall into place by sheer force of their nature," (2) Gregory, Moral. II, "Angels do not go abroad in such a manner as to lose the delights of in- ward contemplation," (3) St. Thomas, Sum. Theol., I, q. 112, a. 1 ad 3, "We give ourselves to action through the sensitive faculties, the action of which when intense impedes the action of the intellectual power. An angel, on the contrary, regulates his exterior actions by the intellectual operation alone," and (4) Eckhart, 1, 5, "Man requires many instruments for his external works; much preparation is needed ere he can bring them forth as he has imagined them . . . More exalted are the angels, who need less means for their works and have fewer images." 3 Mr. Watson slips into the error, unimportant for present purposes, of calling this the "Burmiese" Mahabhirata; the texts and iconography alike are of Indian origin. 4 It is worth noting that the two dragons knotted about the "waist" of the fasces, vajra, or "thunderbolt" which in the Baziiklik representation divides the upper from the lower range (and corresponds to the Vedic skambha and Gnostic sthauros that at once divides and connects Heaven and Earth) are reminiscent of the paired dragons or nigas that guard the Tree of Life in a well-known Indus Valley seal, often reproduced, e.g. in my History of Indian and Indonesian Art, Fig. 6. cf. Fig. 243 in Griin- wedel's Altbuddhistische Kultstatten in Chinesisch-Turkistan. Parallels in Greek mythology will readily suggest themselves.

Again in the Gupta representation at Deogarh the stem of the lotus that supports Brahma is not directly con- nected with the navel of Ndrayana, but rises behind him, and this often happens in the representations of the Tree of Jesse. Still, the connection of the root with the navel is, even cor- rect formulation, and this will be evident if we reflect that the "stem" after all represents the fruition of the "seed" of Jesse, as is especially evident when the Tree becomes a veritable geneology, and that the navel according to all ancient tradi- tion both Western and Eastern is the progenitive centre and a centre in every sense of the word, and as such the starting point of manifestation. The common significance of the Occidental and Oriental trees becomes most evident when we recall that the rose and lotus are equivalent symbols, and observe that the Christian virga, often hermeneutically assimilated to "virgo," is identi- fied with the Virgin as being the ground of the divine mani- festation, just as in Oriental art the lotus is the earth or ground of any such manifestation. When in Western art there are doves on the branches (as in the Dijon MS. illus- tration cited by Kingsley Porter, Art Bulletin, VII, p. 10, Note 2, cf. the mosaic cross in the vault of the apse of S. Clemente in Rome, where the doves are set in the shaft and arms of a cross which rises from a flower provided with pro- liferating branches like those of a Jesse Tree) this corresponds exactly to Rg Veda, I, 164, 21 "There the Fairwings (angels) chant their share of aeviternity," X, 91, 2 where "Agni, as a bird, finds a home in every tree," Brhaddranyaka Up., IV, 3, 2 where "The Swan, the Golden Person, by the Spirit wards His lower nest," and Dante, Paradiso, XVIII, 110, "power that is form unto the nests." Enough has been said, I think, to prove that the funda- mental ideologies underlying the Eastern and Western rep- resentations are the same; and where borrowing is improbable, and independent origin unlikely because of the complexity of the symbol itself, the theory of an ultimately common source can hardly be avoided. Mr. Watson remarks that "The diffi- culty in establishing a relationship between Oriental trees and the Tree of Jesse is that, although we may find striking par- allels, it is difficult or impossible to demonstrate connecting links" (p. 65). The same difficulty presents itself if we try to connect Isaiah XI, 1-3 with the late mediaeval iconography by documentary links. As to this, we can only say with Andrae (Die ionische Sdiule, Bauform oder Symbol? Berlin, 1933, p. 66) that in fact "a formal symbol can remain alive not only for millennia, but . . . it can spring into life again after an interruption of thousands of years"; and add that, while a symbol as such can survive mechanically in tradi- tional arts for an indefinite period, the transmission of symbols together with that of their metaphysical significance belongs for the most part to oral and initiatory teachings which by their very nature leave no documentary traces; and it is just because of this that symbols and their interpretation so often seem to emerge or rdemerge simultaneously at some given mo- ment or in some given place as if from nowhere. In the present case it is not impossible that the transmission of a doctrine of the Tree of Jesse had taken place in Kabbalistic circles; the Zohar (e.g. Vol. V, pp. 38, 203, 221, in the Simon and Sperling version) is often most informative as to the Tree of Life, or Trees of Life and Death, and that the former is above the latter may be compared with the Biizaiklik rep- resentation, in which the lotus grounds of the mundane and heavenly levels of being are distinguished by position in the same sense. The present note is not a review of Watson's monograph, and cannot pretend to do justice to it as a whole. Never- theless, in connection with the Chapter entitled "References in Literature to Relevant Imagery," it seems worth while to 49 Ant S. LEONARDO IN ARCETRI XII CENTURY Detail of Pulpit--Courtesy Art Bulletin cite from St. Bernard, De Adventu Domini, II, 4 "From these passages I think it now manifest what is the stem proceed- ing from the root of Jesse, and what is the flower on which reposeth the Holy Spirit. For the Virgin Mother of God is the stem, her Son is the flower . . . O Virgin! stem of the highest, to what a summit thou liftest on high thy holiness! even to Him that sitteth on the throne, even to the Lord in His majesty . .. 0O true tree of life, which alone was worthy to bear the fruit of salvation!"' As St. Bernard died A.D. 1153, and the passages cited being taken from a sermon sug- gest that the theme cannot have been one altogether unfamil- iar when the sermon was preached, the text is undoubtedly pertinent to the problem of the iconography; and one may suspect that a thorough search of the patristic literature would yield more material of the same sort. An although of later date, reference may be made to Eckhart's sermon, No. LXI in the Evans version, in which he says "Our philosophers teach that the sun draws the flowers out of the roots through the stem, timelessly wellnigh and too subtly for any eye to follow . . . Jesse means a fire and a burning; it signifies the ground of divine love and also the ground of the soul. Out of this ground the rod grows, i.e. in the purest and highest; it shoots up out of this virgin soil at the breaking forth of the Son. Upon the rod opens a flower, the flower of the Holy Ghost." That "Jesse means a fire" evidently rests upon some hermeneutic etymology, and one would like to know its source; in any case, there results an assimilation to the Burn- ing Bush, which is a form of the Tree of Life, and for which there are also Oriental parallels. It may be noted that in the Vyiehrad MS. (Watson, p. 83) the rubus igneus of Moses vir- gula Aaron, Porta clausa of Ezekiel, and virgula Jesse are shown on two contiguous pages, and as Watson comments "It is clear that these four subjects have been put together on account of a community of significance." STaken from C. S. Baldwin, Mediaeval Rhetoric and Poetic, New York, 1928, p. 343, where the sermon is quoted at greater length. 'In the Dijon MS. illustration relroduced by Kingsley Porter, Art Bulletin, VII, Fig. 30 facing p. 16, the Burning Bush is again associated with a Jesse Tree.
