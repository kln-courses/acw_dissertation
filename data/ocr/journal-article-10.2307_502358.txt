<plain_text><page sequence="1">FIFTY-NINTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE Archaeological Institute of America (1957) The fifty-ninth general meeting of the Institute was held in conjunction with the American Philological Association in Washington on 28-30 December 1957. Sum- maries of the papers presented are given in alphabetical order of the authors' names. THE PEOPLE OF LERNA: i. Lawrence Angel, Jefferson Medical College of Philadelphia. Almost 400 Greek skeletons studied this summer with support of American Philosophical Society and N.I.H. bring the grand total to over 2,000. Of nine Neolithic Lernaeans one is a complete Io-year-old girl, Basic White, with excessive teeth wear and signs of irregular nutrition; the others, similar but fragmen- tary, include 3 adults and 4 infants. From the Middle Bronze Age cemetery at Lerna J. L. Caskey and his teams have recovered 230 people: a sample unique in numbers, representativeness, and care of excavation. Adults plus subadults make up only 44% compared with 91% of deaths at ages over 15 in modern America and well over 50% even in Classical Greece. Of the 80 infants 15% appear premature, more show pa- thology, and excess of males rises with age. Males over 15 average just over 36 at death and females 31 (with excess deaths in early childbearing ages and pelvic signs of many pregnancies). Statures of 65Y'" and 6o034" for men and for women are i" below Classic averages, though tallish for the Greek Bronze Age. The pelvis is less deep than in a well-nourished popu- lation. Spinal arthritis and disk collapse affect almost 70% of men (why in the neck especially?) and over 50% of women, compared with I5-20o% in Americans between 30 and 40. Gout, dental cyst, ankle deformi- ties, sacral hiatus, etc. occur alongside wounds (15%) and fractures (under Io%) rarer than in America. The population is extremely heterogeneous: "pre- Greek" types (Basic White 22%, Mediterranean i1% and Alpine 13%) persist beside taller intruders (Nordic-Iranian 25%, Dinariod 11%, Alpine io%, and Mixed Alpine 8%) from several sources. Handi- capped by high infant mortality this Lerna population was most varied, young, vigorous, and capable of growth in more than the physical sense. AGONISTIC FESTIVALS IN ITALY AND SICILY: Irene Ringwood Arnold, Bennett College. In earlier studies of local Greek festivals I have attempted to reconstruct the programs of local agones in various parts of the Greek world. In all cases I have emphasized the agonistic features of the festivals, and have relied mainly on inscriptional records for source material. This paper is an attempt to make a similar reconstruction of the agones in Italy and Sicily, and to answer in particular two questions that seem of para- mount importance in this locality. Were the Greek games as unpopular with the Romans as most literary authorities would have us suppose? Did the games in this part of the world follow the pattern of the great Panhellenic festivals, or did the Romans introduce some local features of their own? The evidence seems to support the conclusion that the Greek festivals, particularly the Augustalia at Naples, the Capitolia at Rome, and the Eusebeia at Puteoli, played a much more significant part in Roman life than is commonly supposed, and may in fact have been one of the unifying factors of the Empire. Signifi- cant as these festivals were, however, they did not occasion any notable changes in the established Pan- hellenic program. Local deviations were rare indeed. THE PALACE OF NESTOR, 1957: Carl W. Blegen, University of Cincinnati. A full report appears elsewhere in this issue. THE SYMBOL OF THE MAGNA MATER: Ida Bobula, Washington, D.C. Mesopotamian boundary markers, kudurru stones from the Cassite period, show reliefs which are identi- fied as symbols of the main divinities in the Babylonian pantheon. Some symbols, like those of the Sun-God or Moon-God are obvious, but one of the signs became a puzzle. It is the symbol of the Great Goddess: an omega-like shape on a low column or altar. The omega appears sometimes inverted. The archaic Sumerian Mother Goddess, Innin, dis- tributed her functions among several later goddesses, her main heir was Bau or Baba, or Gula, goddess of childbirth, life and healing. Scholars related her sym- bol to her functions and the omega was explained as a pair of swaddling bands or the umbilical cord. It is hard to believe, however, that such objects, void of</page><page sequence="2">222 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 62 beauty, shape and dignity would have been used to symbolize a goddess. Hungarian folklore, so rich in motives from Western Asia, provides a clue, naming the rainbow Bdba-bukra, Baiba's headband or ribbon, and naming the Fata Morgana: Deli-bdba. It may be supposed, that as the Sky-God's son, ENIL was present in storm and downpour, so BABA, the Sky-God's daughter, ruled the milder atmospheric phenomena and the rainbow was considered her headgear. The symbol in question, the omega, should be the graphic sign of the rainbow, diadem of the goddess, in analogy with Enil being represented on the kudurrus by his horned hat, which recalls the shape of the alpha. ATHENIAN LAW COURTS AND TOKENS: A. L. Boege- hold, University of Illinois. At the end of his work, The Constitution of the Athenians, Aristotle wrote an excursus that detailed carefully the intricate procedure by which law suits were tried in the Athenian popular courts. The pro- cedure, it appears, demanded, or involved, at several points the exchange of tokens (0ouv',oAa, AP 65.2, 68.2, 69.2). The dikast receives one token when he enters the court building, another after he has voted, and gives one up in the event of a second vote. Bronze and lead tokens, stamped with letters, and found in and around Athens, have long been known; but none of them has been successfully identified with those mentioned by Aristotle. There are pieces, how- ever, in two series of bronze tokens, made and used in the fourth century B.c., whose peculiar markings postu- late an intimate connection between these tokens and recognized pieces of court equipment, similarly marked. Once accepted as fourth century, Athenian, law- court symbola, the tokens may be identified more pre- cisely as those that were handed out to dikasts entering the court building (AP 65.2). THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE APHRODITE WHO BINDS HER SANDAL AND RELATED WORKS OF HELLENISTIC SCULPTURE: Dericksen M. Brinkerhofi, Rhode Island School of Design. Almost one hundred replicas of a Hellenistic statue type known as the Aphrodite binding her sandal exist in marble, bronze, terracotta, on coins, and on gems, yet the origin of the figure has been shrouded in obscurity. It has been attributed chronologically to the fourth, third, and second centuries B.c., and both Alexandria and Asia Minor have been called its home. A new examination reveals that this rococo type should be placed at the end of the third century and that it belongs in Northwestern Asia Minor. Such a conclu- sion may be supported by evidence drawn from the style of the statue, from numismatics, and terracottas. It is secured by the attribution of another work to the same artist. The Invitation to the Dance group of the early second century B.c. may be affiliated with the sculptor who created the Aphrodite who binds her sandal. The implications of this discovery strengthen the hypothesis that Polycharmos, mentioned in Pliny, was the author of the sandalbinder, increase our knowl- edge of the art of the region under Pergamene domi- nation, and point the way to renewed scrutiny of the concept of a Hellenistic rococo. EXCAVATIONS AT LERNA, 1957: John L. Caskey, American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Three deep soundings in the Neolithic layer, north and east of the House of the Tiles, produced strati- graphical evidence that confirmed the observations made in 1955 and 1956. The earliest building-levels contain Rainbow ware, which later is superseded alto- gether by wares with red or brown glaze (Urfirnis). The topmost Neolithic strata have yielded a few un- usual pieces that may perhaps indicate a third stage, but there is no evidence of blending with the Early Helladic. Remains of monumental E.H. buildings were found again this year at levels antedating the House of the Tiles. Associated with one of them was a large circular hearth of baked clay with a decorated rim and a depression in the flat floor. The character of the settlement in this period has been illuminated further by the discovery of a circuit wall with pro- jecting towers. The wall has inner and outer faces, joined to each other by cross-walls that divide the whole system into compartments; these were living quarters, occupied perhaps by the garrison. During this final season in the present series of campaigns at Lerna much attention was paid to the conservation of the monuments that are to be kept as a permanent exhibit. Retaining walls were constructed, ancient stone socles were solidified and discreetly cemented, copings of tile were placed over remains of crude bricks, and a large shelter was built in reinforced concrete over the House of the Tiles. Further reports on these activities will be published in Hesperia. EARLY TRAVELERS' INTERPRETATIONS OF THREE ATHE- NIAN MONUMENTS, Hadrian's Arch, the Monu- ment of Lysikrates, and the Parthenon: M. Katherine Donaldson, Wheaton College. Ciriaco da Ancona copied the inscriptions of the Arch of Hadrian in the fifteenth century. By the six- teenth it appeared in cosmographies; in the seventeenth drawings by Babin and Carr6 emphasized the arch. Probably the earliest known description of Athens, from 1395, referred to its inscription. Had Chaucer heard about Hadrian's Arch a few years earlier, at</page><page sequence="3">1958] FIFTY-NINTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 223 about the time the Acciajuoli became Duke of Athens? In the Knight's Tale Duke Theseus builds an arch with "an auter and an oratorie" "up-on the gate above" to the east of Athens. Chaucer here departs from his source, Boccaccio. The Monument of Lysikrates has been variously interpreted since the twelfth century. Ciriaco described it as one of a group of "Scenarum cathedras" and labelled the Monument of Thrasyllos a "scenam." Per- haps he here associated them with pavilions along pageant routes, or the stage props, sedes, of medieval mystery plays. Ciriaco's drawing of the Parthenon is reflected by a curious inverted version in Sangallo's sketchbook, which was used by Vasari and Dal Pozzo. Could Palladio, inspired by his adopted name, have been influenced in his designs by the "ingens et mirabile Palladis divae marmorium templum"? SLOT CEILINGS: A. Trevor Hodge, Stanford Uni- versity. The form of ceiling most commonly in use in classi- cal Greek buildings was the coffer ceiling. There did however exist another form both well attested and widely used which has received less attention than its due. Its beams were shallower than those of a coffer ceiling and set much closer together, so that there was left only a series of narrow slots between them. These slots were presumably boarded over on top. Holes or dressings cut in the stonework to receive the ends of the beams show that there were ceilings of this type in the Sicyonian Treasury at Olympia, the Pinakotheke and S.W. Wing of the Propylaia, the Temples of Aphaia, Kardaki, Ceres at Paestum, Posei- don at Sounion, and an unidentified Doric building at Delphi. All these ceilings were of wood except that at Sounion, which had marble beams and, probably, wooden boards covering the slots between them. There is little direct evidence for the use of this ceiling in West Greek buildings, but something very like it often appears in the little heroa so commonly featured in South Italian vase painting. A TERRACOTTA FROM GORDION AND THE TRADITION OF THE SEATED KYBELE: R. Ross Holloway, Prince- ton University. A Hellenistic terracotta statuette of the seated god- dess Kybele from Gordion (illustrated, Bulletin of the University Museum 17:4 [19531 7, fig. 3) is remark- able because of its size (height, 0.524 m.) and preserva- tion. It is a copy of the large marble from Pergamon (Altertiimer von Pergamon, VII (1), 69-70 and pl. xii). The suggestion is made that both derive from the 5th Century cult statue in the Metroon in Athens and that the statues from Levadhia (Hesperia 23 [1954] pl. 40, c) and Athens (AthMitt 37 [1912] pls. xi and xii) may be traced to the same source. The terracotta and marbles indicate that the Metroon figure rested her left hand above her tympanon and did not hold it from below. Such revision of the generally accepted restoration of the Agora Mother establishes a distinc- tion between this cult statue tradition and the pose found in votives, e.g. J. N. Svoronos, Das Athener Nationalmuseum, pls. cxvI, CLXXXXVIII, ccxxxIx, and CCXL, and reliefs, C. Bliimel, BerlCat III, KIo6, pl. 84, in which the goddess holds her tympanon from below. Furthermore, the identification of this cult statue tra- dition shows the continuity of the seated Kybele type from the 5th century through the Hellenistic and into the Roman Period, which has been hitherto obscured. THE PREHISTORY OF GREEK SACRIFICE: Michael H. Jameson, University of Pennsylvania. The principal type of Greek sacrifice employs the burning of certain parts of the victim to achieve conse- cration and is probably an Indo-European heritage. The late Constantine Yavis argued that the Minoans had no sacrifice of this type since they had no suitable altars (which is both true and significant), and, fur- ther, that such sacrifice was introduced at the time of the Dorian invasion (which is improbable on several counts). It is apparent that consecration with burning of parts was not characteristic of Minoan ritual which, aside from incense, grain, or cakes burned on small, movable hearths, employed consecration by "deposi- tion" on various sacred stands, and this method may have been applied to animal victims, as on the Haghia Triadha sarcophagus, if the examples are not under Mycenaean influence. It is necessary to distinguish between Mycenaean and Cretan ritual, i.e. between Greek and "Minoan." The characteristic type of Myce- naean architecture, the megaron with fixed hearth, shows the essential provision for consecration with burning of parts. The large, elaborate hearths of the palaces are clearly of ritual significance (witness the table of offerings beside the main hearth at Pylos) and the earliest post-Mycenaean temples continue to have an interior hearth for consecration. The subsequent neglect of the interior hearth is to be connected with the increasingly public character of sacrifice. For the Greeks outdoor sacrifice was likely to have been com- mon at all times, and, with certain exceptions, this is the rule in the Homeric poems. The later history of "deposition" and of indoor burning of parts is traced in classical Greek sacrifice. THOSE SUPERSTITIONS ABOUT THE NUNDINAE: Van L. Johnson, Tufts College. Those superstitions recorded by Macrobius (Sat. 1.13, 16-I9) against the nundinae falling on the first Kalends or any Nones reflect change and fear of</page><page sequence="4">224 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 62 change in the Roman calendar. There is an implication that in early times the nundinae coincided with neither of these days. A statistical examination of this implica- tion reveals that the nundinal letter was originally a fixed and not a shifting letter; that it was fixed as F; that this was a ferial as well as a nundinal letter; and that the calendars of "Romulus" and "Numa" are authentic. It likewise establishes the view that early Roman chronology was dominated by a cyclic year or true annus which contained no gap of uncounted days and had its origin in a 4-month calendar older than any reported by our literary sources. This theory has two important corollaries: I) that the Saturnalia, like the period following the Terminalia, was intercalary in origin; 2) that intercalation, in the beginning, was a permutation device adding days to the market-week, not days to the year. GREEKS, CARIANS, AND THE PURIFICATION OF DELOS: Charlotte R. Long, Clinton, New York. This paper will appear as an article in a later issue. THE PLAN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE CIRCUS OF MAXENTIUS: William MacDonald, Yale Univer- sity. The Circus of Maxentius has been inexplicably neglected; inexplicably because it is easily accessible, it is the best preserved of all Roman circuses, and be- cause of its date it may fairly be taken as typical of a large group of important functional structures. Investigation and survey show that the plan is asymmetrical. The long sides are not parallel but di- verge slightly as they extend away from the curved end. The righthand long side (from the point of view of the charioteer at the start) changes direction, turn- ing back toward the spina in order to insure fair start- ing positions by canting or tilting the chord of the carceres. This basic plan is found in other Roman circuses. The construction of the circus has been called "decadent" but in actuality it would seem to exemplify those advanced masonry and structural techniques developed in the later Empire on the basis of changes begun chiefly in the time of Nero. The excellent opus listatum, the lightening of the masonry, and the use of terracotta vases in the fabric of the vaults all point toward the coming new architecture. AMAROUSION POTTERS AT WORK: Frederick R. Matson, Pennsylvania State University, and Henry S. Robinson, University of Oklahoma. The present-day practices in a potter's shop at Amarousion are followed from the obtaining and preparation of the clays through the forming, deco- rating, firing and sale of the vessels. The potter's prob- lems associated with the nature of the clays and the production of the ware are discussed in relation to the ancient Athenian ceramic products, with illustrations. ESTABLISHING A SEQUENCE FOR ITALIC WARRIOR SCULPTURE: Quentin Maule, Rollins College. Pre-Hellenistic Italic warrior figurines were cata- logued as basis for the seriation. Primary divisions within this corpus were typo- logical, attained by collating changes in military cos- tume. The fashion for helmets with mobile cheek pieces, for instance, a predominant style in Greek representations toward the end of the sixth century, could hardly have spread to Italy before its Greek popularity. Other details confirm this standpoint: a metallic "bellcuirass" is generally worn by figures with less-developed helmets, while the newer leather cuirass accompanies later types. Figures thus isolated as "earlier" are found to have more archaic features than the "later" pieces. Others are put earlier still by certain connections which they have with material from the great "orientalizing" tombs of Italy. The most populous class, the extremely attenuated "Etruscan" warrior, is thus found to originate after 500 B.c. This type, separated into subgroups which become progressively thicker-limbed, less archaic, and more plastically-conceived in rendering of detail, evolves into a bluntly rectangularizing figure like the Mars of Todi. Several reliable archaeological indications allow one to place the latter in the first half of the fourth century, leaving the earlier manner, the elon- gated type itself, to occupy the fifth century, after about 500 B.c., yet before about 400 B.c. The newly- defined fourth-century style is recognizable in many non-military examples which had hitherto been under- stood quite differently. A SURVEY BY JEEP OF THE SOUTHERN DESERT OF PALESTINE: Philip Mayerson, New York Uni- versity. A surface survey of the Central Negev (Israel) and of North Sinai was made in 1956-57. Special emphasis was placed upon studying topographical characteristics and hydrological principles which made sedentary life possible in antiquity for large numbers of people. Examination of the remains shows that seven urban sites (estimated populations of I,ooo-5,ooo), in addition to many other smaller clusters of habitations, are con- centrated in a belt of loess soils and of hills trending for the most part toward the Mediterranean. The area is circumscribed to the east and to the south by sterile desert where, but in isolated places, it is impossible to grow food crops. The ceramic, worked-flint, and architectural evi-</page><page sequence="5">1958] FIFTY-NINTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 225 dence shows that the Southern Desert was inhabited from prehistoric times to the present but that the density of habitation fluctuated greatly. The forces which drive people to settle in a region made sub- marginal by insufficient rainfall must be examined in the light of political and economic conditions not only of Palestine and Egypt, but of the Middle and Far East as well. We are led to the conclusion that the area was most densely inhabited during the sixth, seventh, and possibly the eighth centuries A.D. It is to this time that one must attribute the development of urban centers and the wide network of water-control structures which surround each site. During this period, the land was no more fertile, the rainfall no greater than at present, nor did the inhabitants possess any secret method of water conservation. Prior to 1948, Bedouins (really semi-nomadics) cultivated the area fairly intensively and practiced-and still do-every water conservation technique known to the ancients. THE POLYPHEMOS PAINTER: George E. Mylonas, Washington University. To the artist who painted the protoattic amphora of Eleusis (discovered in 1954) I have given the name of the "Polyphemos Painter" because the names of the "Eleusis Painter" and the "Gorgon Painter" have already been used and because on the neck of that amphora we find the story of the blinding of Poly- phemos by Odysseus and his companions. On the shoulder of the amphora he painted a wild boar facing a lion, and on the main panel of the body the story of the Gorgons. The last panel has a height of o.52m and a length of 1.72m; proportions adequate for monu- mental painting. All his figures are interesting and are painted in an extraordinary manner. However, the Gorgons are his most striking figures and are the earliest representations of these creatures known to us to date. They seem to be more like members of an ancient choros, wearing fantastic masks that transform them into the mythological beings they portray. For these masks the painter used as a prototype the well- known cauldrons with griffins of the Early Archaic period, and the facial features of the Gorgons he drew from those of the griffins. Thus, he used elements developed locally in Greece. As a result, the theory that the type of the Gorgon was borrowed from other lands and cultures has to be abandoned now. The figures painted on the amphora of Eleusis give clearly the characteristic mannerisms of the "Polyphemos Painter" and these prove that he is a different artist from the "Ram Jug Painter" and seemingly somewhat older in date. To the "Polyphemos Painter" can be attributed the well-known Menelas Stand in Berlin, Crater A35 in the Antiquarium of Berlin, fragment No. PI725 of the Agora, and the neck of amphora No. P4950 of the Agora. The floruit of the "Poly- phemos Painter" should be placed in the second quarter of the seventh century and his masterpiece, the am- phora of Eleusis, in the years between 675 and 650 B.c. Incidentally, on his amphora from Eleusis we have the earliest known to date representation of Athena on Attic painting. A detailed study of the amphora and of the painter, in Greek with a summary in English, has just been published by the Archaeological Society of Athens, Greece. CONNECTIONS OF THE GREEK NEOLITHIC AND THE NEAR EAST: Ann Perkins, Yale University, and Saul S. Weinberg, University of Missouri. Two Neolithic painted pottery fabrics of Greece have been found to have striking similarities to Near Eastern pottery. The first of these, the Neolithic Urfirnis (or glazed) ware common in the Middle Neolithic period especially in the Peloponnesus and Central Greece, but now becoming known in Thessaly as well, bears remarkable resemblance in fabric, forms, and decorative motives to the Halaf pottery of Mesopo- tamia and North Syria. The second and later Greek ware, the matt painted pottery of the Late Neolithic period, is equally closely related to pottery of the Ubaid phase which succeds Halaf in Mesopotamia and North Syria. Although sometimes postulated, this close similarity has never been well documented, and the connection between Greece and the Near East thus established offers new possibilities for dating the Greek Neolithic period in relative terms. THE INSCRIBED JAR-HANDLES FROM GIBEON: James B. Pritchard, Church Divinity School of the Pacific, Berkeley. The 1957 excavation at el-Jib in Jordan yielded 53 Hebrew inscriptions written on the handles of jars. The general pattern of the inscriptions is the name of the town Gibeon, the word gdr, and one of three names, Hananiah, Azariah, or Amariah. It seems probable that these inscriptions were labels for jars of wine which was made at Gibeon by three firms and bottled for export. There are some variants of this general pattern. TOWARD A RESTUDY OF THE BATTLE OF SALAMIS: W. Kendrick Pritchett, University of California. This paper will appear as an article in a later issue. THE SIXTH CENTURY BYZANTINE SILVER TREASURE IN KIEV: Marvin C. Ross, Washington, D.C. A Byzantine silver treasure in Kiev consists of a small, round drinking bowl with control marks of the second half of the 6th century, another drinking</page><page sequence="6">226 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 62 bowl on a small foot, and a spoon. Although not one of the greatest, this treasure of Byzantine silver has considerable importance for the history of such silver, and more still for the question of Constantinople versus Syria as the main center of manufacture of this silver. The spoon is of the type found in Cyprus, Syria, and elsewhere. The small drinking bowl with the Con- stantinopolitan control-mark recalls a number of pieces discovered in Syria. The same is true of the larger drinking bowl. These pieces found in Russia suggest Constantinople as the place of origin versus the old idea that such cups were made in Syria. The silver found in Russia that has been stressed in publications hitherto has been of a more elaborate kind. These pieces in Kiev are exactly like those found in the Eastern Mediterra- nean area and give us quite a different idea of the place of origin of such work. A comparison of this kind of silver with several cups carved in semi-precious stones (i.e., sapphire and garnet) may establish also that they are Constantinopolitan in origin, and give us a further picture of the luxury of the Byzantine Empire. DJEMILA: A NORTH AFRICAN "POMPEII": Ray- mond V. Schoder, West Baden College. Founded by Nerva toward the end of the first cen- tury on a triangular plateau in a fertile valley between Sitifis and Cirta, Cuicul (modern Djemila) provides an unusually clear and adequate idea of public and private structures in Roman Africa. It was intended as a settlement for veterans, and a garrison to control the roads. The well-preserved and extensive remains vividly illustrate the town's diverse buildings and reveal the stages in its growth and change. The center of the early town was at the north, where stand the Capitolium, Curia, Basilica Julia, many fine houses, and a Temple probably in honor of Venus Genetrix as Protectress of Rome. These reflect the prosperity enjoyed under the Antonines, when govern- ment was in charge of the Legate of the Legion. In the third century, Cuicul was incorporated into the Province of Numidia. A New Forum was con- structed at the southern limit of the original city wall. Taken with its surrounding structures, this is the finest civic square to be seen in Africa, I6o by 103 feet in size. An excellent commemorative arch was built here in 216 to honor Caracalla. Nearby is the dignified Temple to the Gens Septimia, dedicated in 229 by Alexander Severus. A market, conical fountain, basilica, theater, large baths show how the town expanded far to the south as it flourished. The final stage of growth brought important Chris- tian buildings still further south: two basilicas of the fourth and fifth centuries, a bishop's residence, chapel, and remarkable baptistery. Good samples of sculpture and mosaics round out the picture of cultural interests in this military and commercial outpost of the Roman Empire. A RECONSTRUCTION OF A SILVER AND GOLD VESSEL FROM BUBASTIS: William Kelly Simpson, Harvard University. A study of the silver and gold vessels from the Tell Basta Treasure, discovered at Zagazig in 19o06, has resulted in the partial reconstruction of one of the inscribed and decorated vessels through the addition of fragments in the Berlin Museum and the Metro- politan Museum of Art in New York to the body of the vessel and one section of the decorated neck in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. The vessel in Cairo is illustrated by C. C. Edgar in Maspero, Le musee igyptien, vol. 2, pl. 54, 2 (J. 38720/39868). The Berlin fragments are published by A. Scharff in BerlMus 51 (1930) 114, figs. I (left and center), and 2. One of the New York fragments is illustrated by W. K. Simp- son in BMMA, New Series, 8 (1949-50) 63 (lower left). The other New York fragments (07.228. 222, 241, 219, 220, and 221) will be illustrated with the paper for the first time and will be subsequently pub- lished. The vessel is one of three inscribed for the Royal Butler and King's Messenger to Every Foreign Land, Atumemtoneb, the foremost of which is the silver jug with gold handle in Cairo, an object which has been illustrated frequently in handbooks on Egyp- tian art. A study of the treasure confirms the conclu- sions of Maspero, Edgar, Montet, Scharff, and von Bissing that these vessels were made in Dynasty XIX or slightly later, and the conclusions of Edgar, Maspero, and von Bissing that they were fashioned in Egypt and not abroad. EXCAVATIONS AT SERRA ORLANDO (MORGANTINA): Erik Sjoqvist, Princeton University. A full report appears elsewhere in this issue. THE EVOLUTION OF THE MESOPOTAMIAN CONE AND SPINDLE: Elmer G. Suhr, University of Rochester. The early Mesopotamians knew about the cone- shaped shadow of the moon that reaches the earth during a solar eclipse. They also believed that both the moon and its shadow rotated and thus combined the life-giving pneuma reflected from the sun with the moisture and air of the clouds to dispense fertility in the form of rainfall on the earth. The movement of the moon's shadow made the moon an agent of crea- tion; it was partly responsible for the importance of this body in Mesopotamian astronomy and for the emphasis on the vortex in Greek Pre-Socratic philos- ophy. The clay cones inserted in the walls of Ur were</page><page sequence="7">1958] FIFTY-NINTH GENERAL MEETING OF THE INSTITUTE 227 meant to bring prosperity to the city and its inhabit- ants. The small figure of Nannar holding the cone, in the Louvre, is not pushing the object but rotating it; this is the same cone that made its way to Syria and Paphos. Later the city wall as a headdress crown- ing Aphrodite Tyche was substituted for the cone. When a female goddess superseded Nannar in the east an anthropomorphic spindle (the so-called basket-bearer in the Louvre) took the place of the cone and invaded the sculpture and vases of Greece. ACITVITIES IN THE ATHENIAN AGORA, 1957: Homer A. Thompson, Institute for Advanced Study. In 1957 the American School of Classical Studies (i) completed the installation of museum, storerooms and workrooms in the Stoa of Attalos, which had been dedicated on September 3, 1956; (2) finished the restoration of the Iith century Church of the Holy Apostles; (3) carried out the definitive exploration of extensive areas on the north slope of the Areopagus, a residential district outside the Agora proper; (4) completed landscaping operations in those parts of the area where excavation has been finished. A more de- tailed report will appear in a forthcoming number of Hesperia. MARGINALLY DRAFTED, PECKED MASONRY IN THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST: Gus W. Van Beek, The Johns Hopkins University. Marginally drafted, pecked masonry has been found in different areas of the ancient East, from Greece to Persia and as far south as South Arabia. Of these areas, only South Arabia has yielded a sufficient number of examples to permit an analysis of its technical and stylistic development. These examples fall into six stages of development-the last two of which are archaizing imitations-which range in date from the middle of the seventh century B.c. to the first century A.D. according to epigraphic evidence. This type of dressing developed from "rusticated" masonry, with the transition almost certainly taking place in Assyria during the early seventh century B.c. With regard to "rusticated" masonry, we now have a continuous record of its use in the Near East-at sites in Palestine, Assyria, and near Van-from the tenth to the early seventh centuries B.c. Since the Palestinian examples reflect direct Phoenician influ- ence, and since the earliest known examples have been found at Ugarit, we can safely attribute the origin of "rusticated" masonry to the Phoenicians or their Canaanite predecessors. THE MYCENAEANS IN ACHAIA: Emily Townsend Vermeule, Wellesley College. A current problem in Mycenaean archaeology is the activity and independence of local kingdoms in Greece outside the immediate dominion of the Argolid. The province of Achaia, though still largely unexplored, presents an assemblage of late Bronze Age material which suggests that the local culture was not only relatively unaffected by the leadership of Mycenae in the east, but also prospered surprisingly after the de- struction of the palaces at Mycenae and Pylos. Achaia was apparently bypassed by the "Dorian invasion" and continued to flourish through the end of the sub- Mycenaean era. The collection in the Patras Museum, consisting of over five hundred late Mycenaean vases plus bronzes and jewellery, mostly unpublished, illus- trates the peculiarities of shape and decoration which divorce this west coast style from the familiar fabrics of the Argolid, and suggest a possibility of continuity through the Dark Ages. Parallels for some of the Patras vases are found in the Attic Protogeometric groups of the Kerameikos and early Iron Age pottery from Cyprus. The material leads from the archae- ological side into problems like the relationship of Achaia and Pylos in the Linear B tablets, the real nature of the Dorian invasion, the dialect affinities between "Achaian" and Arcado-Cypriote, the isolation of fringe areas from the normal line of Mycenaean development, and the nature of survivals from the "prehistoric" period into early classical Greece. THE FORTIFICATIONS OF SIDE IN PAMPHYLIA: Frederick E. Winter, University of Toronto. Although the walls of Side were rebuilt in Roman times, the stretches on either side of the main gate appear to be Hellenistic. Unlike the obviously late portions, they are built entirely of massive ashlar blocks, with no mortar; and the carefully worked string-courses on the outer face, in contrasting colour and finish, show an aesthetic sensitivity which is un- usual in the more utilitarian work of the Romans. Yet these walls are a far cry from simple fourth-century and early Hellenistic systems such as Messene and Herakleia-ad-Latmum. There is evidently a ditch of considerable size in front of the walls (this does not show up well in photographs, but is quite clear on the site); the curtains were flanked at frequent intervals by large square towers, probably of the same general type as those at Perge and Isaura, and were themselves elaborate three-storeyed structures, ten or eleven meters in height. These curtains are perhaps the most interesting part of the system. They demonstrate not only the remark- able technical development of Hellenistic military architecture, but also the accuracy of the descriptions of Hellenistic military writers, who have at times been accused of representing their own theories as accom- plished fact. At Side, as in some of the systems described by Philo of Byzantium, there are large chambers built against the inner face of the wall, separated by massive</page><page sequence="8">228 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 62 piers of masonry, and either corbelled or vaulted over. But Philo's chambers simply provided shelter for the garrison; those at Side seem to have housed pieces of artillery. The alure above these chambers, which was five to six meters above ground level, was at least partially covered by a series of small corbel-vaults, springing from the piers which divided the alure into a number of compartments. Each of these compartments had a large artillery-port and a small archer-slot in the outer screen-wall. The alure at the third-storey level, eight to nine meters above ground-level, was simply an open guard- walk, protected by a low parapet surmounted by crenellations. Presumably the towers were at least one storey higher than the curtains, i.e. four storeys, with a total height of about fourteen meters. This is approximately the height of the well-preserved towers at Perge, which may serve as a model in restoring those at Side; while the Side curtains are our best guide in attempting the restoration of the stretch of curtain at Perge, in which the vaulted chambers of the ground-storey are still standing, but the upper portions have completely dis- appeared. The great height and massiveness of the Side forti- fications, the extensive use of vaulting, and the obvious dependence on artillery rather than hand-weapons, are all very typical of the middle and late Hellenistic periods. EXCAVATIONS IN ALCUDIA, MALLORCA (Baleares): Daniel E. Woods, Manhattanville College. In 1956 Mr. William J. Bryant of Springfield, Vt., Director of the William L. Bryant Foundation (named for his father) conceived the idea of joint archae- ological work on Spanish classical sites by Spanish and American scholars and students. With this end in view, the Bryant Foundation purchased a fine i7th century house in Alcudia, Mallorca (the site of ancient Roman Pollentia) and remodelled it. Today the ground floor houses the Archaeological Museum of Alcudia. This summer (July Ist to August 15, 1957) an expedi- tion under the supervision of Dr. Luis Pericot, Univ. of Barcelona, a Spanish archaeologist, Prof. Miguel Tarradell of the Univ. of Valencia (the excavator of Tamuda and Lixus in Morocco) and an American, Prof. Daniel E. Woods of Manhattanville College, Purchase, N. Y., went to Alcudia under the auspices of the Bryant Foundation and conducted excavations in Roman POLLENTIA. In these excavations Sr. D. Luis Amoros, Palma, assisted, also Mrs. Tarradell, Bar- tolomeo Font of Lluchmayor, and Maria Petrus from Minorca, the latter two pupils of Drs. Pericot and Almagro of Barcelona and Madrid. Besides uncovering an 8 by 34 meters area of the Roman city, Pollentia, near the preserved ancient Roman wall, excavations were undertaken in a pre- Roman necropolis about 15 miles from Alcudia near the coastal town of Can Picafort. From the evidence of the pottery in the stratigraphic levels Pollentia reveals a foundation of the 2nd cent. B.c. and its de- struction in the 4th cent. A.D., i.e. from Campanian B pottery to Clear and Stamped Sigillata. Excavations within the Roman wall itself surprised the excavators, Professors Tarradell and Woods, who expected a Roman Republican wall dating from the foundation of the city. Within the wall the pottery fragments were uniformly datable to the time of Augustus, i.e. Arettine and Thin-walled (Paredes Finas) fragments. At least the part of the wall of the Roman city, Pollentia, which has been studied dates from ca. 10 B.c. to ca. A.D. 40. The necropolis of Son Real near Can Picafort is on a point of land that juts out into the sea and near a small island which held the primitive population. The graves are dug out of the rocky earth and consist of megalithic circular and rectangular stone tombs, corbelling towards the top and paved and covered with large stone slabs. They are very well constructed and contained handmade, unpainted, grey ware, bronze and iron weapons, and necklaces of the type found in the 4th century B.c. tombs in Ibiza. The tombs are different from any other type found hitherto in Spain. Dr. Tarradell of Valencia and Professor Daniel E. Woods of Manhattanville College will return to Alcudia next July (1958) and continue excavating the Roman city, Pollentia, and the necropolis of Son Real near Can Picafort. Proceedings are under way to form a Cen- tro Arqueologico Hispano-Americano in the Baleares, with its basis of operation in Alcudia. On the Board will serve as charter Directors: William J. Bryant, Springfield, Vt.; Dr. Luis Pericot, Univ. of Barcelona; Dr. Martin Almagro, Univ. of Madrid; Dr. Miguel Tarradell, Univ. of Valencia; Sr. D. Luis Amoros, Palma; Dr. Sterling Dow, Harvard; Dr. Walter W. S. Cook, New York Univ.; Prof. Daniel E. Woods, Manhattanville College. The Bryant Foundation has for several years fi- nanced the excavation of the Roman Amphitheatre of Tarragona in Spain under the direction of Samuel Ventura. This excavation was completed in 1957 and will soon be published. THE ROYAL TOMB AT GORDION: Rodney S. Young, University of Pennsylvania.
