<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART* In a previous essay of mine, I tried to show that the main problem of the philosophy of language is to establish some basic criteria which may be used to characterize and to distinguish two types of communication: the scien- tific and the esthetic. This can be achieved only through the clarifying of questions related to logical syntax and semantics and esthetic syntax and semantics. Logic will be defined as the critique of scientific language, and esthetics as the critique of poetic language and of all the means or forms of artistic expres- sion. The main trait of logico-scientific thought is its reversibility, whereas the esthetic order manifests itself by irreversible processes. The propositions of science and of logic, as a consequence of this basic quality can be inverted, transposed, and converted, submitting, com- pletely, to the laws of transformation. The esthetic language, on the contrary, is never transformed, inverted, or transposed, without casusing serious damage to its contextual meaning. To this, one could object that the possibility of translation is perfectly admissible. I would say, then, that a translation of a literary or poetical work may be rendered in two categories: perfect and imperfect. To exemplify the first category, there occurs to one's mind the transla- tion of Edgar Poe's poems and stories by Beaudelaire and, more recently, the French edition of Ulysses by James Joyce, revised by Valery-Larbaud and by the author himself. In both cases, however, one cannot properly talk about translation, for, what happened here, in fact, was a recreation of the original text, especially in the case of Ulysses, where it seems to be the same book, published by its authors in two languages. In the case of a perfect translation, when reading a work, spontaneity and freshness should be so great that one never has the impression of sentences written or drawn from a previous model. In such a case, one can perfectly well speak of a new book. The scientific work, however, is the only one to which one can refer as subject to a literal translation, without anything being missed of the original content. The poem or the piece of prose is not translated in a literal way, which shows, in this case, the impossibility of replacing the original sentences by other equivalent ones. The equivalence may only be obtained when one deals with propositions which are strictly scientific. * A compressed version was read at the Second Inter-American Congress of Philosophy. 469</page><page sequence="2">470 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The problem of equivalence of propositions in scientific language leads us directly to a crucial question, which is related to the meaning and the value of convention. Mathematics, for instance, can be literally tran- scribed in a type of language where logical propositions figure essentially; then, one speaks of the reduction of mathematics to logic. What does express this possibility if not the reduction of mathematical propositions to propositions which are equivalent, but which belong to the realm of logic? Professor Willard V. Quinel seems to consider a very enticing point of view in which mathematics and logic spring from the same linguistic conventions, although this point of view has not yet been proved. Be this as it may, one cannot deny that both disciplines inter- penetrate each other through successive analytic definitions. In this abstract domain, conventional formulae shape themselves in clear and well-defined abbreviations, which eliminate all ambiguity. They preserve their unalienable character of purely formal, although not arbitrary arti- ficial devices. In this respect it is as well to mention that Henri Poincare2 made himself more than clear when he stated that geometry is not true, although it offers certain conveniences and advantages. The expressions used by the French mathematician do not seem to be very happy, for the value of geometrical convention does not depend on being convenient, but on showing itself to be efficient and fruitful. The aggressive nominalism of Edouard Le Roy, pronouncing as he did the failure of scientific thought was inspired by some rather indefinite statements made by Poincar6. Poincar6 considered convention as a result of free activity of the spirit, and not merely as operational technique, destined to a purely functional activity. Such functional action of convention, which exists only in relation to certain contexts, previously specified, must be clarified, in order to under- stand the logical meaning of artificial devices and alternatives where it is absolutely necessary to choose or to decide. Einstein's decision to have recourse to Riemannian metrics in his general theory of relativity, was never subordinated to the caprice of arbitrary preferences, for in the last analysis it was the result of a rational deliberation. Nobody would be interested in asking whether this set of non-Euclidian postulates comes from mere convention, since its productiveness imposes itself as a technical means capable of removing the greatest difficulties. The non-comprehension of the extremely operational character of con- ventions in juridical and social sciences, leads to the theory of "fictional- 1 Willard V.

(1936).</page><page sequence="3">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART 471 ism," inspired directly by the doctrinary prejudices of Vaininger over the "Als-Ob." Far from being fiction, the social contract is a highly theoret- ical concept, which tries to reduce a certain set of relations to a concept of conventional structure. It is interesting to analyze the position of Rousseau himself in relation to this problem, and to discover that his method is inspired by a conscious operationalism, which has nothing in common with historical interpretation. He warns us that he is going to put facts aside,3 since they are not of interest in the question. His investigations on the fundamentals of the social con- tract consist in "conditional and hypothetical reasonings." On reading these pages, one has the impression that Rousseau is an authentic forerun- ner of the deductive-hypothetical method, in spite of the romantic impulses which rule over the greater part of this work. The concept of "natural man," generally understood as romantic fiction, reveals itself, also, with all the characteristics of an operational notion, which tries to catch human beings in a state of isolation. The writer considers them as separate from social relations, still inaccessible to the influence of laws and factors of civili- zation and culture that have so profoundly modified human nature. This method is perfectly justified from the scientific point of view, although Rosusseau's conclusions are purely conjectural. Thus, one can see that the alternative formulated by the critics of the social contract and of the concept of natural man is as follows: it either deals with an historical fact or with fiction; it seems inadmissible in relation to an analysis of theoretical presuppositions of these notions. The least defensible aspect of this fictionalistic doctrine which has penetrated the theories of contemporary law appears in science and mathematical logic. According to this theory, logical principles would be artificial devices, worked out by a specialized technique, the objective of which is, merely, to attain pragmatic finality. This interpretation bases itself on the stub- born refusal to recognize that logic limits itself to the study of the formal properties of relations and that it does not constitute an art or normative science, properly speaking. One can perfectly well admit that among the structural properties of the propositions there is one which establishes norms or rules for reasoning and action of judgment, but this regulatory function would be a mere consequence of the universal character of those essential forms in the logical process of inference. The logical principles such as identity, noncontradiction, and excluded middle would withdraw their normative power from the formal charac- teristics of the propositions. These structures would explain the normative principles of thought, as long as they distinguish themselves by the uni- I Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discours sur l'Origine de l'Inrgalitt.</page><page sequence="4">472 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH versality and the extension of their abstract contexts. The laws of logic, reduced to linguistic conventions, would not, even so, lose their canonic characteristics peculiar to the formation of scientific concepts and to the processes of discursive reasoning. Perhaps it would be convenient, now, to inquire into the function of these conventions in the scientific domain through the influence of non- verifiable concepts and hypothesis or of operations to which no object or state of affairs corresponds. Such inquiry could be extended to symbols and metaphorical images, which-contrary to what is generally admitted -has fundamental importance in the mechanism of scientific language. Metaphor, which would not be explicable without the operations of sym- bolization, results directly from the substitution of one object for another, of one image for another, and of one sign for another sign. The active processes of symbolization, in the elaboration of the metaphor, acquire an affective meaning which coincide with the presence of purely intellectual factors. Hermann Paul, the German philologist4 ascribes to the metaphorical image an extremely drastic character, which guarantees its effect over our sensibility. This drastic style distinguishes images and metaphors from more sharply scientific language. This is what happens when Maxwell's demon interferes suddenly in the middle of his equations and integrals; a demon sly enough to follow the molecules and to grasp hold of the door which separates two compartments of a receptable full of gas. At the moment when the swift-moving molecule goes from left to right, the demon opens the door; but when the slow molecule approaches, the door is roughly closed. The result of this manoeuvre is that the fast-moving molecules accumulate to the right of the compartment, while the slower ones remain locked up tog the left. Such perfect distribution of molecules makes the gas heat up to the right and cool down to the left of the container. Maxwell's metaphor, here, plays the part of an anthropomorphic conven- tion, which satisfies specific conditions of rational and scientific interpre- tation. Now, if we compare Maxwell's metaphorical convention with the image of the poet of the Divine Comedy, "l'Amor que move il sole e l'altre stelle," one can at once perceive that the difference is very great. Such difference is not only due to the fact that it is dealing with the English physicist's demon and with the authentic God of Dante's Divina Commedia. The prob- lem does not limit itself to the mere question of thermodynamics, in the first case, and poetry, in the- second case being at stake. Of course, there is always the possibility of admitting that thermodynamics has something to do with love.... Speaking seriously, however, it is clear that Maxwell's metaphor becomes an integral part of scientific language and has, as its main 4Karl Bithler, Die Sprachtheorie (Verlag Gustav Fischer in Jena, 1934).</page><page sequence="5">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART 473 objective, to represent drastically a situation, which through other means, would run the risk of not imposing itself with such intensity. In lyrical language the meaning of the sentence is not univocal and reveals a necessary ambiguity, especially as to the meaning of the subject-term, so as to arouse in us a steady affective resonance. There is no sense, therefore, in inquiring whether "l'Amor que move il sole e l'altre stelle" expresses a false or a true proposition. As a scientific statement, it would be false, since, regarding the movement of the stars, the accepted proposition is Kepler's, not Dante's. It is possible, though, that the line of the Divinra Commedia, in accordance with a certain objection presented at the conclusion of this semantic analy- sis, might have expressed a scientific truth to its author instead of a purely lyrical reaction. Love, for Dante, might perhaps in this metaphor be a synonym for cosmic reality, or synonymous with a universal energy which would set the celestial bodies in motion. This thesis is based on a misap- prehension very common in poetical criticism, that in order to understand a poem, it is indispensable to divine the poet's intention at the time he wrote it. Such a hypothesis would be admissible if the poetical sentence were to have only one meaning, as do the logical or the scientific proposition. Because of the manifold shades of meaning in lyrical language, the author's interpretation of the lines figures as only one amongst countless possible meanings, of an imprecise and ambiguous context. Besides, the kind of criticism which tries to discover Dante's real intention when he wrote this famous line would be mere verbal ingenuity, instead of esthetic judgment. The import of a poem like the Divina Commedia is not one and one only; since it contains different messages for generations to come. There does not exist, therefore, any interpretation of poetry which may be considered as the best authorized one, although a belief in such may inspire representatives of dogmatic criticism. Esthetic judgment in this domain must admit, as basic premise, the variety of possible interpretations of lyrical material and the wealth of aspects of artistic expression in all its shapes and forms. It is because of this liberty or poetic freedom that esthetic language is represented as anti-conventional par excellence. The canons of formal logic do not apply to this syntax, which is entirely free from compromise with the principles or norms which confer validity on discursive thought. The importance of an artist depends on the decision with which he destroys conventions and rules which are -deprived of interior vitality, thus, opening up a way to the arising of a new scale of values in the field of expression and stylistic. These statements are undeniably true, but it is necessary to make one important restriction. Anti-conventionalism in authentic art cannot be</page><page sequence="6">474 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH taken in an absolute sense. Poetic metaphor, for instance, is made possible only by virtue of a linguistic convention, which precedes it. What I wish to say is that literary language itself is a consequence of preliminary accept- ance of certain inviolable precepts, of given conditions, without which esthetic values would not be present and the artistic aspect of expression could not longer subsist. It is true that these precepts and conditions are extremely broad, but nevertheless, for all that, the discipline imposed by them does not seem to be less severe toward a quite conscious critique of the metamorphoses to which disguised conventionalism submits. The reason for this difficulty is, in great measure, due to the predominance, in relation to the art of po- etry, of a critical method which would consider it a real sacrilege to try-as we used to-to apply to the joem modern means of linguistic and semantic interpretation. Instead of this, dogmatic and academic critique, in ac- cordance with Maritain's Thomist prescription, prefers to stem from a supposed poetical ontology, subsequently deducing its essential properties. The concept of an entity or poetic essence, however, while leaving no margin for severe judgment, does open one's mind to the undisciplined irre- sponsibility of childish impressionism. I consider it much more advisable to take certain verses as a starting point and to inquire ingenuously what they mean. From such unbiased and direct analysis we can draw certain conclusions regarding the nature of lyric structures. The result of this analysis seems to me important from the point of view of critical judgment of esthetic values. Artistic anti-conventionalism must not hinder us from investigating the influence of precepts and canons over the ideas themselves which inspired the currents of literary schools. It would be easy to demonstrate that the classical school in literature was based on the acceptance of certain conventional canons which imposed themselves on the style and the expression of esthetic values during a cer- tain historical period. The reading of the manifestos of revolutionary movements in literature and art shows clearly that the suggestive power of the new ideas consisted, merely, in substituting for devitalized conventions other conventions, which opened up perspectives which were hitherto unknown. Stendhal's Racine et Shakespeare, published in 1823, attempts to demonstrate, by means of rational arguments, classicism's incapacity to adapt itself to the new con- ditions of that historical period. This French writer thinks that Racine's and Moliere's plays were suitable only to a court atmosphere at the time when black periwigs and embroidered coats were in fashion. Classicism contained nothing important or significant for the new generation, for the people, and for the industrial community. The substance of Stendhal's argument like that to be found in Victor</page><page sequence="7">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART 475 Hugo's famous preface to Cromwell and, more recently, in the manifestos of surrealism and existentialistic literature, consists in the assertion that pre- vious schools had already exhausted their reserves of latent possibilities, and had nothing left to do but to create an art free from prejudices and hostile to merely mechanized conventions. What these revolutionaries do not perceive, however, is that the conven- tionalism of preceding esthetics can only find an "Ersatz" in the anti-con- ventionalism of modern currents. Nowadays, the esthetic scene is dominated by the influence of literary conventions, which stem, in great measure, from the work of James Joyce, Eliot, Paul Valery, and R. M. Rilke. These new tendencies manifest themselves especially through a severe attitude in the manipulation of verbal structure. Language is considered, at the same time, instrument and objective, attempting to derive as yet unexplored effects from an esoteric vocabulary made flexible by preoccupa- tion with achieving shades of meaning and esthetic subtlety. What is most interesting in present-day trends in poetry, in music, and in painting is that productions are frequently limited to purely technical exercises, to a kind of craftmanship which imputes to the organization of the material itself, the paramount objective of artistic creation. I do not know whether I have been sufficiently clear, but what I wish to say is that poetry seems to be satisfied with the mere manipulation of words and sounds, whereas music-tends to the atonal association of sounds and rhythms, and painting explores colors and forms abstracted from their normal contexts. Poetry, in general, has become a purely linguistic exer- cise or process of recreation of verbal forms. It can be noted, however, that none of the arts tries to express anything which transcends the processes and elements of its technique. There is no room for expression properly speaking, if not in the new surprising acoustic combinations in music and unforeseen attempts at new verbal structure in poetry. The conventionalism of the modern esthetic of verse only escapes those who still think that poetry is a matter of pure sentiment or of clearly marked ideas. The force of modernist prejudices is of such a kind, that the publishing of a book by Karl Schapiro in which this wonderful poet returns to the cult of the canonic forms of didactic poetry, aroused the almost unanimous condemnation of authorized criticism. The return to conventions definitely superseded by the technical progres of verse is considered as a symptom of decadence, constituting a serious menace to balance and harmony of dominant esthetic values. The super- seding of academic precepts is visible enough, also, in the realm of painting and music. But, from time to time, one can see in both a rebirth of proc- esses and methods previously considered to be definitely shelved.</page><page sequence="8">476 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The penetrating observation of Wdlfflin' on the function of the pictorical and the linear, of surface and depth, of open and closed forms, of unity and multiplicity, of absolute and relative clarity, open up new vistas regarding the values of styles and the very development of artistic forms. In this phase of W6lfflin's studies, there is no room for purely conventional criteria. But at the minute W6lfflin begins to establish a distinction between a classic and a baroque school, not only in modern times, but also in ancient architecture, in the very domain of the Gothic, it becomes clear that both concepts (classic and baroque) appear as conventions indispensable to the study of the internal evolution of forms. Artistic manifestations become classic or baroque according to the prevalence of conventional precepts which define a kind of "immanent logic" for the various stylistic phases. Therefore, there exists a recurrent style or type in various works of art which acts as an organizing principle6 as an invariant structure through different historical periods. The recognition of this stylistic structure is not always easy, but it is up to art criticism to point it out wherever it may be discovered and to define its most important characteristics. This is ex- actly what Wdlfflin did with the classic and baroque which acquire a sense of a true working-hypothesis or heuristic convention for the interpretation of certain traits and qualities which occur in all periods of the history of art. Similar criteria could be applied to music since its historic development seems to waver between the two fundamental tendencies implicit in the classic and the baroque. It is evident, on the other hand, that tonal or atonal style constitutes a physical property of musical structures, but if the composer chooses between the two forms of artistic expression it will be hard to deny the conventional nature of this alternative. Objections to this theory, which admits an active influence of the conven- tions over the development of art and style are nearly always based on the belief that such criteria have their origin in unjustifiable scientific preju- dices. So, we try to show that, as opposed to science, philosophy is equipped to orient art criticism and to establish standards inspired by axiology or theory of values, perfectly applicable to the domain of poetry, music, and painting. In accordance with this philosophical orientation which is of Germanic origin and impregnated with idealism and phenomen- ology, an interpretation of art and literature based on the subjective experience (Erlebnis) will be much more acceptable than one based on conventions.

Ernst Nagel, "Nature and Convention," Journal of Philosophy, March 28, 1929.</page><page sequence="9">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART 477 The Anti-conventionalism of an authentic and restoring esthetic goes to prove the veracity of this argument, which, in artistic productions only recognizes the effectiveness of affective causes and spontaneous attitudes. The creation of esthetic values is only explained by the innate capacity to express original and profound experiences (vivencias, Erlebnisse). These would be the real criteria for esthetic philosophy and for well-oriented art criticism. The rest is more or less inspired by a certain coarse and non- understandable scientificism. These are the opinions which are current in the countries of Latin America, where Ortega y Gasset's superficial and brilliant eclecticism has exercised an influence as widespread as it has been disastrous. I can see, though, that in certain intellectual circles a healthy reaction is already taking place, a reaction against the evil tendency to assimilate, uncritically, the products of German thought and, subsequently, to send them forth with a strong seasoning of Latin imagination and verbiage. However, while esthetic impressionism will endure, where the judging of a work of art is concerned, there will be no place for a critical activity based on precise and severe criteria. I believe that esthetic judgment will be- come more penetrating, according to the ability evinced in discriminating linguistic or stylistic conventions of poetry and art, wherever they may insinuate themselves, by attempting to cloak themselves in objective reali- ties. Such discrimination of what distinguishes the conventional factor from the empirical context properly constitutes the basis of relativism in esthetic judgment. Relativism, in the computation of artistic produc- tions, is converted into a guarantee of its soundness. The influence of philosophical criteria on criticism, almost always mani- fests itself through an over-emphasis on absolute values in art and in the concept of beauty. It is natural that the attempts at a scientific systemati- zation of esthetics should introduce into this field that same relativistic spirit, that spirit which has already shown itself so fruitful in the realm of research and positive knowledge. Scientific propositions are conjectural and hypothetical: there is nothing more beneficial than for our assertions regarding the nature of art to wear the cloak of the same anti-dogmatic tendency. The thesis of esthetic conventionalism, however, is only clarified through a careful analysis of the structure of ethical and social conventions. There exist certain precepts and rules which constitute the basis of human fellowship and mutual understanding. These precepts are not justified, merely, by having undergone the test of critical analysis and experimenta- tion. They impose themselves on account of circumstances which have nothing to do with proof or rational demonstration. Their power, however, is urgent: it constitutes a real exhortation and command exercised over the</page><page sequence="10">478 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH smallest details of our behavior. Ethical and social conventions, though, vary according to period, to geographic frontiers, to races and cultures. In my country, for instance, an invitation to lunch or dinner frequently means something quite different from and even contrary to what is gener- ally accepted in other civilizations. Thus, if anyone makes a prolonged call in the course of the morning and because of this is invited to stay to lunch, this invitation must be interpreted as nothing more than a conventional formula, whose meaning is simply a reminder that one's visit is becoming inconvenient. The characteristic attributed by Poincare to geometries which are not true, but useful and convenient is easily extended to usage, habit, and social convention. Social convention, though, presupposes tacit agree- ment, generalized acceptance by a group or community receptive to certain forms of moral and political conduct. It might be an excellent idea to examine the influence of conventions or social precepts over the political ideologies prevailing in different countries. There used to be a great deal of talk about the effect of myths on Nazi, communistic, and democratic ideas. I believe that the mythological char- acter of these militant political theories has been exaggerated. Frequently, it is not a question of a myth itself, properly speaking, but of a legitimate convention accepted and imposed by a given minority, on the majority. The explosive nature of these beliefs warns us that there exists a profound difference between a conscious acceptance of a precept of which we make use, because we consider it efficient or rational and the attitude of one who assimilates by passive suggestion, without critical examination of its context. I have, intentionally, left to the last part of this paper a very general synthesis of the different meanings which may be attributed to the word convention. In the first place, the expression referred to figured as a pro- ductive formula or operational concept. In this regard, it is as well to re- member that convention figures in science, especially, in theoretical phys- ics, under the form of "disguised definitions." As this, however, it acquires the shape of an organizatory principle of scientific knowledge, of an actual working hypothesis, the test of which consists in its greater or smaller pro- ductivity as a process of systematization and interpretation of empirical data. Convention includes, also, the precept and the heuristic rule and usually becomes concrete in choice or decision when faced with an alterna- tive situation. Later on, I tried to extend the meaning of conventional formula so as to include the habit, use, or custom which is only justified when there is a certain aim to be reached (social, political, or ethical). In the realm of art, convention presents itself as a style or recurrent type which serves as basis for rational interpretation of artistic forms. In all these</page><page sequence="11">CONVENTION, NATURE, AND ART 479 different examples, the word convention has kept its meaning of an opera- tional criterion which adapts itself to an immanent logic in the state of affairs and.in the mechanism of processes and relationships.
