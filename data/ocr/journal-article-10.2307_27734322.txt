Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007 Abstract Alvin Plantinga has famously argued that metaphysical naturalism is self-defeating, and cannot be rationally accepted. I distinguish between two dif ferent ways of understanding this argument, which I call the "probabilistic inference conception", and the "process characteristic conception". I argue that the former is what critics of the argument usually presuppose, whereas most critical responses fail when one assumes the latter conception. To illustrate this, I examine three standard objections to Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism: the Perspiration Objection, the Tu Quoque Objection, and the "Why Can't the Naturalist Just Add a Little Something?" Objection. I show that Plantinga's own responses to these objections fail, and propose counterexamples to his first two principles of defeat. I then go on to construct more adequate responses to these objections, using the distinctions I develop in the first part of the paper.

Mirza hence cannot be rationally accepted.1 This argument has generated a great deal of controversy, and a substantial literature concerning it has grown up as a result.2 While this literature is full of insights and interesting proposals, it does not seem as though we are nearing a resolution of the debates that Plantinga's argument has provoked. The aim of this paper is to contribute to a resolution of these debates. It seems to me that the main problem affecting current discussions of the evolutionary argument against naturalism (or EAAN, as we will call it henceforth) is that both its proponents and its detractors have typically assumed a certain understanding of the way the argument is supposed to work. Once we realize that this understanding is far from compulsory, many outstanding issues concerning the argument become easy to resolve. In particular, or so I claim, the vast majority of the objections to EAAN that have been put forward by its various commentators can be seen to fail once we can recognize an alternative way of understanding it. While it is certainly not possible to consider each and every objection to EAAN in detail within the space of this paper, I wish to support and illustrate this claim by examining a few of the prominent objections that readily suggest themselves to philosophers. My hope is that by doing so, I will be able to lay out some of the conceptual groundwork necessary for a more adequate understanding of EAAN than that which has prevailed in the literature thus far. I will proceed as follows. I begin with an outline of EAAN, and then I describe what I take to be the main worry that critics have had concerning one of the central claims in Plantinga's argument. In Sect. 2,1 distinguish between two different conceptions of the way in which EAAN is supposed to work. I call these the probabilistic inference conception, and the process characteristic conception: the probabilistic inference conception is the conception that critics of EAAN typically assume (albeit without clearly stating it), whereas the process characteristic conception is the alternative to which I wish to draw attention. Section 3 explains why the probabilistic inference conception should be rejected, and explains the process characteristic conception in more detail. Finally, in Sect. 4, "Objections to the Defeater Thesis", I use the process characteristic conception to resolve prominent issues concerning EAAN. My goal is to illustrate the power of this conception in resolving such issues, and to encourage philosophers to adopt it as a way of thinking about EAAN. 1 Outline of EAAN Let N stand for metaphysical naturalism; let E stand for the view that human cognitive faculties have evolved by way of the mechanisms, processes and events that are studied by contemporary evolutionary theory, such as natural selection 1 Alvin Plantinga, "Is Naturalism Irrational?", Chapter 12 in Warrant and Proper Function (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press 1993), pp. 216-237. In this book, the evolutionary argument against naturalism is referred to as the "main argument", and should be distinguished from the "preliminary argument" developed in the same chapter.

Plantinga gives an argument for the claim that P(R/N&amp;E) is either low, or inscrutable (meaning that we cannot determine whether it is low or high): call this the Probability Thesis. He then argues for the claim that anyone who accepts both N and E and who also accepts the Probability Thesis, has a defeater for R:4 call this the Defeater Thesis. Why would anyone believe something like the Defeater Thesis? Plantinga here appeals to certain analogies: chief among these analogies is the following thought experiment:5 The Case of the Drug XX. Suppose a man believes that he has taken an unreliability-inducing drug called XX. He also believes that the drug is likely to cause global unreliability of such a serious kind that its victims are typically rendered unable to detect their own unreliability, (that is, they continue to believe that they are reliable when in fact they are not). He comes to believe that the probability that a person has remained cognitively reliable given that they have taken this drug is low or inscrutable. More formally, if we let XX also stand for the statement that the man has taken the drug, and let R' be the proposition that the man has reliable cognitive faculties, then P(R7XX) is low or inscrutable. Under these conditions, says Plantinga, the man has a defeater for R'. Having defended the Defeater Thesis in this fashion, Plantinga goes on to say that anyone who has a defeater for R has a defeater for each one of her beliefs. Since any sensible naturalist will also accept E, it follows that the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis thereby has a defeater for her belief in naturalism. This concludes the argument that naturalism is self-defeating. Every aspect of the argument has 3 The qualification "over some range" is necessary, because it is easy to see that there are many circumstances in which our cognitive faculties are not reliable at all: there are, for example, all those circumstances in which they are not functioning properly (whether due to drugs, illness, or injury), and there are all those circumstances for which the design plan of our cognitive faculties is not appropriate (trying to judge the relative distances of heavenly bodies on the basis of perception would be an example of such a circumstance). In the latter range of circumstances, many would include attempts to solve philosophical problems as well e.g. Colin McGinn, Problems in Philosophy. (Oxford, UK and Cambridge, USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1994). A reviewer has pointed out to me that, since one can divide up human cognition into different domains, our evaluation of the likelihood of human cognitive faculties being reliable may vary depending on the domain we are considering. This is correct; however, if Plantinga's argument for the Probability Thesis is sound, then P(R/N&amp;E) will be low or inscrutable no matter what domain we are considering. The reason is that the considerations on which Plantinga's argument for the Probability Thesis rests are entirely independent of the domain being considered. For more details on Plantinga's argument for the Probability Thesis, see Alvin Plantinga, "Introduction", in Naturalism Defeated? ed. Beilby, pp. 5-10. 4 Plantinga also argues that theism does not suffer from the same problems that he identifies with naturalism (or at least does not suffer from the same problems in the same way). His argument is thus a way of exhibiting a certain advantage he believes theism has over naturalism. 5 This is the most prominent analogy in the discussions presented in Naturalism Defeated? Essays on Alvin Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism, James Beilby, ed. (Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press 2002a). Other analogies, like the Case of the Cartesian Demon, will not be discussed here for lack of space. ? Springer</page><page sequence="4">128 O. Mirza been subjected to scrutiny, but the vast majority of objections to it have focused on the Defeater Thesis.6 Hence, this latter claim will be the subject of this paper. There has been one main worry that critics have had about the Defeater Thesis. The objections to EAAN that we will consider later on are manifestations of this worry, which can be expressed as follows: what exactly is the connection between the naturalist's acceptance of the Probability Thesis on the one hand, and her acquisition of a defeater for R on the other? In the next section of this paper I address this worry in detail: I show that there are two distinct conceptions of the connection between the naturalist's acceptance of the Probability Thesis, and her acquisition of a defeater for R. I call these the probabilistic inference conception of the way in which the naturalist acquires a defeater for R, and the process characteristic conception of the way in which the naturalist acquires a defeater for R. 2 How could the naturalist acquire a defeater for R? A notion that is central to EAAN is that of a defeater. In what follows, we will adopt Plantinga's own definition of this notion, as follows: D is a defeater of B for S iff 5"s noetic structure N includes B and is such that any human being (1) whose cognitive faculties are functioning properly in the relevant respects, (2) whose noetic structure is N, and (3) who comes to believe D but nothing else independent of or stronger than D would withhold B (or believe it less strongly.7 The basic idea here is that if S has a defeater for B, and S continues to hold onto B, then S is being irrational. It has been widely noted that there are two distinct kinds of defeater: there are rebutting defeaters, and there are undercutting defeaters. Different authors have defined these terms somewhat differently.8 We will define them as follows: D is a rebutting defeater for B if and only if D is a defeater for B in virtue of being a reason to believe the negation of B. D is an undercutting defeater for B if and only if D is a defeater for B in virtue of being a reason to doubt the trustworthiness of B's source. 6 Outside of the literature on EAAN, there is significant discussion of whether or not evolution favors true beliefs, and this has a bearing on the Probability Thesis. For example, see CL. Stephens, "When is it Selectively Advantageous to Have True Beliefs? Sandwiching the Better Safe Than Sorry Argument", Philosophical Studies 105:2, 2001. However, criticism of EAAN itself tends to focus on the Defeater Thesis. 7 Alvin Plantinga, "Naturalism Defeated", (unpublished manuscript: 1994), p. 33. 8 The distinction between rebutting defeaters and undercutting defeaters was introduced into the literature by John Pollock. His definitions of the terms "rebutting" and "undercutting", while related to the ones I adopt, are nevertheless quite different. See John Pollock, Contemporary Theories of Knowledge (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield, 1999), pp. 196-197. Alternative definitions of "rebutting" and "undercutting" can be found in Michael Bergmann, "Defeaters and Higher-Level Requirements", The Philosophical Quarterly 55:220, 2005, p. 424. ? Springer</page><page sequence="5">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 129 Given the way we have defined rebutting and undercutting defeaters, it is easy to see that all defeaters will be either rebutting or undercutting. One way to see this is inductively: if we look at any particular case of a defeater, we will find that it works either by being a reason to believe the negation of a belief, or by being a reason to doubt the trustworthiness of the source of a belief. Another way to see why this is true is to imagine a belief B, and to suppose that a person who holds the belief B acquires another belief D'. Now suppose that D' does not give the person in question any reason to believe that B is false, and it also does not give him any reason to doubt the trustworthiness of B's source. Then it is clear that D' is not a reason for the man to give up B, and hence is not a defeater for B. These brief considerations do not amount to a definitive proof of the claim that all defeaters are either rebutting or undercutting; but very often, in philosophy, we have to recognize that definitive proofs are not available, and thus we should accept those claims that we find the most plausible on reflection. In this case, it seems hard to deny that defeaters are either rebutting or undercutting, given the way that we have defined these terms. So we will accept this as a provisional assumption in what follows. It follows from the discussion above that if the naturalist acquires a defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis, this defeater is either rebutting or it is undercutting. Let us now return to the main worry that, I claim, lies behind all of the different objections that critics have made to the Defeater Thesis. That worry was: what exactly is the connection between the naturalist's acceptance of the Probability Thesis and her acquisition of a defeater for R? I now want to show that the proponent of EAAN can answer this question in one of two ways, depending on whether she takes the naturalist's defeater to be rebutting or undercutting. Suppose, to begin with, that the proponent of EAAN takes the naturalist's defeater to be rebutting. Our EAAN-proponent must then think that the naturalist, in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis, acquires evidence against R (evidence which does not necessarily require him to believe that R is false). The only way this is possible is if the Probability Thesis supports an inference to the conclusion not-R (in conjunction with other beliefs of the naturalist, specifically N&amp;E). On the probabilistic inference conception, the naturalist acquires a defeater in virtue of such an inference, which can be represented schematically as follows: P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable N&amp;E Therefore not-R.9 If the naturalist acquires a rebutting defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis, it surely must be by way of the inference given above; there do 9 Note that this inference is not meant to be a representation of EAAN itself. This should be clear given that the Defeater Thesis is a premise in EAAN, but appears nowhere among the premises of this inference. The significance of this inference is merely this. Assuming that the Defeater Thesis is true and that the defeater for R to which it refers is rebutting, then it is in virtue of the support provided by the premises of this inference to its conclusion that the naturalist acquires this rebutting defeater for R. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">130 O. Mirza not seem to be any other options. Thus, if the EAAN-proponent takes the naturalist's defeater to be rebutting, he is thereby committed to the probabilistic inference conception. Now suppose that the EAAN-proponent takes the defeater to be undercutting. An undercutting defeater for a belief, let us recall, is one that undermines the trustworthiness of that beliefs source. But how could accepting the Probability Thesis undermine the trustworthiness of the source of R? I can only think of one initially plausible way for the EAAN-proponent to explain how this undercutting defeater arises. I will call this the process characteristic conception. The basic idea behind the process characteristic conception of EAAN is that when the naturalist accepts that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable, she has good reason to think that the process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties had a certain character istic; and that it is in virtue of having this good reason that she acquires an undercutting defeater for R. What is this characteristic, exactly? It can be expressed in terms of certain common metaphors: we can say that the process was not sensitive to whether or not human cognitive faculties would be reliable, that it was not directed towards producing human cognitive faculties that would be reliable, that it didn't "care" whether or not human cognitive faculties would turn out reliable, and so on. These metaphors may seem uncomfortably anthropomorphic. But there are other ways to identify the characteristic that is intended here, one of which I will henceforth adopt. That way is to say that, during the operation of the process that resulted in the creation of human cognitive faculties, there were no conditions that could serve to filter out unreliable cognitive faculties. Or, as we might put it, the process did not involve any filter of unreliable cognitive faculties. It has been widely assumed that, during the period when our cognitive faculties were being formed by natural selection acting on random genetic variation, the conditions in which our cognitive faculties and the cognitive faculties of our ancestors were being used were filtering out unreliable cognitive faculties. The filtering mechanism in this case would simply be the tendency of false beliefs to lead to maladaptive action. Now, it is clear that Plantinga is at pains to deny this common assumption. And this suggests that we might be able to make some progress in understanding EAAN if we adopt the following conception of the EAAN defeater: the relevance of the Probability Thesis in EAAN is that the naturalist who accepts it either has good reason to think that the process that created human beings did not involve a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties, or at least good reason to doubt that the process that created human beings involved a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties; moreover, the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis will have, on this conception, an undercutting defeater for R. So far then, we have two different conceptions to which the EAAN-proponent can appeal in explaining how the naturalist acquires a defeater for R: the probabilistic inference conception, and the process characteristic conception. Can these two do the job that is asked of them? In other words, would adopting one of these conceptions support the conclusion that the naturalist does in fact have a defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis? I address these questions in the next section. ?} Springer</page><page sequence="7">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 131 3 Examining two conceptions of how the naturalist could acquire a defeater for R 3.1 The probabilistic inference conception I now want to argue that the Defeater Thesis cannot be defended on the basis of the probabilistic inference conception. Recall that the Probability Thesis is the statement that "P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable". The logical form of the Probability Thesis shows us that it is a disjunction, the two disjuncts being the statements "P(R/N&amp;E) is low" and "P(R/ N&amp;E) is inscrutable". Now consider a naturalist who accepts N&amp;E and also accepts the Probability Thesis, but who only accepts the Probability Thesis because he thinks that P(R/N&amp;E) is inscrutable. Could such a naturalist reasonably make an inference from the Probability Thesis and N&amp;E to the conclusion not-R? It seems not, for the proposed inference would only be reasonable given the acceptability of the following inference: P(R/N&amp;E) is inscrutable N&amp;E Therefore not-R There is, however, not the slightest reason to think that such an inference supports its conclusion. Thus, there cannot be any reasonable inference from the Probability Thesis and N&amp;E to the claim not-R. And the objections to the Defeater Thesis that we will study in Sect. 4 of this paper can be understood as being, essentially, different ways of defending this same conclusion. 3.2 The process characteristic conception When we consider whether or not a given source of beliefs is reliable, one relevant set of facts concerns those processes that causally affect the reliability of that source. These processes include those that were responsible for the origin of that source, as well as those that affect the source after it has come into being. There are cases in which a person S has an undercutting defeater for her belief in the reliability of some source of beliefs F when the following conditions are satisfied: (1) S believes that there has been a process P, capable of causally affecting the source F, such that the reliability of F is not only dependent on the outcome of P, but is also completely determined by that outcome i.e. S believes that there were no causal factors involved independent of this process P that interfered with the causal effects of P. (2) S believes that she has no source of warrant for the belief that F is reliable other than the pronouncements of F itself. (3) S has good reasons to doubt or deny that the operation of the process P involved a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties. 4y Springer</page><page sequence="8">132 O. Mirza These conditions describe a situation in which, from S's point of view, S's belief in the reliability of her source is based only on the output of that source itself, and in which that source is causally dependent on a process which simply didn't "care" whether or not it turned out reliable. It ought to be intuitively obvious that there will be such situations in which S will have a defeater for her belief in the reliability of her source. Moreover, since in these situations none of her beliefs give S anything like strong evidence against her belief in the reliability of the source in question, S cannot have a rebutting defeater for that belief. These points are well illustrated by the standard analogies put forward by Plantinga in defense of the Defeater Thesis. For example, the case of the drug XX fits this pattern and it is intuitively obvious that the subject has a defeater for R: in the literature and discussions on this point, as far as I'm aware, there has not been any controversy regarding the prima facie plausibility of the claim that the subject in this example does have a defeater for R. Moreoever, it is not at all plausible to assert that the subject has a rebutting defeater for R. For the claim that P(R/XX) is low or inscrutable cannot support anything more than a weak inference to the conclusion not-R, if it can be said to support such an inference at all. There seems to be no doubt that there can be defeaters that fit the above pattern. The only remaining question is whether or not the specific case of EAAN is one that does fit the same pattern. Suppose we take S to be the naturalist, P to be the evolutionary process which created human cognitive faculties, and F to be human cognitive faculties themselves. Then it is clear that the first and second conditions above are satisfied. The only remaining question is whether or not the third condition (3) is satisfied for the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis. I now want to describe one initially plausible way in which the proponent of EAAN can argue that this third condition is also satisfied in the case of the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis. Let us begin by asking why it is that people would generally think that P(R/N&amp;E) is high. The reason is surely just that they assume that natural selection involves a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties. If this is the case, then it gives the naturalist a good reason to think that R is true, given that N&amp;E is true. That means that it gives the naturalist a good reason to think that P(R/N&amp;E) is high. We can summarize this as follows: (F) If the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable faculties, then P(R/N&amp;E) is high. From (F) it follows, by contraposition, that (A) If P(R/N&amp;E) is low, then the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties did not involve a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties. Letting K stand for the sentential operator "The naturalist is capable of rationally accepting that", we can see that if P(R/N&amp;E) is inscrutable, then ~K(P(R/N&amp;E) is high) (this follows from the meaning of "inscrutable"); and if ~K(P(R/N&amp;E) is high), then ~ K(the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable faculties) (for if the consequent of this last 4y Springer</page><page sequence="9">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 133 conditional were false, then the naturalist could rationally argue, on the basis of (F), to the conclusion that P(R/N&amp;E) is high). From these last two conditional statements, it follows, by hypothetical syllogism, that (B) If P(R/N&amp;E) is inscrutable, then ~K(the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable faculties). Now suppose that the naturalist accepts that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. Recall that the Probability Thesis is the disjunction (PT) Either P(R/N&amp;E) is low or P(R/N&amp;E) is inscrutable. From (A) and (B), and the Probability Thesis, it follows by disjunctive dilemma that (D) Either the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties did not involve a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties or ~ K (the evolutionary process responsible for creating human cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable faculties). The naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis has good reason to accept (D), by virtue of the considerations given above, and thus good reason to doubt or deny that the operation of the process of natural selection that resulted in the creation of human cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable faculties. In conclusion then, the process characteristic conception describes a way in which undercutting defeaters can arise in general. Moreover there is an argument with some initial plausibility that shows, in light of the process characteristic conception, how the naturalist acquires an undercutting defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis. The process characteristic conception is thus a viable way of understanding EAAN. 4 Objections to the Defeater Thesis We are now ready to examine objections to the Defeater Thesis. I will focus on three: the Perspiration Objection, the Tu Quoque Objection, and the Nonproposi tional Evidence Objection. Each of the following sections will examine one of these objections, and each section will contain (1) a statement of the objection, (2) a discussion of significant or interesting features of the objection, (3) a description of Plantinga's own response to the objection, (4) an account of some of the problems with Plantinga's response to the objection, and (5) a new response to the objection based on the process characteristic conception. 4.1 The Perspiration Objection 4.1.1 Statement of the Perspiration Objection You claim that the naturalist has a defeater for R in the fact that the probability of R on N&amp;E is either low or inscrutable. The probability that the function of ? Springer</page><page sequence="10">134 O. Mirza perspiration is to cool the body, given (just) N&amp;E is also low, as is the probability that Holland, Michigan is thirty miles from Grand Rapids, given N&amp;E. But surely it would be absurd to claim that these facts give the partisan of N&amp;E a defeater for those beliefs.10 That is how Plantinga puts the Perspiration Objection. He attributes it to Frederick Suppe, Michael DePaul, and Stephen Wykstra.11 Branden Fitelson and Elliott Sober have put forward a similar example: they note that it is hard to estimate the probability of the proposition "birds fly" relative to the proposition "the theory of special relativity is true"; thus it is reasonable to think this probability is low or inscrutable; but it seems absurd to say that we have a defeater for our belief that birds fly just in virtue of accepting this along with the theory of special relativity.12 4.1.2 Discussion of the Perspiration Objection Clearly, examples such as those given above can be manufactured easily, and they constitute a natural objection if we understand EAAN in accordance with the probabilistic inference conception. For the major problem that we have seen so far with EAAN, when read in accordance with the probabilistic inference conception, is that it appeals to a very weak probabilistic inference. One way to show that this is a weak probabilistic inference is to construct an analogous case of an inference whose weakness is not a matter of dispute. And the various examples we have mentioned above clearly provide such analogous cases.13 In addition to highlighting the weakness of the probabilistic inference from the Probability Thesis and N&amp;E to not-R, the Perspiration Objection has a more general significance: by providing us with examples of cases in which a person believes B, A and "P(B/A) is low or inscrutable", but clearly does not acquire a defeater for B, the Perspiration Objection raises the question of how we can determine which are the cases in which seeing that a probability is low or inscrutable does lead to there being such a defeater. 4.1.3 Plantinga*s response to the Perspiration Objection Plantinga writes: Is the objector right? I think not. She apparently presupposes that (or apparently presupposes that my argument presupposes that) 10 Alvin Plantinga, "Naturalism Defeated", (unpublished manuscript: 1994), p. 14. I obtained a copy of this paper from the author. It is also available (although without numbered pages) at http:// www.homestead.com/philofreligion/files/alspaper.htm. 11 Ibid., p. 14. Plantinga does not mention any published sources for these objections. 12 Branden Fitelson and Elliott Sober, "Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism", Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 79:2, 1998, p. 124. 13 The Perspiration Objection itself is such an analogous case, as is the example from Fitelson and Sober mentioned above. ? Springer</page><page sequence="11">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 135 (5) For any propositions A and B I believe, if B is improbable or inscrutable with respect to A (i.e., the right attitude towards the question of its probability with respect to A is agnosticism) then A is a defeater for B. (5), however, is false, which ill befits a principle.14 Clearly, Plantinga thinks that what lies behind this objection is the assumption that EAAN relies on the principle above. And in his later reply to James Van Cleve,15 in which he deals with this same objection, Plantinga stresses that he is not appealing to any principles: Well, I don't know of any general principle here that will do the job. (Finding such general principles is always a pretty tall order). But why would I need such a principle? Indeed wouldn't the right procedure here be broadly inductive; shouldn't we, at least in this specific sort of case, follow Chisholm in being particularists?16 Plantinga goes on to explain that he is instead defending the claim that the naturalist has a defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis by citing certain analogies (such as the case of the drug XX and the case of the Cartesian demon introduced above in our outline of EAAN). Plantinga's response to the Perspiration Objection can thus be summarized as follows: the Perspiration Objection presupposes that EAAN relies on a certain principle; however, EAAN does not rely on any such principle, but rather on various analogies. Thus, says Plantinga, the Perspiration Objection fails. In addition to refuting the Perspiration Objection, Plantinga is also sensitive to the challenge of explaining in general how to distinguish the situations in which low or inscrutable probability does yield a defeater from those in which it does not. As a first step in answering this general question, (and not as a response to the Perspiration Objection itself) he proposes what he calls the First Principle of Defeat (FPD): If S rationally believes that the warrant a belief B has for him is derivative from the warrant a belief A has for him, then B is not a defeater, for him, of A.11 With FPD in place, it becomes possible to explain why a broad range of cases involving low or inscrutable probability do not yield a defeater. As an example of one of these cases, consider Plantinga's own counterexample to what he calls principle (5), which is as follows: .I believe (6) You own an old Nissan, and I also believe (7) You own a Japanese car. 14 This reply appears in Plantinga, "Naturalism Defeated", p. 37. 15 In Naturalism Defeated?, ed. James Beilby, p. 238. 16 Ibid., p. 239. 17 Plantinga, "Naturalism Defeated", p. 41. Q Springer</page><page sequence="12">136 O. Mirza (6) is improbable with respect to (7) (most people who own a Japanese car do not have an old Nissan); but obviously (7) is not a defeater for (6).18 In the above case, (7) is not a defeater of (6), and this can be explained by the FPD because the warrant of (7) is derivative from the warrant of (6). Plantinga does not claim that FPD, by itself, constitutes an adequate theory of when low or inscrutable probability yields a defeater. However, we can think of it as an important first step in the direction of such a theory, since it is meant to provide a sufficient condition for such a probability not to yield a defeater. 4.1.4 Problems with Plantinga*s response to the Perspiration Objection I claim that Plantinga's response to the Perspiration Objection is only adequate given one specific way of construing the Perspiration Objection, one on which the examples used by the objector are meant to be a reductio ad absurdum of the principle that is alleged to lie behind EAAN (that is, principle (5)). There is, however, another construal, on which the point of the Perspiration Objection is to put forward certain analogies; only this time, unlike the case of EAAN, the analogies are put forward, not in the service of defending the Defeater Thesis, but rather in the service of attacking it. These analogies are used to show that the naturalist does not have a defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis. For, so the argument goes, if the naturalist did have such a defeater as is claimed by Plantinga, then by analogy she would also have a defeater in the Perspiration case. But since it is absurd to claim that the naturalist has a defeater in the latter case, it is also absurd to claim that the naturalist has a defeater in the former. The structure of this argument is also that of a reductio ad absurdum. But this is not a reductio of any principle alleged to lie behind EAAN. And since the Perspiration Objection, on this construal, does not appeal to there being any implicit principle like (5), Plantinga's original response to it is inapplicable. The First Principle of Defeat, which Plantinga proposed in the course of discussing the Perspiration Objection, also fails, because there are counterexamples to it. Here is one: imagine that I come to believe that French philosophers always speak the truth and nothing but the truth and that then, after an injudicious reading of Descartes, I come to believe that there really is an evil demon of the kind he describes (B), so that I am forced to conclude that my cognitive faculties are mostly unreliable (A). I rationally believe that the warrant, for me, of A, is derivative from the warrant for me of B, and so, according to FPD, A is not a defeater, for me, of B. But this is wrong? surely the belief that my cognitive faculties are unreliable is a defeater for any belief I hold, including B. It is not hard to construct similar counterexamples. 4.1.5 A new response to the Perspiration Objection Before explaining why the Perspiration Objection fails, it will be helpful to lay out the argument explicitly in standard form. Let F be the statement that "The function 18 Ibid., p. 40. 4? Springer</page><page sequence="13">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 137 of perspiration is to cool the body". The Perspiration Objection can be expressed as follows: (A) If the naturalist who sees that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for R, then the naturalist who sees that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for F. (B) It is not the case that the naturalist who sees that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for F. (C) Therefore, it is not the case that the naturalist who sees that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for R. This argument is valid, and (B) is uncontroversial, so I will argue against (A). (A) is only plausible because of a perceived analogy between the EAAN case and the Perspiration case. The force of this perceived analogy can be brought out by thinking of (A) as being itself the conclusion of an argument, as follows: (S) The epistemic situation of the naturalist who accepts that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable and the epistemic situation of the naturalist who accepts that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable are similar in all relevant respects. (A) Therefore, if the naturalist who sees that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for R, then the naturalist who sees that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable has a defeater for F. I will now argue that (S) is false, and hence that (A) is unsupported. If EAAN is understood in accordance with the process characteristic conception, then the defeater which the naturalist acquires in virtue of accepting that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable is an undercutting defeater. A serious problem arises, however, with the idea that the naturalist could have an undercutting defeater for F in virtue of accepting that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. For an undercutting defeater is one that calls into question the trustworthiness of a beliefs source. It is here that a difference between the Perspiration case and the EAAN case can begin to be discerned. For in the latter case, there is at least some explicit mention of human cognitive faculties in the Probability Thesis, whereas there is no such mention in the claim that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. This fact alone makes it difficult to see how the claim that P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable could possibly be relevant to an assessment of the reliability of our cognitive faculties, and so makes it difficult to see how the trustworthiness of the source of the belief F could be called into question just in virtue of the naturalist's acceptance of this claim. Given the process characteristic conception, the Probability Thesis is directly relevant to questions about the reliability of human cognitive faculties, and thus to questions about the trustworthiness of the source of the belief R; the claim that P(F/ N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable is not similarly relevant to questions about the trustworthiness of the source of the belief F. The analogy proposed by the proponent of the Perspiration Objection between her example and the case of the naturalist in EAAN thus breaks down. And so the Perspiration Objection fails. The process characteristic conception also provides useful guidance on the question that led Plantinga to propose the First Principle of Defeat, namely the 4? Springer</page><page sequence="14">138 O. Mirza question of how we can distinguish the conditions under which accepting that a probability is low or inscrutable yields a defeater from those under which accepting a probability is low or inscrutable does not yield any defeater. More specifically, the process characteristic conception draws our attention to one way in which probability statements can be relevant to defeat: certain probability statements imply that a process affecting the reliability of a given source of beliefs does not involve any filter of unreliability. We have already given an argument to the effect that the probability statement "P(R/N&amp;E) is low" is one such statement. Clearly, it would be useful to have a general characterization of all such statements. This is a project that I will not undertake here, but I mention it to indicate one natural line of investigation that grows out of recognizing the process characteristic conception as a viable way of understanding EAAN. 4.2 The Tu Quoque Objection It is easy to see why the Perspiration Objection fails, because the analogue in it of the Probability Thesis, namely the statement that "P(F/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable" doesn't have any bearing on the reliability of the source of our belief in F. So if we wish to develop a more viable objection to EAAN, we will have to do so by constructing a case in which the analogue of the Probability Thesis does have a bearing on the reliability of some source of beliefs. One objection which allows us to do this is the Tu Quoque Objection. 4.2.1 Statement of the Tu Quoque Objection The Tu Quoque Objection could be put as follows: "The theist believes that there is a God: an omniscient, omnipotent and supremely benevolent being responsible for creating and governing the world. This means that, unless his powers of inference are severely limited, the theist also believes what is entailed by theism, namely that there is a very powerful being that has created human cognitive faculties. Call this latter belief austere theism, which we will denote by A. Now, the conditional probability P(R/A) is very hard to determine, and so the most plausible opinion about its value is that it is inscrutable, from which it follows that it is low or inscrutable. Since every theist is an austere theist, it follows that any theist who sees that this probability is low or inscrutable has a defeater for R. This can be supported by exactly the same analogies as are used to support the claim that the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis has a defeater for R." 4.2.2 Discussion of the Tu Quoque Objection I now want to explain why this is a serious problem for proponents of EAAN. The reason is that the Tu Quoque Objection presents the proponent of EAAN with the following dilemma. Either the objection is cogent, or it is not. If it is 4y Springer</page><page sequence="15">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 139 cogent, then theism loses the very theoretical advantage over naturalism that it was one of the purposes of EAAN to exhibit. If it is not cogent, then neither is EAAN, since both are, apparently, supported by exactly the same analogies. The ideal response for the proponent of EAAN in the face of this dilemma is to maintain both that EAAN is cogent and that the Tu Quoque Objection is not, thus rejecting the second conditional in the dilemma above. This response will involve finding some relevant difference between EAAN and the Tu Quoque Objection in virtue of which the latter can be shown not to be cogent, while the former cannot. 4.2.3 Plantinga's response to the Tu Quoque Objection Plantinga has presented exactly such a response. He proposes a principle governing defeat, and his idea is that the Tu Quoque Objection violates this principle, whereas EAAN does not. The principle in question is called the Second Principle of Defeat (SPD): If S rationally believes that the warrant of a belief A for her, is derivative from the warrant of a belief B then, for any belief C, A won't be a defeater of C, for her, unless she rationally believes that B is a defeater, for her, of C.19 Let A be austere theism, B be theism simpliciter, and C be R. Consider a theist who rationally believes that the warrant A has for her is derivative from the warrant B has for her (as she might if she shared Plantinga's religious epistemology).20 She does not rationally believe that B is a defeater, for her, of C, and so, according to SPD, A is not a defeater, for her, of C. Thus, according to Plantinga, the Tu Quoque Objection fails. 4.2.4 Problems with Plantinga's response to the Tu Quoque Objection As with FPD, there are counterexamples to the principle SPD. For SPD is equivalent, by way of elementary propositional logic, to SPD1: If S rationally believes that the warrant of a belief A for her is derivative from the warrant of a belief B, then, for any belief C, if A is a defeater for her, of C, then she rationally believes that B is a defeater of C. But SPD1 is false, and hence so is SPD. To see this, we only need to show that it is possible for S to satisfy the antecedent of SPD1 with respect to some beliefs A and B, and for A to be a defeater for some other belief C, but for S to be unable to 19 Ibid., p. 45. 20 According to Plantinga's religious epistemology, the source of Christian belief is the Internal Testimony of the Holy Spirit, which gives the believer warrant for the entire complex of traditional Christian belief, (here labeled theism simpliciter), including such things as belief in the Holy Trinity, the reliability of the New Testament, and so on. Belief in the existence of God is a part of this complex, and so gets its warrant from theism simpliciter. This religious epistemology is defended and developed in detail in Alvin Plantinga, Warranted Christian Belief (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000). ? Springer</page><page sequence="16">140 O. Mirza rationally draw the conclusion that B is a defeater of C (due to cognitive malfunction, say). Hence it is possible for her to be unable to form the rational belief that B is a defeater of C, even if all the antecedent conditions of SPD1 are satisfied. For example, Sally is an ardent member of the Workers' Revolutionary Party, and believes that the Party speaks only the truth. In particular, she thinks that the Party leader, Bill, speaks only the truth (B). On his authority, she accepts dialectical materialism, which is a version of N, and also E. Now Bill, eager to protect the faith of his followers in such a cardinal doctrine as dialectical materialism, has written a paper in which he criticizes Plantinga's evolutionary argument against naturalism, although in the course of his paper he concedes that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. Sally reads and accepts this claim, the Probability Thesis. Assuming, for the sake of the discussion that Bill is mistaken and the argument is in fact sound: N&amp;E (A) is now, for Sally, a defeater of R (C). Moreover, she rationally believes that the warrant of A, for her, is derivative from the warrant of B (she believes A only because Bill accepts the truth of each of its conjuncts). However, Sally doesn't rationally believe that B is a defeater of R, the reason being that although she is smart enough to see this, her emotional attachment to the infallibility of her Party leader is too strong to allow her to admit it to herself. This counterexample shows that SPD1 is false, and hence that so is SPD. It is not hard to produce similar counterexamples. 4.2.5 A new response to the Tu Quoque Objection As I pointed out earlier, the Tu Quoque Objection confronts the proponent of EAAN with a dilemma, one horn of which can be expressed by the following conditional, (TQ) If EAAN is cogent, then so is the Tu Quoque Objection. TQ appears to be plausible because of a perceived analogy between the Tu Quoque Objection and EAAN. Just as in the case of the Perspiration Objection, I will argue that, if EAAN is understood in accordance with the process characteristic conception, then there is no epistemically significant analogy between the naturalist who accepts that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable and the theist who accepts that P(R/A) is low or inscrutable. For if there were such an epistemically significant analogy between the two cases, then the theist would acquire an undercutting defeater in virtue of accepting that P(R/A) is low or inscrutable. And, just as in the case of EAAN, the only plausible way of understanding how the theist could acquire such an undercutting defeater is given by the process characteristic conception. The question then arises: could this conception be used to show that the theist has a defeater in this case? No, because one of the key conditions of the process characteristic conception is not satisfied here. More specifically, the theist has not been given any grounds for doubting that the process she believes created her cognitive faculties involved a filter of unreliable cognitive faculties. The reason is that the proposition A does not incorporate any of the beliefs in virtue of which the theist is likely to believe that there was such a filter: such beliefs as, for example, the belief that God created 4? Springer</page><page sequence="17">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 141 humans in His image, a part of which involved giving them reliable cognitive faculties, or some version of the belief that God is no deceiver. Thus, although there is a superficial analogy between the Tu Quoque Objection and the case of the naturalist in EAAN, a study of the process characteristic conception shows that this analogy has no epistemic significance. 4.3 The Nonpropositional Evidence Objection The distinction between the probabilistic inference conception and the process characteristic conception can help us respond to a powerful criticism of EAAN due to Michael Bergmann. That criticism depends on the claim that the naturalist faced with EAAN has a great deal of nonpropositional evidence for her belief in R. The idea that our beliefs can have such nonpropositional evidence is a key feature of the epistemologies of a number of philosophers; one example is Thomas Reid, who in this regard has influenced Plantinga himself, and thus Bergmann calls his argument a "Reidian response" to EAAN.21 According to Bergmann, this nonpropositional evidence for R (which takes the form of an inclination to reject as absurd the contrary of R) prevents the naturalist from having a defeater for R simply in virtue of seeing that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable.22 4.3.1 Statement of the Nonpropositional Evidence Objection This objection is summarized by Bergmann as follows: For the sake of argument, we've conceded to Plantinga that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. He says this is a defeater for R. But the commonsense naturalist can respond as follows: "Even if a naturalist believed that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable, this needn't give her a defeater for R. For she could have nonpropositional evidence for R that is sufficiently strong to make belief in R rational, reasonable, and warranted?even for someone whose total relevant propositional evidence, k was such that P(R/k) is low or inscrutable..."23 The heart of Bergmann's response to EAAN can be expressed thus: the defeater with which the naturalist is threatened in EAAN fails to defeat R, because the nonpropositional evidence for R outweighs the propositional evidence presented in EAAN for the falsity of R. Bergmann demonstrates this by comparing EAAN to an example he calls the Straw Drawing Case.24 He expresses these two cases as follows. 21 Michael Bergmann, "Commonsense Naturalism", in Naturalism Defeated? ed. Beilby, 2002, p. 63. 22 Ibid., p. 67. 23 Ibid., p. 68. 24 Ibid., p. 73. In fact, Bergmann considers a number of other cases as well, but for the sake of simplicity, we will overlook these here. ? Springer</page><page sequence="18">142 O. Mirza Plantinga's N&amp;E Defeater for Naturalism: Because of the following beliefs: X: The sources of our beliefs (including my belief in naturalism) came about by way of N&amp;E. Y: P(a belief source is reliable/it came about by way of N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable It is reasonable to doubt: Z: Our belief sources are reliable (i.e. R).25 Straw-Drawing Case X: The straw is drawn from the lottery straws. Y: P(straw is about three inches long/it is drawn from lottery straws) is low or inscrutable. Z: The straw that is drawn is about three inches long.26 In each of these cases, two beliefs X and Y are alleged to give rise to a defeater for a belief Z; in the case of Plantinga's N&amp;E Defeater for Naturalism, X is N&amp;E, Y is the Probability Thesis, and Z is just R. However, in the Straw-Drawing Case X and Y clearly do not constitute a defeater of Z. As Bergmann puts it in discussing the Straw-Drawing Case, Suppose you came to believe, in the normal way (through observation), that Z?i.e., that the straw you selected from a large number of lottery straws is about three inches long. Then suppose you learn that all the lottery straws but one were twelve inches in length and that, as a result, you believe Y. This together with your belief that X would not make it reasonable for you to stop believing that the straw you drew was about three inches long. Instead, it would make it reasonable for you to think that something you know is true (i.e., Z) is unlikely given your propositional evidence.27 Bergmann notes that in these cases "we have some evidence against Z" (emphasis Bergmann' s), and then goes on to write that That evidence is a probabilistic inference from X and Y. If that evidence is not outweighed by other sufficiently strong evidence for Z, then the sensible thing to do is to have doubts about Z. The reason it is sensible to persist in believing Z in the straw-drawing case is that the evidence for Z from sense perception and memory is sufficiently strong to outweigh the counterevidence from the probabilistic inference.28 Bergmann then argues that the nonpropositional evidence the naturalist has for R is also sufficiently strong to outweigh the counterevidence from the probabilistic inference to not-R based on the Probability Thesis. For, he claims, the evidence 25 Ibid., p. 71. 26 Ibid., p. 73. 27 Ibid., p. 73. 28 Ibid., p. 73. ? Springer</page><page sequence="19">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 143 against Z in the N&amp;E-case is "even weaker than it is in the straw-drawing case", given that "the naturalist isn't even given a good reason to believe that the probability mentioned in Y in the Plantingian N&amp;E-case is low",30 and the evidence for Z "is at least as strong as in the straw-drawing case."31 A comparison of the N&amp;E-case with the straw-drawing case, then, is claimed to yield the following result: the naturalist who accepts the Probability Thesis should merely conclude that something he rationally believes to be true (that is, R) has low or inscrutable probability on something else he believes to be true (that is, N&amp;E). 4.3.2 Discussion of the Nonpropositional Evidence Objection Bergmann states explicitly that the EAAN defeater is a rebutting defeater for R: for, he claims in a footnote, even if there is supposed to be an undercutting defeater for N, this only comes about by way of a rebutting defeater for belief in the reliability of the source of N, namely a rebutting defeater for R.32 Since Bergmann thinks of the Probability Thesis as being meant to give the naturalist a rebutting defeater for R, it is clear that his understanding of EAAN presupposes the probabilistic inference conception. For, as we have noted above in Sect. 3, it is very hard to see how the naturalist could have a rebutting defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis except by way of a probabilistic inference to the conclusion not-R, as made explicit in the probabilistic inference conception. Moreover, Bergmann's commitment to the probabilistic inference conception is apparent in his references to probabilistic inferences.33 4.3.3 Plantinga's response to the Nonpropositional Evidence Objection Plantinga agrees with Bergmann that the naturalist has nonpropositional evidence for R, but claims that this "does not deliver R from defeat for the reflective naturalist".34 Plantinga's argument for this can be expressed in the following three stages. First, Plantinga distinguishes between proper function rationality and alethic rationality.35 "Proper function rationality" is the kind of rationality that a person displays when her beliefs are produced by properly functioning cognitive faculties: this includes situations in which the cognitive faculties are not aimed at producing true beliefs, but are instead aimed at some other purpose, such as survival. "Alethic 29 Ibid., p. 75. 30 Ibid., p. 74. 31 Ibid., p. 75. 32 Ibid., p. 72-73. 33 Ibid., p. 73. There are many other interesting details and arguments in Bergmann's paper that we will have to pass over in the interests of space. 34 Alvin Plantinga, in "Reply to Beilby's Cohorts" in Naturalism Defeated? ed. Beilby, 2002b p. 230. 35 Ibid., p. 231. ? Springer</page><page sequence="20">144 O. Mirza rationality", on the other hand, is the kind of rationality that a person displays when her beliefs are produced by properly functioning cognitive faculties which are aimed at (that is, designed for) producing true beliefs. Second, Plantinga uses the notion of proper function rationality to explain why the naturalist continues to have an inclination to believe R, even after accepting the Probability Thesis; even though alethic rationality requires that the naturalist give up belief in R (so that if only truth-aimed processes were involved, the person would in fact give up belief in R), the design plan of the naturalist's cognitive faculties ensures that belief in R remains, since "disbelieving or doubting or withholding R would have disastrous consequences."36 Third, Plantinga uses his explanation of why the naturalist continues having an inclination to believe R to argue that such an inclination cannot function as nonpropositional evidence for the naturalist, once the latter has accepted the Probability Thesis. As he puts it, He believes that N and E are true, and that given that condition, the probability of R is low or inscrutable... True, he also has this strong impulse to continue to believe or assume R. But (as in the above case of the person who believes she's ingested XX) he can't take this as evidence for his reliability; no doubt he would have that inclination to believe R whether or not it is true.37 According to Plantinga then, once the naturalist accepts the Probability Thesis, whatever nonpropositional evidence the naturalist might have loses its probative value, given that it is the result of processes that have little or nothing to do with holding true beliefs. We can summarize Plantinga's response to Bergmann as follows: the nonpro positional evidence to which Bergmann appeals is itself subject to defeat by the conjunction of N&amp;E and the Probability Thesis. 4.3.4 Problems with Plantinga s response to the Nonpropositional Evidence Objection I wish to argue that Plantinga begs the question against Bergmann. To see why, note that a key aspect of Plantinga's response to Bergmann is the claim that the naturalist who continues to believe R even after accepting the Probability Thesis is only doing so because of cognitive processes which are not aimed at producing true beliefs. This claim implies that the only cognitive processes involved in sustaining belief in R for such a naturalist are those which are not truth-aimed. But since Plantinga would accept that under normal conditions belief in R is sustained by truth-aimed processes, this claim is a reasonable one for him to make only if he presupposes that the naturalist does in fact have a defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability 36 Ibid., p. 231. 37 Ibid., p. 232. ? Springer</page><page sequence="21">Evolutionary argument against naturalism 145 Thesis. This is exactly what Bergmann is at pains to deny. Hence, since Plantinga presupposes the very point at issue, he is begging the question. 4.3.5 A new response to the Nonpropositional Evidence Objection The Nonpropositional Evidence Objection to EAAN is very hard to fault if the EAAN defeater is construed as Bergmann does, that is, if it is thought to be a rebutting defeater. However, if we take seriously the idea that the EAAN defeater for R is an undercutting defeater, then Bergmann's objection loses its force. For in that case, there is no longer any reason to think that, if the naturalist's belief is defeated at all, it will be because he has evidence for the falsity of R. It is possible that rationality requires him to withhold belief in R simply because he has discovered certain characteristics of the process which produced human cognitive faculties, such as the fact that this process didn't "care" about producing reliable faculties, or because he realizes that there is a serious possibility that this process had such characteristics: this is, essentially, the process characteristic conception of the way in which the naturalist in EAAN acquires a defeater. The process characteristic conception allows us to see exactly how it is possible for the naturalist to acquire an undercutting defeater, rather than a rebutting defeater. On the process characteristic conception, the naturalist will have a defeater for R, a defeater that undercuts any nonpropositional evidence she may have for R. She will not, however, have this defeater by way of any evidence for not-R, and so the fact that she has nonpropositional evidence for R will not prevent her from having a defeater in the first place. 5 Conclusion Although I have rejected some prominent objections to the Defeater Thesis, it has not been my goal to advocate EAAN. Rather, as I emphasized in my introductory remarks, my goal has been to clear the ground for a more fruitful and adequate understanding of EAAN than that which has been presupposed by discussions of it so far. That more adequate understanding is made explicit in the process characteristic conception of EAAN, and I have been concerned to demonstrate the power of this conception to resolve outstanding issues concerning the argument.39 38 The reason is that if the naturalist has no alethic rationality defeater for R in virtue of accepting the Probability Thesis, his belief in R will continue to be alethically rational, which means that the cognitive processes involved in sustaining belief in R are truth-aimed. 39 One issue which could not be discussed here, due to space limitations, is The Conditionalization Problem. This is the problem of determining which of the naturalist's beliefs X are such that, if P(R/ N&amp;E&amp;X) is high, then the naturalist does not have a defeater for R in virtue of accepting that P(R/N&amp;E) is low or inscrutable. (One possibility for X is that it could be some piece of evidence from contemporary non-evolutionary psychology which supports R.) I am convinced that the ideas developed in this paper can be used to solve the Conditionalization Problem, and I intend to set out this solution in detail in a future article. For a detailed discussion of the Conditionalization Problem, see Alvin Plantinga, "Reply to Beilby's Cohorts" in Naturalism Defeated? ed. Beilby, pp. 220-225. ? Springer</page><page sequence="22">146 O. Mirza One useful result of the above discussion is that it yields an elegant argumentative strategy to refute EAAN, in the form of a dilemma. For one could argue, based on the discussion of this paper, that EAAN can be read either according to the probabilistic inference conception or according to the process characteristic conception; and then one could proceed to refute EAAN under each of these conceptions. The refutation of EAAN when read according to the probabilistic inference conception has already been given by the work of other philosophers; and it now remains to refute EAAN when read according to the process characteristic conception. In this way, the criticisms of previous philosophers can be incorporated into an overall argument to refute EAAN. This work remains to be done; and in the meantime, if I am right, the challenge of the evolutionary argument against naturalism is still very much with us.40 References Beilby, J. (Ed.). (2002).
