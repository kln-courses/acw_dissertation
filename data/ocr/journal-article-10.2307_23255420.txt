<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS Science Ponders Religion, edited by Harlow Shapley (New York: Appleton Century Crofts, 1960). Reviewed by Moses L. Isaacs After many years of dormancy, the subject of Science vs. Religion seems once again to have become popular. Among the pieces of evi dence is a movie on the famous Scopes trial of the Twenties, and, what is perhaps even more signifi cant, a re-publication of the monu mental History of the Warfare of Science with Theology, by Andrew D. White, a well-known practicing atheist of the last century. The book reviewed here, Science Pon ders Religion, edited by Harlow Shapley, is another straw in the wind, and undoubtedly is the fore runner of more to come. This book is a series of eighteen essays by members of a group of scientists who met on Star Island, off the New England coast, to do necessary creative pondering. The authors are, for the most part, past or present university professors in the fields of biology, physics, as tronomy, geology, and mathe matics. Except for one chapter which we shall mention later, religion, as readers of Tradition know it, does not fare very well. The first chapter called "Stars, Ethics and Survival" by Shapley might better have been titled, "Cutting Man Down to Proper Size." Equipped with ap parently nothing more than a sharp ened pencil and a pad of paper, he calculates that there must be in space, conservatively speaking, of course, at least ten billion planets which have the same conditions for life as our earth. With such a high probability, it is easy for him to jump to life on other planets as a certainty. All of this leads to the conclusion stated in the preface of the book: "The anthropomorphic one-planet Deity now has little appeal." All that Shapley needs to start the course of evolution, not only of animals and plants, but of matter it self, is hydrogen, plenty of it; and with time — plenty of it, too — he sees as inevitable all that we now have, even up to man with all of 143</page><page sequence="2">TRADITION: A Journal of Orthodox Thought his complexities. faith. Such a scientist can use a theory as well as any other scientist, and, as a matter of fact, can change it or discard it more easily than one to whom Science is a sort of reli gion. No such classification is given; so that I am afraid that if Professor Holton were to classify us we would be dumped into Group IV. Says he: With this start, we can see that man, in the phraseology of one of the authors, is not "a little lower than the angels, but just a little higher than the apes." Most of the authors are not saddened or de pressed by this conclusion. They think of a religion completely dom inated by science, which would be based on something like the follow ing reasoning: I, Man, am the high est product of Evolution and on the basis of noblesse oblige it behooves me to conduct myself in an ethical fashion. This ethical conduct turns out to be indistinguishable from the conduct taught by religion, but would come from an unemotional scientific consideration of the prob lem, with man's responsibility atop the evolutionary pile ever in mind. There are other suggestions for this new "religion" such as a "ritual" based on great works of music and art. Another point of view is also expressed: "some liberal denomina tions could save themselves by con forming wholeheartedly to science." The authors grant that science is constantly changing, but then reli gion should be flexible or agile enough to keep pace. In the fifth chapter, entitled "Notes on the Religious Orientation of Scientists," by Gerald Holton of Harvard, there is a classification of present-day scientists into six groups. This reviewer looked in vain for a group into which he could put himself and other Ortho dox Jewish scientists, namely among those who see science as dealing only with relative truth, and who therefore consider that science cannot be a yardstick of religious "A fourth group is also not large. It contains those who are devoted members of an explicitly funda mentalist sect or other religious group with doctrinal positions in matters which most scientists would regard as questions of scientific fact; yet they can attain in their scientific work complete autonomy. From the outside it is neither proper nor simple to explain this compartment alization of mind, and one is tempted to compare it with the con tradiction beween Sunday profes sion and weekly behavior of many a churchgoing businessman." "Us" poor hypocrites do not even excite his pity. Judging from the unanimity of the basic thinking of the writers, the Star Island conferences must have been love feasts from the start or perhaps there were power ful persuaders to bring about such homogenized uniformity of ap proach. Parenthetically, I should say, there were one or two chapters where the point of view was so ob scured by verbiage that I might be doing the authors an injustice by lumping them with others. In addi tion there are two chapters that are different enough to merit closer at tention. The first of these for us to con sider is called "Science, Faith, and Human Nature" by C. Judson Her 144</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews rick, a zoologist, an Emeritus of the University of Chicago. While not in disagreement with the notion that "viridical" knowledge takes prec edence over religious belief, he shows caution in defining the boundaries of science. He feels that "nature as envisioned by science may be only a small fraction of that which is." "Even if this possibility is recognized," he adds, "I grant that it remains true that the un knowable is none of the naturalist's business." He shows the important part that faith, not often recognized or admitted, plays in the working and thinking of science. All in all, Herrick, whose chapter is the last in the book, is a cautious as Shap ley, the author of the first chapter, is rashly dogmatic. The one chapter that runs de finitely counter to the trend of the book is called "Faith and the Teaching of Science" by E. C. Kemble, a physiologist of Harvard. From the old-fashioned religious standpoint this presentation is gen erally acceptable. This is fortunate, for it removes the suspicion that we are claiming that everybody is out of step but us. Referring to his teaching of elementary science to students, he says, "I make clear to them my own belief in the value of religious faith for those who can achieve it. In addition, it means that I make an effort to protect students from too easy an accept ance of the conclusion that belief in God is incompatible with the facts of modern science and that religious interpretation of life is no longer intellectually respectable." He then lists the familiar claims of the materialist: that impersonal laws govern biology, that mind is explicable wholly on the basis of nonliving forces, that God is needed neither as Creator nor as Maintain er of the universe, etc. In reference to these he says, "Many scientists believe or half believe these propo sitions. To me they stand as an un proved and dubious extrapolation of the legitimate conclusions of science." Further on he writes, "I remain skeptical of the possibility of explaining mind in terms of mat ter, or energy, or any purely phys ical conceptions. The faith of the materialistic biologist that he will ultimately succeed in understanding man as a physicochemical system, and nothing but a physicochem ical system, is understandable as a professional bias, but to me the case is not yet proved." The reviewer's job is not com plete until he gives an opinion as to the value of a book in one's library. The purchase of this book is not recommended. It does not say any thing that was not said over and over again in the Twenties when the controversy last raged. Even to the foot-loose scientist who might like to try some new faith, it gives no solid ground on which to stand. 145</page></plain_text>
