My first interest was the pottery of the Tapajo of Santarem and, after studying the col- lection at the University Mtuseum and that at the Mu- seum of the American Indian, Hleye Foundation, I went to Sweden for further research at the Ethnographical NMuseum of Goteborg, where there is an outstanding Tapajo collection. In 1939 I published a study based upon the American and Swedish material. 1 During this initial research I noticed the similarity between Tapajo pottery and that of the Southern Mounds of the United States. In an effort to find some reasonable connecting links between the two areas I went to Mexico, British Guiana, and several islands of the Caribbean, hoping to obtain in unpublished collections some solution to the problem. The results were, however, not very satisfactory, so I was forced to publish such facts as I had. In 1939 I went to Rio de Janeiro and saw part of the Marajo collection in the Museu Nacional, but did not examine it. Upon return I began study of the large collection that Dr. W. C. Farabee had brought to the 1 Palmatary, Tapaj6o Pottery. Ulniversity 'useum as a result of his excavations in Amazonia between 1913 and 1916. When work on this had been concluded, I obtained a grant from the Amer- ican Philosophical Society to go to Bele'm, Brazil, to study the Marajo collection in the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi and the private collection of the late Dr. Carlos Estevio de Oliveira, who was its director at that time. I was much surprised to discover that these two Brazilian collections contained several wares which did not appear in the collection at the tiniversity Nluseum; I therefore realized that a study of any adequacy would have to be based, not upon these three collections only, but upon all available ones. In order to continue this research I obtained another grant from the American Philosophical Society, which was to finance the study of Marajo collections in other American museums, and to search for correlating material in unpublished Southern mound collections. This latter proj ect was necessary, since it soon became evident that the resemblance of Marajo pottery to that of the Southern NMounds was quite as striking as had been that of the Tapajo, but that the correla- ting elements involved were different for the two Arnazonian areas.</page><page sequence="2">0.

This study is therefore based upon examination of Marajo material in the following museums: the Univer- sity Museum, Philadelphia; the Arnerican Mluseum of Natural Hlistory and the Mluseum of the American In- dian, Heye Foundation, New York; the Brooklyn Mu- seum; the Peabody Miuseum of Archaeology and Eth- nology, Harvard University; thle United States National Museum, Washington; the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem; and the private collection of the late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira. Photographs of impor- tant Maraj(i pieces were obtained from the Mluseu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro; the Mordini Collection in Barga, Italy, and the Mluseo Etnografico Luigi Pigorini, Rome. Unpublished Mound collections were studied at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, and the Ala- bama NMuseum of Natural History, Tuscaloosa; the private collection of Mrs. HIenry H. Simpson of High Springs, Florida, was also examined. Thus over a period of several years during which the research for this study has been in progress, I have become indebted to institutions and individuals not only in the United States but in Brazil and Italy as well. Primarily I am indebted to the American Philo- sophical Society which financed my research and to the University Museum whose Marajo6 collection sup- plied the first incentive to intensive research in this phase of Amazonian archeology, and where much of the manuscript was prepared. In Brazil I wish to express my appreciation to Dr. Oswaldo Aranha through whose interest transportation was supplied for me and my party between Belem and Marajo Island and up the Rio Arari into the heart of the archeological area. I am also indebted to Coman- dante Antonio Rogerio Coimbra and Dr. Inocencio Bentes for arranging the details of transportation. I wish to express appreciation for the kindness of the late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira, formerly Director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, for the privilege of studying the Marajo collection at that museum as well as his private collection; he and his family were also of great assistance on the Marajo expedition. I am greatly indebted to the late Comandante Braz Dias de Aguiar of the Comissao Brasileira Demar- cadora de Limites, Primeira Divisao, for many cour- tesies but in particular for the general map which accompanies this study and which was prepared especially for it under his direction. To Dr. Inocencio Bentes for much work involved in collecting infor- mation for the site map, and to my friend and inter- peter, D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita for redrawing it for publication, I am most grateful. I am indebted also to D. Heloisa Alberto Torres, Director of the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, for photographs of important specimens in that museum, and to Sr. Bertino Miranda and Dr. Frederico Barata for geographical information. To D. Josefina Miranda for the hospitality of Tuyuyut on the Rio Arari, and to Sr. and Snra. Lauro Lobato for the cordiality of Nossa Senhora de Loretta, also on the Rio Arari, I wish to express deep appreciation. To Dr. Antonio Mordini of Barga, Italy, I am greatly indebted for both geographical and archeological in- formation concerning Maraj6, and for the privilege of publishing his field notes on his excavations at Panellas and Teso dos Gentios. He also very kindly obtained for me photographs of the Marajo collection in the Museo Etnografico Luigi Pigorini in Rome and permission for their publication. In the United States, Marajo research, as well as study of the archeology of correlating areas, has in- volved work in several museums and libraries; there- fore the list of those who have generously given of their time to assist me is a long one. In particular, I wish to express my appreciation to Mr. Donald Scott, formerly Director of Peabody Museum, Harvard Univer- sity, for permission to study the Marajo collection at that museum; to NMr. Junius Bird for much help with the Marajo collection at the American Museum of Natural History; to Mr. E. K. Burnett for permission to study the Marajo, Tapajo, and Antillean collections of the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation; to Dr. Herbert J. Spinden for photographs of the Marajo collection of the Brooklyn Museum; to Mr. Neil MJ. Judd and Mr. Frank M. Setzler for photographs of the Maraj6o collection in the United States National NMu- seum (Mr. Setzler also looked over part of the manu- script); to Mr. David L. De Jarnette for his assistance in the study of the Mound collection at the Alabama Museum of Natural History, and for photographs from that collection; to Dr. S. C. Dellinger of the Univer- sity of Arkansas Museum for permission to study the Lower Mississippi Valley collections in that museum; and to Mrs. Henry H. Simpson for permission to study her collection from the mounds of northwestern Florida at her home in High Springs, Florida. Dr. Matthew W. Stirling of the Smithsonian Institution and Dr. Linton Satterthwaite of the University Museum, very kindly looked over a considerable part of the manuscript and offered helpful suggestions; and I am deeply indebted to Dr. Manoel Cardozo of the Lima Library, Catholic University of America, for his generous assistance during several weeks of research on the historical and geographical aspects of my problem. I wish especially to express my appreciation for the interest and counsel of Dr. J. Alden Mason of the University Museum who has given generously of his time to the critical reading of the nmanuscript, and offered many valuable suggestions concerning both the content and the form of this study.</page><page sequence="4">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE ISLAND 263 THE ISLAND NOTES ON GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE Ilha de Mlarajo, as the Brazilians call it, has been described as resting in the mouth of the Amazon like an egg in that of a serpent. 2 This is an interesting simile, and a glance at the map makes apparent its suggestiveness; geographically speaking, however, it is not quite in accordance with fact. The Amazon flows to the northw,est and north of Mfarajo; its two mouths, the Canal do Norte and the Canal do Sul, are separated by the large islands of Caviana and Mlexiana, N4arajo's northern neighbors. The Equator cuts through both of these islands, and between them flows the Canal Perigoso. To the north- east Marajo borders on the Atlantic. To the south- east are the Rio Para and the Baia de Marajo. To the south are the Rio Para and the broad mouth of the Tocantins, through which that river pours its huge volume from the mainland to merge with the Para'.3 On the west, Marajo is separated from the continent by an intricate system of deep and comparatively narrow channels known as the Furos de Breves; these Furos are important highways since they are the connecting links between the Para and the Amazon. Ships bound for Amazonian ports do not at once en- ter the Amazon - its mouths are clogged with numerous islands; swift currents and shifting sand-bars make navigation dangerous even for small craft. Instead, vessels enter the Para and attain Amazonian waters northwest of Marajo by means of the Furos de Breves.4 While the waters to the south of the island are readily navigable, they cannot be classified as peace- ful; crossing from Belem on the southern mainland to Marajo in a small launch or barco (local type of sail boat) is not infrequently attended with upset. Early writers on the area refer to the rough waters traversed by the Indians and to shipwreck among the Europeans. Marajo is a large island, 47,964 square kilometers in area,5 or about twice.the size of the state of New Hampshire. It is extraordinarily flat. Seen from the air in early July its eastern section looks like a dark, muddy swamp crisscrossed by innumerable rivers and 6 igarapes, and dotted over with small wooded areas known as "tree islands." Its jungle land in the west is also cut up by multitudinous waterways. Farabee, who traveled over most of the island in search of archeological sites, estimated that it had no natural 2Farabee, 1921: 142. 3Note: There is a considerable literature on the com- plicated hydrography of the area around Maraj6, and some maps show the Baia de Marajo to the southeast of the island, and the Rio Para' to the south only. 4 Smith, 1880: 15. 6 Le Cointe, 1945: 41. 6A Tupi word meaning "boat-way," Sampaio, 1928:222. elevation more than twenty feet above the sea level; 7 Cott, who went there to study wild life, increased this figure to twenty-five.8 In reality, Marajo is part of an archipelago. In the opinion of Dr. Delgado de Carvalho, the island as it is today cannot be regarded as an entity which has al- ways existed, but rather as a body of land which has been built up by the combining of islands, a fact which accounts for its diversity; also, that within a certain time, as the Furos de Breves fill up, M1araIjo will become an internal peninsula. 9 In spite of its general flatness, the island may be divided into two distinct and almost equal natural areas. These sections may be roughly defined by a line running diagonally from the mouth of the Cajuuna on the northwest coast to the mouth of the Atua on the southeast. The resulting southwestern division, which is slightly the smaller of the two, is covered with rubber trees and other jungle growth; the northeastern 7Farabee, 1921: 142. 8Cott, 1938: 638. 9Delgado de Carvalho, 0 De Ita.

A visao de Herbert Smith, relatada por Euclides, tinha fundamento cientifico. Muitos cientistas brasileiros e estrangeiros supuseram que a costa do Brasil, depois de levantada no cretaiceo e principio do terciairio, passou a afundar e desabar no Oceano. Na foz do Amazonas, o fenomeno se aplicava a costa paraense. Os estudos geologicos e paleontologicos rnais recentes alteraram um tanto a interpretacao. Camadas cretaiceas inferiores, com fosseis tipicos, afloram desde o sul da Baia, pelo Ceara e pelo Maranhao, ate o Para, onde ocorrem calcaireos fossiliferos ate 40 metros de altura acima do nivel m6dio da baia de Guajara. Sobre esta formaco repousan, ern cncordancia, dep'sitos fluviais quaternarios, o que vem provar que, depois de levantadas, estas camadas nunca desceram, embora desa- bamentos locais possam se ter dado sob a acao de agentes externos. Mas o estudo da formaqao de ilhas revela outro processo em andamento: dep6sitos de sedimentos, entulhamento de canais, terras caidas acumuladas, invasao da vegetac,ao. Nos proprios tempos historicos, as alterac,oes obrigat6rias de linhas de navegacao traduzem a rapidez relativa do processo. De outro modo nao procede o Amazonas ao construir o seu delta.

SOC. area is open campo 10 country, today famous for its huge cattle fazendas. 11 Marajo's coasts differ in conformity with the waters which bathe them. To the west and the north is the Amazon. The west coast is low, clayey and muddy; the north coast, bathed by the "general winds ,,12 is also low and is marked by occasional broad expanses of reddish sand held together by clay over which the waves of the Amazon roll and break. The eastern and southern coasts, on the contrary, are quite different. These are characterized by beachi- es of white sand and the frequent appearance of coarse, ferruginous sandstone; especially is this true of the southern coast which faces the mouth of the Tocantins. That which, however, more- than any other element, contrasts the eastern coastal area with those of the north and west, is a strip of rock-based high land along the Atlantic extremity. This longitudinal section, nowhere nmore than three miles in breadth, is much higher at certain places than the general level of the island, but at no place does it attain an alti- tude which would classify any part of it as a hill. 13 In addition to the two main divisions of the island previously discussed, there is another type of terrain more or less common to both of them. All parts of the island, except the eastern coast which is a bit higher than other areas, are characterized by swampy de- pressions, sometimes fairly extensive. In the wooded section these are known as "igapos;" in the campo country they are called "baixas. , 14 When the "baixas" occupy large areas and are hid- den beneath a thick growth of swamp vegetation, they are known locally as "mondongos" (pl. 2-a). However, this name is especially applied to a stretch of swamp- land which, ten or twelve miles from the north coast, extends from the mouth of the Rio Cururu, in the west, almost to the Atlantic Ocean. This area contains formidable swamps, small lakes, various types of is- lands, and above all, "infinitas plantas palustras," principally Aningas (Caladium arborescens), among umas ilhotas, vizinhas do continente, que favoreceram a deposicao, o golfao era livre e recebeu aluvioes quandc o vale amazonico deixou de ser um bra o de mar ou um alongado lago de aiguas salobras. No fim do terciario, o golfo estava diminuindo: os fosseis denominados "fauna de Pebas," encontrados nas argilas do Solim5es, sao de pe- quenos invertebrados de aigua salobra. 0 fundo do golfo ainda era de aigua salgada. No quaternairio porem, o Ama- zonas passou a construir seu delta, nao mais interno, mas externo, na direca~o da Caviana. Marajo nos aparece, assim, nao como uma ilha preex- istente, mas como o resultado da reuniao de vairias ilhas, dai a sua diversidade.

Its summertime, or dry season, begins in September and lasts until nearly the end of the year. During this period the vegetation turns yellow and dries up; the clayey soil, deprived of its water by the intense heat of the equatorial sun, breaks into irregularities marked by more or less deep depres- sions. What little fresh vegetation remains is found in the "baixas" to which, in modern times, the cattle resort for pasture, while numerous flocks of river birds circle around the small waterholes searching for fish which have taken refuge there. During this period the "tree islands" seem to assume unusual forms; sometimes they look like a forest; sometimes, stand- ing alone and seen from a great distance, they appear to be fortifications; and, on some fazendas, 16 their total absence on one or two sides of the horizon gives to the campos the aspect of a tranquil sea. 17 Then, toward the end of December, the rains come. "It is easy to understand," remarks Penna, that on so vast and flat a surface as Marajo, dotted over with depressions or "baixas" and with a level little above that of the two great rivers which bathe it, the rainfall, not finding immediate outiets, must necessarily produce more or less general flooding throughout the island. Ihe first rains, which ordinarily commence in December, hardly moisten the ground and close the cracks in the soil. Those of January and February cover all the "baixas," and, as the winter progresses, the rivers rise above their banks and overflow the campos. With the torrential rains of March and April, nothing renmains above the water except bits of land higher than normal called "tesos"; these are found on some fazendas, on the eastern coast and in various points in the north and south of the island. 18 Thus in the season of floods the campos disappear and the Island is transformed into a vast lake where groups of trees protrude above the water and become islands in reality. Canoes with sails affixed or paddled in the usual way, and even medium-sized launches pass over the vast expanses where a short time previously the vaqueiros 19 had galloped. Sometimes, in places where the water is less deep one sees an ox plodding along with a montaria2 at- tached to his tail; the owner, sometimes alone and some- times accompanied b! his wife and children, rides at ease and guides his beast.... In this season of general inundation, it is not easy to distinguish the course of a river except by the line of trees which ordinarily border its banks. The river birds abandon these places and emigrate to the Amazon or more remote places where food will be less difficult to find. Swarms of importunate insects, fleeing the flooded campos, invade the houses in the center of the island and, to make greater the misery, fevers, both intermittent and much more serious, develop.... Such is the aspect of the island in winter. 22 '5Ibid.) 40. 16Catte ranches. 17Penna, 1900: 79. 18Ibid., 80. 19 Cowboys. 20 Sma11 canoe. 21 Penna, 1900: 80. 22Ibid., 81.</page><page sequence="6">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 265 The winter rains continue into June, gradually de- creasing in volume as the season nears its end. During July and August it rains a little every day or two, and thus on to summer again. To one interested in Marajo' before the advent of the European, a complication to transportation in the wet season is suggested by the thick, coarse grass which grows through the water, often to considerable height above its surface. Thus, although the island may be flooded, parts of it look like vast meadows. As Penna has stated, in places where the water is not too deep, canoes are tied to the tails of oxen which plough through both grass and water, and the transportation problem is accordingly solved. When Farabee was on Marajo', he did his digging in the dry season and, because there were no roads on the is- land, waited until the advanced rainy season to get the material out. He says: By the middle of May there was sufficient water to float a canoe all over the interior of the island of Marajo. We hired a sailboat with an eighty-foot mast, loaded her with empty packing cases of various sizes, many of them three feet square to accomodate the large burial urns; and went to see what had happened to our collections.... During the wet season, the grass grows rapidly and covers the water so that one often finds himself sailing through a great meadow with no water in sight in any direction, although it is six or eight feet deep under his boat. Although our boat was of shallow draught, we were unable to cross the low divide between the Arary and the Camutins where our collections were stored and we had to secure oxen to haul our canoe back and forth from the camp to the boat. One naturally asks why we did not paddle our canoe. The answer to this question at the same time answers the more perplexing one of why the oxen are hitched by their tails. As the grass grows in the warm weather, it mats together so closely that it is next to im- possible to push a canoe through it and it becomes neces- sary to haul it with an ox; but why not use two oxen and a yoke? The ox is broken to ride because he is much safer than a horse in swampy lands. His feet spread out as they go down in the bog and fold up as they are pulled out. There- fore, he never sticks fast and falls down. He is ungainly and impossible on the gallop but is usually a better walker than a horse. He is badly affected by the direct heat of the sun, so we often rode across the savannahs in the moon- light. He has remarkable ability in following the way with which he is acquainted in the dry season but which now is covered with three or four feet of water.... The yoke is not used because the boy wants to ride and because a single ox breaks a path in the long grass through which the canoe is pulled with little effort.... We left our sailboat standing in the deep grass, loaded our large canoe with empty packing cases, threw a clove hitch over the tails of our oxen and crossed the divide to our old camp on the Camutins, a long day's journey away. I remained behind to pack while the boys returned to the boat for another load of boxes. And so on; a trip a day, loaded one way and empty the other, until all the collection was packed, transported, and stored aboard our sailing boat. The question at once presents itself, "How did the pre-Columbian inhabitant of Maraj6 manage the trans- portatsion problem during the wet season in an era when, in America, there were no oxen and presumably 23 Farabee, 1921: 157 et seq. no sails?" If, as Farabee states, the paddle could not be used in this mass of grass and water, it must have been necessary to resort to the pole for impelling canoes over long distances. This problem was suggested to Dr. Inocencio Bentes, Director of the Comissao de Estudos e Obras na Ilha de Mlarajo e Portos do Para. He replied that anciently the Indians on the island used small craft known as "igarites" made of the trunks of trees with the aid of the stone axe and fire. He then contributed the following interesting bit of Marajo transportation history which he illustrated (fig. 1). His statement is as follows: During the rainy season from December to June, vegeta- tion develops considerably, impeding free navigation by hand with paddles. Under this condition poles three or four meters long are used to impel canoes.... When canoes are able to travel freely on the rivers and over the inundated campos, the Marajoans use a sail of cloth. Anciently, the Indians used splints from palm trees or rushes, or improvised a sail from the broad leaves of certain palms such as the buritizeiro, the inajazeiro and many others. Sails thus improvised are a considerable aid to navigation when there is a wind. The foregoing statement suggests the problem of the probable antiquity in Amazonia of these sails of splints and leaves. Hurley describes the native wel- come to the first governor of Para as follows:24 From his ship Caldeira de Castello Branco gazed in wonder at the beauty of the panorama of savagery before him. The shore of Parauassui red with Tupinamba's painted with uruc'u; the harbor full of uba's and igarites. The bay cut by canoes with sails of miriti proceeding from the is- lands. Many people. A sea in motion. Life.25 This was in January of 1616. In this connection, Cott26 shows a small craft wafted over a Marajo stream, a fully-leafed tree-branch serving as a sail. Such means of locomotion is not confined to Maraj6o but is used in other localities, notably on the Tocantins.27 It would seem that the use of a tree branch as an implement of propulsion might have been a very early adaptation of a bit of European culture, possibly a forerunner of such sails as may have developed in Lower Amazonia by 1616. European sails first appeared along the Brazilian coast in 1500.28 To the visitor interested in its ancient civilization, Marajo of today suggests another problem, that of the navigability of its rivers in pre-Columbian times. Many of the more important rivers on the island are, at present, so obstructed with vegetation as to be entirely unnavigable. I asked Dr. Bentes if, in his opinion, the rivers were thus obstructed several hun- dred years ago. His reply was generally in the nega- tive; he said: 29 24 Hurley, 1940: 17. 25 Hurley does not give source. 26 Cott, 1938: 642.

Paddle used in Para Fig. 1 Some rivers which are in constant use, such as the Arari, the Anaja's-Mirirn, the Anabijui and others, have improved in navigability from year to year; others, how- ever, which have been obstructed by vegetation for a long time (a hundred years or more), as the Genipapocui, the Tartarugas, the Apei, the Goiapi, the Cambu', and others, have grown worse from day to day. Hiowever, with the pre- sent service for clearing out the beds which this Comrnis- sion performs by order of the Federal Government, these rivers tend to improve, and when all the projects are com- pleted navigation should be completely re-established. It is necessary to make clear, however, that the princi- pal cause of these obstructions, without being the only one, was the barragens which the proprietors of the lands adjacent to these rivers used to construct for the purpose of retaining the water of the rainy seasorn during the sum- mer (the period without rains). These barragens, called also aterros, were built transverse to the rivers. When the rains came they were not opened, as they should have been, and the result was the sedimentation of the beds. At first the vegetation was low and creeping, later coarse growths such as aningais, seriubais, tobocais, developed; finally caine the palms of which the principal one is the majestic miritiseiro, ten or more meters in height. It is easy to see that once these obstructions are rernoved and the river beds cleaned out, natural navigation will be pos- sible again. Since 187230 (a year in which the winter flooding on Nlarajo was particularly severe) a series of investi- gations have been instituted with reference to the causes of river obstruction and other physical condi- tions which interfere with the normal drainage of the island. From these reports it seems possible to con- ceive that, at the time the rmounds were built, drain- age on the island might have been rnore natural and the seasonal flooding less serious than in more recent times. This phase of Mlarajo's prehistory merits in- tensive research since it might help to explain how the island supported what must have been a fairly numercus population, and to make more plausible the development there of a great cerarric industry. The homeland of the ancient Marajoans can hardly be appreciated without some reference to its fauna, keeping in mind that its pottery-making civilizations developed in the age of the stone axe and the bow and arrow. Among the most important animals, not because of the numbers of species but because of the multitude of individuals in each, are the monkeys. These choose for their habitats the trees along the river banks, the so-called "tree islands" previously referred to, and the wooded stretches along the coasts. Here live the black llycetes Belzebul with red hands. The family group of these monkeys consists of from ten to twenty members dominated by an old male whose supremacy is sustained by physical force and the size and en- ergy of his canines. These monkeys remain on the island the year round, adjusting themselves to an existence partially amphibious for, during the winter months, their tree-homes become practically lacus- trian. Goeldi mentions also the curious but always timorous little Saimiris sciurea, whose gymnastics 30 See Gomes d' Oliveira and Teixeira.</page><page sequence="8">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 267 among the bamboos and the palm trees reach the fantastic. 31 Then there are bats. Scarcely has the sun disap- peared from over the seemingly limitless grasslands when bats, large and small, infinite in number, of "todas especies," begin their food-searching sonier- saults over rivers, fazendas, wooded spots. 32 There is also a large rodent, Ilydrochoerus capy- bara, called locally the "capivara," from two Indian words meaning "master of the grass." In the dull light of the early morning, along the rivers in the northeastern part of the island, one can see herds of from fifty to a hundred of these animals moving over the grassy areas which interrupt the woodland along the banks. Alarmed, the capivara rushes for water, making a barking or yelping sound. Quite naturally, the weapon of these great rodents is their teeth which cut like razor blades, causing serious injuries. Goeldi states their hide is of a reddish hue and their flesh tastes and smnells of fish. Their principal enemy is the jaguar.33 Actually, the capivara is the largest of living rodents, an average specimen measuring four feet six inches in length. In appearance they have been described as suggesting giant guinea pigs. The "tamandua" or arboreal anteater, Myrmecophaga jubata, is conspicuous on Mlarajod. The tamandua', like other anteaters, has a tapering snout and a long, wornm-like tongue, which is protrusible and sticky, an admirable organ for licking up the ants on which it lives. But, unlike the great anteater, or "ant bear," which is terrestrial and has a large bushy tail, the tamandua spends its life in trees, and in adaptation to this habitat the long muscular tail is prehensile. Aniteaters' feet are armed withi remarkably strong claws, which are used in tearing open the ant galleries and also, in the arboreal species, for ripping up bark to bring to light lurking insects. They are also serviceable as weap- ons of defense, for with one stroke they have been known to eviscerate a dog. Moreover, the coat is thick, the skin tough, and the limbs powerful, so that he is a formidable creature to attack, even though he has no teeth to bite with. 35 Among the carnivora the jaguar, Felix onqa, or c onqa" as the Brazilians call him, is the most irim- portant. These beautiful big cats, the largest feline after the Old World lion and tiger, are numerous on Mlarajo, but, since they do most of their prowling at night, they are not generally in evidence. They are difficult to hunt for they are equally at home on land and in water. In modern times they have been a great menace to the cattle industry.36 Bernardino de Souza states that they kill the crocodile easily and cruelly.37 Of the large number of reptilian forms found on Marajo6, the most important is the crocodile or "ja- care as he is known in Amazonia. Two species a- 31 Goeldi, 1902: 372 et seq. 32 Ibid., 374. 33Ibid., 378 et seq. 34 Cott, 1938: 662. See also von Ihering, 1934: 29. 351bid., 664. 36 Goeldi, 1900: 375 et seq. 37Souza, Bernardino de, 1874: 21. bound - the smaller is the "jacare-tinga," or "blonde" (Caiman sclerops), which measures a meter and a half in length; the other is the "jacare-acili," or ''large" (Caiman niger), which sometimes attains a length of four meters. These animals frequent quiet inlets along the rivers, small ponds, the mondongos or swampy areas previously referred to, and the larger lakes. They pre- fer streams with a slow current and avoid swift- moving water. Rio Arari, Lago Arari, the rivers which flow into the Atlantic, and the swanmps in the interior of the Island, are the natural abodes of these animals. When, in mid-summer, the surface of Lago Arari reaches its lowest level, jacares encrusted with dry- ing mud lie on the banks in enorrnous numbers. Here they rernain, one upon the other, piled ur in layers like logs of wood meters high, seemingly paralyzed by the exhausting heat of the dry season, and are liberated from their lethargy only by the beginning of the winter rains. During the breeding season, which takes place in summer, both species are equally fierce and agres- sive, but throughout the remainder of the year the smaller one is the more ill-disposed, the larger being rather phl.egmatic and, to a certain extent, even cowardly *38 The jacare is not easy to kill. Bernardino de Souza states that its thick, scaly hide cannot be pierced by the ball of the ordinary "espinarga" (rifle) and that its vulnerable points are the eye, the ear, and the belly. 39 Goeldi describes a jacare hunt in which the animals were driven near the edge of the water, and then skilled vaqueiros jumped on the shoulders of the beasts and broke the bones in the occipital region with an axe (machada).40 Farabee saw a hunt in which the animals were chased ashore, then the open jaws lassoed from two sides, while a third vaqueiro struck across the back of the neck with a machete, cutting the spinal cord.4' In all probability the ancient NMarajoan solved the problem of the jacare by aiming directly at his eye with his poisoned arrows. Then there are the lizards. Of particular importance is the "camaleao,"lguana tuberculata,whose principal habitat is the northeastern part of Marajo, especially Cabo Magoary, the Atlantic coast and adjacent is- lands. This animal customarily attains a length of one and three-quarters meters. Iguanas are entirely vegeta- rian and, due to their incredible numbers, have some- times reduced certain areas of the island to almost a desert. The camaleao is an excellent swimmer and diver, is strong and not easily killed. Both the flesh and the eggs of these lizards make appetizing food. Not to be disregarded are the "tartarugas" or great 38Goeldi, 1900: 392 et seq. 39Souza, Bernardino de, 1874: 21. 40 Goeldi, 1900: 394. 41 Farabee, 1921: 142 et seq.</page><page sequence="9">268 PALM4ATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL, SOC. marine turtles, Cuhelone mydas, which each year lay their eggs on the sandy stretches along the Atlantic coast; also the water snakes, Eunectes murinus, which invade riverside ranches, making away with poultry and attacking pigs, dogs, and even calves.42 The bird life of Marajo could not be adequately discussed except by a naturalist. Goeldi names a long list of feathered folk varying from very small birds to others of considerable size. Some are of sombre hue, some white, some brilliantly colored. 43 As for myself the unforgettable memory of Marajo is the scarlet ibises and graceful white gargas which rose languidly from the dark foliage on one bank of the Arari', and with a few flaps of the wings, crossed that narrow stream to disappear in the tree-tops of the opposite bank. Every wooded spot seemed to vibrate with bird music, most of it soft and gentle, but oc- casionally a harsh squawk or a shrill scream or a particularly beautiful solo rose above the general chorus. Fish are plentiful in the rivers of MarajoI, so pre- sumably the ancient islanders were well supplied with that particular article of food. Goeldi does not dis- cuss the edible species but refers especially to that enemy of man and beast alike, the piranha, Serrasalmo piraya. This small, triangular-toothed, blood-thirsty fish, though not limiting its habitat to the Ilha de Marajo, is the scourge of its waters. Any unfortunate, with even a slight trace of fresh blood on the surface of his body, who falls into one of the island's in- numerable waterways - be he man, horse, steer, or powerful jacare - is immediately attacked. First, only a few piranhas appear, then, as the blood begins to flow freely, hundreds join the assault. At the end of a few minutes all that remains of the victim is his larger bones, all flesh4 cartilages and smaller bones having been devoured. It is necessary to consider the wild life of Marajo because some knowledge of it helps to fill in the pic- ture of the physical background against which these ancient civilizations developed - its food supply, its hazards, its beauties. From the standpoint of the archeologist this information also suggests some clue to the thinking of these peoples, since their potters utilized so little of the native fauna in the creation of their modeled and painted designs. Among the Tapajo, who lived where Santarem is now situated, all sorts of Amazonian fauna were used as decorative subjects and often quite realistically; the cuti'a, Dasyprocta croconota, a little rodent found also on Mara jo, was prominent in modeled form, the toucan and other birds were commonly represented, as was also the tartaruga, the onca, the monkey and the jacare. Among the Marajo designs there frequently 42 Goeldi, 1900: 395 et seq. 43Ibid., 382 et seq. 44 Ibid., 397. appear small and highly stylized zoomorphic heads, but actually, the only animal except the human being, which these ancients featured to any considerable extent was the jacare. No doubt they feared this ugly creature, plentiful, ferocious and difficult to kill; perhaps to placate him they worshipped him. Certainly the peculiar geometric intricacy of much of their art appears to have been developed in tribute to him. Marajo' is separated from the mainland, both north and south, by waters which are hazardous even to sturdy small craft of today; this condition may have served to isolate and protect its peoples to a certain degree and to have contributed somewhat to the inten- siveness of their development. However considering the geology of the island, its climate, its insect and wild life, its probable lack, in ancient times, of an adequate supply of edible plants, it seems rather remarkable that a great ceramic-producing civilization should have developed there. HISTORICAL NOTES Clear records concerning the natives of Marajo Island are late of date and not very numerous. The city of Belem on the mainland just south of the island was not founded until early in 1616 when the Portu- guese, having routed the French out of S. Luiz do Maranhao, followed up the coast into the Rio Para' to dislodge the Dutch and the English from establish- ments which might lead to the control of the great highway to the west - the Rio Amazonas.45 Nlissionaries appeared early on the scene at the new settlement. First came a small group of Francis- cans who arrived from Portugal in 1617; the Carmel- ites came in 1625, the Mercenarios in 1639.46 The Jesuit, Luiz Figueira, arrived in 1635 but, realizing the extensiveness of the missionary possibilities in Amazonia, went back to Portugal to attempt to in- terest other Jesuits in the field. In 1643 Figueira returned to Brazil bringing with him fourteen missionaries. All went well with the little ship which carried them until it reached the Baia do Sol, not far from Belem; here it was wrecked in the shallows. Three of the missionaries and sev- eral other passengers made their way to the mainland in boats, but Figueira and the eleven remaining missionaries took refuge on a raft contrived out of the ship's wreckage and were carried by the wind and current to Marajo Island, then called the Ilha de Joanes. Here they were killed and eaten by the Aruans, one of the several tribes there.47 Thus in 1643 the tribes on Marajo came conspic- uously to the forefront in the annals of the Colony. Ten years later, in 1653, Antonio Vieira the Jesuit 46 Vianna, 1900: 214 et seq. 47 Ribeiro, 1922: 223. 4 Lucio de Azevedo, 1930: 48.</page><page sequence="10">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 269 who was to win the confidence and friendship of the Marajo tribes, arrived in Amazonia. Somie of his let- ters are of importance as they refer to the nmarauding expeditions of these Indians into the white settle- ments and those of other Indians, and, in retaliation, the efforts of the Portuguese to capture and enslave them by organized nmilitary force. he gives also a quite detailed account of his conclusion of peace with these tribes and the ceremony in which they pledged their loyalty to the Portuguese Crown. In these des- criptions he mentions several culture traits: they lived in Dalm houses; their musical instruments were drums and horns; on ceremonial occasions they be- decked their canoes with feathers; shouting in unison was their method of expressing great happiness. 48 But he makes no mention of pottery. In a letter to the Padre Provincial of Brazil, written in 1654, Vieira recounts information given him by a Po)rtuguese soldier who claimed to have been on Marajo' shiortly after the death of Luiz Figueira and his companions. According to this soldier, prisoners destined for cannibalistic feasts were brought one by one on different days to a large open space in the center of which a post had been erected. To this the victim was fastened. The ceremony consisted in sing- ing, shouting and dancing around the prisoner, each Indian clutching his killing stick. These sticks are described as strong, broad on the end and carefully fashioned. When the frenzy reached its highest pitch, the Nlarajoans let fly their clubs at the head of the victim. He was always struck on the head first. After being killed, his body was roasted and eaten. This Portuguese soldier stated that it was neces- sary for a Marajoan to crush an enemy's head at a specified place of execution, otherwise he was un- able to "take or have a nanme." The nobler the enemy captured and killed, the greater the credit to the war- rior. Even crushing the head of a woman of a hostile tribe conferred the right to assume a name. Because of this need for a name, the story con- tinues, Marajoans sometimes made long journeys, and at night entered the burial places of their enemies and disinterred a corpse. This they carried off vic- toriously to the place of execution in their own vil- lage and, with the same ferocity and the same festivity indulged in with a live victim, they crushed the head of the cadaver. By this method, also, a name could be procured.49 Another Jesuit, Joao Felippe Betendorf, who ar- rived in Amazonia a few years later than Vieira, states that the most important weapon used by these Indians was the poisoned arrow, that only a slight wound would cause death, and that the poison was always brewed by a prisoner of war who died two 48 Vieira, Carta LXXXVI, ao Rei D. Afonso VI, 28 de novembro de 1659. 49Ibid., Carta LXVI, 1654. days later from the effect of the fuimes. 50 Neither does Betendorf mention Dottery-rmaking as one of their culture traits. The question arises as to just wlho were these Indians concerning whoni Vieira andI Betendorf left records. Vieira states that there were twenty-nine tribes on the island speaking languages as different as Spanish and Germnan. 5I Ile lists the following: Aruans, Anajals, Manpuas, Paucacas, Gualara's, Pixi- pixix "and others."52 Betendorf said that there were seven tribes on the island, that they all spoke dif- ferent languages, that they could not understand one another, and that they frequently warrecl amnong tlhem- selves. To Vieira's list he adds the hoccas, the Paizxs, the ,lawraianazes, and the Sacacas or Joanes frormi wlhom the island took its original name - lh/ia Gran(le ae Joanes. 53 The na me was changed from Joanes or juanes to Mfarajo6 about twenity years after thie settlement of belel6m when the Portuguese began to attempt establishments along the banks of the Rio Niarajo-assui. Penna adds three otiher names - iMliocobes *lluanas, and the Jururmas. 54 The Aritans are usually referred to as Arawak; to which linguistic group or groups the others belonged is a matter for conjecture. In several cases these tribal namles h,ave become the names of rivers or settlements on the island.55 Frequently in the literature of the area, both early and recent, the ancient inhabitants of NMarajo', usually exclusive of the Aruan, are referred to as Nhee i- gail-as. Vieira states that the name had its origin in the many and difficult languages spoken on the is- land. 56 Sampaio says that the term-, is Tupi' and gives as his first definition a speech "ma" or "evil"; his second definition is "an incomprehensible ton- gue."57 Goeldi's interpretation is a little different. HIe says the term "Neegaiba" is a Tupi' or lingua- geral verb which means to speak poorly, or after the manner of the comrmon people, in contradistinction to "'Abaneenga" which means to speak correctly and intelligibly. He points out that the conquistadores came up to Para' from Maranhaio, a Tupi'-speaking area, and that much of the Portuguese success at arms was due to the Tupi allies who accompanied them. The term "Nheengaiba," therefore, was a Tupi' desig- nation for a group of peoples who did not speak their language and, because these people were enemies, another connotation was inherent - tribes whiclh were brutish, barbarous, and contemptible. 58 Unfortunately, the Portuguese seem to have absorbed mostly the 50 Betendorf, Livro 3, Capitulo 2. 51 Vieira, Carta LXVI. 52 Ibid., Carta LXXXVI. 53 Betendorf, Livro 3, Capitulo 2. 5 Hartt after Penna, 1885: 109 et seq.

Joao IV. S Unfortunately Penna's author- ity is not given. He is probably right, as the Fran- ciscans were the first missionaries to arrive in the area. In an effort to verify the Penna statement and in the hope of finding material which antedated the Vieira letters and which might contain detail which they do not, I consulted the Convento de Sto. Antonio, Rio de Janeiro. Its eminent Franciscan historian, Frei Basilio R6wer, replied that he did not know the source of Penna's information, nor whether or not it 60 was correct. It seems doubtful that the Nheengaibas or the Aruans were the authors of the pottery we find in Marajo mounds; however no really scientific field work has ever been done on the island and thus the approximate age of the pottery is as yet undetermined. ARCHEOLOGICAL SITES Interest in the archeology of Marajo' dates back almost a century. Since that time the island has been visited by a number of scientists - geologists, geo- graphers, paleontologists, naturalists, archeologists - most of whom have contributed reports of importance. In addition, Mlarajod has attracted its quota of journa- list-explorers, some of whose descriptions of sites and of the pottery they obtained from them are of value in serving to emphasize the archeological wealth of the island. Because of the variety of detail within these re- ports, as well as their variant nature, it seemed im- possible to summarize their contents and, at the same time, to present a clear archeological picture of the island. Therefore I have arranged the source material chronologically and have endeavored, by direct quo- tation as far as possible, to tell the story of arche- ological research on Marajo' Island a,s it has been recorded by those who have dug there. The source material consists of published papers, field notes, two more or less popular books, and letters to the University Museum and to myself.6W Dr. Charles Frederick Hartt, American geologist, summarizes early archeological investigation on Marajo as follows: The most interesting and fruitful field of archeological study thus far discovered in Brazil is that of Pacoval Island in Lago Arary, on the great island of Marajo or Joannes, in the mouth of the Amazon. Von Martius refers to the existence of funerary urns in a place called CAmutins62 59 Hartt, 1885: 110. 60 R6wer, Letter, 27 de novembro de 1944. 60All translations from. Portuguese, Italian and French are my own. 61 Hartt, 1885: 17 et seq. 62Ibid., Camuti or Camutim (Tupl) means "pot" or " urn. " on the island of Marajo, but, as far as I know, this site was never examined scientifically until the year 1870, when it was visited by Sr. Ferreira Penna, and later in 1876, by my assistant Mr. 0. A. Derby. On my expedition to the Amazon in 1870, my friend Sr. Ferreira Penna called my attention to the fact that the6i were ancient Indian relics on the Island of Pacoval. Not being able to visit it personally, I appointed one of my assistants, Mr. W. S. Barnard, to examine it and to make collections. Furnished with letters from Exm. Vis- conde de Arary, Sr. Penna, and other friends from Para, Mr. Barnard visited the Island, and found that it consisted of a burial mound in which had been interred igagabas containing human bones, idols, utensils and other pottery objects. ...In the summer of 1871 the Island was visited by Mr. J. B. Steere of the University of Michigan, and later, in the same year, this gentleman visited the Island of Pacoval, and made very important collections for the museums of Para and Rio de Janeiro. He obtained, by exchange, some duiplicates of this collection. I had intended to visit Pacoval in November of the same year, but finding it necessary to make an expedition to the Serra do Paraua-quara, I sent Mr. Derby, in company with Col. E. R. Beckley, to Para to make the necessary prepar- ations. Unfortunately, my assistants had to remain there, not only because of illness, but also because the Governor forbade the removal of antiquities from NMarajo'. Arriving in Para, President Abel Graga graciously gave me permission to make a collection; but due to the delays caused by the illness of all the commission, I was obliged, to my great disappointment, to give up the trip, and sent in my place Mr. Derby, accompanied by Col. Beckley, as artist. Mr. Derby brought back a fine collection, the greater part of which is today in the Peabody Museum of Ethnology in Cambridge. In 1876, Mr. Derby, then Ajudante da Commissao Geologica do Brasil, again visited Lago Arary and the mound at Camutins; the collections obtained on this expe- dition are those of the Museu Nacional of Rio de Janeiro. Steere describes, his work on Marajo as fo 64ows4 My first acquaintance with the archaeology of the Ama- zon was made on the island of Marajo, which is the great delta over two hundred miles across, lying in the mouth of Amazon. It is low and flat, mostly open campos covered with coarse grass, and much of it flooded in the rainy sea- son. It serves as pasturage for large herds of small half- wild cattle, from which the meat supply of Para is drawn. Its present scanty population lives in a few small villages and on fazendas, cattle estates, placed several miles apart to allow room for pasturage. A number of artificial mounds exist in the interior of this island. I was unable to get an idea of how many from the inhabitants. These mounds, as far as observed, are on the rivers or on interior lakes, and are called bythe Brazilians ilhas, islands, or fortalezas, forts. The present inhabit- ants appear to know nothing of the origin of these mounds, and have no tradition of their makers or inhabitants. I visited two of these on my first trip to Brazil. They were both on the river Arary, the largest stream in Marajo, which is about as broad as the Huron, but at the time of 63 Distances involved in a trip from Belem to important points on the Arar;' and to Pacoval, and the size of Lago Arar;, have been furnished by Dr. Inocencio Bentes; these are as follows: "De Belem a foz do Rio Arari, 27.400 metros; da foz do Rio Arari a' Cachoeira, 45.600 metros; de Cachoeira ao Anajas-Mirim, 60.000 metros; de Anajas-Mirim a' boca do Lago Arari, 8.200 metros; da boca do Laeo Arari a Pacoval, 5.500 metros; da foz do Anaja's-Mirim ao Cuieras, 6.600 metros. 0 Lago Arari tem 22 quilometros de extensao, 7 de largura e 60 de perimetro, com uma area de 110 quilomretros quadrados e uma capacidade de 320 milhoes metros cubicos.

Perhaps thirty miles inland it heads in Lake Arary, which is three or four miles broad and ten or twelve long. I hired a canoe and boatman at the village of Cachoeira, on the upper Arary, and we paddled and poled across the open and flooded campo, eliminating the many curves and loops of the river. The mound, called Ilha dos Bichos, island of the b.easts, was visible at several miles distance, a soli- tary projection above the level and flooded plain. On coming up to it I found it to be about a half-acre in extent, and from fifteen to twenty-five feet in height above the plain. It was covered with trees, and its sides were washed into deep ravines, yet there seemed to be the remains of a ditch or trench, intended perhaps for defense, for building material, or for both. The top was covered thickly with broken bits of pottery and on digging into this deposit I found it of considerable depth. A number of large burial urns showed in the ravines at different levels. These were usually crushed by the caving in of the earth, or by the roots of the trees. They were upright, with straight sides and with large covers like broad-brimmed hats. Both the urns and the covers showed remains of painting in various bands and figures. The human remains were too decayed for examination. In one urn, I found some mineral- ized fat, and in others, several curious three-cornered shal- low dishes with holes in their corners, which appear to have been used as tangas, aprons. T'hese were beautifully polished and ornamented. The mound appeared to have been built to a certain height, inhabited, and the dead buried beneath. Then, after a time, another layer of earth and another period of occupation was added. Two of these levels showed paving of burned clay, which was covered with ashes, charcoal, and broken pottery. I could get noth- ing in the village in the line of digging tools but a slave's heavy hoe and a crowbar, yet I was able to secure one of the urns and its broad over-hanging cover in a fair state of preservation. The second visited was called Paccoral,65 banana is- land. It is situated in the present border of the lake. At the time of my visit it was about a hundred feet in diameter with its top not more than ten or twelve feet above water level, and was being washed down continually. It appeared to have been much larger, for the lake about it was full of pottery, among them some entire dishes which my canoe men fished out with their bare feet. The mound contained burial urns similar to those of the Ilha dos Bichos. A fazendeiro who had his ranch on the lake gave me a. celt of black stone which he had picked up at the mound. He said they were called thunder stones, and were frequently found there. On my second trip to Brazil in 1879 we camped for sev- eral days on a large mound of several acres on the little river Anajais which empties into the bay of Marajo farther west than the Arary. The mound was similar to the others in its contents but contained more small vessels, idols, and the like. 'What such a large population, as these mounds indicate as having existed on Maraj", could have lived on is hard to imagine. I saw patches of wild rice about Lake Arary, but the natives did not use it, and I did not experi- ment with it. D. S. Ferreira Penna, naturalist in the service of the Museu Nacional, created the term Ceramios for the burial places of lower Amazonia. To the list of early explorers of Marajo referred to by Hartt he adds the names of CO. Jobert and W. Schwacke. His dis- cussion of Pacoval Island is, in part, as fol- lows: 6 66 Pacoval. 66Penna, 1877: 48 et seq. Pacoval67 is the most important of the Ceramios of Para'.... It is a little hill, low and artificial, formed by a series of urns and other vessels, separated irregularly by layers of earth brought from the neighboring campos.... Ac- cording to the season, its height above the lake varies from three and a half to eight meters, its greatest width is thirty-five meters, its length eighty to one hundred meters. At an unequal distance from its two extremities, there is an interruption in the Ceramio, a depression where no pottery is found; this indicates either that earth has been removed by the fishermen who go there annually to do their salting or that the builders of tne Ceramio had originally constructed it in two unequal parts. The latter hypothesis appears the more acceptable. Of these two sectioks the one which still appears in the form in which it was constructed is the one to the north that to the south is no more than a pile of fragments of vessels which totally covers the ground. A still greater quantity of fragments covers the area around the northern section, extending into the campo and the waters of the lake. So abundant are these sherds that there is almost no point on which the foot may be placed without treading upon the remnants of an urn which has held human remains, a decapitated idol, or a vase enriched with ornaments.... My first visit to Pacoval was preceded by that of Dr. Steere. T his naturalist had informned me that he had dis- tinguished in Pacoval three strata of vessels, super- imposed one upon the other, and representing artifacts sensibly different from each other in designs and other decoration. In his opinion the lowest stratum contained the most highly perfected wares, the uppermost, wares of less importance. This fact appeared to me of great interest and, on my visit to Pacoval, I had the satisfaction of confirming it, although it appeared to me that there were two intermediate strata instead of one. This circumstance I attributed either to the lack of order in which the urns in the middle were deposited... or to the inability to mnake a sufficiently regular and satisfactory examination of the Ceramio. In order to investigate better the condition alluded to, I commenced to cut down the small trees which covered the upper part of the Ceramio and, without much delay, there began to appear numerous circles which were nothing less than the mouths of urns buried without covers or lids. They were all of coarse clay, dark, and without orna- ment, except some indistinct traces of white paint and angular decoration. They were broken and full of earth and their own pieces and those of little vessels which originally reposed within them. In one of these appeared a little pipe which, although very crude, was not without interest because it was the only one I had found in the Ceramios of Para.... Within an urn excavated from the lower intermediate stratum of the Ceramio on Pacoval, I found in 1873... one of those talismans of pale pedra verde, known in Mexico by the name of Chalchihuitl or Esmeralda baja... the 67 In an effort to determine whether Pacoval, true to tradition, was an artificially constructed burial ground, I had sent from Marajo6 three soil samples - one from the cen- ter of the island itself, one from the bank of the Igarape das Almas which enters Lago Arari a short distance from P'acoval, and one from the lake shore a little to the north. Dr. A. W. Postel of the Department of Earth Sciences, University of Pennsylvania, who analyzed these samples, said it was not possible to state positively concerning the artificiality of the mound on the basis of so few samples. The analyses showed that all the samples came from the same bed, or series of beds, the heavy mrlinerals in all being practically identical. However, the fact that the two samples from the mainland were clay, and the one from Pacoval gravel, might suggest that it had been built by man. Dr. Inocencio Bentes, Engenheiro do Departamento Na- cional de Portos, Rios e Canais e Chefe da Comissao de Estudos e Obras na Ilha de Marajo, states that Pacoval is not an island but a peninsula, since, when the water in the lake is low, a connection with the mainland is discernible.</page><page sequence="13">272 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS.

To Ferreira Penna68 we are indebted for reference to two little known sites, Cajueiros and Santa-Izabel. His descriptions are as follows: Cajueiros Dr. Couto de Magalhaes, in his instructive and important book 0 Seizagem, recordls that in Marajo6 on the Fazenda Cajueiros, property of Dr. J.

Santa-Iza be I In 1873 I visited this Ceramio situated in the campos of Marajo, northwest of Lago Arary. It is difficult to find without a guide, because the artifacts are buried in ground which is flat and on a level with the surrouncling area. Although inferior in extension and nurmiber of artifacts to Pacoval it is, nevertheless, the only site which catn rival it in perfection of designs, reliefs, and painted decoration. It was here that I found, for the first time, sorne Tin- teiros, utensils indispensible to Indian artists; all were ornamented with elegant and delicate reliefs. One contain- ed a ball of clay, very fine and of red color, whic h still retained muchi of its moisture, due, probably, to some vegetable extract which entered into its composition. The report of Derby is as follows:69 Of all the localities in Brazil where the remains of an- cient Indian tribes have been found, the Island of LMlarajo is the most interesting to the archeologist. Whether the race at this point was a superior one, or whether the con- ditions under which they lived were more favorable, it is certain that the ancient inhabitants of Mlarajo, or at least a portion of them, made greater advancement toward civilization than any other of the aboriginal tribes, having excelled in the arts those of every other part of Brazil. In addition to the small heaps of stone implements found in nearly all the provinces of Brazil, there are found in Marajo antiquities whose characteristics are peculiar to that locality and indicate superiority. I refer to the arti- ficial mounds and the objects they contain.... Near the center of the island, in the midst of the plains, is a lake called Arary, out of which flows a river bearing the same name. Other important rivers are the Igarape- grande, which empties at the southeast part of the island, and the Anajas, which rises a little to the west of the Lake Arary and, crossing the forests of the western side, receives before leaving the plains the tributaries Camutins and Mocoes. On the margin of these rivers artificial mounds exist, but only those of Arary and Camutins have been examined. Those which I now describe may be taken as types. The best-known mound is situated by the side of Lake Arary, and in the winter becomes transformed into an is- land called the Island of Pacoval. In shape it is nearly oval, having a length of 150 meters and a breadth of 70 meters and a height of 5 meters above the water of the winter's overflow, which covers all the neighborhood for miles around. On one side of the island, exposed to the action of the waves, is a small cliff, in which the structure of the mound is displayed,' and where it is seen that, even to its base, the earth is filled in with pottery and ashes, proving the artificial structure of the mound. The waves have exca- vated very extensively into it, and the beach below is covered with pottery. The mound being thickly wooded, 68 Penna, 1877: 48 et seq. 69Hartt, 1885: 18 et seq. the objects lying near the surface have been much broken up by the roots of trees, but, at a greater depth, they are preserved in perfect condition. Several other localities on the shores of the lake yield a similar kind of pottery, but these places have not been investigated. About six or seven leagues to the west of the Arary, on the banks of the Camutins, there exists another well- known group of niounds, and a league further are over fifteen others of large and small size. The plain is here also very low and subject to inundations, the greatest natural elevations not rising more than one or two meters above the water during the rainy season. A narrow strip of forest usually borders the margin of the river where mounds, also wooded, are generally encountered; there are, however, other mounds situated on the plain. The principal nmound of Camutins, known by the same name, is a veritable hill, having a height of fifteen meters a- bove the plain, and with its sides so steeply inclined as to render their ascent on horseback quite difficult. The outline of the mound is elliptical, its length being two hundred and ten meters and its breadth at the base about eighty meters, but at the summit it is much nar- rower. The sides are furrowed by the rain which com- rrmences to excavate in holes made for the purpose of procuring igagabas, which are in great demand as recepta- cles for farinha. In these furrows the earth is seen to be full of pottery and ashes as at Pacoval. As a stronger evidence of the artificial origin of the mound, there is found near it a large excavation, similar to those some- times found in a railroad grading, and from which, without doubt, was obtained the iriaterial for constructing the mounds. The excavation is on the opposite side of the river, and near it is another mound alm-ost equal in size to that of Camutins. A few hundred meters below the mound of Camutins, on the same side of the river, is a thirdn mound of less height but broader and probably long- er. This last is situated at the bend of the river, being surrounded by water on three sides. The pottery of the largest mound of the Camutins is of the same character as that of Pacoval. As far as I was able to observe, it appears that the igagabas are more frequently painted than engraved, while the contrary is true at Pacoval. The predominating form is large and flatly globular, while at Pacoval the most commnon forms are smaller, sub-cylindrical and conoid. However, such observations are unimportant in establishing distinctions, and all the principal formns are represented as much at one site as at the other. There are many fragments of tangas, but I did not find a single complete one; most are red in color and without decoration, but I saw painted fragments similar to those of Pacoval. In 1882 Dr. Ladislau Netto, then Director of the Museu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, organized an arche- ological expedition and visited Marajo'. He brought back to the Museu three fourths of the collection he describes in his long and well-illustrated report.70 Hie visited Pacoval and was in agreement with Penna and Steere that the better pottery was near the bottom of the mound, the poorer quality near the top. He amplifies his point of view as follows: 71 However, I do not attempt to indicate whether this coarse pottery is an expression of progressive decadence, effected in the same people to whom are attributed the beautiful urns previously referred to, or if it was the pro- duct of a less advanced people who came to establish themselves in the same place from which the inspired and skillful fabricators of the most beautiful pottery in South America had retired or been vanquished. What I know is that the same mound which served the 70Ladislau Netto, 1885: Prefacio. 7' Ibid., 261 et seq.</page><page sequence="14">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 273 latter as the resting place of the mortal remains of their kinsfolk, served the other to the same end, without, there seems to me, having been any distinction in the manner in which the ceremonies were practiced. One fact appears worthy of attention... that the bodies were not buried here but were, probably, interred on the open plain from which the bones were collected and placed in a pre- pared urn. This was buried with honor in the sacred mound erected, it is to be presumed, in veneration of some deity or of the object symbolized by the name of the tribe. The mound of Pacoval, it will be seen later, displayed by its configuration its consecration to or commemoration of the entity in honor of which it had been constructed. This type of totemism was common among all primitive peoples of the two hemispheres and. to a high degree in America. Pacova7l2is an artificial mound -which, in form, suggests a jaboti. This animal is very pop-ular in the mythology of Amazonia because of his astuteness and sagacity.... The construction of this monument, which represents the animal with his head extended in an attitude of vigi- lance, must have required hundreds, even thousands, of workers and many months of painful toil, in part, under water. Ladislau Netto thought Pacoval may have been the residence of the tribal chief and likens it to struc- tures in the Lower Mississippi Valley. During the dry season of 1913 Algot Lange dug on Pacoval Island in Lago Arari and also at an unnamed site east of the island, which may have been Severino. Much of the collection he obtained is at present in the American Museum of Natural History, New York. Concerninf his work on Pacoval, he writes in part as follows:7 The form of the island is that of a narrow parallelogram with rounded corners... The northern section is higher than the southern.... Three sides of Pacoval are bounded by the waters of the lake while... the eastern shore... merges into a swamp or so-called mondongo.... A mondongo is neither land, nor water, nor prairie, nor bush. It is simply a thick layer of semi-solidified mud upon which cana-rana grass and other plants have formed a blanket.... Great alligators always abound around Pacoval Island, especially when the waters are high; they even take up temporary residence under the floor of the house. At the present time they have retired farther out into the lake and around the edges of the mondongo, where they can be heard at night uttering their peculiar grunts. Schools of piranhas swim around in calm weather, and are ever ready with their saw-teeth to attack any living thing that may come within their reach. ...The beach is a foot deep with fragments which crunch under my feet. Hundreds of little figures of red, black, and gray colors lie scattered around. Some are human heads with more or less contorted features, others are animal figures of the most grotesque appearance. There are pieces of large and small vases and jars broken off in the course of ages of existence, first in the ground, then possibly uprooted by the trees, and washed and tum- bled around by the waves of the lake, when the waves run far up on the island during the wet season.... Carefully we rake over the surface of the whole island.... All the boys are now spread out in a long line, each with a farina basket, and thus begins a wholesale col- lection of antiquities.... We soon observed that some large urns called ygaqabas were sunk into the ground, forming a straight line fol- 72 Testudo tabulata (Tortoise). 73See Mordini, 1930: 62. 74 Lange, 1914: 308 et seq. lowing the littoral. I counted twelve in all. The first of these was broken upon reaching a depth of two feet. It crumbled into minute fragments when fully exposed. The mouth of the second jar was plainly visible amidst many broken pieces on the surface of the beach. This we at- tacked judiciously with picks and shovels.... The result of this cautious work is a pyriform funeral urn of almost three feet in height.... I removed a quantity of earth and grayish ashes from the interior with the result that I find some human bones, all broken in pieces, and underneath these a most peculiar object of rare beauty and skill of workmanship... 75 I find also small platters with labyrinthic designs paint- ed and incised.... Large and small idol heads.... a large richly painted and incised idol which has probably served as the funeral urn, ygaqdba, of some prominent child.... No wonder I retire the first day with the satisfaction of having done good work, for I have unearthed no less than 580 specimens.... They tell me of many places in the neighborhood which contain much pottery similar to that which covers, or rather constitutes, this island. There are some places far up the "Creek of the Souls"76 on a piece of prairie land where outcroppings of pottery occur. Many tes os, or prairie-islands, are pointed out.... We begin our search in the waters of the lake and I am surprised at the continued good luck. The waters are as full of specimens as the beach, showing how the action of the waves during many years has washed the pottery from its subterranean resting places and gradually swept it out from the island...: Here we find platters of the most delicate design and whole Wngas, all of which preserve a remarkable freshness of colour.... We leave on an excavating expedition to a point son5 six miles from Ludovico's in a due easterly direction. Here we spend two whole days, returning with a canoe full of pottery, some of which is in fragments. The mound we visited is elevated hardly two feet above the level of the surrounding country, in the middle of a difficult piece of prairie, soggy and overrun with an uneven coarse growth of wild cotton plants. Old Ludovico indicated this spot as being likely to contain a great deal of pottery... as no excavations have ever been undertaken there. I found the pottery to be of a totally different character from that near Ludovico's. The clay ...seems to be lighter in colour and weaker.... All the vessels ... are of a different shape, too.... At the moment of departure the mother sends all her little tots to me, each one carrying an apron full of little idols, tangas, jars and little plates which have been used as playthings among the youngsters. My total collection now amounts to 4,888 specimens.... Dr. William C. Farabee represented the University Museum in northern South America from 1913 to 1916. In the dry seasons of 1914 and 1915 he dug on Marajo Island, returning each successive wet season to float out his collections. He never published any tech- nical study of this important archeological mission, but I have had access to his field notes and to his correspondence with the Museum over the periods referred to; it is from these sources as well as from his one published article, 78 that the following record of his work on NMarajo has been compiled. Dr. Farabee dug two sites concerning which the Museum, seemingly, has full field notes: Fortaleza, 76 Tanga. 76Igarape' das Almas. 77 This is in the general location of Severino from which some of the finest of Marajo pottery has come. 78 Farabee, 1921.</page><page sequence="15">274 PALIMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. in the valley of the Arari', and the Miagno Mound in the valley of the Camutins. Hie also made some ex- cavations in the vicinity of Lago Arari', but in his field notes on file at the Museum there is no record of that work. Early in October, 1915, Dr. Farabee records a week of exploratory work in the Municipio de Soure. Hle visited fourteen fazendas without finding anything of archeological importance. He refers specifically to Nazareth, Laranjeiras, Pacoval, Sao Lourengo and "the French place." He says that Sao Lourengo was the most talked of, but was without mounds, the point of interest being the wall of an old Franciscan mission. At Pacoval, the fazenda of Sr. A. Miranda, there had been a mound, but it had already been dug over by a German named Rempkin. At Nazareth there were village sites and some mounds less than a foot high. He gathered a few sherds from this area. Dr. Farabee concludes with a note concerning physical conditions in this municipio, he says: There are a few small fazendas near Soure, but not far above the grass begins. The river is salt, so the cattle must drink salt water during the summertime, but in the rainy season, all is fresh. In many places they drain off the igarapes and thus keep fresh water all summer. All the houses have wells. There are some good fazendas, but many are too low and under water all winter. In February of 1915 Dr. Farabee sent to the Uni- versity Museum a report on the excavation he had made at Fortaleza during the previous dry season, November and December, 1914. That report reads, in part as follows: On November 9th, I left Para' in a small boat for Marajo6 in company with Mr. Bertino Miranda, one of the members of the family which owns some of the largest cattle ran- ches on the island.... Mr. Miranda did not know that there were any mounds on their fazendas, but said he would take me to the owner of an adjoining fazenda who knows the location of some mounds. One of the Miranda cowboys said that he knew of a mound four hours away and we went to se it. We found not one but fourteen along a small stream.... I hired eight men and went to work. Within two weeks we turned over the greater part of four mounds down to the original sur- face of the field without finding anything except pottery and ashes. The negative results were interesting, however. In the mounds of Ohio great quantities of fragments of animal .bones, etc. are found. Here we find no animal bones, no fire places except in one mound, no bone im- plements, and only one stone axe. The people must have lived on platforms; the ashes thrown out were stratified by the water. There is a popular impression here that the island is changing its level gradually - the water standing higher in the rainy season than formerly, but in the mounds I found unmistakable evidence that no ap- preciable change has taken place since the mounds were built. Trees standing by show the high water mark of last 79This fazenda is not to be confused with the cerarnio in Lago Arari. 80Farabee, Letter, Feb. 8, 1915. 81 Dr. Inocencio Bentes sent the following information concerning the location of Fortaleza: "A Fazenda Forta- leza fica situada na margem direita do rio Goiapi, qui e flutuante do rio Arari, onde desagua proxima da cidade de Cachoeira, hoje denominada Arariuna." (Letter, 20 de Agosto de 1946.) year. The mounds show water stratification up to a cer- tain point above which there is no stratification. These two high-water marks are practically identical. The first three mounds Dr. Farabee dug were those he indicated as 2, 3, 4; the fourth was 5. ConcerninE the latter he leaves some interesting field notes: ...Mound was very hard as it is near the end of the dry season, the hot sun and heavy winds soon took all the moisture out of the land. The campo all around is baked and cracked, no green grass. What little water remains in the small streams is kept constantly stirred up by the cattle and the capivaras.... White sherds common but not numerous, also thick red ones.... Abandoned work on 5 after having excavated well past the middle of the mound down to the original soil and found practically nothing. The mound is a mystery to me. The ashes at the bottom seemed to have all been put on at the same time or during one work season as the ashes are sift- ed down into the original mud until it is difficult to tell where they end. The next layer of earth was put on before the next wet season, but water covered it and sun dried it into cracks; then more earth was put on and again a wet season and again cracks; but above this which is on the level with the present high water level, there are no sun cracks and no way to tell when the top was put on. The sherds are the same throughout, so all built by the same people. Some 15 small beds of ashes were found at dif- ferent levels scattered through the mound. No charcoal, no fireplaces, no human or animal bones. No post holes or other indications of houses. The fifth mound which Dr. Farabee excavated was No. 7, and in this he found rich treasure. Sr. Bertino N. de Miranda tells me that this mound is located on the Igarape' Felicidade, a tributary of the Rio Goiapi' and is across stream from an old house from which it takes the name Casa Velha. In his report to the Museum, Dr. Farabee sums up his work there, in part, as follows: The fifth mound stood in a strip of forest along the s-tream and was covered with fruit and large forest trees. The mound was 460 by 230' by 10' to 12' high. As we were not allowed to fell any trees, our work was necessar- ily irregular and patchy. We at once began finding things in abundance.... The burials were grouped. In a space of 50 feet square, we might find 50 pots, and then another 50 without finding a thing. Once in a space 4' by 2 we found 82Dr. Farabee describes these fourteen mounds as fol- lows: No. 1. Did not examine. 2. 10' high, 150' in diameter, steep on the stream side, sloping gently in other directions. 3. 3' high, oblong, 20' by 30'. 4. 5' high, 30' in diameter, steep on the stream side. 5. 7' high, 60' in diameter. 6. 4' high, 15' wide, 40' long, in open field by side of stream. 7. 10' - 12' high, 200 yards long, 75 yards wide, in forest by side of river. 8. 6' high, irregular in shape, 250' by 300', just across stream from 4. 9.

Apparently, they practiced two methods of burial: in one, the bones after they had been disarticulated and, in some cases broken, were put in pots and buried. The other method was to burn the body and bury the ashes in a pot. In no case did I find charred fragments of bones with the ashes as is common in the mounds in the U.S., I was unable to get any bone entire - there were traces of bones merely. Very little was found inside these burial pots or with them. In some cases a "tanga" was inside the pot but more often it was placed near the pot on the outside, along with plates and dishes. The "tanga," as you know, is a triangular piece of pottery supposed to have been worn by the women instead of an apron. Some of the pottery is beautifully decorated.... There are a few stone implements, lamps and small things. ...Unfortunately, it will be impossible to get the col- lection out for two or three months, not until the water is high enough to go in with a canoe. Fortaleza, where the mounds are, is 18 miles from the AraryRiveracross country and, as there are no roads or trails or wagons, I must wait for water-.... It is very difficult to get permission to dig on the is- land... but Dr. Vicente Miranda was educated at Columbia, has traveled in the United States.... He and his nephew, Bertino, have been exceedingly kind to me.... After Dr. Farabee had completed his digging at Fortaleza he went to the Upper Amazon for several months and then, as he had planned, returned to Marajo' at the height of the rainy season to float out his collection. A letter to the University Museum dated June 14, 1915, contains the following infor- mation: ...I went to Marajo' for the collection.... It was left on the top of the mound well protected from the weather. When I returned termites had entered every box and had eaten not only the boxes and the packing but the labels also. It was necessary to repack every box, a part on the island and the rest in Para.... My former packing list is of no value and the fragments of different pots are more or less mixed up. Dr. Farabee left a notebook listing over three hun- dred specimens taken from the nine trenches he dug in Mound .7 and he indicates the relative positions in which they were found. There is, however, no description of any of them. Since he had labeled each specimen before the original packing, he prob- ably felt descriptive notes were not necessary. Thus, as a result of the work of termites, we do not know which specimens were over which. After the com- pletion of his subsequent work at Camutins, he wrote to the University Museum that he had found "few types" at the latter mound which were also present at Fortaleza. 84 Thus the two sites must have im- pressed him quite differently. A few entries in his field book seem suggestive of local conditions and so are recorded again in this study. They are as follows: Trench 4. No. 23, top above the surface and gone. Inside was a tanga in three pieces in different places, broken purposely before placing inside. Trench 5. No. 21, burial 8"deep, near it half of another large pot (3) with top gone. No. 2 had inside fragments 84Idem., Letter, Dec. 14, 1915. of small bones and skull, a young person in teens....

Fragments of a spindle whorl, first one found.... 42 had bones of a woman of middle age. Form of skull was still discernible, about 80 - 85 index, small, smooth and round. Fragments of other bones were in- side; long bones had beenbroken in order to get them in. Neck of the pot had been broken to get skull inside. Jaw bones were not with the skull but to one side. Only one tooth, 3rd molar, remained, others had been lost before burial.... Ashes inside on one side of skull, bones show no evidence of fire; ashes outside of pot also. Trench 6. No. 1, stool near surface... 6 alone, large, top above surface and gone... 7 inside 6, all gone except bottom... 18 small, round, inverted pot with ashes in- side; over it 19 inverted, at side 20, a stool, with 21, a large plate, over it... 46, a fruit dish85... 47, a double dish. Trench 8. No. 9, seats piled together south of a large pot half above the ground; three seats had ashes inside, two were set over clay, all were right side up.... Dr. Farabee devoted November and December of 1915 to exploration and excavation on the Camutins. He describes the mound from which the University Museum's collection came as follows: On the right bank of the Camutins River which is a branch of the Anajas-grande, on the fazenda of Snra. Elvira Magno e Silva, opposite a larger mound, known as the Camutins Mound, which is the largest on the island. He describes the mound on the Magno estate as six hundred feet long, two hundred feet wide, twenty feet high. Concerning mounds on the Camutins he continues: The largest mound on the island of Mlarajo' is on the fazenda of Cezar Azeveda and his brocter Manoel, on the left bank of the Camutins, three hours from Bom Fim on the Anajas-mirim. It is thirty feet high, one thousand five hundred feet long, one hundred feet wide, but on the top it is very narrow, not room for a house, looks like a burial place only. It is in the forest but the campo comes to the foot of it. There is a house at one end. Vicente Murabek Azeveda at Bom Fim - an hour from Santa Rosa - is brother of the owners. They would not give permission to dig.... Within two miles above, on the same side of the river, are seventeen other mounds of various sizes, all are along the river bank. The last two are near together, one hun- dred and fifty feet apart and, with the exception of the Camutins Mound and the one on the Magno estate, are the largest of the group. They are twenty feet tall and as sharp as hayricks in the Spring. I don't know what they could have been used for, certainly not to live on, too sharp and steep and small. On the Magno side there are four - the large one and two about a mile up the river, and one below two hundred feet in diameter, round and flat-topped, not more than ten feet high. We dug several places in it, six feet deep on the top, found nothing but ashes after three feet and no fragments. In all the holes on the sides there were nothing but fragments four feet deep, nothing whole. The location of the mounds was due to springs along the riverside, eighteen were on the left bank. The river here flows from north to south, the wind blows from the east and the campo comes to the river on the east and not on the west where there are more pests of all kinds. 85 The type termed in this study "concentric dish." 86Note: Dr. Farabee usually calculates his time in hours on oxback.</page><page sequence="17">276 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF NIARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. The left bank is always preferable - more wind, more sun, more springs on that side. Permission having been obtained, Dr. Farabee or- ganized a camp and prepared to dig out the second largest mound on Marajo' Island. Ongas were frequent visitors and came within close range both day and night. He first did some exploratory digging on the top and on the west end of the mound but, finding nothing of importance, turned to the south end. His record of work on this part of the mound is, in part, as fol- lows: Plan I ...Put men to work near the south end where someone had taken out a pot, and at once found so many pots to- gether it was impossible to dig without hitting one. In a space of six feet square there were six large pots and three small ones. Three beautifully decorated ones had been put in first, possibly not all at one time, but not touching one another; then later three others had been put in on top of them, the tops of the first three had been broken to fragments and scattered and the others set in (them). The first three had been engraved, the other three painted in angular designs. These had been left so near the surface that in cultivation the tops had been destroyed - holes dug for banana trees. So six beautiful pots had been destroyed. No. 1 had been 3' high with a neck 15" across; the one resting on it had been 2%2' high; 3 was inverted over it; 4 had top cut off, 7 resting on top of it; inside 4 was 5; upright and on edge of 5 was 6 - a plate; 8 was engraved, 9 on top of it; 10 small and broken; 11 sat in neck of 12 which had been destroyed in burying 11. Every pot had ashes inside ....

Closed work Saturday, Dec. 18, 1915. Filled up holes and left mound in good condition. Dr. Farabee built a "house" for the protection of the pottery he had taken from the Magno Mound; he then waited several months until the campos were well flooded, returned, packed the pots and floated them across country to the river (pl. I-a). Dr. Farabee interprets the results of his work on the Miagno Mound as follows: 87 ...This great mound had been built up artificiallv to near its present height and had been occupied by a vil- lage whose people deposited their refuse just outside their doors and buried their dead in the mound in urns three feet high, in which the bodies had been placed in sitting posture.... It would appear that part of the dead were cremated and the ashes buried in small urns of beau- tiful form and design. Later, other people occupied the mound, who buried their dead seated in great urns of beautiful form and design but of entirely different manu- facture from those of the earlier people. They, too, cre- mated a part of their dead and buried the ashes in small urns of similar form and design to the large ones. These large urns were apparently not manufactured primarily for burial purposes but, no doubt, were first used for the stor- age of water. This we infer from the fact that we often found the body of an urn, with an incomplete or broken neck used for burial. ...The mouths of the urns were always covered either with a beautiful painted shallow bowl... or with a great flat plate inverted over the mouth and often extending to the edge of the lip.... Whatever ornaments were originally worn and buried with the dead had entirely disappeared. Nothing whatever was found on the inside of the burial urns except the so- called "tangas" or fig leaves supposed to have been worn by the women. Many fragments of these tangas turned up in the general digging, but only perfect ones were found inside the urns, where they always occurred at the very bottom. The tangas were always well made, hard burned, highly polished, and either in bright red monochrome or painted designs. No two have been found alike. The slight difference in form and in the flare of the corners and in the designs would seem to indicate that they had been made to order and to fit the wearer. When the urn was placed in the grave, the bottom of the hole was dug to fit it, so that all of the smaller pieces of pottery placed with the dead were deposited at the side of the urn. In the general digging, the most important of the smaller objects recovered resembled in size and form the ancient Roman lamps, having an open bowl and a short stem with a hole for the wick. They may have been lamps, or, as a medical doctor suggested, they may have been used as medicinal cups for the sick; each observer is entitled to his guess. 87 Farabee, 1921: 145 et s eq.</page><page sequence="18">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 277 One of the first questions asked in reference to these remains is as to their age. Unfortunately, there is no pos- sible criterion for fixing the exact age of any archeological remains in the New World. If articles of European manu- facture are discovered in the remains, then the age is clearly fixed as post-Columbian. On the other hand, if no evidence of European contact is revealed, we can only say that the finds are prehistoric, which may mean five hundred or a thousand years before the discovery. For the culture of the island of Nlarajo, there is nothing available for fixing even a relative age. No European articles were found in any of the mounds excavated; so we are justified in claiming for them an age of more than four hundred years, the time which has elapsed since the discovery of the Amazon. There are other evidences also which would allow them a considerable or even great age. Although the bodies had been placed in covered urns and buried in mounds high above the flood plain, the skeletons had entirely disinte- grated - even the enamel of the teeth had disappeared. In the refuse heaps where bones of animals are cast away with other kitchen remnants, no evidence of bones or shells was found. This would appear to argue for a rather great age. I have explored prehistoric mounds in the Mis- sissippi delta where conditions of soil and rainfall are very much the same as they are here on the Amazon. In the Mississippi I found human bones well preserved where they had been buried without protection, in direct con- tact with the earth. Animal bones were also found, well preserved and in very great abundance. It is true, however, that there is greater rainfall at the mouth of the Amazon and. besides, we know nothing about the chemical com- position of the soil, which might affect the preservation of bones. One can easily understand why so few articles were found with the burials in the mounds of NMarajo. There is no stone in the Amazon Valley suitable for the manufacture of implements; hence, the very few found must have come a long distance. Because of this lack of stone, the im- plements must have been made of wood, bone, and shell. All of these have entirely disappeared and left nothing but pottery behind. I have said the bodies had been buried intact in a sit- ting position inside of these great urns, and now I must explain how we were able to determine that fact. Many of the urns were broken from the weight of the superposed earth, and when excavating it was convenient to remove these fragments before disturbing earth in the interior. This method allowed us to cut down in cross sections and expose the outline of the bodies in profile. As the bones decomposed, silted earth took their places; so by carefully cutting away the earth, we were able to trace out all the bones of the body. In many cases, in the early stages of decomrposition, the head had fallen forward from the trunk and remained face up on the bottom of the urn. The body, no doubt, had been wrapped in cloth or bark and then de- posited in the urn after it had been placed in a hole dug in the mound. The neck of the urn was sufficiently large to admit the body in this form. In one of the largest of the urns two adult bodies had been seated side by side. Many times the grave digger encountered an earlier burial, but instead of selecting another site, he continued and broke away the upper part of the urn and seated his own on top of the earlier burial. So far, we have been unable to find conclusive evi- dence that the people were clothed or manufactured cloth of any kind. In the North American mounds, cloth-marked pottery was often found, but here nothing of the kind has been discovered. In all of our excavating, only one spindle- whorl, or object that might have been used for that purpose, was discovered. If the people were acquainted with spin- ning, it is rather strange that more spindlewhorls or other evidence has not been found. The people may have dressed as some of the modern natives do today, in bark cloth, but even this is doubtful. If the so-called tangas were used as fig leaves it is highly improbable that any clothing was worn over them, as they are always well made, beauti- fully decorated and worn to be admired. If the women wore tangas, the men must also have worn some protection, which was more than likely made of bark. From all indications and the informnation at present ob- tainable, it would appear that the high state of culture here represented is indigenous to this one island. It is not directly related to any other knciwn culture; but it is true that little archeological work has been done along the coast of Brazil north and south of Marajo, and evi- dence may yet be found of some contact.... There is no evidence in the material found of a development from a lower culture; but, again, this may be due to the fact that little systematic work has been done on the island. To Dr. Antonio Mordini we are indebted for the in- formation that Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira, for- merly Director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi in Bele'm, excavated the Teso do Severino in 1925. This site is on the Igarape das Almas which enters Lago Arari from the east. Dr. Mordini states 88 that today this teso ...est completement nivele' et on reconnait seulement son emplacement primitif par une ceinture de vieux arbres qui de'limnitent sa forme. Les fouilles que le savant arche'ologue bre'silien Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira y a executees ont mis a jour des pieces de ce'ramique bien plus avancee au point de vue artistique et aussi technique que celle de Pacoval do Arary, la pate etant plus fine, le travail plus soigne' et la cuisson plus poussee; en outre plusieurs de ces pieces portent sur leur surface une espece de glagure qui les recouvre partiellement (probablement la resine du Jutalsica que les habitants actuels de l'ile employent pour vernir leurs pieces de poterie), mais tandis que la decoration a motifs geometriques rectilignes (peinte) ou curvilignes (grave'e) est bien superieure aux pieces de Pacoval do Arary, la de'coration zoomorphe ou anthropomorphe obtenue par plastique est tres inferieure surtout au point de vue artistique. In the summer of 1941, Dr. Oliveira, his wife and daughter, D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita and myself went on a little expedition up the Arari to Pacoval. The primary aim of the trip was to furnish me with an opportunity to acquire some first-hand knowledge of the general terrain of this valley, and to give me the pleasure of visiting the most-discussed site on MIaraj o. By 1941 Pacoval had been pretty well leveled by water and a long succession of professional and non-professional diggers, Dr. Oliveira therefore sug- gested a visit to Santa Brigida which had never been excavated. This is a big mound, probably two acres in extent and, in its present condition, about twelve feet high. It is flat on top owing to the trampling of cattle in wet and dry seasons over a period of years. Santa Brigida is the property of Sr. Lauro Lobato and is situated on the Igarape Cuieras, a tributary of the Anajas-mirim which, in turn, is a tributary of the Rio Arari. Our stay at the site had to be limited to only a few hours; thus no preparations were made for very 88Mordini, 1930: 63 et seq.</page><page sequence="19">278 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. formal digging, but Sr. Lobato, whose fazenda "Loret- ta" was our headquarters, kindly supplied picks and shovels and also some "bravos" and, in addition, went along himself to help. There was no time for exploration or examination of the entire structure, but Dr. Oliveira supervised some digging on the side of the mound at the point at which our canoes had landed. Apparently, this section was full of pottery. In the space of about two hours, the workmen removed two large, undecorated jars, lacking their tops, one plain shallow dish, a painted and engraved concentric dish, more or less complete, and fragments of several large vessels. No effort was made to determine stratification but, with- in the limits of the small area excavated, decorated and undecorated wares seemed buried close together and in confusion. Mr. Curt. Nimuendaju did a little work on Marajo. In response to inquiry, Dr. Antonio Mordini replied that Mr. . Nimuendajui had spoken to him of having done some research in the Lago Arari region, of having visited Pacoval, and of having done some excavating on the Fazenda Ganhaio on the Igarape' GanhTo; how- ever, Dr. Mordini did not know the dates nor particu- lars concerning this work.89 Dr. Mordini excavated on Marajo in 1926 and in 1928. Concerning the number of possible burial sites on the island and those within the general area of his work, he writes as follows:90 ...On connait dans l'ile plus d'une centaine de tertres artificiels parmi lesquels le celebre d' "Ilha do Pacoval do Arary," celui de "Teso do Severino," ceux renfermes dans le territoire delimite par les fleuves Ganhao, Cururu et les lacs Mututi et Asapao et qui sont nommes: Serra- Teso dos Gentios- Menino Deus- Panellas, plus une serie de 7 petite tertres construits l'un pres de l'autre sur le chemin qui va de Cajueiros a Faz Cafe. Tous ces te:rtres sont en forme ovaloide et orientes a ce qu'il parait in- tentionnellement dans la direction E - 0; d'autres de la meme forme tels que Pacoval do Cururu, Mataforme, Anana- tuba ont une orientation N - S; et a ce suiet il est interes- sant de remarquer qu'aucun des tertres connus de l'ile de Marajo presente une forme zoomorphe intentionnelle. Le tertre d'Ilha do Pacoval do Arary que plusieurs arche- ologues (entre autres Ladislau Netto) ont decrit comme ayant la forme d'un "Carumbe" (Testudo tabulata) ne devait cette forme qu' a la chute d'une partie da sa con- struction superieure, chute produite par le glissement du terrain qu' on reconnait avec facilite. In 1926 he excavated at Pacoval do Arari'. At this site he distinguished two distinct archeological stra- ta, separated by a sterile stratum. The upper, or Stratum A, extended from the surface to a depth of 75 cm., the sterile stratum had a depth of 48 cm., the lower archeological stratum, or Stratum B, had a depth of 55 or more centimeters. The pottery from Stratum A belonged to a "stile tipico de Marajo." Examined by micro-emulsion, this 89Idem., Letter, Feb. 1946. 90Idem., 1930: 62. pottery was shown to contain siliceous material con- sisting of the ashes of tree bark, introduced intention- ally during the preparation of the paste.91 In Stratum B, the general style of the pottery was the same as that of Stratum A - that is, designs in red or sepia-blue on a grayish background; however, microscopic examination of the pottery of this level showed that it lacked siliceous material of biological origin. Concerning this matter, Dr. Mdordini remarks:92 From this it is possible to maintain that the Marajoans arrived at the island ignorant of the custom of adding siliceous material of biological origin to the clay used in making their pottery. Later, they acquired this cultural element either by local invention or by trade with some other Amazonian tribe. Since in Stratum B was encountered painted pottery, highly developed in style, the seductive hypothesis of Uhle might be entertained - this was to the effect that the painted pottery of Marajo was of Andean- Chibchan origin. Thus the invention of adding a siliceous substance of biological origin to the paste might have appeared, at least in Marajo, at a period considerably posterior to the -principal Andean-Chibchan influence in Lower Amazonia. Notable quantities of tanga fragments were found in both of the pottery-bearing strata of Pacoval, also pieces of large urns and small vessels.94 In 1926, Dr. Mordini dug also at Teso dos Gentios. He has been kind enough to send, for inclusion in this study, a copy of his field notes for both this site and that of Panellas which he excavated in 1928. His sketches (figs. 2 and 3) and the keys to them illus- trate clearly the closely packed condition of the typical Marajo burial mound and the variety of both vessel-form and decorative technique which the arche- ologist may reasonably expect to find in one.

Item 5 is important. This is the only instance known either to Dr. M'ordini95 or to myself of a neck- lace of pierced teeth having been found in a Mlarajo burial site. Itenms 16 and 23 also are of great interest, in thiat they record instances in which tangas probably had been attached to female urns. Naturally, the retaining cords would have disappeared long since. Dr. MIordini writes that he is sure that these tangas were purely ceremonial in character as they were larger thlan nor- mal and of too little curvature for actual use; also, the holes in the corners showed no wear from a cord. 96 It would seem, from these field notes that Dr. MNiordini obtained more skeletal material in good con- dition than anyone who has dug on MIarajo. Therefore it is to be hoped that, in the not too distant future, some physical anthropologist may become interested in this collection and lend his aid in unraveling the mystery of early civilization on this island. A small portion of Dr. Mordini's original collection may be seen on plates 4-a to f; 5-d and e; 77-c and d; 79-c and d; 105-f and k. aHe writes that, in addition to these pieces, he has several thousand sherds, but that twenty-seven of his finest specimens were de- stroyed at his home in Barga, Italy, during the recent war. Many of the finest pieces he brought from Brazil are now in various European museums. Hie gave five large jars from Panellas and two from Teso dos Gen- tios to his friend the late Dr. K. T. Preuss; these were, before the late war, in the V6lkerkunde Museum in B3erlin. Twenty-one complete pieces from his ex- cavations at Pacoval and Teso dos Gentios were presented to the NMuseo Nazionale d'Antropologia ed Etnologia of Florence, while small collections of slherds were sent to the British Museum and to the Statens Etnografiska Mluseet in Stockholm. 97 Dr. Mlordini seems to regard his two expeditions to Mlarajo as more or less exploratory in nature as he he had planned to return in 1930 for more extensive operations and, in particular, for careful stratigraph- ical studies. This latter project, unfortunately, did not attain fulfilment. 98 In 1929, Nlr. Carlos Quadrone dug at Panellas and recovered some fine pieces, anmong them several stools, sometimes regarded as "offertories," and what may have been a Jluyrakita, or Amazonian amu- let, of a transparent grey-green stone, probably jade- 95Idemn., Letter, Oct. 4, 1946. 96Iderm., Letter, Oct. 11, 1946. 97Idem., Letters, Sept. 23, 1946; Nov. 10, 1946. 9Idem., Sept. 11, 1946. ite or nephrite. According to NMr. Nimuendajiu, this piece may have been a temnbeta or lip ornament as, in forni, it resembles the resin tembetas used by some present-day tribes of northwestern Mlatto Grosso, notably the Sanamaiki (upper Rio Machado).99 The piece referred to is figured on plate 105 - k. Dr. Frederico Barata, of Belem, told me recently in conversation that he had never heard of jadeite in any form having been found on Marajo and this is the only instance known to me; however, as previously reported, Penna found a piece of "Esmeralda baja" at Pacoval. Such amulets were characteristic of the Tapajo and neighboring tribes, but not of the Mifarajo Indians. In 1930 D. Hieloisa Alberto Torres, Director of the M4useu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro, went to Mfarajo and also to M'exiana, an island to the north of Miarajo, in search of ancient Indian pottery. On N,arajo she exc-avated ...five hitherto unknown sites of which three were camp sites, while the other two were cemeteries. One of the latter (Pacoval de Cururu) consisted of an artificial mound located on land which is under water except at low tide. The camp sites in each case yielded undecorated pottery, but the cemeteries yielded the beautiful carved pottery for which the island is famous. 100 Dr. Miordini states that two of the sites which Miss Alberto Torres excavated were Mataforme and Anana- tuba. 101 The Brooklyn Museum sent an expedition to the Amazon 1931 - 1932, under the leadership of Mr. Desmond Holdridge, explorer and journalist. The Mu- seum's published report gives little detail concerning the work on Marajo Island, beyond the fact that five mounds were explored and that the work lasted four months. NMr. Holdridge has, however, written a popular book on Mlarajo entitled Feudal Island, and the fol- lowing quotations are from it. Apparently, the first site dug was on the Fazenda Laranjeiras, the property of Sr. Jayme Lobato. In addition to describing a large urn containing bones which was destroyed in removal, the author adds: 102 ...Digging carefully with a penknife, I soon uncovered plates and dishes, fragments of dolls and whistles, broken bits of tangas.... On the table where we ate lunch was a big bowl which had been taken out of the mound and now served its irrev- erent owners as a place to put mashed sweet potatoes.... There has never been found in the graves a single article of European manufacture.... It is said by some that the deeper you dig into the mounds the more complicated and beautiful the pottery becomes, but in the only mound where I had even a slight opportunity to examine the stratigraphy, this did not hap- pen to be the case. The mound is by far the most important on Marajo, being about seventy feet high and entirely artificial. Monte Carmelo, as the mound is called, is on the estate of Epominandas Ferreira Texeira, near the source of the Rio Ana jas.... 99Idem., 1936: 22 et seq. 00 Lothrop, 1934: 820. ?101ordini, Letter, Sept. 23, 1946. 02 floldridge, 1939: 67 et seq.</page><page sequence="22">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE ISLAND 281 Owing to the "slipping" caused by heavy rains on the steep sides of Monte Carmelo mound and to the destructive action of the roots of the big mango trees crowning its summit, fragments of pottery were exposed from the river bed to the top. At both top and bottom there were quanti- ties of simple red pottery, some of it incised, some of it not. Between these two layers was the highly developed ware, incised, sculptured and painted, which is charac- teristic of Marajo. Such excavations as I made tended to confirm the impression that three separate strata existed. The author nmentions a large urn he recovered at Monte Carmelo; the decoration was in white, red, and dark brown. He continues: From the distribution of bones in this and every other urn I have seen, I conclude that the body was allowed to rot or left to the ants and vultures before burial, the bones being then collected and interred in small bundles. Similar practices exist to this day in Amazonia among the remoter tribes. This urn is now in the Brooklyn Museum. Many of the trays and dishes found display an impish humor... and there are many little clay whistles in the form of birds. These are usually capable of three or four notes. There are tiny dishes in the form of10wortoises... the variety of household ware is enormous. It is interesting to note that, although formerly there was a sambaquz or artificial shell heap at Cachoeira on the Rio Arari, shells never have been found in the ancient ceramios of Marajo6. 104 The Maraj6o islanders had no adequate stone supply and therefore must have imported their implements. Many years ago Ladislau Netto recognized the im- portance of studying the stone artifacts of Miarajo and wrote concerning the matter as follows: There are in the ceramic artifacts of Marajo some points of affinity with poftery found in the shell heaps of San- tarem, in the mounds on the two margins of the Amazon, 103 Dr. Mordini has offered the following comment on Mr. Holdridge's discussion of burial customs on Marajo6: "L' enterrement secondaire en urnes etait probablement precede a Marajo (comme dans nombreuses tribus ama- zoniennes actuelles) du decharnement: le corps etait mis dans un grand panier en fibres et successivement immerge dans l'eau courante d'un lac ou fleuve pour plusieurs semaines. Apres ce traitement on retirait les ossements parfaitement decharnes. "J e ne crois pas que le corps fcut abandonne aux vautours et aux betes sauvages qui pouvaient meme s'emparer des ossements du defunt. Plus probablement les fourmis; mais la pratique courante etait l'immersion." (Letter, Sept. 23, 1946.) 104Conhece-se um sambaqui na ilha de Maraj6, regiao de Cachoeira, entre o lago Arari e o rio Para. 0 monte de con- chas foi destruido para a fabricaqao de cal. E' necessario nao confundir com os sambaquuis os cera- mios ou cemiterios indigenas do lago Arari, que teem fornecido preciosissimas ceramicas, reputadas entre as mais artisticas da America. Nem aqui, nem nos outros cera- mios propriamente ditos, do Para, encontram-se conchas. E' esta uma das muitas provas de que os aborigenes mais adiantados, que practicavam a ceramica, nao eram malaco- fagos. Leonardas, 1938: 39 et seq. 105...A pequena villa de Cachoeira, unica povoaqao do rio (Arari), esta situada na margem esquerda, umas 10 a 15 milhas acima da foz. Um recife de gres vermelho concre- cionario apparece alli no leito do rio, formando na vasante uma pequena cachoeira que da o nome a villa. A rocha e o gres ordinario ferruginoso, que se encontra na visinhanc,a do Para' e Soure, e e a unica que tem sido reconhecida na ilha de Marajo, onde os affloramentos de rocha sao exces- sivamente raros. Hartt, 1885: 19. 106Ladislau Netto, 1885: 269 et seq. in vicinities in the Tapajoz and Trombetas valleys, and in the grottos of Maraca in Brazilian Guiana. But at what period were the primitive tribes in these localities af- filiated with the mound builders of Marajo? Were these relationships established from the beginning or were they effected long after the mounds of Pacoval and Camutins were constructed? If there was no relation or other alliance between the builders of these sacred hillocks of the great island and the peoples established on the two banks of the Amazon, it is probable that, later on, the Marajoans were in com- munication with these peoples or, at least, some tribe of them; concerning this there is unequivocal testimony - the presence in the mound of Pacoval of axes of diorite of which I found twenty specimens. Now diorite is a rock which does not exist on the island of Marajo, nor on the two borders of the Amazon, that is at no point at the mouth of the river. It appears only at many leagues beyond the littoral and, if I am not mistaken, for the first time only at the instance of the first falls of the XingCu and Trom- betas Rivers. Thus it seems natural to conclude that the Indians of. Marajo may have had some commerce with the Indians of these lr{gions by which they obtained these articles of stone. SUMMARY The foregoing reports of archeological work on Marajo' seem to indicate that the mounds or tesos (as these structures are referred to in Brazil today) were built in various shapes and sizes and presum- ably not always for purposes of interment. Some of the facts which may be gleaned from these records are the following: 1. At least two important sites, Teso do Severino and Santa Izabel, have been leveled and no record seems to have been left as to their original form or s ize. 2. From Nazareth in the Municipio of Soure Dr. Farabee reports mounds which were less than a foot high; he does not give their area. 3. At the other extreme for size are the two great mounds of the Rio Camutins - the Camutins Mound which Dr. Farabee estimated to be 1,500 ft. long, 100 ft. wide, 30 ft. high, very narrow at the top, and the Magno Mound which he records as 600 ft. long, 200 ft. wide, 20 ft. high. At Fortaleza, he estimated Mound 7 to be 460 ft. long, 230 ft. wide, 10 to 12 ft. high. Monte Carmelo near the source of the Rio Ana- ja's, excavated by Holdridge, was a large mound; he gives no figures concerning its area, but estimates its height as 75 ft. Santa Brigida is a large mound. 4. With regard to shape, Dr. Farabee describes a series on the Camutins as "sharp as hayricks in the springtime;" some of the mounds he excavated at Fortaleza had a circular, some a rectangular base. Pacoval in Lago Arari appears to have been built in two sections or to have had a cross section par- tially removed. Dr. Mordini reports some which were 107Dr. Mordini states that one of the reasons for the scar- city of stone artifacts on Marajo is the -belief of the pres- ent-day population that these relics of former civilizations are bearers of ill luck. Thus whenever a vaqueiro finds a stone piece, particularly an axe, he promptly disposes of it in the nearest river or lake. Dr. Mordini witnessed this pro- cedure in 1928.

None seems to have been intentionally constructed to represent vitamorphic forms although Ladislau Netto has made this suggestion in con- nection with Pacoval. 5. Dr. Farabee makes no special reference to ori- entation, but Dr. Mordini thinks some tesos were in- tentionally oriented east and west, others north and south. 6. Certain tesos were what Penna termed ceramios or burial places - notably Pacoval of Arari', the Magno NMound, Teso dos Gentios, Panellas, Mound 7 at Fortaleza, Ilha dos Bichos; however, four of those dug by Dr. Farabee at Fortaleza contained nothing but pottery and ashes, and in only one was there a fireplace. In Mound 5 at Fortaleza he found only a few sherds and fifteen small beds of ashes at dif- ferent levels, "no fireplaces, no human or animal bones, no post holes or other indication of houses." On the Rio Camutins, Dr. Farabee mentions having dug six feet deep in several places on a big flat- topped mound 200 ft. in diameter and having found nothing but ashes and sherds near the top, and below three feet nothing but ashes. In his opinion the peo- ple had lived on platforms at one Fortaleza site and the ashes they threw out had been stratified by the water. Ilha dos Bichos and the Ntagno NMound appear to have been used for both residence and for burial. Records of archeological research on Marajo' sug- gest only a very incomplete picture of that culture. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that careful field observations often have not been made, but an im- portant element also is climatic conditions, due to which much of the skeletal material and creative art of these peoples must be forever lost. However, as Taylor'08 has so wisely suggested, it is well at least to make a beginning at a "construction" of a cul- ture even though the constituting elements may be far from complete. Future finds may fill in some of the blank spaces, or correct earlier impressions, and gradually, through interrelating elements, something approximating a true cultural picture should emerge. The richness of Marajo"s ceramic production can be appreciated only by reference to the Stylistic Analysis which follows, but over and above the fact that the Marajo' Indians were potters of unusual skill, certain other constructional factors are suggested by the field notes and by physical conditions on the island today. The most acceptable of these seem to be the following: 1. It is evident that, whatever the local differ- ences of pottery-making and decorating techniques may have been, there prevailed throughout Marajo6 the same general burial customs; these suggest re- ligious observances which included a cult of the 106 Taylor, 1948: 35 e t seq. dead and a belief in a future life. In some cases jars previously damaged were used for burial urns, but more often there seems to have been careful pre- paration of funerary vessels. Small containers sur- rounding the urns, often highly decorated, suggest provision for sustenance on the long journey ahead. 2. A dominant feature of NMarajo religion was a fertility cult; this is apparent from the conspicuous use of the tanga and its importance in burial. Vari- ation in size suggest it was used from early child- hood. Phalliform figurines also suggest a fertility cult. 3. Variation in the decoration of the tanga may have been indicative of social status. 4. Cremation and the placing of disarticulated bones in urns appear to have been the burial customs most generally followed but, occasionally and at certain sites, whole bodies were placed in urns. 5. The fact that male urns are very rare and fe- male urns quite common could suggest that more males than females were cremated. 6. In many cases bones have entirely disinte- grated even when the burial was above the water level of the rainy season. This condition suggests considerable age for some of the sites. 7. It is probable that women wore little besides the tanga, although feather ornaments probably were common. 8, The ancient Marajoans probably used poisoned arrows as did the Nheenga?bas of Vieira's time, and certain little cylindroid vessels, pierced near the mouth, might have been used as containers (pl. 5-d). 9. Only one pipe has been recorded from Marajo, so if tobacco was used it was not smoked in pipes. 10. There is no stone on the island, so the Mara- joans had to trade in their stone implements. What they may have had of bone or wooden implements has disappeared. 11. Very few spindle whorls have been found and there are no cloth impressions on MIarajo pottery; thus weaving was not one of their important indus- tries. Some of the tanga designs suggest that they knew basketry. 12. The elaborateness of many of the "tinteiros" which appear in the collections suggests that coloring materials must have been almost sacred elements, cherished with the greatest care. 13. Corn will not grow in the valley of the Arar;' because it is too wet; Steere mentioned seeing a lit- tle wild rice on the island; it is doubtful whether enough manioc could have been produced for a fairly dense population. Wild fruits and nuts are scarce, although the fruit of the assal palm is used today as a beverage. Edible birds are scarce, fish are very plentiful, small game fairly so. 14. Vieira mentions the use of palm houses by the islanders in the middle of the seventeenth century. These are used today in some of the higher spots</page><page sequence="24">I L HIA CAVIA A 0OIRT LJURUA A~4 A LHA MEXIANA 8 4 7- 1.FLEX AS 4 C A N 4 L DO L~~~~~~IPtAMPE LANiCIAMLI DO MACHADOB C,4fqAL DO S 1. ~REDEN010 cI CEAL S * C~~~~~~~~~~~ADO MAGUARI S.en to A X -L.TARTARUOAS CE TERIO JJ' 0 ACVAL 0C= - 0~~- BodoIo~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ p4 ~~~~~~CEMITR0 E.

Also, on the upper river near the entrance to the lake, fishermen live in pile houses along the wrater's edge and even in the middle of the stream. Mlost of the "great houses" of the fazen- deiros, as well as the homes of the cowboys, are of necessity raised on piles for protection during the rainy season. It is probable that pile structures, approximating in type the fishermen's huts of today, have been used on the island over a long period. The ultimate inmpression one gets from reading re- cords of archeological research on Marajo is the grave need, before it is too late, for extensive and detailed study of such tesos as are as yet undis- turbed, in the hope of determining something of the age of MIarajo pottery and of the customs, beyond mere interment, of the people or peoples who pro- duced it. SITE MAP The information for the site map which accompanies this study was procured by Dr. Inocencio Bentes, the engineer who has charge of the myriad waterways on the island, and is the result not merely of his obser- vation but also of considerable correspondence with former residents. Some fine sites such as Severino and Panellas have been completely obliterated and so are not indicated; others appear concerning which there seems to be nothing in the literature. It will be noted that the map represents only the eastern section of the island, this is because the archeology is all in that area. The -m.ap was redrawn for publication by D. Maria de Lourdes Jovita who lived on Marajo for several years and who knows its geography well. THE POTTERY STYLISTIC ANALYSIS INTRODUCTION The ensuing stylistic analysis was based upon the examination of Marajo6 collections in the following museums: the UJniversity Museum, University of Penn- sylvania, Philadelphia; the American Museum of Nat- ural History and the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, New York; the Brooklyn Museum, Brooklyn; the Peabody Museum of American Archae- ology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Cambridge; the United States National Museum, Washington, D.C.; the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem, Brazil; the private collection of the late Dr. Carlos Estevao de Oliveira, formerly director of the Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi. In addition, several pieces have been included from the collection of the Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro, the Mluseo Etnografico Luigi Pigorini, Rome, and the private collection of Dr. Antonio Niordini of Barga, Italy, descriptions of specimens from these three collections having been based on photographs, published material, and information specifically requested. Marajo pottery not included in this study may be found in the Museum of Anthropology of the Univer- sity of Michigan, Ann Arbor; the British Museum, London; the Musee de l'Homme, Paris; the Museum fur V6lkerkunde, Berlin; the Museo Nazionale d' An- tropologia ed Etnologia, Florence; 1 the Musee d' Ethnographie, Geneva, and there are a few small pieces in the Etnografiska Museet, Goteborg. In Bra- zil, there is a collection at the Instituto Historico, 1Mordini, Letters of Apr. 29 and Sept. 23, 1946. Mlace io, Alagoas, and a few important private col- lections, among them that of Senhora Justo Chermont of Belem; Desembargador Raul Braga and Dr. Felis- berto de Camargo of Belem also have some interest- ing specimens. In this study pieces have not always been classi- fied on the basis of their most completely covered surface, but rather with regard to the one which is most important from a classificatory aspect and which affords recognition of all the major decorative tech- niques. Thus, since polychrome and dichrome appear in conjunction with all the other important decorative techniques, a piece is not placed in the polychrome- dichrome category unless it displays no other sig- nificant decoration. For the purposes of this introduction, in order to give some idea of the variation which appears within each of the major decorative classifications, the types of decoration which may characterize the re- verse side of each ware have been indicated on the classification outline which follows; however, in the Analysis proper, the subdivisions within the major wares have been based largely on form-traits, the reason being that the relations between the wares, as well as their differences, may thus be clearly indi- cated, also because form-trait has been used to a con- siderable extent as a basis for correlation with other areas. Note of the type of decoration on the non- classificatory surface has, when significant, been included in the general description of the piece. In a case where a piece has been decorated with two major techniques - for instance, champ-leve on</page><page sequence="26">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) TIHE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 2S5 one side and polychrome or dichrome on the other - it has been termed a "combination sub-ware." Examples of such wares are numerous and often represent Mlara- jo pottery at its best. The importance of these sub- wares to archeological research seems to be that they give as.surance that polychrome and dichrome flour- ished on Mlarajo at the same period or periods as did engraving and champ-leve and, since the same motifs occur in all four techniques and since certain form- traits are common to all of them, it would appear that most of NIarajo art had much the same origin or ori- gins, or that there was much friendly borrowing be- tween the tribes. Certain beautiful fragments of unknown site, but probably from the vicinity of Severino, and pieces known to have come from Severino, while displaying certain fundamental Miarajoan traits, nevertheless have a distinction and a quality which merit further research and suggest the possibility of rich finds in future excavation. Wares which are typically Marajoan are almost all lavishly decorated, often in more than one technique on the same surface. Modeling, for instance, is nor- mal to all the important painted wares which include the engraved and champ-leve wares as well as di- chrome and polychrome, the only notable exception being the red and white engraved wares decorated with the angular S design (pl. 29 - a, b, d). Champ- leve and polychrome wares are frequently additionally decorated with engraving. In this study the classifi- cation of the major wares has been based upon the principal technique of the classificatory surface with- out subdivision for secondary decoration, when the secondary decoration is normal to the ware. This secondary decoration is, however, discussed in the te xt. Fine examples of unpainted wares are rare in Marajo collections. A notable exception to this rule is a small group of gray-blue pieces from the col- lection of the Museo Etnografico Luigi Pigorini in Rome and that of Dr. Antonio Mordini in Barga, Italy. These pieces are typically Marajoan in form and modeling, and similar to pieces in painted wares having a red or red-brown paste. Since these gray- blue specimens are unusual and distinctive because of the color of the paste, and since they show no evi- dence of ever having been painted, they have been classified with the unpainted wares. Highly decorated pieces of red or red-brown paste usually display some traces of paint. However a few fine pieces are, in their present state, unpainted; whether or not they were so intended we have no means of knowing. For simplification of classification these pieces have been placed in the decorative cate- gory to which they would normally belong (usually champ-lev6) under a subdivision indicating that they are unpainted. Archeologists working on MSarajo have collected few specimens of the plainer types of unpainted pottery, probably for the reason that beautifully decorated pieces were so numerous and so readily obtainable, that plainer wares seemed comparatively unimportant. Such examples as we have upon which to base judg- ment frequently display form-traits which are distinct- ly Marajoan but decoration which is scanty and not especially typical of that area. For this latter reason and because of the small number studied,subdivisions have been made for each type of decoration. FHow much smoking was intentional and how much was accidental is difficult to determine, especially with respect to sherds. Because it is probable that relief was normal to the decoration of these wares, no subdivision has been made for it in the engraved and chantp-leve categories. No pieces appeared in the col- lections studied which were decorated with relief alone. NMonochrome wares are rare, and what may be nor- mial to them is therefore uncertain; accordingly, a subdivision has been allowed for modeling. Throughout the classification surface decoration has been designated by the following symbols: U for unpainted; S for smoked; UM for unincised mono- chrome; PE for painted and engraved; CL for champ- leve; Di for dichrome; Po for polychrome; N for wares decorated for negative effect; x for wares which were engraved before they were painted; T for technique. To indicate frequency within the various classifi- cations, the following symbols have been used; C for common; R for rare; VR for very rare. No record of the number of pieces examined was kept; therefore these symbols represent the relative and impressionistic rather than the actual frequency. However, with two exceptions (U-E and PE-I-1) examples or an example of each ware encountered in the 5,000 or more pieces studied hag been included in this classification. On this basis, C represents a ware which appeared with frequency in all, or almost all, the larger collections; R refers to a ware which appeared a few times in more than one collection - in other words the ware was readily recognizable; VR signifies that the ware ap- peared only once or twice in the combined collections and sometimes the example was only a sherd. These isolated pieces have been given consideration be- cause they represent fine wares of which there is possibility of finding more in future excavations, also because other specimens of these wares may appear in collections yet unstudied. Further indication of the relative prominence and importance of the various wares may be gleaned from the amount of attention, descriptive and illustrative, which has been devoted to them in this study - in other words an attempt has been made to suggest, as far as possible, the actual Marajoan archeological situation as presented in the combined collections considered.</page><page sequence="27">286 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. In preparing the classification2 which follows an effort has been made to devise a system which would be expansible. The impression one gets from studying the great variety of Marajo techniques and color com- binations is that, of a surety, many beautiful wares of the island still remain buried and unknown. It is hoped, therefore, that this classification will allow both for the expansion of its limited divisions and provide for the inclusion of new ones. The "Outline of Classification," including ware- symbols, reference to plates, reverse surface decora- tion and frequency, is an attempt to summarize briefly the more detailed description in the "Stylistic Analy- sis" which follows.

In reality, many of them were probably unfinished pieces to which the paint had not yet been applied. Among them also, undoubtedly, are pieces from which the paint has been removed owing to long burial in soil which is water-soaked the greater part of the year. Still another possibility may account for the lack of paint on some pieces. Today, when a M9arajo cowboy finds a serviceable vessel, he usually subjects it to a thorough scrubbing to remove the "Indian" from it. This is partly for practical, but partly also for super- stitious reasons. Many originally beautiful pieces have been ruined in this way. The ancient Marajoans decorated their pottery quite lavishly, often with more than one type of ornamenta- tion. It may, therefore, be assumed that only the coarser household wares were entirely unpainted in their finished state. U-A WARES WITH NO DECORATION Type I. Globular Jars A. Jars with Flat Bottoms and Broad Necks 1. P1. 7-d. Rim out-rolled. Yellow-red paste. B. Jars with Flat Bottoms and Short Necks 1. P1. 7-f. This jar has a flattened globular body, the rim is out-turned, flattened on top. Yellow paste. C. Jars with Round Bottoms and Broad Necks 1. P1. 10-a. This jar has a median ridge around the body and a neck which slopes in slightly toward the mouth. The rim is unusual for Marajo-, consist- ing of a double bevel on the outside of the neck forming a triangle in cross-section. The junc- ture of the rim with the neck is also angular. D. Jars with Round Bottoms and Medium Necks 1. P1 7-h. Roughly finished. Out-rolled rim. Type IL Jars Which Round Out from Flat Base to Shoulder A. Jars Circular at the Shoulder</page><page sequence="30">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 289 1. P1. 7-g. Broad neck. The rim is rounded on the out- side, beveled on the inside. B. Jars Elliptical at the Shoulder. 1. P1. 12-e. Rim merely flattened on outer edge. Jars which are circular at the base and elliptical at the shoulder are not uncommon in Marajo wares. Type III. Cylindroid Vessels A. Vessels with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 8-c. The sides of this pot are almost perpendicu- lar. No independent rim. There is a hole in one side only 2 cm. below the mouth. Rough red paste. Rare. Type IV. Spouted Vessels A. Gourd-Shaped Vessels 1. P1. 8-e. Round bottom. Broken spout. Red paste. Rare. Type V. Crescent-Based Vessels One of the characteristics of Amazonian pot- tery, of both Marajo and Tapajo, is figurines of a peculiar type. These figurines are seated, the hands resting on the hips, though in Marajo the arms are often abbreviated to mere stubs; no feet are indicated; the knees are either pointed or rounded. When turned upside down, the base of these figurines is crescentic in form. A. Pots Resembling Lower Part of Crescent-Based Figurine 1. P1. 8-d. Conforms perfectly to lower part of the cres- cent-based figurine. B. Pots Resembling Entire Crescent-Based Figu- rine 1. P1 12-f. This little pot is similar to many of the Marajo6 crescent-based figurines. It is unusual in that it has three toes at the tips of the cres- cent. The navel, chin, and eyes are represented; the latter are rather protuberant. Type VI. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section Vessels with a truncated conoidal lower section are common in Marajo archeology and are found in all wares. Their form suggests that they might have been designed to be placed in a slightly excavated spot for good stabilization; however, many of them are decorated all the way to the base which rather refutes such an idea. Usually the line between the greatest diameter of the body proper and the bottom of the pot curves gently inward, making a graceful profile; occasionally, it curves outward, but it is almost never straight. A. Bottle-Shaped Jars 1. P1. 12-d. Fine jar with graceful in-curved neck and out-curved rim. 2. Pl. 11-c. Jar with in-curving conoidal lower section. B. Low, Broad-Mouthed Vessels 1. Pls. 10-c and 12-b. Vessels in which the surface between the greatest diameter of the body and the base is out-curved. Yellow-red paste. 2. P1. 12-a. Vessel in which the surface between the greatest diameter of the body and the base is in-curved. Coarse red paste. C. Tall, Broad-Mouthed Vessels 1. P1. 11-a. A vessel in which the surface between the greatest diameter of the body and the base is in-curved. Yellow paste. 2. PI. 11-b. A vessel in which the surface between the greatest diameter of the body and the base is out-curved. Yellow paste. D. Bowls The height of the truncated conoidal base section varies from a few centimeters to half the height of the vessel. In some cases the line of demarcation between the sides and conoidal section is scarcely discernible on the outside but distinct on the inside. 1. P1. 9-b. Vessel in which the truncated conoidal sec- tion is low. 2. P1. 9-c. Vessel in which the truncated conoidal sec- tion is high. 3. P1. 9-d. Vessel in which there is only slight evi- dence of the juncture of the conoidal section and the sides on the outside of the vessel, but clear indication on the inside. 4. P1. 9-a. A large bowl the entire body of which is fun- damentally truncated conoidal in form. The upper section forms a graceful inward curve between the shoulder and the rim. E. Superimposed Forms with a Scalloped Profile 1. P1. 11-e. The scalloped profile is common in Ama- zonian pottery, but is more subtle and highly developed in Tapajo than in Marajo wares. The origin of this profile is probably the household custom of piling pots (see pl. i1-d). In the present case the design seems to be based upon</page><page sequence="31">290 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF NMARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. a handled jar sitting within a bowl having a truncated conoidal lower section. Type VII. ''Pot Stands" A. Stools with a Hole in the Top 1. Pl. 25-d. "Pot stands" of the stool type are common in Marajo wares. The University Museum has seventeen of them, ranging in diameter across the top from 12.5 to 20 cm., and, in height, from 5 to 9 cm. One or two are crudely made but, in the main, they are carefully fashioned and usually decorated. All have hollow, slightly flaring, annular supports. This one has a hole in the top. B. Cylindroid "Pot Stands" 1. P1. 8-a. A tall form with out-turned rim and a slight lip on one side. 2. P1. 8-b. A small form, flat on top and definitely lipped on one side. 3. Alberto Torres, 1940, pl. 47. Miss Alberto Torres shows three pottery supports, more cylindrical than 1 and 2, with out-flaring rims, apparently slightly lipped, and with holes at mid-height. The author states that almost identical pottery supports are in use to- day by Indian tribes of the Rio Negro.3 U-B WARES ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT Type I. Globular Jars with Short Necks A. Jars with Round Bottoms 1. Pl. 13-a. A slightly flattened globular form decorated with crude long and short-line engraving. Yel- low-red paste. B. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. Pl. 13-b. Decorated with crude, more or less perpen- dicular, lines. Yellow-red paste. Type II. Cylindroid Jars A. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. Pl. 13-c. A tall vessel decorated with what seems to be a crude imitation of the engraving technique common on white ware. May be an unfinished piece. 2. Pl. 13-d. A low vessel having the same type of deco- ration as c. Type III. Superimposed Forms with a Scalloped Profile A. Jars with Round Bottoms 1. Pl. ii-d. 3 Alberto Torres, 1940: XIV. In this case the profile is based upon two similar bowls, one larger than the other, the smaller resting in the mouth of the larger. Type IV. Globular Pots with Broad Mouths A. Pots with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 4-e. A vessel decorated with vertical lines above which there is a series of pits which encircles the vessel. Similar decoration appears in the Greater Antilles, but is most uncommon in Mara j o. Type V. Vessels Designed for Suspension (?) A. Globular Pots 1. P1. 5-e. An interesting little piece, the perforations on the sides forming the eyes of an anthropo- morphic figure. The bottom (not shown) is deco- rated with a Helvetian cross between the arms of which are small engraved geometrical figures. B. Cylindroid Pots 1. P1. 5-d. A little vessel with a round bottom. Deco- rated around the sides with a simple fret de- sign, on the bottom with a Helvetian cross be- tween the arms of which are small engraved geometrical figures. Type. VI. Rattles (Maracas) A. Anthropomorphic Forms 1. P1. 4-a and b. This piece is typically Marajoan in that the decoration on opposite sides is different. In this case it appears to suggest a male and a female figure. Small anthropomorphic forms in the painted wares also not infrequently con- tain pellets. U-C WARES DECORATED WITH MODELING Type I. Flat-Bottomed Dishes A. Dishes with Three Zoomorphic Figures on the Rim 1. P1. 7-a. A dish with three hollow zoomorphic figures on the rim. The figures have an applique' strip down the back to indicate vertebrae. That this piece was designed for suspension is suggested by the holes in the side of each figure. 2. P1. 7-c. A dish with three vitamorphic figures on the rim. These consist of a stylized head and four out-curving supports, possibly suggesting the front and back of the trunk and two arms. Seem- ingly designed for suspension.</page><page sequence="32">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 291 Type II. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Broad-Mouthed Vessels 1. P1. 10-b. The lower section is slightly conoidal. The body is decorated on one side only by a scroll in relief with a knob on upper end. No structur- ally independent rim. 2. P1. 12-g, i. The lower section is sharply conoidal. The most interesting feature of this vessel is that the designs on opposing sides are different. It frequently happens in Marajo that the designs on all four sides of a piece are different. In this case only two sides are decorated. B. Igagabas or Water jars 1. P1. IO-d. This jar flares slightly at the mouth; the rim is out-curved; the body is decorated on one side only with a scroll in relief having a knob with indentations at the end. Jars of this general form are common in Mara- j6 and appear in almost all wares. Hlartt de- scribes them as being doubly conical; he says: Estas urnas consistem em dous cones trun- cados, ocos, unidos pelas bases, sendo o cone de cima cerca de tres vezes mais alto que o de baixo e aberto, formando a bocca da urna, emquanto o cone inferior e fechado por um disco que forma a base da urna. 4 In Brazil, these jars are usually referred to as iga;abas, a Tup word meaning "water pot."5 They were frequently used for burial urns. Type III. Figutrines A. Crescent-Based Figurines 1. P1. 6-f. A figurine of coarse red clay, typically Mara- joan, having raised knees and stub-like, arms. The toes are indicated. In contrast to the cres- cent-based forms of Santarem, which are usually pointed at the extremities of the crescent, those of Marajo are typically rounded, owing to the fact that the knees are clearly indicated. Some figurines in this general group were apparently intended to be phalliform. Similar figurine-forms from the Mississippi Valley often show a dou- bling under of the legs, and feet pressed against the buttocks. Such details did not appear in any Marajo collection studied. 2. P1. 6-a. A crude piece without arms. It feels as if it might be almost solid. The head is somewhat bird-like but a navel is indicated. There is a slight indication of feet. Rare. 4Hlartt, 1885: 41. Sldem., 1871: 261. Type IV. Rattles A. Crescent-Based Rattles 1. P1. 6-b. An anthropomorphic figure with eyes of the coffee-bean type. One arm is missing. Has a hole in the base. B. Rattles with a Circular Base 1. P1. 6-c. Feet are slightly indicated. Ears are normally placed and, in addition, there are two little pro- tuberances on the top of the head. No hole in in the base. U-D WARES DECORATED WITH MODELING AND EN- GRAVING FOR LINE EFFECT Type I. Globutlar Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 7-e. A bowl decorated with applique strips in- dented horizontally. Diagonal engraved lines fill the intervening spaces. Type II. Ovoid Jars A. Jars with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 14-d. Engraved with a straight-line and curvilinear design. Small out-turning rim. Geometrical de- sign in low relief on one shoulder. Shape un- usual for Marajo. Red paste. Type III. "Pot Stands" A. Stools with Solid Tops 1. Pl. 25-e. This stool is decorated back and front with a face in relief; the two faces are identical in design. Between the faces on either side is a knob surrounded by concentric circles and rectilinear designs. The top is covered with simple straight-line engraving. Type IV. Flat-Bottomed Dishes with Three Zoo- morphic Figures on the Rim A. See Alberto Torres, 1940: pI. 49 This is a fine piece, similar in form to pl. 7-c, but more elaborate. The heads on the figures are grotesque and decorated with incised scrolls. Type V. Tall Jars A. Jars with a Bulbous Middle Section 1. P1. 20-a. A very unusual piece, suggesting somewhat the bulbous-necked bottles of the Tapajo. Type VI. Sherds A. Adornos 1. P1. 4-d.</page><page sequence="33">292 PALMATARY: THiE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PIIIL. SOC. A zoomorphic head of light red paste.

An unslipped rim and body fragment, deco- rated by horizontal corrugations across the body and by finger impressions on the rim. Both cor- rugation and finger impressions are very rare on M ara j 6. U-G GREY-BLUE WARES Type I. Vessels Designed for Suspension A. Globular Vessels 1. Pl. 5-c. A pot decorated with a toothed scroll and the cross-in-medallion motif. B. Pear-Shaped Vessels 1. P1. 4-f. A miniature vessel engraved in a zoomorphic design featuring the cross-in-medallion motif. Modeled extensions in handle position. Two holes on either side of the mouth, possibly for suspension. Type II. Globular Vessels with Lateral fleads A. Vessels with Round Bottoms 1. Pl. 5-a. Pots of this general design are common in the painted wares and, in two or three of them, pig- ment has been found. Usually they are perforated near the mouth for suspension, or possibly for decoration with feathers; this one is not so per- forated. SMOKED WARES Some of the finest pieces of the painted wares are marred by smoked patches, but whether or not the ancient Marajoans intentionally produced smoked wares is as yet an open question; the number of pieces which show darkening and no paint are few, and the evidence they present is inconclusive. S-A WARES WITH NO DECORATION Type I. Bottles A. Bottles with Round Bottoms 1. Pl. 12-c. Made of red paste discolored by smoke. Han- dled. A rare form. A Marajo cowboy found this ancient piece, put a thong through its handles and used it for a water bottle. S-B WARES ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT Type I. Globular Jars A. Jars with a Short Neck 1. Pl. 47-d. A type more or less common on Marajo. The body is decorated with fluting and a simple di- agonal straight-line design in engraving. The neck is covered with closely spaced vertical, engraved lines. 2. P1. 20-b. A small jar decorated with a face in relief. It is unusual in that it has four handles. Type II. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 36-d. A sherd decorated with a sigmoid scroll and modeling just below the rim. Undecorated on the ins ide. 2. P1. 36-g. A sherd of red ware finely engraved and dar- kened by smoke. Undecorated on the inside. S-C WARES ENGRAVED FOR NEGATIVE EFFECT, FIELD HATCHED Type I. Cylindroid Vessels, Bulbous at the Base A. Jars in which the Body and Neck Merge 1. P1. 41-k. A small handled jar two sides of which are decorated with engraving for negative effect, a scroll in relief partially surrounding the design on either side. This general form is conspicuous in Marajo pottery. Sometimes the lower section of the pot is distinct from the cylindroid neck; sometimes, as in this case, the two sections are gently merged. Type II. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 40-d. Sherd of the side of a shallow bowl. No indi- cation of paint on either side. S-D WARES ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT AND RE- TRACED IN WHITE Type I. Low, Broad-Mouthed Pots A. Pots with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 14-a. A small pot beautifully decorated with a re- peated design, possibly a snake-head motif. The paste is red darkened by heat. The rim is smooth and flat on its upper surface but slightly notched on its outer edge. This piece is unusual because of its continuous design. The engraving seems to have been retraced with white paint. Rare.</page><page sequence="34">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 293 Type II. Sherds A. Body Sherds 1. P1. 36-i. This piece is somewhat problematical, it not being quite clear whether all its dark color is due to smoke. The engraved lines are retraced with white and a very shallow excavation in tri- angular effect is also painted white. Very rare. S-E WARES ENGRAVED FOR NEGATIVE EFFECT, HATCHED FIELD RETOUCI-IED WITH WHITE Type I. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 36-f. This piece gives the effect of carving but the parallel striations of the field are clearly de- fined and little below the plane of the main de- sign; the white retouching is thin. Undecorated on the inside. Very rare. S-F WARES 1)ECORATED WITH CLAMP-LEVE Type I. Vessels Designed for Suspension (?) A. Pear-Shaped Vessels 1. P1. 42-a. Has holes in the neck. Possibly a pigment pot. Decorated on the sides with conventional- ized vitamorphic forms in relief. The front and back are ornamented with vitamorphic designs and the cross-in-medallion motif. UNINCISED MONOCHROME WARES UM-A WARES PAINTED WHITE Type I. Personal Ornaments A. Tangas 1. Not illustrated. In the University Museum's collection there are one or two tangas decorated only with a thin coat of white paint on both sides. Type II. Figurines A. Crescent-Based Figurines 1. P1. 100-a. Only rarely does a Marajo6 figurine have no decoration other than white paint. Type III. Miniature Pottery A. Globular Vessels 1. P1. 4-c. Occasionally a miniature piece is decorated only with white paint. In this case the notation which accompanied the photograph stated that the vessel was "covered with grey-white clay." UM-B WARES PAINTED RED Type I. Personal Ornaments A. Tangas 1. P1. 104-f. Small, and sometimes large, tangas painted red are not uncommon in NMarajo6 collections. Type II. 111iscellaneous Vessels A. Miniature Pottery 1. Not illustrated. Occasionally a miniature piece is found roughly daubed with red paint. UM-B-1 WARES PAINTED RED WITH APPIIQUED DECORATION Type I. Jars with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Globular Jars with a Short Neck 1. P1. 12-h. Unusual in that, when seen in profile, the line between the base and the upper extremity of the conoidal section is practically straight; usually this profile is either in-curved or out-curved. There is no independent rim, merely a flattening of the upper extremity of the neck. An applique strip decorated with indentations surrounds the base of the neck. The outside of the entire jar had apparently been covered with red paint; there are no traces of paint on the inside. UM-C WARES PAINTED BLACK Type I. Figurines A. Crescent-Based Figurines 1. P1. 79-c and d. Seemingly this piece is made of clay which has been covered with a black substance which penetrated rather deeply below the surface and the whole baked very hard. The piece is in no sense typically Marajoan, the eye form and the position of the hands suggest the Greater An- tilles,6 while the peculiar support for the elbows occasionally appears in Venezuela.7 PAINTED AND ENGRAVED WARES The white engraved wares have been chosen to succeed the unpainted wares and the unincised mono- chrome wares as possibly the least complicated in form and ornamentation of all the important Marajo wares. In reality, however, none of the decorated wares can be said to be simple. Superficially observed white engraved pieces give the impression of sim- plicity, but examination shows them to be not only skilfully made but of rather unique decoration. In NMarajo design there is frequently an element of independence, a disregard of the expected. This characteristic is common in the white engraved wares. For instance, two knobs may appear on one side of a 6 Palmatary, 1939: fig. 38-a. 7Requena, 1932: 131.</page><page sequence="35">294 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. rim, not handles, just ornament, with nothing on the other side nor anywhere else which seems to be re- lated to them; also, decorative elements on the same vessel are often irregular in number - there may be two on one side and three on the other. Yet, somehow, the ultimate product is usually interesting and often pleasing. The white engraved wares fall into two general classifications: wares which were painted before they were engraved, and wares which were engraved before they were painted. Specimens of the latter group are rare. Within the first group there are two types of en- graving. One type is that accomplished by a sharp instrument which cut through to the natural background of the vessel. After a period dust or soot settled in the engraved lines, giving a black-and-white effect to the decoration; striking examples are plates 17-a and 24-c. A much more rarely employed technique was to use a heavy wash on the outside of the vessel and then to engrave partially through it; an example of this method may be seen on plate 37-i. Sometimes the two types of engraving were used on the same vessel; an instance is plate 25-a. Because both the partially and completely incised methods are occasionally used on the same pot, no attempt has been made in the ensuing analysis to classify the pieces on the basis of the type of en- graving employed. While the large proportion of pieces which make up the white engraved group have no decoration other than that implied by such classification, a certain amount of modeling is not uncommonly encountered. Because these types of decoration are not restricted to any particular pottery form, nor associated withi any specific engraved design, no attempt has been made to subdivide the major classification to emphasize these traits; instead, note has been made of this extra ornamentation in the descriptive analysis of the pieces concerned. PE-A-1 WARES PAINTED WHITE AND ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT WITHOUT RETRACING Type I. Shallow Vessels A. Elliptical Dishes 1. P1. 28-e. A small dish, rather ellipitical in form, un- painted on the outside, decorated with fine en- graving on the inside. Fairly common. 2. P1. 15-c. A dish decorated with a modeled bird head on one corner and, near the adjacent corner, a knob-like protuberance, possibly in simulation of a foot. Scroll and rectilinear design on the inside; band of engraving in rectilinear design below the rim on the outside. General form and design appear in several sizes. 3. P1. 28-c. A small, flat-bottomed dish, finely engraved on the outside with two rows of simple scrolls. The inside is painted in two tones of red-brown on a background of cream. The design is posi- tive in effect and contains a divisional unit with a conventionalized face on either side, the upper part of the faces conforming to the middle or broad part of the dish, the chins to the narrower ends. The stiggestion of a double head or a dou- ble body is common in Marajo wares of all kinds. B. Circular Disihes 1. P1. 15-a. A dish with a circular, flat bottom from which the sides slope upward at a rather sharp angle. The sides thicken toward the rim which is smoothly rounded. Unpainted on the outside. The inside is decorated with two parallel engraved lines around the rim and four scrolls around a central scroll, with scrolls and part-scrolls in between the main ones. General form and de- sign fairly common. 2. P1. 24-c. A dish of rough red paste, unpainted on the outside. The inside is decorated with five inter- locking scrolls, the central one being the small- est. The larger scrolls are in pairs, two angular, two round. This dish is interesting in that it illustrates the Marajo characteristic of non-duplication in the working out of designs - the two angular scrolls are not exactly alike, neither are the intervening circular ones. C. Triangular Dishes 1. P1. 25-b. Triangular dish with a circular, flat, bottom. From the base the dish slopes gently upward and outward and curves in at the rim to form a three- sided mouth. A vitarnorphic head decorates one angle, fin-like extensions decorate each of the other two. The inside had been painted white and decorated with a scroll design. D. Kidney-Shaped Dishes 1. P1. 16-h. On the rim is a vitamorphic in-turned head; two protuberances on the opposite side probably simulate feet. Roughly engraved on the under side. General type not common. 2. P1. 16-e. Shows the under side of a slightly kidney- shaped dish. Painted white on the inside. An- thropomorphic heads, facing inward, in handle position. Unusual for the beautiful deep en- graving on the under side in what appears to be a reptilian design, the vertebrae crossing the dish from handle to handle. 3. P1. 16-a. On the outside, the bottom is decorated with</page><page sequence="36">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 295 a series of concentric circles; the gently sloping sides are covered with two reptilian designs and two interlocking scroll motifs. The inside is decorated with a geometrical design in dark brown and white. Two knobs on either side in handle position. 4. P1. 70-a. There are four of these kidney-shaped dishes in the collection at the University Mluseum; in some the form is more pronounced than in others. The rim of this piece is oval on the outside, flat on the inside, forming a rather abrupt juncture with the body of the bowl. Decorated on the out- side with engraving, on the inside with a red geometrical design on a white background. E. Shell-Shaped Dishes 1. P1. 31-a and b. A small dish finely engraved on the outside with an interlocking scroll design. The inside is decorated with a geometrical design in positive effect. Colors dark brown on a cream background. Type II. Deeper Vessels A. Boat-Shaped Vessels 1. P1. 17-b. A large dish finely engraved with scrolls, four on either end, two on either side, separated by vertical lines. The rim is decorated with scrolls and modeling. An unusual and beautiful piece. B. Circular Flat-Bottomed Dishes 1. P1. 14-b. The sides of this dish slope outward from base to mouth. The rim is hollow. Rims of this type are common in both Tapajo and Marajo pot- tery, but this is the only piece I have seen which has its complete rim; the fragment shown in the illustration fits perfectly into the attached portion. As far as can be discerned the rim was fired without an aperture. Type III. Globular Jars A. Jars with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 16-g. A jar decorated by vertical bands in relief, three on two sides, two on each of the alternate sides. The spaces between the strips are deco- rated by designs in straight engraved lines at various angles. 2. P1. 18-d. A jar engraved in a design quite common in Marajo. This consists of a Helvetian cross with- in a medallion; the medallion, in turn, is sur- rounded by two other motifs - a stepped pyra- midal design in thin-line technique, and a simi- lar design in heavy engraving. In the latter case, one side of the pyramid is inverted, giving a peculiar, but interesting, effect. Type IV. Cylindroid Jars Bulbous at the Base Under this general classification there are two more or less distinct groups: A, those in which there is a perceptible demarcation be- tween the body and. the neck of the jar; B, those in which the body and the neck seem to merge. Similar forms are found also in wares engraved in negative effect and those decorated with c hamp -leve. A. Jars in which the Bodies and Necks are Distinct 1. P1. 17-a. An unusual piece as far as pattern is con- cerned; the design is evenly and beautifully distributed over the entire body of the jar. 2. P1. 25-a. A jar with an anthropomorphic design on the neck.The neck is flattened on the sides, making its mouth somewhat elliptical in form. The eye- brows meet at the base of the nose, a trait com- mon in Marajo design. The eyes are oval and protuberant, the mouth button-like. The mouth of this jar is peaked over the face and finished by a rim flattened on the top and rounded on the outside. The side of the neck is decorated by a band in relief with a loop on the upper part and a hand-like design on the lower part. An extension of the band part way down suggests an ear. The body and neck are covered with scroll engraving. General design unusual. B. Jars on which the Bodies and Necks are Merged 1. P1. 18-a, c; pl. 23-a. Jars in the cross-in-medallion and half-in- verted pyramid pattern. Fairly common. Type V. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Broad-Mouthed Vessels 1. P1. 21-b. Probably intended to represent two human beings. Along the line of greatest diameter in four places are groups of five protuberances. In the center of either side of the body is a divi- sional unit consisting of a ring in relief which could be interpreted as a navel below which the vagina is indicated in engraving. Above each divisional unit at the rim is a slight protuber- ance; between these on either side is a series of five protuberances, probably intended to represent fingers and similar to those on the lower part of the vessel, no doubt intended for toes. Painted and engraved all the way to the bottom. The inside seems to have been decorated with scrolls and other geometrical designs in red on a cream background. 2. P1. 21-a. Similar in design to the vessel just described</page><page sequence="37">296 PALMATARY: THIE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. and decorated with protuberances irregular in number - nine on one side at the upper extremity of the conoidal section, eight on the other; four on one side of the rim, ten on the other. The inside shows remnants of a design in red and white. 3. P1. 21-c. This pot has an engraved reptilian design on four sides and a divisional scroll between each unit of the main design. On two sides there is a knob on the line of greatest diameter, on each of the other two sides there are two knobs in the same position. The rim is two-lipped, giving a scalloped effect in profile; it is decorated with two knobs on one side only. TIwo-lipped rims are common in Marajo wares. There is little that is naturalistic in Nlarajo art, most of it is highly conventionalized. This particular reptilian design is common and ap- pears on more than one ware. Often it is two- headed. Its probable inspiration was the jacare' or South American crocodile. B. Igagabas 1. P1. 22-a. This jar has an in-curved conoidal lower section. It is crudely made and lhas what is apparently a finished hole in the base. 2. PI. 22-d. An igagaba whose conoidal lower section is out-curved. The body is decorated on two sides with an engraved stylized zoomorphic form having long, three-toed claws. The heads are represented by scrolls, and a single head on opposite sides serves to connect the bodies of the two animals. The interstices are filled with scrolls. T'ype VI. Effigy Jars A. Bird Effigies 1. P1. 16-b. A jar with flat base. The head is lacking, the two wings indicated. The back is broken so it is not possible to determine its design completely. Form very rare. Type VII. "Pot Stands" A. Stools with a Solid Top 1. Pl. 28-a. A small pottery rest, decorated on the top with engraved scrolls; on the sides with en- graved rectilinear designs. B. Stools with a Hole in the Top 1. Pl. 28-g. Pottery rest decorated with the cross-in- medallion pattern. Type VIII. Four-Lobed Vessels A. Bottle-Shaped Vessels 1. P1. 19-b. An anthropomorphic jar, the head constituting the neck. On the back of the head there are two knobs; the vertebrae are indicated between the back; lobes. On the front lobes the breasts are figured. The central part of eaclh lobe is cov- ered with an interlocking engraved scroll. B. Small Bowls 1. P1. 20-c. Painted white on the outside and decorated with a series of concentric circles on each of its four lobes. Painted red on the inside. Type IX. Figurines A. Antlhropomorphic Figurines 1. P1. 100-i. Small finely engraved piece which seems to have been fired without an aperture. PE-Ax-1 WARES ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT, THEN PAINTED WHITE WITHlCuUT RETRACING Examples of these wares are not common, but such few specimens as I have seen are excellent in both craftmanship and design. Type I. Sherds A. Body sherds 1. P1. 37-g. A sherd with a heavy coat of paint over deep engraving. Painted white on the inside. 2. P1. 37-d. A fragment of the side and bottom of a small pot. The engraving is very delicate. The inside had been painted white. PE-A-2 WARES PAINTED WHITE, ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT, RETRACED, RETOUCHED, OR BOTH WITH RED Under this general classification have been in- cluded wares decorated as follows: 1. White engraved wares which have red decoration on the neck only (pl. 19-d). 2. Wares decorated with fine engraving, some or all of the lines, and some of the intervening spaces, having been retouched with red (pl. 24-b). 3. Wares decorated with a combination of fine and heavy engraving, the heavy engraving only having been filled in with red (pl. 26-a). Vessels of the same general form were frequently decorated in more than one of the above-mentioned techniques; therefore, in these wares, there seems to be no direct correlation between form of vessel and style of decoration.</page><page sequence="38">VOL. 39, Pr. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 297 Type I. Shallow Vessels A. Round Dishes with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 24-b. A dish decorated with a bilateral design of interlocking scrolls, having a central scroll and divisional units between the main sections of the design. The central scroll and the central one in each half are more or less square with rounded corners; the scrolls on either side of these are definitely angular. The fine lines are engraved through to the red paste, giving a red and white effect; the broad lines are retraced with red paint. 2. P1. 31-d. Shallow dish with a finished hole in the cen- ter of the bottom. The decoration is simple straight-line engraving and red quadrangular scrolls. B. Kidney-Shaped Dishes 1. P1. 32-a. A dish painted white on the outside and decorated with engraving. Painted white on the inside and engraved with an interlocking scroll design, one element of which is composed of three parallel finely engraved lines, the other with deep engraving filled in with red. Part of the design is in circular, part in angular, scrolls. Zoomorphic heads rest on the rim in handle position. Type II. Deeper Vessels A. Deep Dishes with Flat Bottoms 1. P 1. 24-a. A handsome deep bowl. On its long diameter its greatest height is 19 cm.; this is gradually reduced by a graceful curving at the rim to 13 cm. on its short diameter. There are two ex- tensions decorated to represent eyes at the edge of the rim on one side only. These one-sided decorations are characteristic of Marajo6 design. 2. P1. 28-f. A small dish which had been painted red on the inside. On the outside the dish is engraved in the stepped pyramidal design in three tiers. A Helvetian cross, painted red and centered in an engraved medallion, fills the spaces within each of the lowest pyramidal tiers. Apparently a band of red had encircled the vessel just a- bove its base. 3. P1. 48-a. A small dish delicately decorated with fine- and-broad-instrument engraving, the broad lines having been retraced with red. Painted white on the ins ide. 4. P1. 16-f. A small dish beautifully decorated on the outside with a red and white concentric design. Polychrome on the inside, see pl. 69-a. B. Deep Dishes with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 21-d. A deep bowl which is slightly elliptical in form. Its bottom is covered with one continuous, more or less rectangular, interlocking scroll. This scroll consists of one unit of deep en- graving inlaid in red, and an interlocking unit of two fine engraved lines. The body of the ves- sel is divided into two broad panels and two narrow ones. The broad panels are decorated with scroll designs but have dissimilar patterns. The panel shown in the illustration is sur- rounded by a band in relief and decorated by an interlocking sigmoid design retraced with red. There is a knob in the center of the design and two in the lower center. The other panels seem to have had three knobs in the lower center. The rim is two-lipped. Decoration on inside indeter- minable. Type III. Globular Jars A. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 18-b. A white jar with a red neck. An inverted face in relief, painted dark red with a white stripe down the middle, is the central ornament on two sides of the jar. Above this face, also in relief and also painted red, is what seems to have been intended to represent a pair of insect wings. Below the face are traces of another dark-colored ornament. Two rows of interlocking scrolls, the upper one of large scrolls, the lower of small ones, cover the remainder of the body of the jar. The spaces between the scrolls are covered with a rectangular design in double- line engraving. An unusual piece. 2. P1. 23-e. A jar in the angular S pattern. This all-over design is common in Marajo red and white wares and is employed on some of the best pieces. The design consists of a series of connected S units in fine engraving, and within each there is an isolated S in much deeper engraving filled in with red. Jars in this design usually have a red collar. The jar featured is closely related in general form to the truncated conoidal types; it lacks, however, the distinctive lower section which characterizes the latter group. 3. P1. 82-c. A few pieces found in Marajo have this pe- culiar red and white design. It is in part related to the angular S all-over design in that it has the finely engraved enclosure element for the main red motif. The latter, however, only oc- casionally suggests a true S; more often it is made up of seemingly irresponsible elongated angular forms to which are frequently attached</page><page sequence="39">298 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. a motif common in the champ-leve and painted wares - that of the "three-fingered hand." B. Jars with an Annular Support 1. P1. 16-d. The top of this jar is gone; the body is deco- rated with scroll engraving and red paint. This piece is unusual for this ware in that it rests upon a support, seemingly an out-flaring an- nular base. This type of base is often seen in the champ-leve and polychrome wares but rarely in the engraved wares. Type IV. Globular Bowls A. Bowls with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 41-f. An avian form in low relief with outstretched wings decorates the rim and the shoulders. This seems to have been colored red originally. The remainder of the decoration is in line engraving which completes the relief design. The inside had been painted white. Type V. Four-Shouldered Vessels A. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 19-d. A small jar, circular at the base but having one shoulder dimension longer than the other. The two shoulders on the longer dimension are higher than the other two. The lobes on the shorter dimension are decorated by an engraved medallion of four segments in the center of which is a face in relief; its eyes are protuber- ant, its nose long. The other lobes are deco- with engraved scrolls. The lower part of the body is unpainted. The neck is deeply engraved and shows traces of red inlay; over the long axis it is decorated by two faces in contra- position making a square design of great beauty. A rarely fine piece. 2. P1. 28-k. A large jar with long-nosed upside-down faces on two shoulders; the other two and the greater part of the body of the jar seem to have been covered by fine engraving over white paint. The lower part of the body had been painted red. The neck is handsomely carved, presumably for red inlay, but little color is at present dis- cernible. A very fine piece. The technique is so close to the jar just described that one could easily imagine them to have been made by the same potter. 3. P1. 18-e. A four-lobed jar painted red up to the lobes. Two lobes are decorated by a long-nosed face in relief placed upside down; the other two are covered with interlocking engraved scrolls. The neck is missing. Type VI. Vessels of Truncated Conoidal Form A. Shallow Vessels 1. P1. 15-d. Large dishes of this general form are common in both the red and white engraved wares and in the champ-leve wares. Strictly speaking, the body of the dish is a truncated cone and the rim is vertical. The depth of these dishes varies considerably - in some cases the vessel is so shallow that the vertical rim is the real retain- ing element; in other cases the truncated conoi- dal body reaches a depth of only five to six centimeters exclusive of the vertical rirp. The dish featured has a finished hole in the bottom which suggests that it may have been especially designed for funerary purposes; how- ever, in the collection at the University NMuseum, there are other dishes of this type the bottoms of which are unpunctured. The general form of these vessels would have nmade them service- able as lids for some of the larger urns or as vessels for the preparation of meal. It is doubtful that many pieces were definite- ly designed for lids. In his notes Dr. Farabee speaks frequently of having found urns covered with other vessels, but we do not know which pieces were the covers. His photographs, how- ever, seem to indicate that almost any kind of vessel, suitable in size and shape, was used to cover a burial jar. Type VII. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Broad-Mouthed Vessels 1. P1. 33-a. Hartt says this vessel is circular and has a height of 20 cm. and a breadth of 36 cm. He describes it as follows: ..A ornamentagao consiste em repetiqoes de uma figura particular formada de linhas gravadas sem tinta e espagos mais largos cortados no barro e pintados de vermelho. Considerado com um todo, pode-se comparar a ornamentagao desta urna com um circulo de funis collocados um dentro do outro. 8 2. Pl. 33-b. Hartt9 says that this jar is elliptical, having mouth diameters of 42 and 33 cm., and a height of 33 cm. The design is a combination of four commonly employed Marajo6 motifs: the cross-in- medallion, the enclosing S, the half pyramid, and the partial elliptical frame. The design on this pot is but one of many examples of the ability of the ancient Marajo potter to break up motifs, then to recombine them into patterns almost infinite in variety. The decoration on the inside is not described. 8 Hartt, 1885: 43 et seq. 9Ibid.: 44.</page><page sequence="40">VOL. 39, PT. 3,1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 299 B. Igagabas 1. P1. 29-a, b, d. Three large jars in the angular S pattern. This design was described under Type III, A-2. Inside painted red part way. 2. P1. 23-f. A large jar decorated with a variation of the angular S motif. This design consists of an en- closing all-over angular S pattern in very fine engraving, but the red S is not as sharply tri- angular at the tips as in the pure form of the motif; instead, its extremities are embellished by a series of more or less triangular exten- sions which soften the general effect of the motif. This and other modifications of the S motif are fairly common. 3. P1. 29-c. A large jar which combines the cross-in- medallion, the partial elliptical frame, the half- pyramid, and the enclosing S motifs. The same motifs were used on plate 33-b, but the final effect is different owing to the fact that, on the vessel in the Museu Nacional, red was used on the cross-in-medallion motif, while on this one the cross is merely engraved. 4. P1. 33-c. Hartt points out that the main motif on this piece is a double head, one half right side up, the other upside down, one pair of eyes and one nose serving for both. Two heads in contra- position are common in Marajo design. The an- gular S, in an all-over pattern, is used as the enclosing unit for the double-headed motif. In describing this piece Hartt says: The surface of the upper part of the jar is care- fully smoothed and covered with a coat of fine whitish clay and is ornamented with engraved de- signs colored red. 10 At the American Museum of Natural History there are some large fragments of a pot in this engraved design but they are entirely white. Thus this motif, like many others, was probably reproduced in several variations. 5. P1. 33 d. This is one of those capriciously designed pieces occasionally seen in Marajo wares. The engraved angular S enclosing pattern serves as a framework for variations, in red, of the angular S and hand motifs. C. Anthropomorphic Urns 1. P1. 22-c. The back view of a large, badly damaged urn. The truncated lower section is unpainted; the main portion of the body is painted white and engraved; the vertebral column is indicated by a long indentation and red paint; the buttocks are '0Ibid.: 41. represented by protuberances and decorated by red lines. The sex is female. There is a hole in the bottom. 2. P1. 22-b. A little urn figured by Barbosa Rodrigues. It is typically Mlarajoan but is especially interest- ing because of the small zoomorphic heads in arm position and also because of the protruding feet. 11 3. Pl. 34-a and b. Hartt 12 says this very fine urn was found on Pacoval by Derby. It was resting inside a large, round, unornamented jar, evidently de- signed to protect it. He states further that the urn was filled with white sand and clay totally dissimilar from the soil in which the outer pot was buried. In the bottom of the urn were broken bones and between the two vessels, were pieces of a tanga. Hartt mentions the fact that the cus- tom of placing an ornamented funerary vessel within a jar of coarser ware was practiced by the Indians of Georgia. This urn is of especially fine workmanship; an unusual and beautiful feature is the two- headed serpent in red and white relief appliqued on the sides in a sigmoid design. Type VIII. Effigy Bottles A. Anthropomorphic Forms 1. P1. 100-h. White engraved ware retouched with red. The bottom is round and flat. The body is scalloped in profile. The eyes and mouth are protuberant and within circular enclosures. B. Avian Forms 1. P1. 28-d. A delicately engraved bottle in the form of a bird; it has an opening in the head, also in the tail. The opening in the head had apparently been painted red. 2. P1. 28-b. A small bottle, presumably a bird effigy, but the head is gone. The handle is in the tail. The lower portion is a flattened bowl. Similar in form to that described in B - 1. The two pieces have much the same type of decoration. C. Other Vitamorphic Forms 1. P1. 26-a. An intricate bottle composed of a group of vitamorphic forms. The lower part consists of a shallow, flat-bottomed bowl; above this, and rising from its mid-body, are two zoomorphic figures with outstretched arms. On alternate sides are two anthropomorphic figures devel- oping from points higher up and joining arms with the other figures. The neck is supported by "Rodrigues, Estampa XII. 12Hartt, 1 885: 3 1 e t se q.</page><page sequence="41">300 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAjO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

This is the only complete jar of this type I liave seen but, in the Museu Goeldi and also in the American Museum of Natural History, there are several fragments which suggest that they may have belonged to vessels of this or similar type. Type IX. Anthropomorphic Jars A. Jars with Crescentic Bottoms 1. P1. 27-b. A small jar related in general form to the crescent-based figurines commonly found in both MaraIjo and Tapajo pottery. The rim is missing. The body is decorated with engraved scrolls and red paint. B. Jars with Circular Bottoms 1. P1. 27-a. The top of a s mall, beautifully engraved, anthropomorphic jar. The design is characterized by the Helvetian cross in hexagonal medallion; the background between the medallions is filled in with red paint. The body is covered with in- terlocking scrolls. The hands are raised to the mouth, a characteristic of Marajo design, but much more frequently seen in Tapajo pottery. Apparently, the base had been roughly circular. Type X. Cylindroid Jars, Bulbous at the Base A. Jars in which the Bodies and Necks are Distinct 1. P1. 33-e. The designer of this pot has assembled parts and variations of several motifs commonly em- ployed in both the red and white engraved and champ-leve wares. Type XI. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. Pl. 35-f. A fragment of rim deeply engraved and re- traced with red. The inside is undecorated. 2. P1. 39-i. A fragment of a heavy rim. Decorated with deep and broad engraving in the thick white slip. The upper surface of the design was re- touched with red after the engraving. The tech- nique is good, although a few traces of red paint are discernible in the engraved depressions. 3. P1. 35-a. A fragment of a shallow dish decorated with the cross-in-medallion motif in red and white. The reverse side is white and engraved in a rectilinear design retraced in red. 4. P1. 37-f. A rim sherd decorated with a vitamorphic head. On the outside the technique is much the same as that usually found on the buff and brown wares - that is, there is fine engraving in scroll and triangular motifs, and deep blunt- instrument engraving, in this case retraced with red. The inside is covered with a red-brown tex- tile scroll on a white background. There are many gradations in tone between brown and red on NMaraIjo wares, and it is sometimes necessary to make arbitrary decisions. The decoration on this piece is similar to that on the buff and brown sherd (pl. 38-a). B. Body Sherds 1. P1. 35-e. An unusually fine example of the cross-in- medallion motif in which the red coloring is well preserved. The reverse side is painted white. C. Neck Sherds 1. PI. 28-i and j.

An unusual design featuring a white scroll and cross-hatching in the red interstices. The reverse side is decorated with fine engraving and also deep, broad-instrument engraving in a rectilinear and scroll design. PE-A-3 WARES PAINTED WHITE, ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT, THEN RETRACED WITH BLACK Wares painted white and engraved with black re- tracings are rare. Generally speaking, the black and white effect presented by most of the white engraved wares is due to extraneous matter - charcoal and dirt - which has collected in the engraved lines during years of burial. However, in addition to the usual black and white effects due to chance conditions, the Marajoans occasionally definitely applied black paint to an engraved white surface, thus producing a true black and white engraved ware.

The back and front of this jar have substan- tially the same design. The face on the upper portion is typically Marajoan - the eyes are e- longated and protuberant and enclosed in a definite area; the nose and eyebrows meet, form- ing a T; the mouth is button-like. The head and body have been painted a deep cream and deco- rated with fine and deep engraving, the latter cutting through to the light red paste of the jar and adding to the color effect. The urn is fin- ished at the top by a flaring collar painted red. Customarily on these urns the sex is indicated; on this piece it is merely suggested. 2. P1. 23-d. A large anthropomorphic urn, the back and front of which are practically identical. The general style is that of the white engraved wares but the surface coat is nearer yellow than white. The jar appears to have been made of a dark red paste over which a layer of finer and lighter-colored red clay was placed. Over this is a thick surface coating, deep cream in color. With a blunt instrument the design was engraved through the outer coating to the red background. Whether or not the design was ever retraced with red it is impossible to say; it seems proba- ble that the red surface of the jar may have been depended upon to give the desired red-and-cream</page><page sequence="43">302 PALMTATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS.

The workmanship is excellent on all of them. The first covering seems to have been a red slip; over this is a fine cream coat in which the engraving is done. Lines for retracing were made with a broad instrument. Type I. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 37-b. A fragment of the rim and body of a shallow dish.

PE-F-1 WARES PAINTED RED AND ENGRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT WITHOUT RETRACINGS Vessels finished on the outside entirely with red paint and simple line engraving are not common in Marajo wares. Sherds show both light engraving which exposes little or none of the underlying slip, and rather heavy incision which cuts through the painted surface entirely. Type I. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Broad-Mouthed Bowls 1. P1. 23-b. Engraved in a wavy-line and pyramidal design around the body of the vessel. The conoidal sec- tion is decorated with the textile type of scroll. The inside appears to have been covered with a design in red and white. Rare. B. Iga4abas 1. P1. 26-b. This jar is painted dark red and divided into four panels similarly engraved. No trace of con- trasting color is perceptible, but in the corners of the panels there is an area slightly roughened by the engraving tool and left unpainted. Pos- sibly the yellow-red of the natural background was depended upon to produce a contrasting ef- fect with the darker painted surface. Occasional- ly the Marajoans combined painted and unpaint- ed areas to produce decorative effect. Of course this jar may represent an unfinished piece or may have lost part of its colored decoration through long burial in moist soil. Type II. Globular Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 32-e. A bowl decorated with indented strips in re- lief and engraved diagonal lines between the strips. This general style of decoration appears in several wares. Type III. Smaller Vessels A. Dishes with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 41-e. A flat-rimmed dish upon which were original- ly perched three bird-like figures, one of which is now missing. The decoration on the inside is indeterminable, the outside seems to have been red. General type fairly common. Type IV. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 35-rn. The rim and piece of the neck of a pot en- graved in an angular scroll design. The inside is painted white. B. Body Sherds 1. P1. 35-k. A smallI fragment painted red and engraved through to the natural paste foundation. The re- verse side is painted red. 2. P1. 35-h. Piece of a neck painted red and dlecorated with scrolls and the many-fingered-hand motif in fine-line technique. The inner suirface appears to have been left unpainted. PE-Fx-1 WARES ENG(RAVED' FOR LINE EFFECT, THEN PAINTED RED These wares are extremely rare. The sherd des- cribed is the only example in the collections stuIied. Type I. Sherds A. Body Sherds 1. P1. 35-1. A small fragment which was engraved and then painted red. Above the red there is a band of white. Reverse side is unpainted. PE-Fx-l-N WARES ENGRAVED FOR NEGATIVE EF- FECT, T1HEN PAINTED RED WITHOUT RETRACINGS Some of the most delicate of Maraj6 workmanship is found in these wares. T'ne negative effect is produced by covering the field with closely spaced parallel lines produced by an engraving tool. In this technique none of the background is actually removed, the gen- eral plane of the field and that of the negative design is the same. It is normal to find considerable elabo- rate modeling in combination with this technique. Type I. Pear-Shaped Vessels A. Vessels Designed for Suspension 1. P1. 42-b. A small pear-shaped vessel decorated with conventionalized reptilian design in negative effect. Two zoomorphic figures in relief extend down the sides in handle position. Perforations just below the mouth indicate that the pot was intended for use with a cord. Probably a pigment container. Type II. Four-Lobed Vessels A. Vessels Designed for Suspension 1. P1. 43-a. A four-lobed vessel dlecorated with a reptil- ian design in negative effect. It is perforated on either side just below the rim. Two realistic toucan heads serve as handles. Workmanship very fine.

The cast of a jar from the NMuseu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro. B. Anthropomorphic Urns 1. P1. 23-c. A large urn of yellow clay which seems to have been painted red, engraved in line effect and retraced with white. The body of the urn is divided into three vertical sections, two of which are decorated with one large scroll each; the third (figured in the illustration) has anthro- pomorphic decoration, partly engraved and partly in relief. PE-F-3-N PAINTED RED, ENGRAVED FOR NEGATIVE EFFECT, RETRACED WITH WH^ITE Type I. Broad-Mouthed Pots A. Pots which Taper from Mouth to Base 1. P1. 44-b. In general surface effect this piece is quite similar to that illustrated in plate 43-b; the tech- nique is, however, entirely different. This pot has been painted red, engraved, then retouched and retraced with white. The other pot is a red- over-white technique. In decoration, the effect of four panels has been produced by a long band in relief with hand motifs on the ends; this band runs parallel to the rirm on two sides of the jar, then turns at right angles and extends part way down the al- ternate faces. The haridles extend fronm the rim to the center of these relief bands. The panels are decorated with textile scrolls in negative ef- fect and a central button. Type Ir. Globular Bowls A. Bowls Flattened on the Bottom 1. P1. 47-e. A bowl with a face in relief on two sides. There are holes for suspension on alternate sides. Th-ie striations of the field are fairly regular; sorlme white paint remains in these areas. W'hile the original color seems to have been red the firing process has produced a brownish tone. Type III. Shoe-Shaped Vessels A. Vessels with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 48-d. Very delicately engraved for negative ef- fect. The paint on the outside has almnost disap- peared. The inside is white. There is a gro- tesque design over the toe end consisting of hand motifs and nodules. On the bottom is an engraved figure probably representing a two- headed frog. Type IV. Cylindroid Vessels.Bulbous at the Base A. Vessels in which the Neck and Body Merge 1. P1. 49-a and b. A combination of fine engraving in negative effect and modeled design. The piece is rather unusual because in addition to the lower bul- bous section there is another less clearly de- fined just under the neck, giving the jar a beau- tiful line in profile. On two sides of the jar are modeled two- headed crocodilian forms having limbs extended and bent at right angles, two upward and two downward. On the other two sides the suggestion is anthropomorphic. The faces on the neck are made up of typical Marajo6 eyes and noses form- ed by the handles; a central nodule on each anthropomorphic design suggests a navel. The crocodile limbs extended from the adjoining sides and the half crocodilian figures at the bottom of the jar combine to give something of a medallion effect to the central portion. The heads of the crocodiles in profile suggest han- dles. The workmanship on this piece is extremely delicate. The striated background is regularly done and on practically the same plane as the negative design. Some of the white retracing remains. There is a little evidence of white paint inside the flaring collar.</page><page sequence="46">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 305 B. Vessels in which the Neck and the Body are Distinct 1. P1. 41-j. This piece is thus classified, with some res- ervation, from notes not wholly satisfactory from the standpoint of the painted areas. The neck is missing but undoubtedly the complete jar was much the same form as that in plate 43-b. The principal motif is a serpent in low re- lief whose body is coiled to form a scroll. This design appears on two sides. The background areas are nicely striated to hold the white paint which throws the red design into negative ef- fect. This type of jar seems never to have been handled. Type V. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Vessels with an Angular Shoulder 1. P1. 92-a. I saw this vessel only through glass, but it appears to be red with white retracings. Angular shoulders are rare in Marajo but occur occasion- ally on the mainland to the north. There is a face on the neck and the scroll designs on the body apparently were intended to represent a series of faces alternately right side up and up- side down, the division between the two being indicated by a short bar in relief. The knobs in the center of each section represent the noses. Alternate right side up and upside down faces are common motifs in Marajo decoration. Type VI. Shallow Vessels A. Vessels with an Annular Foot 1. P1. 71-a. A beautiful piece, decorated on the inside by a double-headed design having a divisional unit. The interstitial spaces are filled in by fine cross-hatching in dark brown on a white field. Type VII. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 39-k. An elaborate fragment of rim, neck and body. Mr. Junius Bird has analyzed the decorative process of this piece into the following steps: 1. Outside a. Modeling in low relief on neck. b. First slip, a creamy orange inside and out. c. Second slip, white, inside and outside neck. d. Third slip, red over outside of body. e. Thin line incision to emphasize low relief modeling. f. Application of red paint retouch to this incision. g. Intricate scarfed field incising through red slip of body. h. Application of white paint to scarfed areas. 2. Inside a. Dark brown slip over creamy slip. 2. Pl. 36-j. A beautiful piece engraved with a scroll and cross-hatching, retraced with white. Part of the red surface has turned brown in the firing. The inside is white. PE-G-1 WARES PAINTFED RED OVER WHITE, AND ENGRAVED THROUGH TO TI-IE WI-IITE FOR LINE EFFECT Complete pieces in these wares are not common; sherds are more numerous and the workmanship is always good. Type I. Globular Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 7-b. This bowl shows clearly the red-over-white technique since considerable of the outer red coat has worn away, exposing the white slip. The main decoration is a broad band around the middle of the vessel consisting of two rows of faces in contraposition. This motif is common in Marajo design. On the bottom is a face in a medallion. Rare. Type II. Shallow Vessels A. Kidney-Shaped Dishes 1. P1. 47-f. Almost all the red covering has worn away. The sides and bottom are decorated with pits and rather crude straight-line engraving. Three small heads serve as handles. Cream and dark red or brown decoration on the inside. Type III. Globular Urns with a Tapering Neck A. Urns with a Flaring Collar 1. P1. 96-a. The neck appears to have been painted red over white and engraved through to the white in line effect. The colors on the body are at present not determinable. This piece is unusual for a large urn. It is decorated by engraved faces set within the space between two scrolls turning in opposite directions and terminating in a many-fingered hand. The interstitial spaces are filled with stepped pyramidal motifs in en- graved technique. This same design may be seen in polychrome on "b" of this same plate or, to better advantage, on plate 87-a.</page><page sequence="47">306 PALMATARY: IHE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Type IV. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 40-e. A fragment of neck and rim. The rim is en- graved on top. The neck section is decorated with a scroll and straight-line design which shows clearly the underlying white slip. The inside is covered with the white slip. B. Neck Sherds 1. P1. 35-d. A fragment of neck without independent rim, decorated with a fine scroll. This piece clearly shows that a white slip had been put on first and then covered with a coat of red paint. The engraving cut through the red outer covering to the white background. The inside is covered with the white slip. C. Body Sherds 1. P1. 35-j. A fragment fron1 which much of the upper red coat has been lost. This piece figures the paral- lel incisions characteristic of the ladder de- sign. White on reverse side. PE-G-1-N WARES PAINTED RED OVER A WlIITE OR CREAM SLIP AND ENGRAVED THROUGHI TO THE UNDERCOAT IN NEGATIVE EFFECT, FIELD HATCH-IED These wares seem to have been decorated by placing a coat of red paint over a fine and fairly thick white or cream slip, then engraving through to the slip before it had completely hardened. The out- line of the negative design was made with a sharp tool; the striations forming the background were made with a broader instrument. This method served to loosen the red paint, and eventually, through wear or long burial, the bits of paint on the upper surface of the striated areas wore off, producing a red design against a white or cream background. In these wares the upper surface of the field and that of the negative design are on the same plane - that is, the technique employed is engraving and shows none of the striking plane differences characteristic of champ-leve. Type 1. Four-Lobed Vessels A. Vessels Designed for Suspension 1. P1. 42-c. All of the pots of this general type have holes in the neck and three have been found to contain pigment. This one has two vitamorphic heads in handle position and the body is deco- rated by medallions figuring the two-headed jacare (crocodile), a design which appears com- monly in all the decorative techniques. B. Vessels with Cylindroid B ottoms 1. P1. 45-a. A four-lobed vessel featuring the cross-in- medallion motif in relief effect on each lobe. Between the lobes and under the crosses are arm and hand motifs. The cylindroid lower sec- tion is decorated with a simple linear design. Concentric lines surround the short neck. Un- decorated on the inside. Type II. Egg-Shaped Vessels A. Vessels Designed for Suspension 1. P1. 41-d. A small egg-shaped pigment container, deco- rated with a series of scrolls in negative effect on the sides and ends. A decorated band in neg- ative effect encircles either end and another surrounds the shoulder. There are two vitamor- phic figures in handle position. A perforation just below the mouth on either side suggests that the vessel was intended to be used with a cord. Type III. Cylindroid Vessels, Bulbous at the Base A. Jars in which the Bodies and Necks are Distinct 1. P1. 43-b. A handsome piece on which the technique of red over white for negative effect may be studied to advantage. The jar is made of coarse dark paste and is covered with a fairly heavy whitish slip. Over this is a coat of red paint. The striations which create the background for the negative design are extremely regular and evidently were in- tended to add to the decorative effect. Some of the striated surface retains a little of the origi- nal red paint, other parts have lost it; some spots are badly damaged. The globular section is surrounded by a broad band in relief with an adorno in the form of an upside-down head in handle position on either side. The surface below the band is di- vided into four sections by four perpendicular bands in relief which extend two-thirds of the way to the base and terminate in a two-fingered motif so arranged as to suggest a pyramidal ef- fect. The many-fingered hand is used as a di- visional unit above the heads and again half way between them, making four divisions above the band and four below it which, however, are not in correspondence. Below the head, in engraved technique, is the body of a jacare (crocodile) with outstretch- ed claws. Thus an anthropomorphic head func- tions with a zoomorphic body - a trait unusual for Marajo. Opposite sides of the vessel have substan- tially the same decoration. This also is a trait not characteristic of all Marajo wares. B. Vessels in which the Neck and Body Merge 1. PI. 19-c.</page><page sequence="48">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) TILE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 307 This classification is made with some reser- vations since much of the red paint is gone, though considerable white remains on the stri- ated background. The general type is that of the red-over-white ware. This piece is handled, as seem to be all the pieces on which the neck and the body merge. There is a jacare (crocodile) in relief under each handle, and on alternate sides a reptilian design engraved in negative effect. The inside had been painted white half way down. 2. P1. 53-a. A large jar with anthropomorphic decoration on one face, partly in relief and partly in en- graving in negative effect. This jar presumably was red over white, but much of the paint is gone. Type IV. Shoe-Shaped Vessels A. Vessels with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 48-c. Much of the upper red coat has been rubbed off. The face on the neck is white as is the in- side of the neck. Type V. Shallow Vessels A. Shell-Shaped Dishes 1. P1. 98-a and c; P1. 99-a and c. Dishes of this general shape are not uncom- monly found in the engraved wares. Normally, they have a small vitamorphic head and one or two other small extensions from the rim. These two pieces are of especial interest in that they are differently decorated on the outside, but the designs on the inside are almost identical. Any- thing approximating exact repetition is rare in Marajo pottery. Type VI. Vessels of Indeterminable Form A. Vessels Lacking Upper Section 1. P1. 53-b. This piece is broken and no trace of the neck remains, it is therefore impossible to classify its form with certainty. I saw this piece only through glass, but presumably it was originally red over white. Type VII. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 40-c. It is clear from this piece that originally the red paint covered the entire surface, because considerable still remains on the upper surface of the striated areas. The inside of the sherd shows remnants of a polychrome design in red, buff and white. 2. P1. 40-b. The interior surface of a red-over-white rim sherd. Painted white and decorated with two motifs characteristic of Marajo6, the cross-in- medallion and the ladder.

PE-J-2-N WARES PAINTED BLACK, ENGRAVED FOR NEGATIVE EFFECT, RETRACED WITH WHITE Type I. Broad-Mouthed Pots A. Pots which Taper from NMouth to Base 1. P1. 44-a. Probably originally a black-and-white piece, although at present it is almost sepia in tone. The striations on the field are regular and on substantially the same plane as that of the main design. Traces of white paint remain on the field and retracings in white are evident in the line engraving. The rim is black over white; the inside had been painted white. Originally this must have been a very hand- some piece. The principal decoration is a jacare (crocodile) motif, partly engraved in negative effect and partly modeled. The remainder of the jar is decorated in scroll and medallion motifs in negative effect. Type II. Broad-Mouthed Bowls A. Bowls with a Round Bottom 1. P1. 48-b. A small bowl beautifully executed. The de- sign in negative effect is black, the field white. The inside is decorated with a black geometri- cal design on a white background.

PE-L-1 WARES PAINTED BLACK OVER RED OVER BUFF AND ENGRAVED THROUGH TO THE BUFF FOR LINE EFFECT Type I. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 36-e. This intricate piece seems to have three layers of color on the outside with the design engraved through to the undermost. The inside seems originally to have been white over buff. There is a groove in the top of the rim that was made before the painting was done; this top sur- face shows clearly the black, red and buff coats which appear on the outside. PE-L-1-N WARES PAINTED BLACK OVER RED OVER BUFF AND ENGRAVED THROUGH TO THE BUFF FOR NEGATIVE EFFECT Type I. Sherds A. Body Sherds 1. P1. 37-j. The outside of this sherd is decorated with a textile scroll in negative effect, the field is covered with striations carefully paralleled for ornamental effect. Considerable of the buff shows through, some of the red and a fair amount of the black remain. The underlying buff slip appears on the inside (shown in the illus- tration) also; over this is a dichrome design in red-brown and cream. PE-M WARES OF INDETERMINABLE COLOR EN- GRAVED FOR LINE EFFECT Type I. Broad-Mouthed Pots A. Pots which Taper from Mouth to Base 1. P1. 30-b. The published description of this vessel states merely: "Vaso de argila vermelha. Mara- jo. Decoragao a trago fino." 13 However, in de- sign and general technique this piece suggests the White Engraved Wares; and since it is clear that four broad lines, two at the top and two at the bottom, had been prepared for retracing, it seems probable that the pot originally belonged to, or was intended for, the red and white en- graved type of ornamentation. Type II. Four-Lobed Vessels A. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 14-c. This jar probably belongs to the same cate- gory as that figured on plate 19-d, but a few traces of white paint are all that remain of its colored decoration. It is made of dark paste. Two shoulders are decorated with a head in re- lief, the other two with engraved scrolls. Dr. Estevao de Oliveira obtained this piece from a family who were using it as a receptacle for salt and, as in many other cases in Marajo, the color may have been purposely removed to make the jar acceptable for domestic use.

The neck is decorated with a face in relief on the front; a handle is at- tached at the back. I do not have a full des - cription of this piece but presumably it belongs to the white engraved or red-and-white engraved classification. Type III. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Anthropomorphic Urns 1. P1. 30-a. The published description of this piece states merely that the head is painted white and engraved. The body was probably originally white with red retracings.This type of engraving is, as far as I know, never associated with all- white decoration. Miss Alberto Torres states that, according to the testimony of the first ex- plorers, urns of this type were found within other urns of coarser naterial and bore on them a tanga of clay tied by a cord. 14 Type IV. Broad-Mouthed Bowls A. Bowls with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 31-f. A small bowl decorated all the way to the base. The sides are covered by a series of in- terlocking scrolls with vertical divisional units. The rim is two-lipped; the lower lip is scal- loped. Such rims are fairly common on white and red-and-white wares. The inside was painted white. Practically all the paint has been re- moved from the outside, but the technique is definitely that of the white or red-and-white wares. B. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 41-g. Small bowl with vitamorphic figures in han- dle position. Probably belonged to the white or red-and-white wares. 2. P1. 69-d. Decorated on the outside with pits and en- graving. Pits are most unusual in Maraj6 deco- ration. This bowl is not at present painted on the outside; its color is rather yellow, and it has a polished effect. The inside is decorated with a red-and-white geometrical design having three unequal divisions. Type V. Two-Part Dishes A. Dishes Having an Annular Foot 1. P1. 31-c. I have no description of this piece. There is a perforation at either end of the divisional ridge between the two sections indicating that 14 Ibid.: XIII. the dish was probably designed for suspension or for feather ornamentation. Type VI. Superimposed Forms with Scalloped Profile A. Jars with Flat Bottoms 1. PI. 14-e. A jar whose form seems to be based upon a low, broad vessel resting in the mouth of a glob- ular jar with a neck. The body is decorated with vertical and diagonal lines. The upper section has an anthropomorphic face in relief on either side, the spaces between being filled in with curvilinear engraving. 2. P1. 32-d. A jar whose form is based upon the profile of three pots graduated in size, placed one upon the other. Type VII. Shoe-Shaped Vessels A. Vessels with Rounded Bottoms 1. P1. 41-i. The surface is badly rubbed, but this was probably originally a white ware specimen. This general form appears in several wares, see plates 5-b and 52-a. Type VIII. Sherds A. Body Sherds 1. Pl. 36-h. There are several of these sherds in mu- seum collections which have designs character- istic of the white wares retraced with red, but they have been darkened by heat and therefore give a black-and-red effect. Whether or not this was intentional there is no means of deter- mining. B. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 37-a. A crude piece decorated with vertical, en- graved lines. UJnusual.

On the bottom is a series of concentric circular bands toothed around the outer edge. B. Vessels of Indeterminable Base 1. Pl. 41-h. This piece is made of fine dark clay and, in its present condition,is unpainted. It is deco- rated with a series of scrolls in negative effect and a circular motif with pits. The striations between the principal motifs are fine and regu- lar. The piece is unusual because it features a large anthropomorphic head in handle position. This is not a knob but a hollow element incor- porated into the main body of the pot. The true handle extends from the top of the head to the shoulder of the vessel. Type II. Cylindroid Jars, Bulbous at the Base A. Jars on which the Bodies and Necks are Distinct 1.

A rattle with a head in relief on either end. On the sides there are upside-down faces in en- graved technique, also an arm-and-hand motif and textile scrolls. The upside-down face is characteristic of Maraj6 design. The published description of this piece does not give its color. 17 Type V. Incomplete Pieces A. "Pot Stands" 15Ibid.: Est. 21. 6Ibid.: XI. 17Ibid.: XII. 1. P1. 16-c. Probably the top of an elaborate stool. There is a four-scroll design in the center; pairs of large and small scrolls alternate around the edge. Originally there seem to have been four ornaments in relief extending from the outer edge; only one remains. ENGRAVED TRANSITIONAL WARES Sometimes, at first glance, pieces in the engraved technique and pieces in the champ-leve technique look very similar. The difference between the two methods of decoration can be determined by exami- nation of the treatment of the field. In the champ-leve wares the field is dug out irregularly to hold inlay and the depth of the excavations varies considerably. The relief on these pieces is actual, the design negative. On engraved wares the field is regularly striated, and the plane of the field and that of the design are sub- stantially the same. In this case, also, the design be- comes a negative one but the technique must be clas- sified as engraving as there is no absolute relief. Within each of these techniques there is a further subdivision. In the most common forms of champ-leve the excavations are fairly deep and the field relative- ly large (see pl. 56 and 57); usually on the engraved wares, also, the striated field is definitely significant (see pl. 43-b); in both these techniques the negative designs appear to be doubly or triply outlined, an ef- fect secured by engraving deep lines parallel to the main outline of the design. However a less common form of both champ-leve and engraved design was ob- tained by running light engraved lines midway be- tween the two edges of the negative design. On these pieces the field is very limited and the design area large. The result is a flat, one-plane effect. Though comparatively rare, some of the finest Maraj6 pieces have been done in this technique. Plate 54-a illus- trates this type of decoration in engraved technique, though the field is filled in with angular units rather than the simple parallel striations generally found in true engraving; "b" on the same plate is an example of champ-leve; plate 62-b is a combination of both. This particular limited-field type of carved and en- graved decoration appears to be transitional between true engraving and true champ-leve, and is sufficient- ly striking in effect to constitute a separate category. By classifying these wares as transitional, I do not mean to infer any time-element or to suggest anything other than a stylistic expression intermediate between the engraved and champ-tev6 techniques. As far as I know, the Engraved Transitional ap- pears in red with a white field and has been classi- fied as ET-A; in two-tone red, in which the negative design is painted red and the field is the unpainted lighter red of the slip, this has been classified as</page><page sequence="52">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 311 ET-B; and finally, in wares of indeterminable color which have been classified as ET-C. ET-A DESIGN PAINTED RED, FIELD PAINTED WHIITE Type I. Cylindroid Vessels, Bulbous at the Base A. Vessels in which the Upper and Lower Sections Merge 1. P1. 54-a. This could be included in the engraved clas- sification as the field is engraved rather than excavated - though not as usual with simple striations but rather with wedge-shaped units. Thus the design and the field are on the same plane. The decoration is, however, worked out in the limited-field technique, giving the design a flat effect. The principal motifs are simple quadrangular and notched textile scrolls. The rim flares slightly, two handles extending from below its upper edge to a band around the neck. Just be- low each handle is a flattened and extended anthropomorphic figure in relief. As far as I know, vessels of this type, in which the upper and lower sections are merged, are always han- dled. Vessels on which the two sections are distinct appear never to have had handles. ET-B DESIGN PAINTED RED, FIELD AN UNPAINTED LIGHTER RED Type I. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Broad-Mouthed Pots 1. P1. 62-b. This piece could be classified as either en- graving in negative effect or as champ-leve since some of the background is excavated, some striated. This fact illustrates the transi- tional character of the limited-field decoration in general. The surface of the body is divided into four broad panels by divisional units in the form of narrow panels. The principal motif on all four of the large panels is a notched textile scroll decorating each corner of each panel. The re- maining space on all of them is filled in with similar, but not identical, geometrical design. Of the divisional panels, two are broader than the other two. All are decorated with wavy en- graved lines. The profiles of these truncated conoidal pots are often exceedingly good. There are no hard lines but gentle inward curves, often more sen- sitive to the touch than to the eye, between the base and the body; usually between the conoidal section and the rim double curves relieve any suggestion of harshness of outline. ET-C WARES OF INDETERMINABLE COLOR Type 1. Broad-Mouthed Pots A. Pots which Taper from Mlouth to Base 1. P1. 54-b. Strictly speaking this piece is in the champ- leve technique as the field apparently was ex- cavated for inlay. However, the decoration is definitely of the limited-field type. All traces of inlay are gone; a little red paint is perceptible on the outer surface; the inside seems to have been white. The general form is common. Type II. Concentric Dishes A. Dishes with an Annular Foot 1. P1. 55-a and b. In contrast to the concentric dishes found in Tapajo collections, all of which have flat bot- toms and spanning handles between the outer and inner dishes, 18 the Marajo concentric forms are always footed and always have depressed inner dishes. This depressed inner dish, to- gether with the annular foot, gives in profile the effect of the medially constricted annular base common in Tapajo pottery'9 and seen occasion- ally in the Lower Mississippi Valley. 20 The dish illustrated is slightly elliptical in form. The underneath surface of the outer dish is beautifully decorated with a continuous sig- moid motif, part of the pattern having been done with a fine tool, part with a blunter instrument. Notched textile scrolls fill the spaces between the long sweeps of the sigmoid. The color is gone but small excavated areas suggest that in- lay was intended. The outside of the inner dish forming, in effect, part of the support, is deco- rated with alternating triangles each filled in with parallel straight lines. This dish can hardly be said to have a truly independent rim. The inner surface is bevelled at the outer edge and covered with fine scroll decoration. This bevelled edge is smoothly and inconspicuously incorporated into the under sur- face of the vessel. Midway of the longer axis on either side of the dish there is a pierced nodule, and on either side of this are small anthropo- morphic heads in relief. The only color on the inside is a few traces of white paint. CHAMP-LEVE CL-A-1 CHAMP-LEV? IN RED-AND-WHITE EFFECTS The Marajoans apparently achieved their red-and- white effects in champ-leve in three ways: One method seems to have been to paint the unfired 18 Palmatary: 21. 19 Ibid.: 13. 2OIbid.: 109-</page><page sequence="53">312 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. ANMER. PHIL. SOC. vessel red, to do the necessary carving to complete the relief design, and then to paint the depressions with white. Whether the excavated areas were ever entirely filled, approximating a cloisonne finish, is a matter of considerable doubt. Pieces decorated by the method described have been classified as CL-A-1- TI,21 and seem to be representative of the most com- mon technique employed for red-and-white effects in champ-leve. Another method seems to have been to depend upon a thick white outer slip for the white background and to carve directly into this and to leave it unpainted, the outer surface of the vessel having been painted red prior to the carving. There are two excellent ex- amples of this method in the University Museum's col- lection. Such pieces have been classified as CL-A- 1-T2. This technique appears also on engraved wares, as on the engraved jar- figured on plate 26-b; there is no retracing. A third and rare method was to depend upon the natural red paste of the pot for the red effect and to paint the excavated areas white. This technique has been classified as CL-A-1-T3. CL-A-i-Ti RED RELIEF, WHITE FIELD, TECHNIQUE ONE (DESIGN PAINTED RED, FIELI) PAINTED WHITE) Type I. Shallow Vessels A. Vessels with no Support 1. Pls. 98-b and 99-b. A small dish scalloped around the outer edge and having a short vertical rim. The inside is decorated with a black and red positive design on a cream background. 2. Pls. 98-f and 99-f. A small dish slightly concave on the bottom and scalloped around the outer edge. The inside has a brown triangular pattern on a cream back- ground. 3. P1. 50-b. A shallow dish of medium size which has been reconstructed to a considerable extent. The principal motif on the outside is a stylized two-headed zoomorphic figure which appears commonly in the engraved and painted tech- niques as well as in champ-leve. The inspiration is not entirely clear but it might be a tartaruga or giant turtle, or possibly the jacare or croco- dile. On the inside are traces of red and white decoration. 4. P1. 71-b. Decorated on the outside (not shown) with very shallow champ-leve, on the inside with a polychrome design in negative effect, the colors of which are red, brown and white. 21 The letter-T indicates technique. Type II. Globular Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 64-a, b, c. A bowl of beautiful workmanship. It is typ- ically NMarajoan in that the design is made up not of a repeated motif but of a series of dif- ferent, although related, motifs which continue around the body. On the bottom, elements from all four sides are blended into a harmonious whole. On this piece the white retracing appears to have been relatively thick. The inside shows only vestiges of white paint. Type III. Cylindroid Pots A. Pots with Collars which Flare Slightly 1. P1. 57-b. A large jar featuring the elongated two- headed motif, the textile scroll, the arm and hand motif, and several face designs some of which are in contraposition, a trait characteris- tic of Marajo decoration in all techniques. The color is a dark brownish red; the field had been painted white. 2. P1. 56-c and d. Two adjacent faces of the same jar. The principal motif in the design is the stylized elongated two-headed figure employed by the Marajoans in engraved and painted techniques as well as in champ-leve. The two heads meet to form the principal design on two faces; the elongated bodies extend across the other two sides, and above and below them are arm and finger designs interspersed with a modification of the cross-in-medallion motif. Opposing faces of the jar are similar but not identical. Only traces of paint remain. 3. P1. 58-a, b, c, d. Four views of the same jar. This piece is of especial interest because it illustrates the fre- quently non-repetitional character of Marajo6 de- sign. Although the same motifs were used all around the jar, no two faces are alike. It would seem that the potter began his work in the cen- ter of "d" and continued directly around the pot. This is suggested by the fact that "d" is the only face where a pair of medallions ap- pears; in other words, the design did not work out quite evenly and another unit had to be added to fill the extra space. It is rarely that one finds so clear an ex- ample of this Marajoan non-repetitional princi- ple, but the examination of a large number of pieces seems to indicate that the ancient pot- ter felt no obligation to decorate opposite sides of a pot identically, but rather strove to blend a group of motifs into a varied and harmonious whole.</page><page sequence="54">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 313 B. Vessels with Widely Flaring Collars 1. P1. 57-a. A vessel with a stylized face on two sides of the collar; between the two faces, on either side, are two vertical bands in relief forming a divisional unit. The body is decorated with scrolls, cruciform motifs and a tooth-like de- sign. The general color on the outside is a dark brownish red; the field retains a fair amount of its white paint. The decoration on the inside is indeterminable. The general style is common. Type IV. Globoid Jars A. Jars with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 59-a. A combination of blunt-instrument engraving and champ-leve. The principal motif is a sigmoid scroll which fills the major part of each of the six panels into which the body of the jar is di- vided. J ars of this type have no true neck but are surmounted by more or less flaring collars. The one on this jar is simply decorated by straight and wavy lines in relief. The inside of the collar seems to have been painted red. On the outside only traces of red surface paint and white field remain. Type V. Pear-Shaped Jars A. Jars with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 59-b. This is an unusual piece because it has both champ-leve and polychrome decoration on the same surface. The collar is red both inside and and out; the champ-leve has red relief and a white field. The lower part of the jar is covered with white paint and shows traces of red. The wavy line decoration interspersed with stepped pyramidal and notched textile scroll motifs is typically Marajoan and appears in both painted and engraved techniques as well as chanip-leve. Type VI. (Cylindroid Vessels, Bulbous at the Base A. Jars on which the Body and Neck Are Distinct 1. P1. 63-b. An incomplete piece. The body is divided into four panels no two of which are decorated exactly alike. This variation in design around the body of a vessel is a Marajo trait. The prin- cipal motif on the panel shown in the illustra- tion is an elongated two-headed figure, one head being right side up, one upside down. This motif is found also on the painted and engraved wares. TIhe neck apparently had several divi- sions, how many it is impossible to say. The vessel is made of pink paste, the paint on the relief surface is dark brownish red; the field has retained considerable of its original white paint. It is doubtful that the white applied to the back- ground areas of these wares ever attained the depth of real filling; it usually appears as a rather thin layer. In other words, the technique does not approximate cloisonne. Type VII. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 36-c. This piece is rather brown in tone but, in the opinion of Mr. Junius Bird of the American Mu- seum of Natural History, this condition is proba- bly due to some mischance in firing. The rim is decorated with broad-instrument engraving re- traced with white, and with a carved design the field of which is retouched with white. The same combination of techniques appears to have deco- rated that portion of the pot just below the rim; whether this was neck or body it is impossible to say. Brown on the inside. CL-A-1-T2 RED RELIEF, WHIITE FIELD, TECHNIQUE TWO (DESIGN PAINTED RED, WHIITE UNPAINTED FIELD) Type I. Deeper Dishes A. Dishes with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 66-a and b. This dish is made of white paste and the ex- cavated areas on the outside are unpainted. The relief design and all other parts of the outer sur- face are painted red. The inside is decorated with a red positive design on a white unpainted background. The rim is flat, out-spread and di- vided into four sections. There is a zoomorphic head midway of the outer edge of one section. Dishes of this type are not common. Type II. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Vessels with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 62-a. The slightly flaring collar is decorated by a series of parallel horizontal engraved lines. The body of the jar is divided into four panels. The central motif of each panel is the two-headed reptilian figure so common in Marajo design. The pot is made of white paste, and the field of the carved area is unpainted; the relief design and the remainder of the pot are painted a dark reddish brown, giving a two-tone effect to the decoration. The inside shows vestiges of a red- on-white design. B. Wide-Mouthed Bowls 1. P1. 56-a. This bowl is of white paste. The upper sec- tion is decorated with a broad band in chanmp- leve featuring pyramidal and scroll motifs. The conoidal lower section is crudely engraved with</page><page sequence="55">314 PALMIATARY: THE POTTERY OF NIARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. a scroll design. The outer surface, including the relief design, was painted red. The excavated areas appear not to have been painted. Traces of polychrome appear on the inside. CL-A-1-T3 RED RELIEF, WHITE FIELD (RED UN- PAINTED DESIGN, FIELD PAINTED WHIITE) Type I. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Incomplete Vessels 1. P1. 63-a. This pot is made of dark red paste; in its present state the relief design shows no signs of having been painted. The background had been painted white. An unusual feature of the decoration is the wavy design in the center of the relief decoration. Other motifs used are the notched textile scroll and pyramidal effects, both common in all the major Marajo decorative techniques. CL-A-2 TWO-TONE RED WARES (RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED RED, FIELD A LIGHTER RED AND UN- PAINTED) Type I. Globular Jars A. Jars with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 60-a and b. A combination of high relief and champ-leve. The collar is decorated on two sides with a face having the typical elongated Marajoan eye. On two sides of the body the principal decoration is a jacare with limbs bent at right angles. This is a common motif in Marajo wares. On alternate sides is a stylized anthropomorphic form with head upside-down. Upside-down heads also are characteristic of Marajo decoration. Much of the outside of the collar seems to have been painted white with linear motifs in red. The body was covered with a fine red slip in which the carving was done. In its present state the background is unpainted. The relief design is darker than the background. 2. P1. 61-a and b. A jar similar in form and design to the one just described. There is, however, one interest- ing difference: on plate 60-a the principal motif is a figure in relief of a man standing on his head; on plate 61-b substantially the same de- sign may be seen as part of the general champ- leve' decoration. On this latter jar the heads on the collar are above the jacares; on the other jar they are between the jacares. On this jar the excavations were made in the light red slip; the relief is darker in tone. As far as at present discernible, there was no re- touching of the excavated areas. Type II. Large Jars A. Incomplete Pieces 1. P1. 50-a. The neck and collar of a large jar. This piece illustrates beautifully the two-tone red technique. The excavations are deep and show no trace of having been retouched with another color. The finely engraved line midway between the ridges outlining the relief design gives a peculiarly delicate cast to the decoration. Type III. Smaller V'essels A. Circular Dishes with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 31-e. Dish with a flat-topped out-turned rim. The body is decorated with a simple geometric de- sign which is rather common, though rare in this ware. The inside shows traces of a red and white painted design. CL-A-3 ONE-TONE RED WARES (BOTH RELIEF DESIGN AND FIELD PAINTED RED) Type I. Small Jars A. Crescent-Based Jars 1. P1. 47-a. This is an interesting piece since it is in the form of a headless crescent-based figurine. It is unusual because it represents a hunclhback. The general form appears also in the unpainted wares, plates 8-d and 12-f. CL-B-1 RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED WHITE, FIEILD PAINTED RED Type I. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 35-b. A fragment of rim and neck, decorated with engraving retraced with red and carved areas in- laid with red. The reverse side had been painted red. This ware is very rare. B. Body Sherds 1. P1. 37-h. Fragment of a base. Only a small amount of coloring remains on the field. CL-C-1 RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED SEPIA, FIELD PAINTED WHITE Type I. Sherds A. Rim Sherds 1. P1. 36-a. Piece of a neck and rim decorated in a dia- mond-shaped motif in sepia with a background of white. The rim seems to have had a thin coat of sepia over white. The inside shows only a few traces of dark paint.</page><page sequence="56">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 315 CL-D-1 RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED CHOCOLATE BROWN, FIELD UNPAINTED Type I.

Vessels with a Lateral Spout 1. P1. 42-d. These little vessels are common in Marajo collections and there have been many specula- tions as to their probable use. D. Maria Jovita has suggested that a stick may have been placed in the small tube-like extension which is always found at one end; thus they may have been used for ceremonial purposes. The inside of this "spoon" probably had been white. Prac- tically all pieces of this type are carefully made and many have painted designs on the inside. Dr. J. Alden Mason suggests that they may have been drinking vessels, and Dr. Farabee jokingly referred to them in his notes as "medicine cups. " CL-E-1 RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED BLACK, FIELD PAINTED WHITE Type I. Shallow Vessels A. Vessels with an Annular Foot 1. P1. 47-g and h. An uncommonly beautiful piece decorated on the outer sides and bottom with textile and nat- ural scroll motifs in relief. The inside appears at first glance to be black on white, but in all probability this decoration was originally red on white which became darkened in the firing. CL-E-2 RELIEF DESIGN PAINTED BLACK OVER WHITE, FIELD PAINTED RED Type I. Sherds A. Body Sherds 1. P1. 39-c. A small fragment from which much of the black has worn away, exposing the white under coat.

The outer lower surface is decorated by a broad band of champ-leve, the principal motif of which is a scroll which sug- gests a two-headed serpent. The outside of the vertical rim is decorated with a wavy-line de- sign in low relief interspersed with simple rec- tangular motifs. The inside shows a few traces of white paint. The outside may have had some black decoration. The general form is common. 2. P1. 68-c. A large dish beautifully carved with scroll, tooth-shaped and other geometrical designs. The inside shows traces of black and white paint. From evidence in one spot only, it would seem that the outside of the vertical rim originally had been decorated with white relief and a red field.

A little piece similar to the engraved piece figured on plate 52-a. POLYCfROME AND DICHROME WARES To the best of my knowledge, there was no true negative painting on Marajo. Ihowever, a high percent- age of the polychrome decoration is in negative ef- fect, or a combination of motifs in positive and nega- tive effects. Seemingly the technique involved in producing the negative effect was to cover the pot with a basic wash of white and to draw the design on that. Then the interstitial spaces were filled in with red as il- lustrated on plate 86-b, or with brown as shown on plate 83-a, or with black as on plate 15-b, making the basic white the bearer of the decorative motifs em- ployed. Quite frequently three colors were used on a pot, usually white, black or brown, red or occasionally orange. The red usually served to form a secondary and positive design running midway of, and in con- formity to, the outlines of the n-main white negative de- sign. A case in point is plate 97-a. On this pot the interstitial spaces are filled in with black, the posi- tive design is in red. Occasionally, the same color used in the interstitial spaces was employed also for the positive design. Plate 86-b, already referred to, illustrates this method of decoration which is in di- chrome, both the interstitial spaces and the positive design being in red. Thus on Marajo6 wares the prin- cipal design is frequently produced in white in nega- tive effect and accentuated in positive painting by a contrasting color; the latter may be the same as that filling the interstitial spaces or a third and strikingly 24 Mordini, 1936: 22.</page><page sequence="58">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 317 contrasting tone. After considerable deliberation an effort to classify dic hrome and polychronie separately was abandoned. The reasons for such decision were the following: 1. In their present condition it is often impossible to determine whether certain important pieces were originally dichrome or polychrome. 2. Dichrome and polychrome often occur on two sur- faces of the same vessel. 3. The same type-forms and the same designs occur in both dichrome and polychrome. 4. A more logical and comprehensive form-type classification could be made by considering dichrome and polychrome together. These multicolored wares constitute a large and impressive section of Marajo ceramics and often dis- play, in both form and decoration, close relation to the engraved and chanip-leve wares of the same area. Po-A POLYCHROME AND DICHROME WARES,, DESIGN DETERMINABLE Type I. Shallow Vessels A. Circular Dishes 1. P1. 69-c. A small circular dish unpainted on the out- side. The inside is covered with a design partly in positive, partly in negative effect. This piece is unusual because the negative effect is pro- duced by crosshatching in dark brown paint over creamn. In the center of each cream sigmoid- shaped space, negative in effect, thus produced, there is a positive sigmoid in dark brown. This decorative device of creating a sigmoid in nega- tive effect, and placing within it another in pos- itive effect is common in Marajo decoration. Just below the rim of this dish are two concen- tric bands of red. 2. P 1. 98-d and 99-d. The outside is decorated with a series of concentric triangles on a white background; the two outer triangles are outlined in sepia; the innermost is painted solidly red. The inside is decorated with a red scroll retraced along the edges with sepia; the background is white. 3. P1. 72-c. A large dish painted red and white in nega- tive effect. The design is one which is common on Marajo wares, consisting of two heads at either end of an elongated body, the spaces be- tween the heads being filled in with geometrical motifs which might be interpreted as legs and feet. The rim is flat, painted red, slopes down- ward slightly and becomes thickened on the under side. The outside of the dish is un- painted. Large shallow dishes are common. 4. P 1. 70-e. The design is badly eroded but shows traces of geometrical figures in dark paint on a white background. The rim is decorated with a deli- cately engraved design and painted white. Two conventionalized heads with round-rimmed pro- tuberant eyes extend beyond the rim in handle position. There is a nodule on the rim on either side of each head. B. Triangular Dishes 1. Pl. 70-f. The design is common in painted wares. In this case it is done partly in positive, partly in negative effect. The colors are red and white. The interstitial spaces are filled in with short, parallel, horizontal lines. There is a vitamrorphic head at one angle of the triangle, and a small and a larger extension from one of the other two; the third angle has been danmaged. Type II. Wide-Mouthed Bowls A. Bowls with a Round Bottom 1. P1. 69-f. A small deep bowl decorated on the inside with a delicate design in red quadrangular scrolls on a white background. The bottom seems to have been ornamented originally with a white cross in negative effect. The outside is rather rough and undecorated. 2. P1. 69-g. A beautiful bowl in excellent condition. The outside is decorated part way down by a broad band of geometrical design in negative effect, dark brown on white. On the inside the design is partly in positive, partly in negative effect, two tones of brown on white. The decoration has four divisions, as is frequently the case on Marajo6 wares, and consists principally of arm and hand motifs supplemented by wavy lines. 3. P1. 65-c. Decorated in red and white on both sides. 4. Pl. 82-e. The outside is white and originally had some black decoration but the design is not determi- nable. The inside is decorated with a black scroll design on a white background. There is a bird head on one side in handle position. On either side of the bird head on the outside of the bowl is a vertical band in low relief. These bands are almost always found in connection with single handles. 5. P1. 41-a. A bowl similar in form to the one just de- scribed. The outside is decorated with a red scroll on a white background; the inside seems to have had dark spots on a white backgfound but the exact design is not determinable. This general type of bowl with a single figure in han- dle position is common in the polychrome wares. B. Bowls with a Flat Bottom</page><page sequence="59">318 PALMIATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. 1. P1. 70-b. The form suggests a four-leafed clover. The outside had apparently been painted white. On the inside are traces of red and white paint. There is no independent rim on the inside, but on the outside a thick band, semicircular in cross section, constitutes the semblance of a rim. Two small in-tumed bird heads on opposite sides suggest handles. To the left only of each head there is a small knob on the rim. This form of dish is rare. Type III. Ovoid Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 71-e and f. A dish painted in negative effect, black and red on a white background. There is a bird head on one side in a handle position. Single vita- morphic heads so placed are common on Mfarajo wares. Ovoid forms are fairly comrnon. Type IV. Globular Vessels with Short Alecks A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 73-a. A fine piece painted in negative effect. The principal motif is the continuous interlocking scroll. Within each scroll element and between each two the space is filled in by the T-shaped motif so common on Miarajo pottery. The negative design is in white, the interstitial spaces are red. The neck seems to have been painted red on the inside. B. Bowls with Flat Bottoms 1. P1. 73-b. A beautiful piece decorated by a series of two-headed serpents in low relief forming inter- locking sigmoid scrolls. The dark relief of the long bodies of the snakes is further accentuated by a red line which follows their outline and is painted over a white background which, in nega- tive effect, also depicts their form. The eyes of snakes are red. The spaces between the snake motifs are filled in with dark red outlined in a brownish black. Dark knobs on a white back- ground are interspersed between the snake units. The collar is red with a white line in negative effect below it. Type V. Globoid Jars with Flaring Collars A. Jars with a Small Mouth 1. P1. 85-b. The published description of this 5piece un- fortunately does not give its colors. Type VI. Pear-Shaped Jars A. Jars with a Short Neck 1. P1. 32-f. 2sAlberto Torres, 1940: XIII. An interesting piece principally in negative effect. The interstitial spaces are filled in with black; the lines which run midway of the nega- tive design are red. Type VII. Cylindroid Vessels with a Flaring Collar A. Collars which Flare Slightly 1. P1. 75-a. The body was originally white over which was a red geometrical design. The outer surface of the rim is decorated with two typical Mara- joan faces in relief, the handles of the jar con- stituting the noses. The outside of the collar had been red; the inside shows traces of white paint. This form of pot is common in champ leve and engraved wares, less common in poly- chrome. Type VIII. Vessels with a Truncated Conoidal Lower Section A. Bowls with the Basal Conoidal Diameter Greater than that of the Mouth 1. P1. 76-a. Painted white both inside and outside with vestiges of red geometrical design on both sur- faces. There is a zoomorphic figure in handle position on one side, and a vertical band in low relief on either side of it. These vertical bands are characteristically found in connection with vitamorphic figures in handle position. The conoidal section is not painted on the outside, and curves out slightly between the greatest diameter of the dish and its base, making a pleasant line in profile. 2. P1. 76-d. The conoidal section is unpainted on the out- side. The inner and the remainder of the outer surfaces show vestiges of red and white deco- ration, though the design is not completely determinable. 3. P1. 77-a. The conoidal section is unpainted. The sides are decorated in black and white. The interior is white. The geometric design is unusual for Marajo. 4. P1. 77-c and d. Two views of the same bowl. The design on the interior is partly in positive and partly in negative effect. It is made up of two pairs of faces around a central body; a face of one pair may be seen at the bottom of d, while one of the other pair may be seen to the right of the illus- tration. The eyes of these latter faces may also be interpeted as faces. A detailed drawing sent by Dr. Mordini shows the crosshatching which produces the negative design to be red over basic white, while the positive design is in black. An unusual feature for Maraj6o is a red</page><page sequence="60">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 319 stripe around the outside of the bowl below and above which is a black stripe which, at regular intervals, expands into a semicircle giving a. scalloped effect to the design. The same de- sign appears on the inner side-surface of the bowl. B. Bowls having a Basal Conoidal Diameter the Same as that of the Mouth 1. P1. 71-c and d. The conoidal section of this piece is painted white on the outside. The sides are decorated with a red and white design in negative effect. The colors on the interior are sepia and red painted in positive effect on a white back- ground. 2. P1. 72-a. The published description of this piece states that the colors are red and white. The decoration is partly in positive, partly in nega- tive effect. 26 3. Pl. 15-b. The outside (not shown) is painted a deep cream and is decorated with two faces in relief and a knob on either side of the bowl between the faces. Some sort of divisional unit is char- acteristic of Marajo design. The inside is painted in negative effect black over white. 4. Pl. 32-c. A bowl painted red over white in negative effect both inside and outside. It is rather un- usual in that the conoidal section is completely covered with the same type of design as the body proper. C. Vessels having the Basal Conoidal Diameter Smaller than that of the Mouth 1. P1. 78-b. A section of a large bowl. The bottom and lower part of the conoidal section are painted a bright red; above this is a band of simple linear decoration black over white. The sides seem to have been ornamented with at least two types of faces in low relief. The decoration of these faces is in negative effect, the white basic wash producing the outline, red and black filling in the background. On the inside (not shown) is a broad black band just below the rim; below this is a broader band of red; the remainder of the inside is white. In its original barbaric bril- liance this piece must have been most interest- ing. 2. P1. 32-b. The basic slip on this piece was white. Covering this completely was a coat of deep orange and the negative effects were built up in orange, the interstitial spaces having been filled in with black. The two vertical parallel 2Ibid.: XIV. lines which run midway of the vertical bands in negative effect are red, as is also the positive part of the scroll. On the inside the basic white slip is used as a background for a red and black design in positive effect. The coloring on this piece is unusual. 3. P1. 72-b. Decorated on the outside by two typically Marajoan faces in negative effect. The colors are brown and red on a white background. The inside had been painted red. D. Vessels with a Semi-Globular Body and a Short Neck 1. P1. 77-b. The outside of the conoidal section is un- painted. The remainder of the outer surface of the body is covered with a scroll design in white, red and black, partly in positive, partly negative, effect. The neck is decorated with parallel horizontal bands of red and black on white. E. Vessels with Semi-Globular Body, Neck and Independent Rim 1. P1. 85-a. A beautiful piece in good condition. It is painted in negative effect black over white. The inside of the neck had been painted white. There are remnants of white paint on the outside of the neck. The principal motif on the body is a continuous scroll which is partially sigmoid in effect. The truncated conoidal section is deco- rated with the wavy-line motif interspersed with short horizontal lines in pyramidal effect. This latter design is common on Marajo wares; the particular scroll motif used is uncommon. F. Semi-Globular Jars with Independent Rim but no Neck 1. P1. 87-b. A large jar decorated in positive technique by a black reptilian design on a white back- ground. Fine lines in red re-outline the main black motif, softening and greatly enhancing the final effect. G. Vessels with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 78-a. A jar typically Marajoan in both form and decoration. The body is painted in negative ef- fect red over the basic white. The collar is painted red and decorated with two faces in re- lief which are painted white; the eye areas are enclosed as is usual on Marajo wares. Between the two faces on either side there is a division- al unit consisting of two vertical bands in lQw relief painted white, as is also the space be- tween these bands. Divisional units are char- acteristic of Marajo decoration. The body of the jar features two wavy-line motifs, one in nega-</page><page sequence="61">320 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. tive effect, the other in a combination of nega- tive and positive effects; ornament of this type is common, as is also the T-shaped motif used in connection with both the upper and lower decorative bands. Within the undulations of the lower wavy motif is a series of faces in nega- tive effect. It is to be noted that they alternate- one right side up, the next upside down. Faces which thus alternate are characteristic of Marajo ornamentation and appear in all the decorative techniques. The conoidal section curves out slightly, making a pleasant line in profile. H. Urns with Vitamorphic Decoration . P1. 90-a. A large urn with a ssmall conoidal section and small base. The neck is decorated on two sides with four small aninmal faces. Thais decoration is unusual in that the faces are hollow, the clay having been pushed out from the inside. Th-e rim is practically round. The body was originally covered with the usual basic white over which there was decoration in red and black, only traces of which remain. 2. P1. 90-b. A large urn with four eyes on two sides of the neck arranged to suggest a face, the lowest one having been slit across in simulation of a mouth. This face is surrounded by a band with ear-like projections on either side. The relief decoration is hollow, having been pushed out from the inside. The body of the jar originally was covered with red and white design in nega- tive effect. 3. P1. 97-b. The interstitial spaces around the design in negative effect are filled in with what may have been originally either a deep sepia or black. Fine red lines run midway of the white areas re- producing the principal motifs of the design in positive effect. The decoration is really in the form of a wide band which extends from the shoulder three quarters of the way to the base. Below this there appears to have been only the white basic wash of the negative design. This urn is one of the instances in which the nose is formed by the handles of the jar and therefore the primary decoration is on the handle sides rather than between them. Darkened by fire in several spots. I. Incomplete Pieces 1. P1. 69-b. This piece has vitamorphic heads in handle position, the upraised hands forming the real handles. The upraised-hand motif is comrmon in Santarem, but unusual in Marajo. The colors are red and brown on white but the design is not en- tirely distinct. Ty pe IX. Globular Jars with a Tapering Neck A. Jars with Flaring Collars 1. P1. 83-a. A large jar painted brown and white, partly in positive, partly in negative effect. On the side illustrated and on the opposite side the de- sign is the same - a typical N!arajo face with scrolls for eyes. On the other two sides are complicated geometrical motifs including one which may be interpreted as insectiform. The interstitial spaces are filled in with the T- shaped motif; this is a common characteristic of Marajo art. 2. P 1. 82-a. A fine jar painted red and black on white. The positive and negative designs seem equally prorminent. 3. P1. 84-b. A beautiful jar painted in positive and nega- tive effect. The colors used are red and brown over the basic white. 4. P1. 91-a. A large urn. The neck is decorated with a scroll and a pyramidal design red over cream in negative effect. The original decoration on the body is not determinable. 5. P1. 93-a and b. A large anthropomorphic urn having the down- cast eyes so characteristic of Marajo urn de- sign. The colors are sepia and red over basic white, partly in positive, partly in negative ef- fect. The colors on this piece are exceptionally well preserved. 6. P1. 94-a and b. A large urn with anthropomorphic decoration on two faces. As is frequently found on these burial urns, there is a vitamorphic figure in high relief on either side of the neck in handle po- sition. The colors are sepia and red over basic white, and the decoration is partly in positive, partly in negative effect. The design is badly eroded in several places. 7. P1. 96-b. The colors of the body and neck are red over cream. The body is decorated inr negative effect, the neck is decorated in relief painted red and red parallel lines in positive effect. The flaring collar is red and decorated with two faces in relief, the handles under the rim serving as noses. Around the top of the neck are four han- dles which constitute the noses of four more faces; the ears are so arranged that two pairs serve for four faces. The eyes and the mouth on the side faces are simple ovoid nodules. The decoration on the body is very eroded. B. Jars with an Independent Rim 1. P1. 92-b.</page><page sequence="62">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 321 The rim of this jar represents a type commlon in Marajo pottery. In this case it is decorated with stripes of red paint; there is a band of red around the shoulder also. The body shows a dark scroll decoration on a cream background. C. Jars Lacking Determinable Form at the Miouth 1. P1. 82-b. A jar painted red over white in negative ef- fect and featuring the typical Marajoan face mo- tif, the T-shaped motif and the scroll. 2. P1. 97-a. Decorated around the body with a series of faces in negative effect. The interstitial spaces are filled in with black, and the red lines run midway of the negative design. A T-motif in negative effect occupies the central portion of the dark areas. 3. P1. 95-a. An anthropomorphic urn with round protuber- ant eyes, a trait not often found on Marajo pot- tery. The colors are well preserved and are sepia and red over basic white; the decoration is mostly in negative effect. 4. P1. 95-b. A large urn with coffee-bean eyes. This form of eye is fairly common on Marajo wares, but cannot be regarded as characteristic. There is a vitamorphic figure on either side of the neck in handle position. The colors are black, sepia and red over basic white. Type X. Four-Lobed Jars with a Tapering Neck A. Jars with a Flaring Collar 1. P1. 84-a. Painted in negative effect red and brown on white. On each of two opposing shoulders there apparently was originally a vitamorphic head in relief. The neck of each is surrounded by a band in relief painted brown and terminating on either side in a foot. The head on one shoulder is missing. B. Vessels Lacking Determinable Form at the Mouth 1. P1. 89-a. An anthropomorphic urn painted in ne_gative effect black over white with some red deco- ration. There is a face with drooping eyelids on two sides of the neck. This eye form is char- acteristic of much of the urn decoration. On either side of the neck, between the two faces, is a grotesque standing figure in handle posi- tion. Small bands, probably representing arms, extend from the ears to below the shoulder and terminate in a hollow cylinder. This cylinder probably suggests some ceremonial object as it is not uncommonly depicted. A face painted in negative effect, typically Marajoan in design, decorates the space below the cylinder. Type XI. Globular Jars with Flaring Neck and Inde- pendent Rim A. Handled Jars 1. P1. 86-a. A jar painted in positive and negative effect red over white. The neck seems to have been red with faces in low relief painted white. The lower part of the handles are white, the upper part red. When the jar is turned so that either handle faces front, the effect of another face is given, made up of an eye from each comiplete face on the neck, the handle serving as a nose. It is not an uncommon feature of Mllarajo design to secure a four-face effect around a neck by so arranging the eyes that each becomes a part of two faces. The cross-in-medallion and large eye motifs make up the principal decoration on the body of the jar. B. Jars without Hlandles 1. P 1. 86-b. Painted red over white in negative effect. The decoration around the body consists of a series of highly stylized faces alternately right side up and upside down. This type of alter- nating series is strongly typical of Marajo painted decoration and appears also on engraved wares. 2. P1. 87-a. Painted red over white in both positive and negative effects. The design is definitely Marajoan in all its techniques and motifs. It is unusual, however, in that the principal deco- ration consists of two connected scrolls which turn in opposite directions, the space between them having been filled with a face partly in positive partly in negative effect. At the inner extremity of each scroll is a many-fingeredhand. The T-shaped motif and the stepped pyramid in negative effect, and the notched textile scroll in positive painting make up the remainder of the design. The decoration on opposite sides of the jar is substantially the same; this is fairly characteristic of dichrome and polychrome, less so of other decorative techniques. Type XII. Deeper Vessels A. Cylindroid Pots 1. P1. 69-e. A small pot beautifully decorated in negative and positive effects with what may possibly be an insectiform motif. The negative design is in white, the interstitial spaces are filled in with black. Red lines run midway of the negative de- sign. The inside is painted white. B. Anthropomorphic Urns 1. Pl. 75-b. A most unusual piece representing a squat- ting child with one hand at his mouth. There is</page><page sequence="63">322 PALIMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. nothing of portraiture and very little that can be considered realistic in NMarajo art; thus such specimens are rare. Painted white, retouched with red. C. Superimposed Forms 1. P1. 83-b. An unusual piece, the design of which ap- pears to have been based upon a bottle placed in a bowl. NMany pottery forms in Amazonia seem to have had their inspiration in the household custom of piling pots. The decoration on this piece appears to have been made up of dark scrolls and fine red lines on a white back- gro Land. Type XIII. julultipart Dishes A. Two-Part Dishes 1. P1. 70-d. This dish has a flat oval base. It is un- painted on the outside; the inside seems to have been painted white, over which was added a red geometrical design. There is a slight flange be- low the smooth rim decorated with indentations on one side only of each half of the dish. B. Dishes of More than Two Parts 1. P1. 74-a and b. Fragments of two dishes in the Museu Na- cional, Rio de Janeiro. I do not have data on the colors. T he larger fragment seems to indicate that the dish had four deep circular depressions and a central smaller rectangular one not so deep. The original number of depressions on the other fragment is not determinable but apparent- ly it had at least three. These two fragments are the only examples of this type of dish that I have seen from Marajo Island. They may have been ceremonial vessels or possibly containers for food. Type XIV. Vessels with a Flaring Annular Foot A. Dishes Having a Single Bowl 1. P1. 76-b. The inside of this dish is unpainted. The up- per surface of the rim is painted red. Only the upper section of the outside is decorated; this is painted white and has three parallel red stripes running around its central portion. 2. P1. 79-a and b. Painted white on the - outside. The inside decoration is red and brown on white and fea- tures a grotesque anthropomorphic figure on the bottom of the bowl. B. Concentric Dishes 1. P1. 80-a. In its present condition the under side of this dish is undecorated, although the outer edge of the rim is painted dark yellow. In the case of this dish and c on the same plate, the bottom of the outer dish is flat and the inner dish pro- trudes definitely above its center. Mlore usual forms are b and d on this plate and a on plate 81 in which cases the inner dish is really inset and the outer dish curves upward to join the upper extremity of the inner bowl. The inside of the flat bottom of the outer dish (pl. 80-a) was painted dark yellow as was also the inner bowl. The inside of the flar- ing sides was decorated with a white wash over which were painted wavy lines in dark brown or black. 2. P1. 80-c. The general form of the top section is rec- tangular with rounded corners. This is not an uncommon feature in Marajo pottery forms. The inner bowl tapers toward the bottom which rests upon the flaring annular foot, giving in profile the effect of the medially constricted supports common in Santarem pottery, and found also to some extent in the Lower Mississippi Valley. This profile is, in general, common to the lower portions of all concentric dishes. The foot and entire under surface of this piece are unpainted; the inner surface shows traces of black and red over a white basic wash, but the pattern is in- distinct. 3. P1. 80-b. Somewhat rectangular in form with rounded corners. There is a slight flange beneath the smooth rim which is decorated at the four cor- ners with indented protuberances. This flange is smooth except on the side illustrated which is decorated with a series of indentations. Such idiosyncrasies in design are common in the white engraved wares but are rarely seen in polychrome. The outer surface of the rim had been painted red; the inside of the bowls show some white paint. 4. P1. 80-d. Unpainted except on the inner surface which is decorated partly in positive, partly in nega- tive effect, red over white. The outside of the rim is painted red. In the University Museum's collection there are about a dozen of these concentric dishes most of which are complete or almost complete; some of these have small flat extensions with two holes in handle position, suggesting that these vessels might have been decoratecd with feathers on ceremonial occasions. 5. P1. 81-a. This beautiful piece is painted black on the under side, and black over white in negative ef- fect on the inner surface of the bowl.</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 323 Type XV. Heart-Shaped Urns with Flaring Rim A. Urns on which the Neck and Body are Distinct It is only rarely on the anthropomorphic urns that there is a definite line of demarcation between the body and the neck, but in the group here clas- sified as "A" a neck is distinctly discernible. 1. P1. 89-b. A large urn having on two sides of the neck a face with downcast eyes. The conventional- ized ears are in relief. What may be interpreted as arms extend from the ears to the shoulder of the urn and terminate in small hands holding a bar. This motif is common on the urns, as are also the drooping eyelids. On either side of the neck is a small seated human figure with arms bent outward and upward. There is a head in re- lief on the under side of the rim just above that of each seated figure. The broad out-flaring rim curves up smoothly on the inside, forming a somewhat acute angle with the flattened outer surface. The original colors were black and red on cream. 2. P1. 91-b. A large urn the neck of which is decorated on two sides by faces in relief. The eyes and the nose were produced by pushing out the clay from the inside; the mouth is a small ring model- ed from the outside. The ears are highly con- ventionalized. The original painted decoration was black and red over cream, the design being only faintly discernible. B. Urns on which the Neck and Body Merge 1. P1. 88-a and b. A well-preserved piece with characteristical- ly drooping eyelids. An interesting and unusual feature is the anthropomorphic figure in negative effect which extends full length down the sides of the jar (see b). Original colors seem to have been black or dark brown and red over white. Type XVI. "Pot Stands " A. "Stools" with a Hole in the Top 1. P1. 77-e. "Stools" are common in Marajo wares; this one is unusual because it is scalloped around the top. The colors are red and brown on a white background. Type XVII. Rattles A. Rattles with a Circular Base 1. P1. 47-c. The body is covered with a design in red concentric triangles and rectangles on a white background. The back of the head is painted red. The arms are depicted in low relief, slight protusions simulate feet. The breasts, the navel, and the vagina are indicated. B. Crescent-Based Anthropomorphic Forms 1. P1. 47-b. A rattle in the form of a figurine with stub- like arms. The colors are black and red over a basic white. There is no hole in the bottom nor indication that one was originally there. The toes are indicated. 2. P1. 100-f. A rattle with no opening. The colors are red and brown on a white background. Stub-like arms and no feet. Type XVIII. Crescent-Based Figurines These figurines, when turned upside-down dis- play a flat, crescent-shaped base, usually without a hole. Crescent-based figurines were common at Santarem also, but the Tapajo types are pointed at the tips of the crescent due to the fact that, in this area, the knee is not usually indicated. The Marajo figurines, for the nmost part, feature the knees bent or stub-like,so the tips of the crescent are rounded. Not all, but many figurines belonging to this gen- eral class are definitely phalliform. A. Figurines with Stub-Like Arms 1. P1. 6-g. The stub-like arm, featured on this piece, is common on the figurines of Marajo but not char- acteristic of those of Tapajo origin. The knees, in this case, are clearly indicated, giving a rounded effect to the tips of the crescent. The toes are indicated by indentations. Traces of red and white paint are observable. No hole in the bottom. Sex female. 2. P1. 100-b. Decorated with red and brown scrolls on a white background. Knees are bent, toes indi- cated. 3. P1. 100-c. Red decoration on a white background. Knees bent, toes indicated. Sex female. 4. P1. 101-c. Red decoration on a yellow background. 27 This is an unusual piece in that the toes are prominent. Sex not indicated. B.

The outside is painted orange; the inside is decorated with a dark red geometrical design painted in positive effect on a buff background. Greatest dimension 12 cm. 2. P1. 38-h. Sherd of a shallow dish, decorated with a de- sign in brown and white partly in positive, part- ly in negative effect. The outside is undeco- rated. The T-shaped motif used repeatedly in the border design and to designate the nose is typically Marajoan. 3. P1. 38-d. An example of the cross-in-medallion motif. Dark brown on cream.

The following belong to that category. 29Ibid.: XIV. 3Ibid.: XIV. Type I. Wide-Mouthed Bowls A. Bowls with Round Bottoms 1. P1. 70-c. The outside is not decorated. On the inside are traces of red, white and black paint. The rim is flat and out-flaring, forming a sharp angle with the interior surface; on the outside, the rim eases into the body with a curved line. This rim is fairly common on Marajo wares. 2.

MISCELLANEOUS STUDIES ADORN OS In striking contrast to the pottery of the Tapajo, which was richly ornamented with modeled figures appliqued to the bodies and the rims of vessels, 32 much of the Marajo pottery is conspicuously lacking in decorative elements which can be classified as adormo s. The white engraved wares are frequently decorated with small knob-like protrusions (pl. 21-c), or mere extensions of the vessel itself in the form of a head- like ornament (pl. 15-c). The white wares with red retracings sometimes show heads in handle position (pl. 32-a), or have extensions of the rim which sug- gest vitamorphic elements (pl. 24-a); much of this ware is, however, entirely without relief decoration (pl. 29-a, b and d). On wares engraved in negative effect vitamorphic figures occasionally appear in handle position (pl. 42-b and c). Adornos are sometimes attached to champ- leve wares, but rarely so (pl. 64). Mlost of the relief on wares in these techniques is fairly low and in re- ality an integral part of the vessel. On the polychrome wares the most conspicuous adornos are the anthropomorphic figures commonly found on the necks of the large burial urns (pl. 89-b and pl. 94). Occasionally these have some supporting value and thus fall into the category of caryatids (pl. 89-a), but caryatid forms are not conspicuous on Marajo pottery. In contrast, the Tapajo used the full burden-bearing caryatid to a marked degree. In the Museu Goeldi collection there are several adornos which are unusually heavy and which provoke speculation as to the size of the pot which bore them. For instance, figure c on plate 102 is a large head from the side of a vessel. The nose is a loop, prob- ably designed to suggest a handle, though it could not have served that purpose. The height of this ador- 31 Ibid.: XIII. 32Palmatary, 1939: 12 et seq. no is 13 cm., its weight is 1 kilo 16 grams. Figure a on the same plate is part of a shallow dish. Its height is 15 cm., which suggests that the dish must have been fairly large. Figure d on plate 107 has a height of 16.5 cm. On the whole, Marajo vessels were large, strikingly larger than those produced by the Tapajo. The rim ornament (pl. 105-h) is of peculiar interest because it recalls the legendary Ewaipnoma which Sir Walter Raleigh believed to have lived in the Guianan hinterland. These were a sturdy but headless people whose eyes were in their shoulders,and whose mouths were in the middle of their breasts. 33 In the main it may be said that, on all their wares, the Marajoans depended for the ornamentation of a vessel more upon its form, and upon various types of surface treatment of that form, than upon decorative units made separately and affixed to various parts of its body and rim. CLAY IMPLEMENTS Type I. I"Bobbins" Ladislau Netto states that a considerable number of "bobbins" have been found in the mounds on Marajo and that some are carefully decorated. He fig- ures one which is beautifully engraved. 34 Two from the Harvard collection may be seen on plate 105-i, m. Similar forms in the American NMuseum of Natural His- tory have straight, almost parallel, sides; their use is problematical. Type II. Spindle Whorls Ladislau Netto figures two engraved spindle whorls from the collection of the MIuseu Nacional, and infers that they are not uncommon. 35 An undecorated one from the University Museum's collection may be seen on plate 105-a. In the collections examined there were very f ew. Type III. Enigmatical Objects A grey-green lump of clay found by Mordini at Panellas (pl. 105-j). EYE -FORMS In Marajo ceramics there is nothing which approx- imates portraiture and very little which is truly real- istic in vitamorphic representation; yet, with the exception of motifs seemingly of jacare (crocodile) or tartaruga (turtle) inspiration, the most common deco- rative device is some anatomical element. Feet are depicted only rarely, sex is often indicated, arm and hand motifs are common, but by far the most frequent- ly employed anthropomorphic designs are concerned with the face or some part of it, usually the eyes. Faces on Niarajo wares are often so highly stylized 33 Raleigh, (1880): 346 et se q. 34 Ladislau Netto, 1885: 444. 3Ibid.</page><page sequence="67">326 PALMlATARY: THE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. and so subjugated to the overall decorative effect that a face motif is not always at first readily recogniz- able. However, after some study of this pottery, faces seem to appear almost everywhere, and often in un- usual and beautiful guises. Naturally the simplest forms of face are found on the wares engraved in line effect. These faces are not always easily discernible from the photograph of a painted pot. Ladislau Netto, however, figures an excellent series of drawings based on the collection at the Museu Nacional; these give some idea of the beauty and variety of the face motif as developed by the Marajoans.36 In the present study, plate 7-b fig- ures a red-over-white bowl decorated around the body by two rows of engraved faces, the upper row con- sisting of faces which are right side up, the lower row of faces which are upside down. This is a fairly common type of decoration. Plate 33-c shows an igagaba (water jar) decorated with a series of en- graved face-like elements, the face effect depending, to a large extent, on the tiny circular eyes. Engraved representations of eyes are frequently combined with slight modeling, usually a simple bulge; such forms are indicated on plates 19-e, 27 and 30-a. In a high percentage of these cases the outward extremity of the engraved design on each eye is fin- ished off with a partial or complete scroll, giving a marked characteristic to this form of engraved Miarajo eye. Occasionally, the bulge is surrounded simply by concentric circles; such a form may be seen on plate 19-d. Frequently eyelashes are suggested; this type is figured on plate 27-b. In polychrome wares the eye area is often repre- sented by a loop as indicated on plate 72-c or plate 82-b; the eyelid and eyeball are often depicted with- in the larger eye area. Occasionally such faces are jolly looking, especially when teeth are indicated. In the polychrome wares, scrolls also are sometimes used to suggest eyes; an example in negative effect is plate 83-a, one in positive effect is plate 72-a. Frequently faces are highly conventionalized; plate 86-b is a case in point. Here the eyes are simple geo- metrical forms; the body of this vessel is decorated by a series of face-like motifs, alternating around the pot, one right-side up, the next upside down. This type of decoration is characteristically Marajoan. Another common form of eye is a series of concentric circles, contrasting positive and negative effects; plate 72-b is an example. Occasionally on polychrome wares eyes are very simply represented as indicated on plate 87-a. In modeled technique the Marajoan eye takes on several distinctive forms. The simplest is perhaps the unornamented bulge, the clay having been pushed out from the inside. Such an eye-form was used on the 36 Ibid.: 359 etseq. large urn figured on plate 91-b. Sometimes this simple bulge was painted, producing a much more realistic effect, as in plate 95-a. It is only rarely that the round-rimmed protuberant eye appears on a piece of NMarajo6 pottery (pl. 90-b); this was the characteristic eye-form of the Tapajo potters.37 The coffee-bean eye is fairly common, but cannot be considered at all typ- ical of Marajo; an example is plate 95-b. The dough- nut eye, so generally employed on Greater Antillean pottery, is extremely rare on Marajo ware? and is never found on important pieces; it may be seen on the sherd, 105-g. One form which is strikingly charac- teristic of NMarajo is the eye with the drooping lid (see pls. 93 and94).NMany of the finest urns are deco- rated with faces having this form of eye; sometimes the eyeball is definitely depicted, sometimes it is not represented. The drooping lid is strongly suggestive of the eye in death and so is quite appropriate for urn decoration.38 A trait characteristic not only of Marajo but also of Tapajo pottery39 is the enclosed eye area (see pls. 78-a and b, 86-a, 88). Frequently two pairs of such eyes appear on the neck of a pot with a con- ventionalized element suggesting a nose between each pair, making two faces. In addition, handles on the sides between the faces often suggest a nose when the pot is turned with the handles facing front. This arrangement creates four faces; no matter which way the pot is turned a face is suggested (see pl. 86-a and p1. 49). HANDLES Much of the Marajo pottery is entirely without han- dles or suggestion of handles. This is especially true of the white engraved wares (pls. 17-a and 18-a) and the white wares with red retracings (pls. 23-e and f and 29). A considerable proportion of the champ-leve and the polychrome wares are also handleless. A high percentage of Marajo pottery is heavy and not adapted to lifting by handles or carrying by a cord. Such handles as are indicated, therefore, are, in most cases, more of ornamental than of practical value and are added for balance of design or for other decorative effect. This point is illustrated by such figures as plates 49-b, 89-a, 92-c. On the other hand, small vessels sometimes have conspicuous handle forms, but again, these are in no sense utilitarian; an example is plate 43-a. True handles usually originate in the rim and ex- tend to a point on the body of the vessel forming a loop (pls. 44-b, and 106-a, h, and i and 107-b and c). Only very rarely a sherd appears with a looped han- dle on top of the rim, such a one may be seen on plate 106-g. Holes appear in a great many rim sherds sug- gesting either provision for suspension or decoration 37 Palmatary, 1939: 51. 38 Ladislau Netto, 1885: 408. 39 Palmatary, 1939: fig. 33 b, e, f, g.</page><page sequence="68">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) TIlE POTTERY: STYLISTIC ANALYSIS 327 by feathers - probably the latter. In the Museu Goeldi there are some heavy rim orna- ments seemingly designed for the passage of a cord. Plate 102-e is a sherd from a shallow dish, while d on the same plate seems to have belonged to a deep dish or pot. There are two holes in the back of the figure on the latter and a large one facing the interior of the vessel. On the basis of a single sherd, it is often difficult to come to any conclusion of value con- cerning the actual function of many of the Mlarajo handles. An important fragment is the handle figured on plate 107-a. This is the only one of this type I have seen in Marajo6 collections, but it is a carefully made piece. MINIATURE POTTERY In almost all of the Marajo collections there are a few miniature vessels. These are usually crudely fashioned, seemingly without any serious effort to produce an article of merit. Sometimes these little pots are decorated with a bit of modeling or engrav- ing, occasionally they are painted in a single color or in polychrome, such as the tiny dish shown on plate 105-b. Some miniature pottery has been found in burial urns, whether such types were intended as toys or as funerary pottery is matter for conjecture (pl. 105- b, c, e, f). Mordini found slightly larger forms, beauti- fully decorated, at both Panellas and Teso dos Gentios (pls. 4-f and 5-e). PERSONAL ORNAMENTS Type I. Tangas The natives of Portuguese possessions in both Asia and Africa refer to the piece of cloth used to cover the pubic area of the body as a "tanga." The word originally came from the price, in Asia, of a piece of cloth large enough to serve this purpose. Brazilian tribes have names in their own dialects for these bits of wearing apparel, made usually in modern times of feathers or vegetable fibers, but the native name of the carefully made and beautifully decorated triangular clay ornaments worn by the women of an- cient Marajo is a secret which lies buried with the scanty remains of those who wore them.40 However, according to Cruls, 41 the word for tanga in the Aruan tongue, which prevailed on at least a portion of Marajo in pre-Columbian times, is babal, meaning "apron." This author further states that, for a considerable time, the function of the tanga was not discerned, due principally to the fact that at first only small fragments were found. To some observers the concavity of these suggested that they might have served as spoons. Later, when complete specimens were recovered, the caboclos or campo folk of Marajo6 40 Ladislau Netto, editorial note to Hartt, 1876: 21. 41 Cruls, 1942: 189. called them dragonas, epaulettes. Finally, a little figurine was unearthed which was wearing an imita- tion tanga; from then on, in popular Marajo parlance, tangas became saias, skirts. D. Heloisa Alberto Torres 42 reports that, in sorne cases, tangas have been found attached to female bur- ial urns. Thus the use of the tanga on ancient Nlarajo seems beyond dispute. Mordini points out 43 that the use of the ceramic tanga, or babal, was limited to klarajod and, in the opinion of Nimruendajui, to a culture which was pre- Aruan. Hartt makes the following observations on the manufacture and form of the tanga: 1. The tanga is usually mnade of a very fine clay which, when exposed to the fire, becomes dark throughout, taking on a reddish black tone. 2. After-firing, both surfaces of the tanga were smoothed with much care, then covered with a white, cream-colored or red slip which, when baked, produced a hard and polished surface. A little more attention was given to the prepara- tion of the upper than to the under side of the tanga. 3. All tangas have the same triangular form. One of the surfaces is convex and usually ornamented, the other con- cave and without ornament. 4. The upper side of the triangle is the longest and is always curved convexly; the sides are shorter and their curve is concave. 5. At a distance of from V2 to % inch from each of the three extremities of the triangle is a little hole. This is evidently designed for the passage of a cord, because the upper, or convex surface, alrmost always shows a groove more or less deep. The grooves which correspond to the two upper angles do not take the exact direction of the angles, but that of a point a little above them; the groove which corresponds to the lower angle, when it exists, is always on a direct line with the angle. 6. The depth of the grooves varies with the tangas, demonstrating the extent to which each has been used. The direction of the grooves indicates perfectly that of the cord s. 7. Taking into consideration the form of the tanga, its size and the direction of the grooves, its use seems to be clear . In the opinion of Ladislau Netto, tangas were a cor- relative to phallic worship; if this be correct, it would probably account for the great care bestowed upon the fabrication and decoration of these orna- 45 ments. Costa has suggested that the tanga may have been used only ceremonially, and gives as his reason the discomfort such an article would engender if worn for any considerable length of time.46 Mordini believes that the greater part of the tangas recovered were customarily worn, the evidence being the impressions made by the rubbing of the cord at the corners; but, in his opinion, a certain number were too thick and of insufficient curvature to have served practical purpose. These, he believes, were ceremoni- 42 Alberto Torres, 1940: XIII. 43Mordini, 1929: 42. 44Hartt 1876: 22. 45 Ladislau Netto, 1885: 436. 46Costa, 1941: 7etseq.</page><page sequence="69">328 PALNMATARY: TIIE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. al objects destined only for the funerary urns of 47 women. Tangas of various sizes have been found. Some are small ancl suitable only for children, others are of proportions adapted to adults. A fair number are un- painted; these are usually made of clay of reddish hue. A few are covered with a thin wash of white; some are painted all red. But the majority of tangas which appear in museum collections are beautifully decorated in polychrome or, more often, in dichrome. The background of the decorated tangas is almost always all white, cream-color, or a light tan. The de- signs are in various tones of red and of brown; black also is used more or less frequently. As far as I know, no two tangas have ever been found on which the designs were entirely identical. Mliss Alberto Torres has made the interesting ob- servation that the designs on these decorated tangas look as if they had been cut out of a strip of textile - that is, there is always a border at the top and the suggestion of one at the bottom, while the motifs on the sides are incomplete. She further points out the similarity between some of these top borders and those on baskets made by modern Indians in the Rio Branco area. These same Indians also use in their basketry certain motifs which were commonly em- ployed in various decorative techniques on ancient NMarajo pots. To what extent the Marajo potters were also makers of textiles we do not know. There are no cloth or bas- ketry impressions on their vessels, and the items in collections which can be interperted as spindle- whorls are few. In this study, the superior band which Miss Alberto Torres refers to may be seen on the decorated tangas figured on plates 102-i, j, k; 103-b, d, e; 104-b, cd, g. NMordini49 has called attention to the important fact that the tangas found at Severino, only a few miles east of Pacoval, differ from those of the latter site in that they lack this basketry-like upper border and that they sometimes display anthropomorphic motifs. For these and other reasons he regards Pacoval and Severino as divergent expressions of the same civili- zation. He further contrasts tangas from these two sites: The babal of the Island of Pacoval are of various dimen- sions. They are made of very coarse clay containing a peb- bly inclusion and, especially in the large section, show microscopically an admixture of siliceous bark which the Indians had gathered from certain trees on the shores of the lake and had used to give greater strength and elasticity to their ceramics. The firing is imperfect and superficial. Generally the outer surface is covered with a whitish slip, the under surface is only partially covered. Some of the more primitive specimens are uniformly covered by hand with a plain red coat, which is not very tenacious and may be removed by rubbing. Better finished pieces have red 47 Mordini, 1930: 63. 48 Alberto Torres, 1940: XI et s eq. 49NMordini, 1929: 42 et seq. rectilinear designs over a basic white wash. More rarely designs are executed in sepia on a grey or cream back- ground. Some specimens are decorated in the pattern Goeldi designated "escalade"50 in describing certain urns from Counany, Brazilian Guiana.... In 1925 Dr. Estevao de Oliveira obtained from the Teso of Severino... a certain number of babal which presented characteristics whichi assigned them to a culture superior to that of Pacoval. These consisted of better quality of paste and coloring materials, better decorative technique, greater richness in ornamental motifs, rectilinear designs anthropo- morphic in character.... In this study the pieces known to have come from Severino are plate 102-f and h. I strongly suspect that the tangas figured on plate 103-a, c, f, are also Severino pieces, both because they present charac- teristics of design described above and because much of the material at the American NMuseum of Natural History was obtained from Lange who states that he dug a site six miles east of Pacoval but does not re- cord its name. Severino is in that general locality. Whether or not the elaborateness, simplicity or total lack of decoration on these important personal orna- ments may or may not have indicated gradations in social status, we have no means of knowing. It is probable, however, that a people as highly skilled in the arts as the Marajoans would have had also a rather well-developed social organization, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that tangas merely daubed with red or white paint may have been worn by a slave element in the population. Bird has made the following interesting observation: The decoration of tangas seems to have been limited to painted designs; neither engraving nor nmodeling nor champ- leve seem to have been within their decorative tradition.51 The colors on the tangas illustrated are as follows: P1. 102-f, Sepia on cream.

Mordini found a necklace of pierced animal teeth at Panellas; this is the only instance concerning which I have any infor- mation. Type III. Ear Plugs Ladislau Netto figures a few ear plugs but does not describe them.53 One in the University Museum's col- lection is illustrated on plate 105-d. Type IV. Lip Ornaments (Tembetas) (?) A small object found by C. Quadrone at Panellas (pl. 105-k). Regarding it Mordini says: ...It is roughly cylindrical with a projection from one side. It is made of a grey-green stone, slightly oily to the touch, probably a jadeite or nephrite. This is the stone which was used by an unknown tribe (perhaps Tupi'), which lived in the middle or lower Amazon, in the making of their so-called Muyrakita or "Amazon stones," amulets con- cerning which there is a rich literature.... To my knowledge, no similar object has been found on Marajo6. It may have been a lip ornament or tembeta, a hypo- thesis highly probable since, according to the information given to me by my friend -Curt Nimuendaju,... lip ornaments of similar form, but made of resin, are currently used by various tribes of northwestern Matto Grosso of whom one is the Sanamalka of the upper Rio Machado.54 The finding of any nephrite object on NMarajo is most unusual, although Penna reported finding a Muirakitan on Pacoval.55 RIMS Rim forms of Marajo pottery seem almost infinite in variety. Any adequate investigation of this subject would, in itself, constitute a major study. The present purpose is merely to illustrate and discuss briefly a few of the commoner forms. An important characteristic of Marajo pottery is the frequent use of the hollow rim. Generally speaking, there seems to be little correlation in Marajo ceramics between rim type and ware; however, an exception may be that wares decorated exclusively in dichrome or polychrome seem not to have been finished with hollow rims. Whether this peculiarity was due to a time element or whether it was not within the Marajo tradition so to employ hollow rims is as yet a problem. Hollow rims, and also hollow cylinders which sur- rounded the shoulders of some of their better vessels, were much in vogue among the Tapajo. This tribe which lingered on, greatly reduced in numbers, until the middle of the eighteenth century, may have bor- rowed the hollow-rim idea prehistorically from their somewhat distant island neighbors. There are, how- ever, two important differences between the tech- 52 Ladislau Netto, 1885: 441. 53Ibid.. 440. 54Mordini, 1936: 25. 55 See section on Sites. niques from the Marajo and Tapajo sites - one is that the Marajo Indians did not use the surrounding hollow cylinder; the other is that while the Tapajo hollow cylinders and hollow rims apparently were always per- forated before firing, at least some of the Mlarajo hol- low rims seemingly were not. I do not recall ever hav- ing seen a perforation in a Mlarajo hollow rim sherd, and many of the Nlarajo rattles and figurines appear to have been fired without an aperture. An interesting example is the bowl figured in plate 14-b. The rim had been broken and mended but was complete, its exterior thus giving no suggestion of hollowness. One day a section loosened and fell out, revealing its real nature. I took it at once to Dr. Vladimir Fewkes for examination, and neither he nor I could detect any evidence of perforation; the seg- ment fitted perfectly into the remainder of the rim. Hollow rims usually appear on the finer types of engraved wares, often, but not always, on wares which have been decorated with blunt-instrument en- graving and retraced with color which contrasts with that on the main body of the vessel. The bowl referred to has an unusually simple form of hollow rim. Mlore typical examples may be seen on plates 38-a, c, g and 39-j. Concerning hollow rims Linne makes the following statement: Vessels found in Venezuela (pottery fragments in the Ethnological Museum at Leipzig), on the lower Amazon (G.M. 23. 10. 546), and in Tarupayu in Bolivia (G.M. 15. 2. 55), are occasionally provided with a hollow rim, often al- together closed up. How through the firing-process it was possible to guard against the air enclosed in the cavity bursting the sur- rounding walls during the heating, is an interesting ques- tion. To me, the most natural and simple explanation seems to be as follows. Mizque ceramics, for example, which are hard and give a ringing note on tapping, may be supposed to have been fired at a temperature of at least 8000. According to the law of expansion of gases, the air enclosed in the cavity must, when being heated, have ex- panded to about four times its volume. If it be supposed that vessels were subjected to slow heating, the air should easily be able to diffuse at least up to 4000. Its increase in volume should during the remainder of the firin, thus only amount to twice the original volume. Even then diffu- sion would take place, although on a lesser scale. The critical point in the firing therefore only occurs during its latter stage. The durable consistency of the paste leads one to suppose that it would be able to withstand such pressure, provided the temperature be not too rapidly raised. Great caution would also have to be observed in the cooling, so as to allow the air to pass again through the walls.56 Figure 4 features a selection of rim types from the large sherd collection of the American Museum of Nat- ral History.

Three of the foregoing pieces, nos. 12, 13, 14, are atypical for Marajo, as far as form is concerned, but are characteristic of Santaremn pottery where an ex- tension below the rim proper, sometimes a sort of shoulder-flange, is common. Of these three pieces, no. 14 is unpainted, 13 is covered with a white wash, and 12 is red champ-leve with white inlay. M\1uch of Santarem pottery is unpainted, but plain white paint would be most unusual there and, as far as I know, the champ-leve technique was not employed by the Tapajo potters. It would therefore seem that no real correlation was involved. Numbers 8, 10, 11 are pieces of polychronie con- centric dishes; these three specimens show an inden- tation in the rim; on the other hand polychrome con- centric dishes sometimes have very simple rims (see pl. 80-a and c). Still anotlher type of rim. not unusual on concentric dishes is that figured in plate so-b; another common form is illustrated by plate 55-a. The large burial urns seem usually to hiave hadl rather simple rims; that many of these are rnissing seems to indicate that they were heavy and over- hanging and broke under the weight of heavy lids anal the overlying earth (plS. 8o-b, 96-b). Small anthropo- morphic figures are frequently placed in hanidle posi- tion underneath these overhanging rims but rarely dis- play any supporting value, that is, they are not true caryatids (pls. 89-b, 94-a). Simple overhans,ing rinms are frequently found also on smnaller ?olychrorrTe vessels (pl. 84-a). Two-lipped rims are common on white engraved wares but are not limtited to those wares (pl. 21-c and d). Flat-topped rim-s, such as featured on plate 70-c, are not common on any ware. A common form of rim. is that shown in reconstruc- tion on plate 92-b. Rims which are triangular in profile are fairly corr- mon on unpainted wares (pl. 10-a). Other characteristic rims are figured on plates 36 to 40 inclusive. CORRELATIONS The following pages summarize my efforts to search for cultural connections between the Amazon and other archeological areas on the basis of pottery form- types and decorative devices. I have limited this study to the rather unusual or significant traits and tried to avoid those of a simple or general nature. In my research I have considered all of South America, the Antilles, Panama, Central America, Middle Ameri- ca, and the Southern Miound Area of the United States. ELEMENTS OF FORM BOTTLES Intricate Bottles Intricate bottles of a special type seem to have been characteristic of certain Marajo wares, particu- larly the white engraved wares retouched with red. I have seen but one complete specimen, that figured on plate 26-a, but in the collection of the American Mu- seum of Natural History and also in the Museu Goeldi there are fragments of several. These bottles consist of four hollow zoomorphic figures, two resting upon, two developing from, and all four corporate with, a bowl-like lower section. The figures are united by their arms and two support the neck which rests upon a stirrup-like connection be- tween them. Similar bottles are not common in American arche- ology, but comparable forms, much simpler in design, have been reported from the Mississippi Valley' - plate 110-a and b are from Arkansas; these two have two and three supports respectively to the mouth section. An interesting piece, found at the junction of the Wabash and Ohio Rivers, has four supports and thus is closer to the Amazonian form (pl. 110-c). Long-Necked Bottles on a Flaring-Ring Base This form of bottle (pl. 20-a) is rare in Marajo, but J.2 the general form is common in Santarem and fairly so in the Mississippi Valley. 3 CARYATII)S Modeled anthropomorphic figures are frequently used in handle position under the broad, flaring rims of the big Marajo burial urns (pls. 89-b, 94-a, 95-b). Only rarely are they really of any supporting value 1 Holmes, 1903: pl. XVIII, figs. e and f. 2 Palmatary, 1939: fig. 5. 3 Iolmes, 1898: pl.

The Marajoans did not introduce into their pot- tery the true free-standing caryatid so characteristic of designs from Santarern, Chiriqui, and Costa Rica. FYE - FORMS One of the characteristics of the pottery of the Tapa jo was the round-rimmed protuberant eye; this type w as generally used on the many vitamorphic forms with which they decorated their wares. 4 The Marajoans, on the contrary, seemed to use no partic- ular eye-form preponderantly; instead, they used many f orms. Both Marajo6 and Tapajo eyes were frequently en- closed in a sort of eye-area, the confining element usually having been a band in relief.5 This eye area is often more or less ovoid in shape with the broad end toward the nose, while the narrower one some- times tapers down and occasionally ends in a scroll (pls. 30-a, 75-a, 83-b, 97-b). Polychrome wares from Cocle have a painted area around the eye of much the same shape as the enclosed eye-area of the Amazon. 6 On a few of the stone figures at San Agustl'n, Colom- bia, there is a suggestion of the Amazonian eye-area .7 An eye-forrm which is definitely characteristic of Marajo is the half-closed eye represented in relief. As far as I know, this eye appears only on polychrome burial jars (pls. 89-b, 94-a). Ladislau Netto has stug- gested that it was intended to suggest the eye in death.8 On the stone figures of San Agusti'n this eye is conspicuously represented. Spinden'0 discusses a series of eyes as depicted on archaic figurines, but not any of these types can be said to be of frequent appearance on Nlarajo wares. FIGURINES Crescent-Based The Tapajo of Santarem made a variety of figurines, both male and female. The type, however, which stands out preeminently as characteristic of this area is a footless female form which suggests a seated figure and which, when turned upside down, has a flat crescent-shaped base. The arms are usually free- modeled and the hands rest on the abdomen. This type of figurine appears frequently not only in the archeology of Santarem but also in that of Lago Grande, thirty miles to the west, and it has been re- ported as far up the Amazon as the Rio Teffe. It is illustrated on plate 108-a. The figurines of Marajo are somewhat different. 4Palmatary, 1939: 51. 5lbid.: fig. 33-b, e. 6Lothrop, 1942: figs. 172, 201-b, 203, 206-g, and others. 7Preuss, 1931: Tomo II, Planchas 42, 43, 53. 8Ladislau Netto, 1885: 408. 9Preuss, 1931: Tomo II, Planchas 24, 30, 33, 35, 36, 44, 46. loSpinden, 1928: 57. 11eMtraux, 1930: fig. 9. Usually they represent figures which seem to be squatting rather than sitting; the knees are therefore raised and prominent. No legs or feet are indicated. Turned upsicbe down, the bottom is flat and generally crescentic, but the extremities of the crescent are rounded rather than pointed. There are two general types with regard to arms: those with arms more or less naturally represented (pl. 6-d and e), and those with stub-like arms (pl. 6-f and g in unpainted wares, pl. 100-b, c, and f in polychrome). In the polychrome wares these figurines sometimes display some sug- gestion of toes (pl. 101-c). Sex is not always indi- cated but, when so, it is female. Certain highly styl- ized forms have been considered phalliform. 2 Figurines are plentiful in Venezuela and many types are represented within this geographical area. Several writers have reported examples of the Santarem type; some of these are male, some female. 13 The Maraj6 form also appears in Venezuela but only rarely; 14 this is in conformity to the archeology in general of the areas concerned - Venezuela vessel-forms are close- ly related to those of Santarem, but only remotely re- semble types characteristic of Marajo. From Santa Marta and Cocle the crescent-based figurine seems not to have been reported; however the Santarem type appears again, and conspicuously, in Chiriqui pottery. In this area the crescent-based figu- rines are frequently represented holding an infant, and NIcCurdy states that they all belong to the alligator ware.15 In N,icaraguan archeology, also, the Santarem type appears, but only occasionally. 16 In Middle America crescent-based figurines similar to Amazo- nian types are very rare. 17 Spinden discusses 18 a series of figurines which he considers evidence of an archaic culture which ex- tended from Middle America through the Isthmus to northern South America. In this series he includes crescent-based forms from Panama and Marajo; how- ever many of the other types he includes in this cate- gory of archaic forms would be most unusual on the Amazon. In the archeology of the Lower Mississippi Valley two types of small pots are commnonly encountered which seem curiously similar in form to the crescent- based figurines of the Amazon. One type represents a kneeling figure, the legs depicted in a rudimentary fashion by a strip of clay on the under surface of the vessel. One which suggests the Santarem type of figurine is that represented on plate 108-b; this comes from the Bradley Place, Crittenden Co., Arkansas, 2 Ladislau Netto, 1885: 334 et seq. 13Bennett, 1937: fig. 12; Kidder, 1944: pl.

In the Dominican Republic small effigy pots ap- pear which have a definitely crescent-shaped base; plate 108-c and d figures one which is a hunchback; conventionalized feet appear on the back; plate 108-e and f figures another type which is not a hunchback but on this one also feet are suggested on the back. These Dominican Republic pots are closer in form to the Maraj6o type of figurine than they are to that of Santarem, because on all of them the knees are prom- inent and the tips of the crescent are rounded. As far as I know feet are never indicated on the back of Marajo figurines - that is a Mississippi Valley trait and suggests that these Dominican Republic forms may be related to both areas. In summary, it may be said that, in the case of the Santarem type of figurine, the connection with the Mississippi Valley may have been through Venezuela and the Isthmus; on the other hand the Marajo6 type, while it appears in Venezuela, seems more closely related to the Dominican Republic forms than to those of the North American mainland. In Marajo collections a curious form of finished vessel occurs which represents the lower half of a crescent-based figurine. The best example is shown on plate 8-d. A slightly different form is illustrated on plate 12-f; this piece includes the trunk but lacks a head. A hunchbacked specimen is figured on plate 47-a. No pots of this general type appeared in any of the Santarem collections studied, nor do they seem to have been reported from Venezuela nor from other areas to the north apparently related to Amazonian cultures archeologically. Strangely enough, however, a perfect example occurs in the archeology of the Puye of the Rio Grande (pl. 108-g). Neither crescent-based figurines nor the type of small vessel just described seem to have been re- ported from areas south of the Amazon or west of the Ande s. Pedestal Armless figurines, suggesting a pedestal in their general form, appear in Marajo but are rare there (pl. 101-b). Requena shows two excellent examples of this type from Venezuela. Similar forms seem not to have been reported from other areas. FLANGES Decorative Below the Rim These flanges do not appear on Marajo pottery, but 19 Moore, 1911: 247. 20Ibid.: figs. 72 and 73. 21 Requena, 1932: 71 and 119. are a striking characteristic of Santarerm wares. 22 They are reported with fair frequency from the north- 23 west Gulf Area. HANDLES Mlultiple M5ultiple handles are rare in Mlarajo (pI. 20-b), but Al24 common on Santarem wares. They appear, but rarely so, in Venezuela, Chiriqui, and Costa Rica;25 however they are strikingly characteristic of certain Nlissis- sippi and Ohio Valley wares and have been reported also from Alabama and Florida. 26 NECKS Bulbous with Outward Recurve A Santarem trait27 which appears, but rarely so, in Cocle. 8 It has been reported with fair frequency from the Ouachita Valley.2 Inset Elaborate necks with a cup-like space between the base of the neck and the body of the vessel do not appear30 in Marajo, but are common on Santarem wares. The type has been reported also from the northwest Gulf Coast. 31 Long, Bulbous (it the Base This32 type of bottle neck is common on Tapajo wares. Elaborate necks are rare in Marajo pottery, but there is one complete vessel in the form of a Tapajo neck (pl. 20-a). Necks similar to this Santarem type have been reported from the Lower Mississippi Valley. RIMS Hollow Judging from the large number of sherds with hollow rims in the collections studied, many of the finest pieces of Marajo pottery must have been completed with a rim in this technique. A few examples may be seen on plates 37-b; 38-a, e, g; 39-j. The hollow rim is common in the archeology of Santarem and, in addition, in that c ulture vessels were frequently decorated by a hollow cylinder which encircled the body. There was no evidence of the latter type of ornament in the Marajo collections ex- amined. 22Palmatary, 1939: figs. 1 and 12. 23 Moore, 1902: fig. 124; 1903: fig. 3; 1918: pl. 15, fig. 24Palmatary, 1939: figs. 15 and 16. 25Holmes, 1884: figs. 51-f and 136; Hartmann, 1901: pl. 22 - 2. 26Idem., 1898: pls.

In Santarem, as far as could be determined, hollow rims were always perforated. There was no complete hollow rim in any of the collections studied; thus judgment in this matter was based upon the fact that many hollow rim sherds were perforated.34 In Marajo, hollow rims were not always perforated if, indeed, they were at all. Linne35 makes the fol- lowing statement with regard to such rims: In South American ceramics we now and then meet with vessels having hollow feet that are completely closed up. In intact vessels the presence of cavities can be detected through the fact that these generally contain pellets of clay, clay fragments, etc., which give them the character of rattles.... Vessels found in Venezuela (pottery fragments in the Ethnological Museum at Leipzig), on the Lower Amazon (G. M. 23. 10. 546), and in Tarupayu in Bolivia (G. M. 15. 2. 55), are occasionally provided with a hollow rim, often altogether closed up.... In the archeology of Venezuela, the hollow rim is not uncommon, though it never there achieved either the quality of craftmanship or the numerical frequency which characterized it in Amazonia. Near Tocoron, in the Lake Valencia region, Osgood found two hollow rims, one of which he describes as "rolled outward and then bent into the wall, leaving a small aper- ture," while the other was "turned inward and then down to the wall, creating a large enclosed air s pace. " Bennett has reported out-rolled rims from the s ame area. In the State of Falcon, Nomland found numerous in-rolled hollow rims; the workman- ship on some of them was excellent and, in deco- ration, they closely resembled out-rolled sherds from Santarem. From the Paraguana Peninsula, which juts out from Northern Venezuela into the Caribbean, Osgood and Howard report hollow rims on open bowls. Three of the specimens were gray and two white- slipped; all were decorated by applied nodes or fillets .39 The Dutch West Indies seem to be the northernmost area from which true hollow rims have been reported.40 Compared with the Amazonian specimens, these ap- pear crude both in conception and technique. Whether they represent the inception of the hollow-rim idea or the northern outpost of its expression is an interest- ing problem. In what appears to have been an out-rolled form, the hollow rim was found by Nordenski6ld on funerary urns at Tarupayu, Bolivia. 41 The nearest approach to the hollow rim technique in Southern Mound archeology seems to have been 34Palmatary, 1939: figs. 11-a, 28-b, d, g. 35Linne, 1925: 129. 36Osgood, 1943: 27et seq. 37 Bennett, 1937: 94. 38Nomland, 1935: 33, 34, 40, 49, 64; figs. 14-c, e, 15-a, b, d e, f, o. 33Osgood and Howard, 1943: 65. 40Josselin de Jong, 1918: 70 et seq., figs. 23, 23-a, pi.

VESSELS Concentric Dishes The Tapajo and the Marajo Indians each made a type of concentric dish which seems not to appear in other areas. At Santarem these dishes were unsup- ported; 42 on Marajo they were supported by a flaring- ring base (pl. 80). Cylindroid Vessels with a Bulbous Lower Section A pottery form which is strikingly common in the archeology of Marajo is that which consists of a cyl- indroid upper section and a bulbous lower section. There are two types of these vessels, one in which the upper and lower sections are distinct with a defi- nite line of demarcation between them, and a second form in which the two sections merge. Plates 43-b, 53-c, 63-b illustrate the former; plates 18-a and c, 19-c, 41-k, 49-a, 54-a are examples of the latter. These forms appear in several of the more important engraved wares, but I do not recall ever having seen a polychrome piece which could be placed in either of these classifications. Vessels composed of a cylindroid upper section and a bulbous lower section seem not to have been com- mon in pre-Columbian America. A few pieces an- swering to this general description have been reported from the Mexican coastal state of Vera Cruz, where both forms appear to have existed, 43 but an area where such forms seem to have been fairly plentiful is that of the nortlheastern Gulf Coast: plate 109-d figures a vessel on which tne sections are distinct, from a site on the Lower Chattahooche, while c on the same plate illustrates one from the Apalachicola River, in which the sections are merged. In addition to these, Moore reports several others from the same general area.44 The general form appears also in Caddoan archeology: Harrington reports examples of the type in which the two sections are distinct;45 Moore also reports speci- mens from the Red River Valley.46 The type in which the two sections are merged seems to have been rare in the Mounds, though in Marajo6 both types are equal- ly common. Four-Lobed Vessels A characteristic of the archeology of Santarem, is the vessel with four lobes. The Tapajo usually em- ployed this form only for rather small vessels. In Marajo, however, the four-lobed or the four-shouldered pot is common, it appears in several wares and often characterizes vessels of fine craftsmanship and con- 42 Palmatary, 1939: fig. 15. 43 Drucker, 1943: pls. 16-c and d, 21-c, 22-a and d. 44 Moore, 1902: figs. 12, 152, 339; 1918: fig. 25. 45 Harrington, 1920: pls.

Examples may be seen on plates 18-e; 19-a, b, d; 20-c; 45-a; 84-a; 89-a. Four-lobed vessels have been reported from Cocle,47 Mexico, 48 Trinidad, 49 and the Dominican Republic, 50 but they are extremely rare in all these areas. The only areas outside Amazonia where they appear con- spicuously are northwestern Florida 51 (pl. 109-e) and the Lower Mississippi Valley, 52 although they are not uncommon as far north as Missouri.53 Some of the four-lobed vessels from Santarem are decorated with a series of concentric circles which partially cover each lobe.54 Similar decoration ap- pears occasionally on Marajo pottery (pls. 19-b and 20-c). This combination of form-type and decoration appears also with fair frequency in the Lower Missis- sippi Valley (109-g). A striking example of similarity in form between an Amazonian piece and one from the Mounds may be seen by comparing the M'arajo four-lobed piece on plate 45-a and the vessel from northwestern Florida on plate 109-f. I have examined both of them. They are about the same size and both consist of a four- lobed upper section supported by a hollow, circular basal section. It is of interest that the four-lobed vessel should be so common in the archeology of the Lower Amazon and the area around the Gulf Coast, and seemingly so lacking in intervening areas. Multi-Part Dishes Vessels consisting of two more or less identical units were common in pre-Columbian America. To the best of my present knowledge they do not appear in the archeology of Santarem, but on Marajo they took the form of two shallow, broad-mouthed, closely as- sociated units such as have been termed "siamese dishes." Examples are figured on plate 70-d, which is unsupported, and plate 31-c which has an annular foot. In a slightly different form the first-mentioned type appears in the archeology of Trinidad (pl. 110-d), Carriacou,55 Haiti, the Dominican Republic,57 north- west Florida (pl. 110-e), Middle Mississippi Valley,58 southwestern Colorado (pl. 110-f). In Middle America similar forms are rare, only one piece having been found in the course of research (USNM 284124, Sta. Cruz de Quiche, Guatemala); this piece, however, had diminutive feet.

A two-part ladle is figured on Ulate l1O-g; its provenience is southwestern Colorado. These double-dish forms seem unrelated in size and shape to the so-called "candeleros" of highland Mexico. u Two-part forms featuring more completely independ- ent, but still identical, units, sometimes with handles or feet and occasionally with both, appear in the ar- cheology of Arkansas,63 in Costa Rica, 64 and in Chiriqui. 65 Similar forms seem not to have reached the Lower Amazon. The collection of the Mluseu Nacional in Rio de Janeiro contains one specimen of a five-part dish (pl. 74-b). The only other instances of comparable vessels which I have been able to locate in the course of re- search are those whose provenience is northern Flor- ida; this type of vessel is common in the northwest-ern part of the state66 (pI. 110-i and j) and has been re- ported from the St. John's River area also. 67 It would be difficult to state with certainly whether the fragment figured on plate 74-a belonged to a three- part or a five-part dish. Three-part dishes, flat bot- tomed and footless, have been reported from north- western Florida.68 Spout at Right Angles to B3ody The actual use of these little vessels (pl. 42-d and e) is a matter for conjecture. As has been previously stated, the suggestion has been made that a stick or a reed might have been placed in the spout, which is usually quite short, and the whole thing used cere- monially as a sort of spoon or dipper. These vessels are common in engraved and champ-leve wares but I do not recall ever having seen one in polychrome. They are always carefully made and usually show traces of painted decoration on the inside. In Trinidad (pl. 107-e) and also in Barbados there were similar little vessels but they had two lateral spouts on the same side. As far as I know these two- spouted pieces do not occur in Marajo.

PRico Rainey 70 found ...three rim fragments with tubular spouts about 4 centi- meters long. In all three cases it can be determined that the spouts were attached approximately 1 centimeter below the lip and at right angles to the wall of the vessel. The rim fragments suggest shallow round bowls but the complete shape cannot be determined. From this description it would seem that the ves- sels to which these spouts belonged were probably very similar to the Nlarajo spouted vessels as the measurements given and the position of the spout with reference to the -vessel wall coincide closely with the Amazonian form. The only reference I have seen to vessels having a single lateral spout comparable to those of Marajo is that of E. H. Morris in his study of the La Plata dis- trict of southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico. 71 In this he figures three vessels with lateral spouts and states that they represent a characteristic shape in all Basket M5aker III localities and that their function is unknown. The size of these vessels is ap- proximately the same as that of the Mviarajo pieces, but the spout is proportionately longer and the bowl more globoid; another difference which might be significant is that the Amazon pieces are always decorated while the La Plata pieces used as illustrations are not. There may be no relation between the areas referred to, but similar problematical pieces in both seems worth recording. Superimposed Forms with Scalloped Profile In ancient America there was an interesting and wide-spread custom of basing the design of the more elaborate vessels upon a pile of corrimon household pots, or a jar set within a pot, or a bowl placed over another vessel as a covering. In my study of Tapajo pottery I referred to the scalloped profile of vessels which owe their form to such inspiration. In Nlarajo, also, this scalloped profile is sometimes quite marked; the form of the pot figured on plate 11-d is based upon two similar bowls, the smaller placed in the mouth of the larger, the rim of the lower bowl fur- nishing part of the decoration; figure e on the same plate represents a bowl with a truncated conoidal lower section supporting a handled jar. Plate 14-e was suggested by a shallow bowl resting on the mouth of a globular jar, while plate 32-d is a series of three bowls graduated in size, the largest on the bottom, the smallest on the top. The scalloped profile is con- spicuous on all these pieces. Tapajo pottery is often very ornate. Sometimes the idea basic to a piled-up vessel's form is obvious (pl. 112-d) while others, also of piled up origin and illustrative of the more highly developed Tapajo types, retain the scalloped profile but, in the process of evolution, have been modified and beautified until their original compound form is no longer strikingly 70Rainey, 1940: 20. 7lMorris, 1939: pl. 189-a, b, c. evident. 72 In the funerary caverns of the Rio Cunani in the littoral of Brazilian Guiana, Goeldi found beautiful pottery, in decoration quite different from that of Maraj6, but related to it in form. Some of the urns used for cremated remains display a profile which is irregu- larly scalloped, the form of most of them having been based on the piled-up principle. In the Cunani' pottery the lower vessel is usually a broad-mouthed bowl or jar with a truncated conoidal lower section over which is placed a rounded shoulder and a neck, but the line of demarcation between the bowl and the upper sec- tion is always clear, suggesting compound origin.73 The jar figured on plate 112-c is an interesting piece. It comes from the Rio Cassipore, also in Brazilian Guiana. Its compound design is evident and its scroll decoration is strikingly Marajoan. This piece is post-Columbian as it contained glass beads along with the human remains. The piled-up design, practically always involving a scalloped profile, is common in Venezuela. Usually the form of these vessels is based upon a fairly large, more or less globoid, pot upon which rests another which is smaller and also somewhat globoid. Fre- quently the smaller has a face on it, and arms extend from the shoulder of the lower pot to the face on the upper. Both Requena74 and Kidder75 show several ex- amples. From the area around Santa Marta, Colombia, urns have been reported very similar in form to the Vene- zuelan vessels just described, and from La Gloria, Colombia, Linne figures a burial urn and its cover which, in profile, strikingly suggest what may have been the origin of some of the compound forms from this area. 7 From the Quimbaya region of Colombia Bennett reports a vessel which, in design, consists of a wide-mouthed bowl supported by a somewhat globoid jar, the greatest diameter of the jar being less than that of the mouth of the bowl. The result is a profile lacking half of its upper scallop. This partic- ular type of piled-up design did not apptear in any of the Lower Amazon collections studied, but it has been reported occasionally from northwestern Flor- ida, 79 and also from northwestern Argentina. 80 Superimposed forms with a scalloped profile appear in the Panamanian province of Chiriqui, but they are not conspicuous there; 1, Lothrop reports two from Cocle. 8 Occasionally the piled-up type of vessel 72 Palmatary, 1939: figs. 11, 17. 7 Goeldi, 1905: Est.

Ricketson reports one piece from Uaxactun which may be interpeted as one shallow bowl resting in the mouth of another; the profile is scalloped.'M Smith figures a piece from the same area but the pro- file is angular;85 a.t El Arbolillo, Mexico, Vaillant recovered a jar based in design upon the form of a long-necked bottle sitting in a bowl.86 In the Dominican Republic the boat-shaped dish was common. Several jars have been reported which consist, in design, of a boat-shaped dish resting on a globular pot. On these compound dishes the boat- shaped section is sometimes so modified as to look almost as globular as the lower half of the vessel thus the profile becomes rather regularly scalloped.8~ Certain water bottles from this area, also, are scal- loped in profile. A pot from the Province of Santo Domingo figured by Krieger is based upon the form of one globoid bowl supporting another.89 Among the Tapajo and the potters of the Rio Cunanl', the elements which contributed to the scal- loped profile were often obscured owing to the fact that their wares were highly decorated and generally sophisticated in form-development. In Marajo, the ves- sels which belonged to the piled-up category repre- sent with few exceptions the simpler wares of the island, and their component parts are obvious. More evident still, however, are the basic units of com- pound vessels found in the Mississippi Valley and the northeastern Gulf Coast. Griffin shows two crude examples of the piled-up design from Fort Ancient, one representing a globular bowl supporting another of about the same size and shape,90 and a still more interesting piece on which there are two series of handles, one on the lower, one on the upper bowl. Holmes reports a similar vessel from Madisonville, Ohio.91 Plate 108-i of this study figures a piece from Arkansas which represents a small jar resting on a globular bowl; j on the same plate figures a piece from Moundville which consists of a handled jar sup- porting a bottle. In northwestern Florida the scalloped profile based on the compounding of vessels is con- spicuous; plate 108-h is a specimen from the Suwanee River area and Mloore reports several other pieces. 92 Compound types from the North American mounds are 83Ideni., 1926: I, fig. 73-a; II, pl.

South of the Amazon, form-traits based on the com- pounding of vessels are apparent in the archeology of northwestern Argentina. Sometimes in this area the origin of a vessel's form is clearly traceable to the piling up of three pots similar in size and shape such as Bruch describes as "pequeiio vaso de triple cintura." This piece is from Catamarca.93 Sometimes the units are graduated in size such as two beauti- fully colored specimens from the same province re- ported by Outes.94 In both of these examples the low- placed handles, so typical of this area, are attached to the lower section. In Argentinian vessels of this character usually the design and sometimes the color of each section is different, thus emphasizing their compound origin. From Peru, Kroeber reports two small jars, scal- loped in profile, which he describes as Paracas- Cavernas type of pottery from Ocucaje,95 a bottle from the tombs of Moche, 96 and a definitely compounded vessel of red-on-white ware from Chancay. Concerning the latter he says, "There is no clear resemblance to Inca, Tiahuanaco, Chimu, Nasca, or any of the better- known Peruvian styles."97 Strong reports a bottle of the late Ancon II period.98 From Ecuador, Saville shows two compounded ves- sels scalloped in profile.99 In summary, it would seem that piled-up pottery forms, scalloped in profile, are fairly common in Lower Amazonia, including both the Tapajo and Marajo6 cultures, and that they appear comparatively as frequently in the Rio Cunani area to the north. In Venezuela they are perhaps more common than in Amazonia but become less conspicuous toward the Isthmus. In Central and Middle America they are rare. S;imilar forms appear with moderate frequency in the Dominican Republic while in the mounds around the Gulf Coast they are common. The general principle of superimposing pots to make a more elaborate design was commonly employed in northwestern Argentina; sometimes three sections were differently decorated, thus emphasizing their multiple origin. The resulting profile was frequently scalloped, but the fact that these Argentinian pots usually were handled on the lower section removes them from any close correlation with Marajo where such a characteristic never appears. Marajo6 and Tapajo piled-up forms appear more nearly related to superimposed types north of the Amazon. The piled-up trait is not characteristic of South American west- coast cultures. 93 Bruch, 1911: fig. 42. 94Outes, 1907: pl. VII-figs. 3 and 4. 95Kroeber, 1944: pl.

CXII.</page><page sequence="79">338 PALMATARY: THE POTTERY OF MIARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC. Other Superimposed Forms Another superimposed type is figured by Outes and consists of a tall jar with slightly out-curved sides, resting in a handled dish, more or less truncated conoidal in shape; the line of demarcation between the two forms is clearly defined. 100 Without handles these forms would be similar to Mlarajo forms such as those on plate 21. In Marajo, however, vessels of this type never suggest compound origin. The tall, painted urns, so generally associated with northwestern Argentina, also appear to have had com- pound antecedents, a fact which probably accounts for their low-placed handles, so characteristically a part of them. Basically, these jars seem to have been a handled dish supporting a globoid vessel having a long neck or a high flaring collar. In some cases the the upper limit of the supporting dish is made evident 101 by a change in the diameter of the vessel; some- times there is no stricture, but the surface below the handles is differently decorated from that above them. This latter type of decoration is illustrated by two specimens from Tucuman102 reported by Bruch, while on the same plate are two other pieces which have en- tirely lost all suggestion of compound origin, the low- placed handles alone remaining as evidence of their relation to simpler forms.10 Handles of any kind are rare and unimportant on Marajo wares except in a few highly ornamented pieces such as pigment pots, and what handles there are on the larger vessels are never low-placed. The Calchaquian jar with its flaring upper section is not suggestive in profile of any NMarajo or Tapajo form with which I am familiar; piled-up designs in Lower Amazonia seem to consist of a different set of units. It is interesting to note that the Peruvian arybal, also characterized by a conoidal lower section, shows no traces of compound origin. On these jars the han- dles are always placed above the upper limit of the conoidal section and are vertically affixed to facili- tate the passage of a cord; in the case of the Argen- tinian urns the handles are usually placed directly on a line with the upper-limit of the truncated conoidal lower section, only occasionally slightly above or be- low it, and they are affixed horizontally, supposedly for lifting. Summary Piled-up form-traits seem so widely distributed, that at first thought it might appear that this charac- teristic is of little value as a correlating feature. However, there are areas where piled-up designs are conspicuous and others where they are definitely rare. In the Mounds of the United States, the Dominican 100 Outes, 1907: Plancha VI. 101 Ambrosetti, 1906: figs. 46, 98; Outes, 1907: Plancha VII-2; Bregante, 1926: fig. 32. 102Bruch, 1911: figs. 34 and 35; see also fig. 93. 103Ibid., figs. 32, 33. Republic, Venezuela, Brazilian Guiana, Lower Ama- zonia and northwestern Argentina these forms are common. In Middle and Central America and in west- coast South America, they are rare. A few forms in northwestern Argentina are similar to those in Ama- zonia, b)ut very few; Amazonia seems more closely related to cultures to the north. The Truncated Conoidal Lower Section Among the more important Marajo form-traits is the truncated conoidal lower section. This form occurs in all the island's wares of which a considerable number of pieces have been recovered. Some of these trun- cated conoidal sections are undecorated, some rather carelessly painted or engraved, or both, part way to the bottom, while on others the entire surface is as carefully decorated as the upper part of the body of the vessel. Some illustrations in various wares may be seen on plates 9-a, b, c; 10-c, d; 12-g, i; 19-e; 21; 22-a, c, d; 29; 32-c; 33-a, b, c, d; 34; 51-d; 62-b; 63-a; 8-5-a. The purely conoidal lower section such as usually characterizes the Peruvian arybal does not appear in Marajo6 pottery. The truncated conoidal lower section occurs in Tapajo pottery found at Santarem, but it is not con- spicuous there; 104 it appears also in the archeology of the Rio Aguarico in eastern Ecuador (pl. 112-a). The truncated conoidal lower section is common in Venezuela, 105 but much less conspicuous in Colom- bia. 06 In the Antilles it appears in Trinidad (pl. 107- g), and in a somewhat modified form in the Dominican Republ-ic (pl. 107-f), while in Puerto Rico Rainey found a piece suggestive of Marajo not only in form but in decoration as well. Krieger reports what ap- pears to be this same ware frorrm St. Kitts. 108 In northwestern Florida the truncated conoidal lower section is fairly conmmon (pl. 111-d and 112- b); 09 it appears more frequently in the archeology of Arkansas (pl. ll1-g and h). In the Red River Valley it is about as common as in Marajo . 110 In this connection it is interesting to note the similarity in form between the Nlarajo piece (pl. 62-a), the Arkansas vessel (pl. 11l-g), the Florida bowl (pl. 112-b), and the piece found by Rainey in Puerto Rico. In studying these correlations it is sometimes dif- ficult to establish a definite criterion as to what con- stitutes a truncated conoidal lower section because in Colombia and the Antilles this section often con- stitutes the greater part of the body of the vessel; 10Palmatary, 1939: figs. 17 and 18. 105Kidder, II, 1944: pls.

South of the Amazon, vessels having a truncated conoidal lower section have been reported from the mouth of the Parana,' also from the cemeteries of the Isla de Tilcara in the Province of Jujuy112 and the Provincia de Salta. 3 A considerable number of the Calchaquian urns might be classified as having a truncated conoidal lower section; however, as previously stated, these vessels belong in the piled-up category and consist fundamentally of a jar resting in a handled dish. In Marajo6 ceramics vessels with a truncated conoidal lower section never have handles and rarely display any indication of having been designed on the piled- up principle. It would thus seem that this group of Argentinian vessels is not related to those under con- s ideration. In areas where most vessels are footed the trun- cated conoidal lower section naturally becomes rare. It is therefore inconspicuous in Middle and Central America and the Isthmus. It is rare also in western South America. Vitamorphic Figures in Handle Position Vitamorphic forms in handle position is a common trait, but there are areas in which it is inconspicu- ous - among these are Colornbia, the west coast cul- tures and northwestern Argentina in South America; Cocle in Panama; Nicaragua and Guatemala in North America. In the Antilles and the Southern Mounds the trait is common. Of the two Amazonian cultures, the Tapajo 14used more vitamorphic forms and represented them more naturalistically than did the Marajo6 Indians, but in Marajo this type of handle suggestion is com- mon, although true handles are rare. ELEMENTS OF DECORATION CROSS-IN-MEDALLION A motif which commonly appears on all the more important Marajo wares is the cross-in-medallion. 115 The cross employed is of the equal-armed Greek type, and the motif is given sufficient prominence to sug- gest it might have had some significance in the mind of the potter. In Cocle this motif appears but rarely,"16 and about as infrequently in this area the equal-armed cross is used as a rim ornament without enclosure. 117 In Central America this cross is inconspicuous 118 and is not always confined. 119 In Middle America it ap- "' Lothrop, 1932: pl.

South of the Amazon the cross-in-medal- lion is fairly common in northwestern Argentina. In this area it is sometimes part of a purely geometrical design,122 but more frequently it is placed in the cen- ter of the body of some zoomorphic form. 123 On Mlarajo6 pottery this latter use of the motif never occurs. ENCLOSED EYE AREAS The subject has been discussed in the section of the Stylistic Analysis entitled "Eye Forms." NEGATIVE TECHINIQUES Champ-Leve Champ-leve belongs in the category of negative decoration because the technique employed, like that of the engraved wares to be described, involves work- ing the background in order to delineate and empha- size the design. In the engraved wares the background was striated or cross-hatched and the design was made conspicuous by its contrasting plainness; in champ-leve the field is cut away at an even depth, throwing the design into a one-plane low relief. In other words champ-leve consists essentially of two planes, one representing the field, the other the de- sign. On Marajo wares the depressed background frequent- ly retains more or less of its filling, in color con- trasting sharply to that of the relief design;124 in no case however, in the wares studied, was the filling of sufficient thickness to warrant the assumption that it had completely filled the excavated area, thus creating a field on the same plane as the design itself - in other words no pieces could justifiably be classified as cloisonn6; however burial in damp soil over a long period undoubtedly removed some of the original filling. Champ-leve was common on Marajo6. This form of negative technique does not seem to have been con- spicuous in the archeology of the Gulf Coast and the Mississippi Valley; however it constituted a promi- nent type of decoration on the pottery of certain NMid- dle American cultures appearing at Teotihuacan and in Oaxaca, in NMexico, occasionally in the Old Empire city of Piedras Negras in the Mayan area, but coming into its own in the Yucatecan period when it was used for fine reproductions on pottery of figures of men and gods. 125 120 Galindo y Villa, 1905: Laminas 34, 41: Ruppert and Denison, 1943: pl. 51-b. 121 Holmes, 1903: pl.

Champ-leve has been reported from various other American archeological areas126 but the two where it seems to have represented one of the dominant types of pottery decoration are Niiddle America and Marajo. Butler and others have suggested the possible rela- tion between champ-leve on Middle American pottery and the stone-cutting arts of that area. 127 The two- plane technique of some of western South America's stone decoration could have equally well suggested the champ-leve technique in clay. There is no stone on NMarajo nor any within a con- siderable distance of that island. It would therefore seem that champ-leve might have been developed by immigrants from stone-cutting areas. It is also pos- sible that it might have been suggested by wood carving in a two-plane technique; however, because of the extreme humidity of Amazonia, the remains of all arts based upon vegetable fibers have disappeared long ago. There is also the possibility that pottery trade pieces may have supplied the original inspira- tion, but the peculiarity of the island's archeology is that while many wares are represented, they all look Marajoan. I have seen no substantial evidence of pieces from other areas. Engraving for Negative Effect In the Mlississippi Valley and also in northwestern F lorida, a common method of decorating pottery was to outline the design on a vessel with a sharp instru- ment, and then to fill in the background with pits 128 (pls. 109-e, i11-d); hatclhin!12 (pl. 111-c); cross- hatching130 (pi. 111-b, e, f); or reed impressions, 131 by this rnethod creating a plain, flat design against a decorated field. In the main tools were sharp and the incisions not deep. M'oore describes the bottle figured on plate 111-a as follows:132 This superb bottle... has an exterior coating of red pig- ment of superior quality, through which is incised a beauti- ful combination of disks and running scrolls in a field of parallel lines. In all probability the lines of the incised decoration have been accentuated with white pigment, but if such is the case, no trace of the coloring remains. With regard to the two other bowls from the same area, he states that they were covered inside and out with polished red pigment and that traces of white pigment are evident in the incised lines of one of them. 133 To the best of my knowledge there are no pitted or 126 NMason, 1939: pls.

In Brazil the engraving was usually done with a blunt instrument through an outer pigment and partially through a fairly soft heavy slip of a different color, often red over white (pl. 43-b), though other combina- tions have been referred to in the text. This technique appeared also in solid color (pl. 37-g). Thus in both the Miounds and in Marajo engraved decoration fre- quently became negative in character in that the back- ground was tooled in order to perfect the design and to thirow it into prominence. Another important point of similarity between the engraving techniques of Marajo and those of the Southern Mounds is that the main motifs in both areas usually have one or two lines running through the cen- ter, more or less parallel to the longitudinal outline; this characteristic is illustrated by the piece from Moundville (pl. 111-e), while on Marajo pottery it may be seen on plates 42-a, b, c, an(d 43-b. In the Mounds this mid-line is often notched (pl. 111-a and b); in Marajo decoration, also, notched in- ner lines occur with fair frequency (pls. 40-c, g; 46; 52-a; 63-a). In the Marajo collections studied some of the best examples of engraving for negative effect display a technique which involves a very limited field. This gives the design a broad, flat appearance. On the Amazon pieces the field is usually filled in with al- ternately directed angular incisions which produce a wedge-like effect (pl 54-a). In the Ouachita Valley a comparable technique was used; the field incisions on a piece figured by Moore are at an angle but are not alternately directed;134 on another fine specimen from the Red River Valley a limited field is filled in with 135 pits. Setzler has pointed out the similarity between the decoration on certain vessels from Marksville, Loui- siana, on which a roughened field contrasted with a "decoration consisting of smooth bands outlined by incised grooves," and that on wares from the Hope- well culture of the Ohio Valley. In conclusion he states that "Louisiana, Mississippi, and possibly Arkansas must be considered in the distribution of Hopewell-like traits." 136 Thus on engraved wares, ne.gative techniques, in- volving various methods of working the background and leaving the design plain and flat, were used at the mouth of the Amazon and over a vast area of the eastern United States, from northwestern Florida a- round the Gulf Coast to the Mississippi, Valley and 14I bi d.: pl1.

Similar techniques appeared also in the NMayan area where in incised wares figures were outlined against a punctate or hatched back- ground. Engraving for negative effect seems not to have been conspicuous in Mexico, the Antilles, South American west-coast cultures nor those of north- western Argentina. Painting for Negative Effect . . . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~13a ,ve True negative painting whereby wax or some other substance was applied to a design area andlater removed after the interstitial spaces had been painted in seems never to have reached Marajo Island; at least in none of the collections studied did a piece appear which showed evidence of such a decorative method. On the other hand what Dr. Mary Butler has termed "false negative," and what in this study has been termed "painting for negative effect," was in common usage on Marajo. By this method the vessel was first covered with a white or cream-colored wash, the de- sign was then outlined and the interstitial spaces filled in with red. brown, or black or a combination of these colors. Any but a white or cream basic wash on Marajo polychrome wares would be most unusual. True negative technique can usually be detected from a photographic reproduction by the quality of the lines enclosing the "lost color" areas. On the other hand, painting for negative effect can be determined only by examining the vessel or from detailed pub- lished description. Unfortunately descriptions vary somewhat in terminology and not unusually are con- cerned primarily with elements other than painting techniques. I am therefore confining this discussion to a few areas concerning which there is definite in- formation and which are within reasonable correlating distance of Marajo. Dr. Mary Butler139 states that "false" negative was widely used in the Maya area. Maya painted designs and Marajo6 painted designs have, however, few ele- ments in common; thus technical procedure alone would be the only basis for assuming cultural rela- tions. Such relations, it would seem, must not have been very direct. Lothrop140 clearly describes the painting technique of Cocle; it is quite similar to that of Marajo except that the Cocle decorative procedure was much the more highly evolved of the two. In Cocle, painting for negative effect created what Lothrop refers to as an 137 Butler, 1936: 456. " "Negative painting has a remarkably wide distribu- tion, from southern Peru to the southeastern United States, with apparent breaks of continuity in (1) western Panama, Costa Rica and Nicaragua; (2) southern Mexico; and (3) northeastern Mexico, the Texas Coast, and the lower Mis- sissippi Valley.

As far as I know, the dark interstitial areas on Nlarajo wares never, in themselves, produced well-organized de- signs; however many of the light negative designs of Cocle are very similar to those of Marajo. This point will be discussed in the section on "Scrolls." Another area from which we have adequate de- scription of painted technique is that of the State of Falcon, Venezuela. 141 The designs though geometri- cal are not strikingly sinmilar to those of Marajo, but in this area there is another important correlating ele- ment, that of hollow rims. Wares similar to those of the State of Falcon appear also in the Dutch West Indies, and again painting for negative effect has an accompanying correlating ele- ment in hollow rims. 142 Excavations on several of the other Caribbean is- lands have produced a red-and-white ware which has been referred to as similar to certain painted wares on Marajo6. 143 Rainey found it in the lower level of two stratified deposits of culture refuse in sites on the north and south coasts of Puerto Rico as one of the wares of what he has designated as the "Crab Cul- ture" of that island. Describing this Red and White Ware Rainey says: 144 All designs are executed in white paint on a red back- ground, that is, in all cases white paint is applied over red paint, and the red is applied over a polished or slipped brown surface. Another characteristic of this type of ware is the pres- ence of negative designs. On all the sherds which are large enough to carry a recognizable design, part or all of the de- sign elements are in negative red outlined by white paint. In some cases design elements are in white paint and there- fore positive, as the white paint is always the last to be applied, but they are always associated with elements in red which are naturally in the negative. ... A general characteristic which can be determined from the complete bowls and the large sherds is the use of deco- rative panels or distinct fields of ornamentation. In no case does a single pattern or design element extend completely around the vessel. These panels are apparently rectangular sections which enclose a single unit. A common design unit of this kind is a spool-shaped figure in negative red in a field of white which is in turn outlined by a rectangle formed by a negative red line.... The Crab Culture seems not to have appeared in excavations recorded from Cuba, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica. 145 However the Red and White Ware with negative decoration appears in the arche- ology of the Virgin Islands and several of the Lesser Antilles including St. Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat, St. Vincent, Grenada, and Trinidad. 146 At first glance this Red and White Ware of the An- tilles is strikingly suggestive of some painted Marajo 141Nomland, 1933: fig. 8; 1935: 49, figs. 15 and 16. 142Josselin de Jong, 1918: pl.

SOC. pieces; this is due to the color combination, to the geometrical decoration, to the tendency to divide the decoration into panels, and also to the formi. However whien the designs of the two areas are actually ana- lized, there is not a great deal in common, and in Maraj6 the negative design is always white, while in the Antilles it is always red. Rainey mentions the frequent use of a spool-like motif on these Red and White W'ares. I do not recall having seen this as a painted motif on Maraj6; however, it sometimes ap- pears in modeled form as a possible ceremonial ob- ject and is held by diminutive hands below the head on a few of the large burial urns (pl. 89-a). Decoration 147 in panels is characteristic not only of &gt;Iarajo but of Cocle and seems to have been also of some of the black-on-white wares of northwestern Venezuela. 148 Bell-shaped vessels, which seem to be characteris- tic of the Red and White Antillean ware, would be unusual in M5araj6; on the other hand truncated conoi- dal lower sections which also appear in this ware are a marked characteristic of lMarajo pottery. I feel that the Red and White Ware of the Antilles suggests some cultural relation with Marajo, but not a very close one. An urn from the Aguarica area of eastern Ecuador (pl. 112-a), reported by Gillin has suggested to him and to others possible archeological connection with Nlarajo6 Island. The photographic reproduction suggests a negative technique, but in reality the jar is posi- tively painted. Gillin149 describes the decorative tech- nique as follows: The color of the exterior background surface is brownish red and the design has been applied with white paint. Over the whole a gum glaze has been applied. The technique referreU to would be most unusual for Mlarajo. In this area, if the design were intended for positive effect, the basic wash, normally, would have been white and the red applied over it; if the design were intended for negative effect still the basic wash would have been white and the interstitial spaces would have been filled in with a darker tone,usually dark red or brown. In other words the basic wash was practically never red. The design itself does not suggest Marajo. Gro- tesque faces were commonly used on MNarajo wares but, as far as I know, they were always practically identical bilaterally; the face on the Aguarica jar has only an irregular and ill-defined nose and mouth, and even the eye areas are not exact duplicates. Dark in- terstitial spaces on Marajo pottery were sometimes broken by white negative geometrical figures, but these form an orderly and coherent decorative element (pl. 97-a); on the Aguarica jar the figures are posi- tive in effect, scattered and irregular in form. 147 Lothrop, 1942: 12 et seq. and 254. 148Nomland, 1933: fig. 8. 149 Gillin, 1936: 469. Ladislau Netto figures one piece in color which is a problem150 and which does suggest some relation to this Aguarica urn. It is a bowl which is decorated on the outside by a typically Marajoan two-headed croc- odile; on the inside it is covered with a basic wash of white over which have been painted geometrical figures in black and red. The color arrangement also is typically Miarajoan. But in this one case, and it is the only one which has come to my attention, the positive design is made up of scattered and irregular units not unlike those on the Aguarica urn. Ladislau Netto states that this piece comes from Pacoval Is- land, but to one familiar with Mlaraj6 ceramics, the inside and the outside seem unrelated. SCROLLS Meandering This form of scroll is not common in Maraj6 deco- ration, but it occurs now and then on some of the bet- ter polychrome pieces (pl. 85-b). A somewhat similar design may be seen on the Arkansas pieces (pl. 111-a and b). From the Ouachita Valley NMoore reports sev- eral instances of meandering-scroll decoration. 151 Opposed In-Turning Face Scrolls On Nlarajo pottery, a face frequently consists of two simple scrolls united at one extremity, and extending outward and upward and finally coiling toward each other to form a heart-shaped face with big eyes. Ex- amples in polychrome may be seen on plate 72-a, c, and 82-b; while in engraving it appears on plate 24-a. This form is common at Cocle also,152 in reality the face scrolls of Sitio Conte frequently consist of a combination of two opposed out-turning scrolls for the lower unit and two in-turning scrolls for the upper unit153 (pl. 112-g and h). Generally speaking, the face scrolls of Marajo are simpler than those of Cocle. opposed Out-Tur7ning Face Scrolls There is an interesting motif in Marajo decoration which consists fundamentally of two scrolls joined at one extremity and turned in opposite directions. The initial curve of each scroll forms the side of a face, while the final curve usually, but not always, termi- nates in fingers. This latter fact suggests that the main extent of the scroll serves as a sort of coiled arm. Examples of this motif in polychrome are illus- trated on plates 71-a, 87-a, 96-b; in engraving it ap- pears on plate 96-a. Lothrop has called attention to the similarity between these opposed out-turning scrolls of Marajo and what he terms "face scrolls" of Cocle; he reports several examples from early graves at Sitio Conte.154 The Cocle opposed scrolls do not terminate in fingers; however, as in Marajo, these Ladislau Netto, 1885: This plate follows page 468. 151Moore, 1909: pls.

In Brazilian Guiana opposed out-turning scrolls, suggesting a series of faces, were sometimes used as a decorative band around the body of a pot. These faces are similar to, but not quite identical with, the motif under discussion. 155 The Interlocking Sigmoid Another form of scroll decoration commonly em- ployed by the Miarajo potters was the interlocking sig- moid. Examples in polychrome may be seen on plates 32-c, 73-a; in relief on 73-b. Lothrop reports this scroll from Cocle, but apparentl5 it was not a fre- quently used motif in this area. In a slightly at- tenuated form this scroll appears in the Rio Cunan; area of Brazilian Guiana. . It is, however, a common form of decoration on the engraved wares of the Lower Mississippi (pI. 109-a), particularly of the valleys of the Red and Ouachita Rivers. 159 It appears on the two-part dish from Florida (pl. 110-e), and Moore re- ports two more from the Apalachicola River;160 a fine example from Georgia may be seen on plate 112-e. This scroll is not characteristic of the archeology of Santare6m, but it appears occasionally on pottery from the cemeteries of northwestern Argentina.161 The Interrupted Sigmoid A common form of decoration among the Tapajo6, both in relief and in engraving, was a sigmoid scroll which was interrupted half way between its two main elements by a sub-motif. 62 Decoration involving this motif is rare on Marajo pottery, but plate 68-a illus- trates an example of it in champ-1eve. The interrupted sigmoid has been reported from Cocle but it seems to have been rare there also. 163 It appears on the pot- tery of Rio Cunan;' in Brazilian Guiana.164 One inter- esting example of it occurs in the archeology of the Red River Valley.165 Superimposed Scrolls Among the more complicated scroll designs of NMarajo is the superimposed scroll. This scroll is not common, but occurs on some of the better pieces (pl. 68-c). To the best of my knowledge this scroll does not appear at Santarem, but closely similar designs have been reported by Goeldi166 from the Rio Cunan;' in Brazilian Guiana, and by Lothrop- from Cocle.'67 155Goeldi, 1905: Est.

Textile Scrolls A scroll which the Marajoans used with frequency is the one which has been referred to in this study as the ''textile" scroll, because of its suitability for weaving techniques. Examples of it may be seen on plates 43-b, 44-b, 54-a. Except for the piece from the Rio Cassipore in Brazilian Guiana (pl. 112-c), I have not been able to find a clear example of this scroll in other areas. This piece contained glass beads and so was not pre-Colunmbian or pre-Cabralian - as they would say in Brazil. The textile scroll appears, how- ever, in stone and carved in the full round as the fret of the Temple of the Warriors at Chichen Itza. 169 SNAKE OR CONTINUOUS WAVE MOTIF This motif in Mlarajo decoration may be seen in en- graved designs on plates 23-b, 35-c; in champ-leve on plates 40-i, 59-b, 63-a, 68-b; in polychrome on plates 71-d, 78-a, 79-b, 80-a. The motif in itself is too sim- ple to be important; however, the peculiar adaptation of it the Marajoans made places it in a category of primary interest from the standpoint of correlation. In Mlarajo it was characteristically used around the body or rim of a vessel, and the spaces between the undu- lations were filled in either with faces turned alter- nately right side up and upside down (pl. 63-a), or by stepped pyramidal motifs used in the sarne way (78-a). In Cocle design there are the same combinations of faces and continuous wave(pl. 112-f), and a geometri- cal figure and the continuous wave, except that in Cocle a formalized hand motif replaces the stepped pyramid of Marajo 170 (pl. 112-g). Interestingly enough, the Altar of the Federation of Nlayapan is decorated by a snake design, and in the undulations there are geometrical figures used alter- nately right side up and upside down, similarly to de- signs just described from Maraj6o and Cocle. 171 THE STEPPED PYRAMID A motif which frequently appears in Mlarajo design is the stepped pyramid. It appears occasionally in en- graved techniques, but more often in champ-leve and polychrome. 17 The motif is seemingly rare or com- pletely absent from Tapajo decoration, and is equally inconspicuous at Cocle. In the Nicoya Peninsula Costa Rica, it appears only rarely. 173 In the Lower Nlississippi Valley, however, this motif is fairly com- mon, appearing mostly in polychrome174 (pl. 109-h). 168 Moore, 1909: fig. 36. 169 Morris, Charlot, Morris, 1931: I: fig. 22. 170Lothrop, 1942: figs. 39-b, 374-a and al, 375. 171 Willard, 1933: 291. 172 Pls. 56-a, 57-b, 58, 59-b, 63-b, 72-a, 74-b, 86-b. 173 Lothrop, 1926: fig. 75-b. 174 Moore, 1910: pl.

TWO HEADS IN CONTRAPOSITION The Tapajo frequently decorated the rims of their pots with two-headed ornaments modeled in the round, but these usually consisted of two heads, zoomorphic, anthropomorphic, or one of each, which emanated from one trunk but which were laterly opposed.176 Such a form would be definitely atypical for Marajo. In the latter area two heads are always represented on op- posite ends of a trunk. In Cocle pottery, both the Santarem type177 and the Maraj6 type of the two-head- ed motif are employed in painted designs. In the decoration of this pottery a variety of animals are used and the figures are more realistic and less geo- metrical than those of Marajo; however, there are some designs reported by Lothrop which are striking- ly similar in conception to certain ones from Marajo, which latter may be regarded as definitely character- istic of that island. The Tapajo of Santarem introduced into the deco- ration of their pottery a great variety of realistically modeled representations of the fauna of their habitat. So lavish and impartial were they in the adaptation of this type of ornament, that it would be impossible to select any one species, or member of a species, as outstandingly significant in their mythology. Not so with the Marajo Islanders. In this area the fauna is quite as varied and as numerous as at Santarem, but its use in decoration is distinctly limited. Occasion- ally there is a bit of realistic zoomorphic modeling, but such representations are rare; by far the greater part of the decoration, whether modeled, painted or engraved, is highly conventionalized. The subject of most of the motifs seems to be the jacare (crocodile). The only other widely used vitamorphic representa- tion, again highly stylized, is the human body, either entire or in part. In Marajo the crocodile is often represented with one head (pls. 44-a and 66-a); quite as frequently he is depicted with two (pls. 49-b, 50-b, 62-a). Some- times heads on opposite sides of a vessel and in op- posed positions are connected by a very elongated body with legs inconspicuously represented (pl. 81-a); or the connecting link between the two heads may be two straight parallel lines, in which case the space on either side of the body may be filled in with intri- cate geometrical motifs which suggest legs and claws (pls. 56-c, 57-b). Again the heads at opposite ends of the two parallel lines may be more anthropomorphic than zoomorphic in character, and the space along the sides may be filled in with conventionalized arm and leg motifs (pls. 72-c). It is this latter form of two- headed motif which appears at Cocle 178 (pl. 112-h). Preuss reports from San Agustin two stone figures each with a head at opposing extremities of a colum- nar body (figs. 3 1-1, 33-3). From further north in Costa Rica, two heads verti- cally opposed are reported by Lothrop in highland polychrome wares, 179 in red-line wares 180 in white- line wares, in lost-color wares; in a highly con- ventionalized form this motif appears also in the polychrome of the Nicoya Peninsula. 183 Hartmann re- ports the motif from the highland sites of Chircot, 184 Orosi 185 El Pais,186 and Agua Caliente.187 In Nica- ragua plumed serpent designs -are sometimes similarly two-headed, and in certain instances are divided into two distinct parts by a narrow band as is often the case in comparable designs from Cocl1188 and Maraio. From Moundville, Alabama, NMoore reports three en- graved pieces on which the heads of ivory-bill wood- peckers are placed in contraposition connected by one body from which a single pair of wings extends. 189 Snakes with a head at either extremity of the body are common motifs in northwestern Argentina. liow- ever these are not comparable to the two-headed forms under consideration as they are usually sigmoid in form. 190 Naraj6o two-headed designs seem more related to those to the north. 191 CORRELATION CIIART The correlation chart represents an attempt to pre- sent simply and diagrammatically the results of search through published material for form and deco- rative elements which might suggest cultural affilia- tions between the two main archeological areas of the Lower Amazon (Tapajo and NMarajo) and other areas in North and South America. For this purpose "3" has been used to suggest that the correlating element was frequent, "2" that it was fairly frequent, "1"- that it was rare, "a" that it was probably absent, "p" that 75Ibid.: pl.

AMER. PHIL. SOC. it was present in an attenuated or partial degree or form, "n" that the evidence was insufficient for jud,ment, "S" that the trait appeared only or primari- ly in stone, SUMMARY We do not know the age of Mlarajo pottery. Antonio Vieira did not mention pottery-making as one of the characteristics of the culture of the several tribes with which he negotiated peace in the name of the King of Portugal in the middle of the seventeenth cen- tury. Since he was quite specific concerning other important culture traits, this omission leaves some doubt that pottery-rnaking was a conspicuous art on the island at that time. Also, no careful stratigraphi- cal studies have ever been made on Narajo. We there- fore lack data upon which to base substantial theories concerning the origin and probable diffusional direc- tion of the traits which characterize Marajo wares. Under such circumstances it seems the best that can be done at present is to search in other archeological areas for form-types, designs, and techniques which distinguish Marajo pottery and to hope at some later time, after Marajo wares have received an approximate dating, to be able to formulate a plausible theory as to whether NMarajo served as a great creative center which contributed its pottery-making traits to several other cultures, or whether, because of its geographi- cal position, it was primarily an area where the tech- niques and traditions of various civilizations con- verged. Beginning with the nearest important archeological area, that of Santarem at the mouth of the Rio Tapa- joz, the question is frequently asked, "Is one likely to confuse Tapajo and NMarajo wares?" The answer is definitely in the negative; pottery from the two areas is different in paste, size, form and decoration. San- tarem and Marajo are some six hundred miles apart, and there probably was a considerable temporal sep- aration as well between the peak development of the two cultures. We have considerable historical information con- cerning the Tapajo. This numerous and powerful tribe had apparently about reached its highest developmen- tal state at the period when Spanish and Portuguese adventurers first made their appearance on the Lower Amazon. Early records refer to the great pottery- making activites of this tribe. The Tapajo put up a stiff fight against the white man who feared them greatly because of their poisoned arrows; they were, however, finally overcome and enslaved by the Portu- guese. Remnants of the tribe lived on until the mid- dle of the eighteenth century when the Mundurucus descended upon the Tapajoz Valley and killed them off.192 How long the Tapajo had been in that area we do not know, but that there was some cultural connec- '92Metraux, 1928: II: 25. tion between them and the Marajo tribes is apparent from the appearance in both regions of three distin- guishing pottery form-types - crescent-based figurines, superimposed forms with scalloped profile, and hiollow rims. 193 However, the phalliform type of crescent- based figurine, more or less characteristic of Marajo, never appears in Tapajo collections. The pottery of the Rio Cunani' in Brazilian Guiana displays some resemblances in form and decoration to that of Marajo; these are principally in superimposed forms with scalloped profile and certain scroll de- signs, also the ladder motif. The closest South American correlation with Ama- zonia is Venezuela which is directly north of it and connected with it by important water routes. The three form-types just referred to as common to both Marajo and Tapajo pottery appear here with frequency and, in addition, other forms and techniques characteristic of either Tapajo or NMarajo but not common to both of them. Venezuela appears to have been a cross-roads between Amazonia and areas to the north, both in the Caribbean and on the mainland where Tapaj6 and Marajo traits mingled with others of a quite different nature. In the main, vessel forms and decorative motifs of the west coast area of South America are not sugges- tive of the Lower Amazon. There is, however, an in- teresting similarity between these areas and the carved stone figures of San Agusti'n, Colombia. These figures frequently display the half-closed eye so characteristic of Marajo burial urns; two heads, one right side up, one upside down, also typical of Marajo decoration; and finally the enclosed eye-area common to both Marajo and Tapajo cultures. Although in stone, it seems that this group of decorative elements must be considered an important correlation. In northwestern Argentina there are a few form- types similar to those of the Amazon; among these are superimposed forms with scalloped profile and the truncated conoidal lower section, also one or two decorative motifs. But there is so much in this area which is entirely unsuggestive of the Amazon that it seems hardly logical to consider the two areas close- ly related. Summarizing in brief Marajo correlations in South America, it may be said that the closest relations seem to be with Santarem and Venezuela, with some resemblances in the Rio Cunani' region of Brazilian Guiana. Generally speaking, the pottery of north- western Argentina and of the west coast cultures does not suggest that of Marajo; however, certain stone figures of San Agustin, Colombia, are characterized by decorative traits found on Marajo pottexy. Turning toward the north, the Isthmian area pre- sents an interesting archeological situation with ref- 193It is suggested that the Correlation Chart be referred to in reading this general summary.</page><page sequence="88">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) THIE POTTERY: CORRELATIONS 347 erence to the Amazon. Here in the wares of Chiriqui and also in those of Costa Rica a close resemblance to Tapajo form-types becomes evident; this is the area of caryatids and supported vessels - forms rare in Marajo. On the other hand in Cocle, in the same general area, there is an almost total lack of charac- teristically Amazonian form-types but a high develop- ment of decorative devices characteristic of Marajo; -these include painting for negative effect and the use of intricate scroll designs. Thus in summary it may be said that Costa Rica and Chiriqui show close form relation to Santarem, but none to Marajo; while Cocle shows strong decorative relation to Marajo but none to Santarem. Generally speaking, Nliddle American pottery is most unsuggestive of the Amazon in both form and decoration, although occasionally a piece fron) the eastern coast of Mlexico will display a Marajo trait in an attenuated fornm. A case in point is the cylindroid vessel bulbous at the base. IHowever certain important decorative techniques are common to both M.4iddle American and Nlaraj6 wares; these include painting and engraving for negative effect and champ-leve. Occasionally also a decorative motif which is comnmon on Mlarajo appears in Mexico in stone; the most inter- esting example is what has been termed in this study the "textile scroll," because of its suitability to basketry and cloth weaving, and which appears as the fret on the Temple of the Warriors in Yucatain. This could be merely an accidental similarity, or it could represent the transference to clay of a memory derived from stone. There may have been some relation be- tween the cultures of Middle America and those of Marajo but not a close one, and in the later culture at Santarem there is no suggestion of Mliddle American influence. Investigation in the Antilles reveals that there is a definite correlation between both Tapajo and Marajo wares with those of the Dutch West Indies in the form of hollow rims; with those of Trinidad and Puerto Rico in truncated conoidal lower sections; with the Dominican Republic in crescent-based forms, four- lobed vessels, superimposed forms with scalloped profile, and truncated conoidal lower sections. The Do-minican Republic is much closer to the Amazon archeologically than any other Antillean area. It also shows relation to Rio Cunan; in Brazilian Guiana in boat-shaped vessels and in other form details. In Puerto Rico and other islands to the south cer- tain wares are characterized by painting for negative effect. This is true of the "Crab Culture" pottery. However, designs on this pottery are not closely re- lated to those of Marajo; also the basic wash on this pottery is always red; that on Marajo seems always to have been white. The relation between the Antilles and the Amazon appears to have been more one of form than of decoration. In 1939 I published a paper on the archeology of Santarem194 in which I called attention to the similar- ity in form and decoration between Tapajo' Dottery and that of the Southern Mounds of the United States. Sev- eral years later, in the midst of Marajo research, I discovered that Ladislau Netto in 1885 published the opinion that the mound-builders of M.arajo and those of the Miississippi Valley and Florida were of the same origin, and that the culture elements had been carried south by "na;6es navegantes," in some cases step by step through the Antilles, in others along the North American coast, and that these pottery traits could have made their way into South America by the Magdalena and the Orinoco and their tributaries. 195 He seems to have confined his theory to Marajo, as the Tapajo consumed their dead and so had no mounds or burials. He based this theory upon similarities be- tween Marajo and Mound pottery he noted while read- ing Squier's "Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley" and W. P. Potter's "Archaeological Remains of Southeastern Mlissouri." Some of the other theories offered by Ladislau Netto in this same publication seem very extravagant today, but Moore's numerous reports on Mound pottery and those of other authors make it necessary to consider the possibility of cul- tural relation between the North American and the NMarajo mound areas even though the diffusional di- rection may at present be uncertain, and satisfactory connecting links not always accounted for. Reference to the Correlation Chart will indicate that both Tapajo and Marajo pottery display a sur- prising number of traits, some of form others of deco- ration, which may be found also on Mound pottery. A further problem is suggested by the fact that, except for half a dozen elements, the Brazilian areas do not correlate with the Mounds in the same way. The two Amazonian cultures were basically different. The distance between the southeastern United States and the Amazon Valley is considerable, a fact which has impressed me deeply when I have been flying from one area to the other. Nevertheless arche- ological similarities between the two must be admit- ted. We know that Tapajo pottery found its way as far north as Carriacou in the. Dutch West Indies; 196 as yet, however, I have never seen in an Antillean col- lection a piece which, to me, appeared definitely Marajoan. It is to be hoped that more work in the West Indies and also in Brazilian Guiana will serve to clear up this relational problem. It seems that the Caribbean is the area where connecting links between these northern and southern areas should reasonably be looked for, as Central and Middle America are much too far to the west to have served as probable trade routes between Marajo and the Mounds. 94 Palmatary, 1939: 121 et seq. 195 LadislauwNetto, 1885: 262, 267, 332, 417, 419, 423. 196Nordenski61d, 1930: fig. 1.</page><page sequence="89">348 PALMIATARY': TIHE POTTERY OF MARAJO ISLAND (TRANS. AMER. PHIIL. SOC. Who the ancient NMarajo Indians were is an interest- ing problem because we have no historical records concerning them, almost no skeletal material, and the remains of only one industry, that of pottery-making. The multiplicity of wares seems to suggest that NMara- jo originally may have been a rather cosrrmopolitan area whiere small groups from various parts and with various traditions had established themselves. No doubt these groups fought among themselves but also traded and intermarried, and thus gradually the numer- ous techniques and traditions blended. In spite of the variety within Marajo wares there is also a certain homogeneity, as if a common ideology prevailed and common religious insignia were accepted. Thus this culture must have existed long enough to have accom- plished variety from without and integration from within. It seems that Mlarajo will always remain something of a mystery both because of the complexity of its wares and the incompleteness its archeological pic- ture must ever present, but a study of the stone im- plements, which had to be imported, might give a clue to the areas with which these islanders traded most and from which certain elements of their population and their culture may have been derived.</page><page sequence="90">VOL. 39, PT. 3, 1949) CATALOG NUMBERS FOR SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATED 349 A P P E N D I X CATALOG NUMBERS FOR SPECIMENS ILLUSTRATED The following abbreviations will be used when re- ferring to the present location of specimens: Alabama Museum of Natural History AlaMNH American Museum of Natural History AMNH Brooklyn Museum BM Comissio Brasileira Demarcadora de Limites, Belem CBDL Mordini Collection, Barga, Italy MC Museo Etnografico Luigi Pigorini, Rome NIELP Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro MN Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi, Belem MG Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation MIAI Museum of New Mexico MNM Museum of the University of Arkansas MUA National Park Service NPS Oliveira Collection, Recife OC Palmatary Collection PC Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard PMII Simpson Collection, High Springs, Fla.
