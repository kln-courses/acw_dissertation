<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and informative word studies. The studies of o'nm (pp. 67 f.) and p~x (pp. 71 ff.) are good examples, the latter including a helpful approach to the problem raised in this connection by arnn. The same precision and clarity characterize his treatments of the sentiments of God. Notwithstanding, this section left the reviewer unsatisfied because it failed to take its own results at face value and come to grips with the problem of the impassibility of God. Having given fair indication of the OT view of God's love and forgiveness, as well as his jealousy, anger, and hatred, van Imschoot might have dealt suggestively with its implications for the traditional doctrine of impassibilitas Dei. Perhaps the book's most characteristic chapter is that on revelation. Running to almost 100 pages it includes a discussion of the concept of revelation, then theophanies, angels, dreams, the face of Yahweh, hypostases, and two noteworthy sections on prophets and the Spirit (the last is a field in which van Imschoot has already published numerous articles). To the reviewer van Imschoot's use of this category forms the strongest contribution of his book. Not only is revelation the topic of this major chapter but it effectively undergirds the author's entire biblical theology. It plays a significant role in his typological method (pp. 2 ff.) as well as in his treatment of the difficult problems of anthropomorphism (pp. 28 ff.) and the uniqueness of Israel's "mythology" (pp. 103 ff.). On the other hand, the book exhibits striking unevenness. In addition to the sub- stantial section on the Spirit and revelation, its treatment of angels and demons (pp. 114-41) is probably unmatched in contemporary OT theologies except by that of Heinisch. Yet its sections on word, miracle, and covenant are surprisingly brief and inadequate. Although van Imschoot is a highly competent scholar, widely read in all the major fields touching his topic (as his bibliographies show), his book is somewhat marred by its uncritical correlation of data. It often fails to distinguish even between different periods of OT history, to say nothing of sources. Thus Job and (II) Isaiah are quoted along with Genesis 18; and Amos 5 8 is cited in support of the prophet's pure monotheism. Along this line the book should be characterized as conservative rather than critical or original in its handling of controversial matters. But then the reader is told at the outset that the book is merely a "caricature" which is very condensed and demands much rereading. Helping to fill a gap in the list of Roman Catholic biblical theologies, this work is a welcome addition to its field. Major evaluation, however, must be withheld until the appearance of the second volume. R. LANSING.HICKS Interpretationes ad Vetus Testamentum pertinentes Sigmundo Mowinckel septuagenario missae, eds. Nils A. Dahl and Arvid S. Kapelrud. Oslo: Forlaget Land og Kirke, 1955. Pp. 183. Few living men have done more to advance OT studies than the distinguished Norwegian scholar who is honored by this little volume of studies on the occasion of his 70th birthday. Over half of the fifteen contributors are, quite fittingly, drawn from 340</page><page sequence="2">OT BOOK REVIEWS the Scandinavian lands, the others from the various Continental countries and Great Britain, with one from the U. S. A. The articles are all of interest, and some are of such importance that the full scope of this review might well be devoted to them. But since a critical evaluation of each is out of the question, and since to single out one or two of them would be invidious, we shall attempt here no more than a brief survey of the contents in the hope that the reader's interest will be whetted. The articles are as follows: 1) W. F. Albright, "Notes on Psalms 68 and 134." The author makes no attempt to renew his debate with Mowinckel on the structure and meaning of Ps 68, but confines himself to the interpretation of a few selected verses. There are numerous philological observations of importance, not least as regards the root snn in Ps 68 18 ('warrior,' specifically 'archer'). 2) A. Alt, "Micha 2, 1-5: rH2 ANAAAIMO in Juda." Micah attacked particularly the ruling class of Jerusalem. He regarded the personal union which had existed since David linked that city with the land of Judah as a great evil, since it had permitted the former unjustly to amass power and property at the expense of the latter. He looked for the ruin of Jerusalem and the redistribution of the great estates, after which (5 1 ff.) a charismatic leader would arise in Bethlehem to rule over Judah alone. 3) H. Birkeland, "Some Linguistic Remarks on the Dead Sea Scrolls." A discussion of forms of the pronoun and of pronominal suffixes with or without final -a in the light of DSIa and b, reinforcing the conclusions of the author's earlier work (Akzent und Vokalismus im Althebrdischen, 1940). 4) N. A. Dahl, "The Origin of Baptism." A most interesting argument, concluding that the Christian rite goes back to the baptism of John and that the latter, in turn, rests not so much on Jewish proselyte baptism, or the lustrations of such sects as the Essenes, as on the regular ablutions connected with the temple worship. The washings of the Essenes had a similar background. While the baptism of John was in preparation for the eschatological festival, the church saw itself as the spiritual temple of God, and the community of the baptized as a royal priesthood offering to God sacrifices of praise. 5) 0. Eissfeldt, "Zur Kompositionstechnik des Pseudo-Philonischen Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum." The author of this work developed a technique of providing links forward and backward, and of smoothing unevennesses, already observable to a degree in the sources and redactors of Genesis-I Samuel. 6) R. Gyllenberg, "Kultus und Offen- barung." A provocative discussion of the cult as the normal place of revelation in early Israel, and of the great shift that took place in this regard under the later monarchy. Attention is given to the living quality of the cult in the earliest church; and there are interesting remarks about the renewed stress upon the cult in Scandinavian churches. 7) P. Humbert, "Trois notes sur Genese I." Gen 1 1 is to be read, "When God began to create ...." The "image of God" in Gen 1 26 f. stresses resemblance, not identity, and signals man as God's possession (as the image of Caesar on the coin makes that coin Caesar's). In Gen 1, P consciously builds on and sublimates the account of J in the interests of a strict monotheism. The chapter was designed to serve a liturgical purpose. 8) F. Hvidberg, "The Masseba and the Holy Seed." Isa 6 13 is to be read with DSIa, and its message is one of total doom. 9) A. R. Johnson, "Hesed and .HasMd." A penetrating discussion of these two words in their relation to the notion of covenant. Hesed has the primary force of "loyalty," and carries with it suggestions of reciprocity 341</page><page sequence="3">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE and mutual obligation. Yet "loyalty" does not always catch the exact meaning; perhaps "devotion" would be the best single word - if a single word can be found. 10) A. Kapelrud, "King and Fertility: A Discussion of II Sam 21:1-14." David used a pretext to do away with the house of Saul. Since the king was responsible for fertility, the famine was naturally blamed on him. But since it could not be suggested that David himself be sacrificed, the priests of Gibeon (at David's hint?) hit upon the family of Saul. 11) J. Lindblom, "Der Eckstein in Jes. 28,16." Reviewing various interpreta- tions, the author concludes that the building in question is the true and unfalsified religion of Yahweh, the foundation of which is faith and righteousness. 12) C. R. North, "The Interpretation of Deutero-Isaiah." A very fine discussion of certain points in the message of the prophet, particularly of the relationship between Cyrus and the Servant. The latter is a figure in the last analysis of the future, and he is re- alized - from a Christian point of view - in Christ. 13) M. Noth, "Die Heiligen des Hochsten." The "saints of the Most High" in Dan 7 were originally heavenly beings, but have been reinterpreted in the present form of the book to apply to Israel. 14) J. Pedersen, "The Fall of Man." The tempter of the story was originally no more than the snake - a creature thought to be very wise - and was only later understood as the Chaos Dragon and, still later, as Satan. 15) E. Sjoberg, "Justin als Zeuge vom Glauben an den verborgenen und den leidenden Messias im Judentum." Justin gives evidence that belief in a Messiah already living hidden on earth was widespread among the Jews, but none that a belief in a suffering Messiah was current. All this does not do the volume justice. But it is hoped that enough has been said to indicate its importance. A handsome portrait of Professor Mowinckel, followed by five pages listing the names of those who unite to do him honor, stands at the front of the book. JOHN BRIGHT Lachish III (Tell ed-Duweir), The Iron Age ("The Welcome-Marston Archaeological Research Expedition to the Near East," Vol. III), by Olga Tufnell, with contributions by Margaret A. Murray and David Diringer. London: Oxford University Press, 1953. Text, pp. 437. Plates, 150 plates. $32.00. These two splendidly produced volumes follow the publication of Lachish I, The Lachish Letters in 1938 and Lachish II, The Fosse Temple in 1940. A fourth and last presentation, Lachish IV, The Bronze Age, now in preparation, will complete the publica- tion of the excavations begun at Tell ed-Duweir in 1932 and brought to an untimely end in 1938 by the murder of the director of the expedition, J. L. Starkey. Miss Tufnell has prepared an archeological report of such comprehensiveness and clarity that ad- equate data is supplied for independent study of the results of the excavations, and she has noted relevant comparative materials from other sites. It is regrettable that there was not opportunity to make a more systematic excavation of the strata on the mound, for the work done at Tell ed-Duweir was largely preliminary clearance, and the main 342</page></plain_text>
