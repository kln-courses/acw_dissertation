<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> A Political Necrology of God drew daniel a b s t r a c t For early modern Christian subjects, Christ’s crucifixion and death fixes at the heart of things a  momentary submission to decreation and destruction, replenished by the Resurrection and the  promise of the Second Coming, but present all the same as a kind of absolute eclipse in ontotheol- ogy. With reference to the reworked “Nicene Creed” that closes Jane Bennett’s Vibrant Matter,  this essay asks: what happens to political ecologies of vibrant matter when they confront the  corpse of God? How might Renaissance political ecologies speak to contemporary political dy- namics, and what stands to occupy the vacant place of suicide, then and now, within this com- munal nexus? This essay pursues answers to these questions by placing an early modern text on  suicide, John Donne’s Biathanatos, into conversation with a contemporary theorization of com- munity—Roberto Esposito’s Communitas: The Origin and Destiny of Community. Donne’s  scandalous, even blasphemous, presentation of Christ as a “self-killer” in Biathanatos raises the  possibility that Christian community is founded in the shadow of an originary yet occulted mo- ment of self-destructive will, at once inferred yet unrepresentable. The socially binding conse- quences of this sacrificial dynamic are further explored in relation to contemporary politics, with  reference to the focalizing effect of the suicide of Mohammed Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor  whose self-immolation catalyzed the “Arab Spring” of widespread popular revolt.   What I hate I love. Ask the crucified hand that holds The nail that now is driven into itself, why. Frank Bidart, “Catullus: Id Faciam” Bidart’s compact re-imagination of Catullus forces us to see the encounter between nail and hand as a scene of rapprochement, even love, between  an inanimate object and suffering, dying flesh: active and passive, subject and  the journal for early modern cultural studies Vol. 13, No. 3 (summer 2013) © 2013 </page> <page sequence="2"> 106 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 object, body and thing are here pinned into a tense, temporary assemblage  under the sign of an overarching transaction between the poem’s classical and  Christian resonances and the insistent contemporaneity of the word now.  Which makes Bidart’s translation, I hope, a fitting emblem for this essay,  which will try to place the self-destructive will operating within Christ’s suf- fering and death into conversation with the task of thinking political and ma- terial assemblages at the edges of the boundary between then and now, alive  and dead. That task—the task of how to imagine the bleeding edge where  human meets thing as the site of politics, community, or assemblage—has re- cently been taken up and re-defined as “vibrant materialism” by political scien- tist and theorist Jane Bennett in her widely influential text Vibrant Matter: A  Political Ecology of Things. Vibrant Matter is a work with a stridently optimistic  and expansive commitment to extending agency on behalf of “thing-power”  and revoking anthropomorphic and human-centric agendas.  At the triumphant conclusion to Vibrant Matter, Bennett sounds a strik- ingly theological note: “I am, for now, at the end of my rope. So I will just end  with a litany, a kind of Nicene Creed for would-be vital materialists: ‘I believe  in one matter energy, the maker of thing seen and unseen. I believe that this  pluriverse is traversed by heterogeneities that are continually doing things’”  (199).1 It is a telling end, insofar as this litany openly risks conceding the resem- blance that Bennett’s project—an expansion of political agency to include di- verse forms of seemingly inanimate matter from crystals to electricity to gar- bage—bears with precursors such as pantheism and panpsychism. In so doing,  this re-worked Nicene Creed begs the question of whether or not Bennett’s  position qua political ecology is fundamentally religious in its work of recogni- tion, celebration and linkage across the ontological spectrum. If such disparate  items are all to be placed on equal ontological footing as political agents within  a “vibrant materialism,” the unifying emphasis across that spectrum and, in- deed, across the “pluriverse” invoked in the creed with which it concludes, is  upon activity: what looks like “dead” matter is, in fact, shown to be potent,  forceful, consequential and active.  This focus upon the vibrant and the active necessarily triggers a perhaps  unfair—or merely recalcitrant and nostalgic—question: is there any genuine  place left for death within this system? To return the Nicene Creed to its origi- nal historical moment, what would happen to the political ecology of things if  we imagined that the Creator of all matter-energy might once have willfully  chosen not vibrancy and life, but surrender and self-annihilation? This is not,  </page> <page sequence="3"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 107 of course, a rhetorical question. Christ’s crucifixion and death fixes at the heart  of things a momentary submission to de-creation and destruction, replenished  by the Resurrection and the promise of the Second Coming, to be sure, but  present all the same as a kind of absolute eclipse in the ontology of the putative  source of all “matter-energy.” Thus the death of Christ on the cross is a moment  that seems to include within Bennett’s busy pageant of actants “doing things”  the unwelcome possibility of Dei-Suicide. Such a possibility is unwelcome be- cause it suggests a divine principle that chose, at least once, not to be vibrant or  not to be active but instead to embrace suicidal shutdown. In so doing, such a  gesture consigns all vibrancy to the threatening temporal shadow of its ulti- mately irrevocable opposites: collapse, stasis, and extinction. What forms of  political agency might lie within the decision to choose death? What happens  to political ecologies of vibrant matter when they confront the corpse of God?  For Bennett, whose primary concerns are contemporary and non-theolog- ical, the answer is this: not much. She already knows that things die, and hap- pily includes the corpses of dead rats on the streets of Baltimore in her mate- rialist copia composed of potentially vibrant and politically agentive things  (4). But to those who recited the first Nicene Creed and not its second vitalist- materialist mutation, there is an important difference, to say the least, be- tween a dead rat and a dead Christ. If we shift from the theorization of the  political ecologies of the present to the political ecologies of the Renaissance,  the problem posed by the dying and dead Christ, and the question of how to  understand Christ’s death as a choice, an action, an example of matter-energy  “doing things,” has consequences for how we think the intersection of ontol- ogy and political theology. If social and divine being are one, if Christ as the  head of the Body of the Church mirrors the sovereign as the head of the state,  then Bennett’s invocation of a Trinitarian logic as the climax of her own ac- count of political ecology invites a doubling down upon how we might con- nect theological incarnation with political incorporation, death with life, and,  more tendentiously still, suicide with community. I want to bring suicide and  community together in this essay by bearing down upon a singular moment  within a single early modern text in which the possibility of a divine submis- sion toward death becomes anxiously thinkable: the presentation of Christ as  a “self killer” within John Donne’s text Biathanatos. In order to articulate the  political affordances within this claim, I will be drawing upon Roberto Es- posito’s text Communitas (and its arguable precursor, Jean-Luc Nancy’s The  Inoperative Community), which proposes a different understanding of how  </page> <page sequence="4"> 108 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 acts of voluntary death might disclose forms of community at the ontological  border of politics. Considering how the hand might love the nail that pierces  it precisely for its capacity to deliver us from life, the account that follows  might thus be termed, with gratitude to Bennett, not quite “a political ecology  of things” but “a political necrology of God.”  The “Misinterpretable Subject” of Biathanatos John Donne’s Biathanatos is more often referred to than read. Donne’s text is  notorious for its supposedly open consideration of the possibility of self-killing  as something other than sin or madness, though his stifled presentation of  such alleged “open-ness” remained unpublished by its author during his life- time, and the circulation of the text was subject to symptomatic command- ments from its author to the intimate circle of its first readers, who were  granted access to the manuscript on the condition that they  “publish it not, but  yet burn it not” (Rudick and Battin, xv). Even in such an ambivalent twilight,  Donne’s prose style twitches and writhes noticeably. A self-canceling artifact  about self-cancellation, the text was written during the era of his shamed post- marital retirement to Pyrford and Mitcham (1604–08) but was kept private  and was only finally published by his son in 1647, long after Donne’s death.2  Donne conveys his usual acute self-consciousness in the snaking negativi- ties of his title page:  BIATHANATOS  A Declaration of that Paradoxe  Or Thesis, that  Self-homicide is not so naturally Sinne,  That it may never be otherwise. (BT 1) Thesis or paradox? The very divergence of these twinned possibilities primes  the reader with stroboscopically alternating expectations for a sober theologi- cal treatise or a witty scholarly trifle. It is perhaps no accident that these ge- neric modes lend themselves to critical alignment with the central antinomy at  the heart of Donne’s peculiarly bifurcated author-function: the split between  the Jack Donne of the erotic poetry and the Dean of St. Paul’s. Taking sides,  Donne himself took pains to allege in the letter to Ker that the text was “writ- ten by Jack Donne, and not by D. Donne,” a declaration whose forthrightness  </page> <page sequence="5"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 109 amplifies rather than resolves the authorial overdetermination at work within  the text it introduces.3 Such acts of disavowal only beg the question of how the  sarcastic tone and paradoxical conclusions can be reconciled with the serious  investment of casuistic labor on display: clearly the fashioning of this paradox- cum-treatise was a job that called for the energies of both Jack and D. Donne  in tandem.  In the material that follows this ambiguous title-page, one finds a clash of  exegetical armies engaging on the shifting ground of its subject, with scholastic  divisions, points and responses swinging back and forth like a pendulum across  the absent center: the open endorsement of self-killing. Such endorsement  never quite arrives, as Donne instead hovers in its vicinity, hinting at the im- plicit “sometime” nonsinfulness, if not acceptability, of self-killing as an act  whose open celebration languishes in a blindspot beneath, before, or beyond  open articulation. After an initial account of his intentions, his method, and his  desired reader, Donne embarks on a tri-partite scholastic ascent of increasingly  forbidding rhetorical obstacles to his thesis, first considering whether or not  self-killing contradicts the Law of Nature, then considering whether self-killing  contradicts the Law of Reason, and finally arriving at the question of whether  self-killing contradicts the Law of God. In pursuit of a “relativist agenda,” Eric  Langley describes Donne as “playing one commentator against another, view  against view, so as to effectively flatten the terms and efface the universalist ob- jectivity of Scripture” (218). Citational abundance becomes a form of leverage  against authority disguised as a respectful submission toward it.   Within this already queasily equivocal document, in his third section  Donne cuts a particularly tortuous course through the heretical thicket sur- rounding the disturbing possibility at the book’s core: the claim that Jesus  Christ committed suicide. Donne’s presentation of this particular paradox is a  masterpiece of indirection whose gnarled, knotty syntax and citational feints  and dodges seem to purposefully solicit the very misinterpretation they protest  too much against. Donne had warned his readers that his text was to be kept  close because it was written “upon a misinterpretable subject” (Sullivan, 155),  and the noticeable divagations, digressions and camouflages of style grow in- creasingly thick as Donne approaches what he might well have regarded as the  most potentially inflammatory and damaging component within an already  dangerous text. In Part III, Distinction Four, Section Five, we finally arrive at  the most relatively explicit discussion of Christ’s willingness to suffer and die  on the cross, an infinitely capacious act of charity whose praise almost upstages  </page> <page sequence="6"> 110 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 the impudence of its sheer presence within a gallery of accounts of “selfe-kill- ing” in the first place.   Donne cannot, of course, literally state that “Christ committed suicide,”  even if he wished to suggest it (and it is never clear that he did wish to simply  and straightforwardly express this). There are some very basic reasons why  such a statement would be unspeakable: nominal, historical, and doctrinal.  First, Donne cannot say “Christ committed suicide” for the very basic reason  that the word suicide is not brought into English until Sir Thomas Browne’s  Religio Medici is published in 1643—the term, now redolent with its Durk- heimian sociological resonance as “le suicide,” was simply not available. Just as  obviously, the statement “Christ committed suicide” cannot be put forward  for basic narrative reasons. As related in the Gospels, Christ is not the actively  violent agent or author of his own death, but a passive victim of the violent ac- tions of others, and since Christ seemingly dies as a consequence of his cruci- fixion at the hands of the Roman state, he did not directly cause his own death  in any straightforward causal sense.  No less obviously, such a statement cannot be made for doctrinal reasons:  though it was not always so, by the seventeenth century it would count as blas- phemy. Although Scripture itself is equivocal about voluntary death, according  to the tenets of Church Fathers, set into canon law by the Council of Orleans in  533, suicide is a monstrous error.4 Since Augustine, “Thou shalt not kill” has  been taken to implicitly include killing one’s self. In his careful consideration  and ultimate rejection of suicidal logics in Book I of the City of God, Augustine  bypasses Lucretia and Cato, grants yet evades the trickier borderline cases of  St. Pelagia and Samson, and reaches a decisive resting place in his response to  the question “Should one commit suicide to avoid sin?” (39) Having imagined a  case in which one could circumvent all future sin with a single suicidal act, Au- gustine seems to decisively close the lid: “If there could be a valid reason for  suicide one could not find one more valid than this, and since this is not valid, a  valid reason does not exist” (39). In his response to the question “Whether one  is permitted to kill himself?” in the Summa Theologica, Aquinas is no less em- phatic: “One who exercises public authority may lawfully put to death an evil- doer, since he can pass judgment upon him. But no man is judge of himself ”  (qtd. in Novak 68). Thus it would seem that by definition, such ascription is  ruled out. Given the premise that committing suicide is wrong, and that the  Savior would not and could not do wrong, then it follows that the Savior would  not and could not commit suicide.  So, nominally, narratively, and doctrinally  </page> <page sequence="7"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 111 speaking, there is no straightforwardly declarative sense in which Donne could  have openly said that “Christ committed suicide.” Yet we need not affirm this  strong theory of Christ-as-a-suicide in order to be able to imply the weaker  variant that Donne’s text is scandalously eager to insinuate to the reader, a  claim that we might phrase in many ways: “Christ let himself be killed,” “chose  to be killed,” “embraced his own death,” “permitted his own death,” or we might  say that Christ simply “let his death happen.” This soup of suggestively amor- phous, ambivalent, and indirect allegations defines the over-determined causal  problem space that Donne complicates and explores.   Talking about indirection indirectly, Donne’s text is a cento of quotations  from authorities whose claims are edited into suggestive proximity in order to  solicit this interpretation. Here is his cautious approach to the issue: His Soule sayth St. Aug: did not leave his body constrained, but because he  would, and when he would, and how he would Of which St. Thomas produces  this Symptome, That he had yet his bodyes Nature in her full strength;  because at the last Moment he was able to cry with a lowd voyce. And Mar- lorate gathers it upon this, That whereas our heads decline after our Death,  by the slacknesse of the sinews and Muscles, Christ did first of himselfe  bow downe his head, and then give up the Ghost. (BT 129–30) In this blow-by-blow account of the final gestures of the crucified Christ, what  we find is a kind of referendum upon the status of the divine power retained  and expressed within the fact of the incarnation. Christ is and has a body, but  remains free of the restrictive consequences this occasions for other bodies.  Christ is unconstrained, and he is thus free to leave his body when he wills to  do so, and no sooner. He is not compelled by the fact of incarnation to be sub- ject to the Body’s organic failures to hunger, thirst, or, as Donne puts it, “Inani- tion.” (BT, 130) This tone of forceful insistence upon an epideictic celebration  of Christ’s superhuman capacity is countered by a subtle but insistent under- tone which suggests the opposite: that beneath the seamless surface of this di- vine power, Christ’s Passion darkly pulses. Behind the language of “full  strength,” there is a downward pull into despair, misery and doubt. This  threatens to stain the being of Christ with the taint of melancholy; considered  in the light of modalist Trinitarian doctrines in which the incarnate Christ is  an expression of God’s own being, this weary slump downward further threat- ens to blacken God’s very being with a passionate stain of black bile.  </page> <page sequence="8"> 112 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 Reduplicating at the level of his prose the very gesture of “self-cancellation”  that marks his subject, Donne’s text blurs his own agency, or authorial force.  Smearing manifold sources—listed extravagantly on his title page—into a  nonstop pageant of bickering and mutually incongruous authority figures in a  manner that anticipates Burton’s Anatomy, Donne keeps dissolving his Church  Fathers and commentators into each other without ever quite stabilizing or  reinforcing a clear central point of authorial security about his own relation- ship to the sources he cites. This tactic affords him both legitimacy and a kind  of scholastic camouflage that suits the delicacy of the subject. W. Speed Hill  situates this strategy as a means to ward off the kind of speculation that one  might regard as psychobiography avant la lettre: Donne’s anxiety to offer irrefutable authority for a (then) heterodox view  of what he delicately refers to as ‘a misinterpretable subject’ accounts for  the multiplication of authorities and their marginal itemization in the  Bodleian MS, a process continued in the holograph that underlies the later  quarto. Are we meant to understand the references? Probably not, at least  in any detail. But we are meant to be impressed with them, to sense that  here is a man of serious purpose, who is not so emotionally involved with  his subject (as he patently was) that his arguments do not carry objective  and authoritative weight. (116–17)  Donne himself seems to sense that the very preponderance of citation requires  some excuses of its own: “If, therefore, in multiplicity of not necessary citations  there appear vanity, or ostentation, or digression, my honesty must make my  excuse and compensation, who acknowledge as Pliny doth, that to choose  rather to be taken in a theft than to give every man his due is obnoxii animi et  infelcis ingenii.” 5 After a dense thicket of such citations, in the decisive passage  Donne finally lands upon a single quotation that is singularly arresting in its  power and force:   And therefore St. Thomas, a man neither of unholy thoughts, nor of bold,  or irreligious, or scandalous phrase, or Elocution (yet I adventure not so  far in his behalfe as Silvester doth That it is impossible that he should have  spoken anything against faith or good manners, ) forebeares not to say That  Christ was so much the cause of his own death, as he is of the wetting, which  might and would not shut the Window when the rayne beates in. (BT 129–30) </page> <page sequence="9"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 113 Deploying citational folds as a means of self-protection, Donne here fashions a  kind of scholarly “bulletproof vest” composed of tightly wound layers of Au- gustine, Thomas, Marlorate and Silvester in order to hedge against censure.6  But he is doing more than that. What looks like caution and distance is, in fact,  a way of focusing the power of what he deploys, amplifying and magnifying its  impact. His showy, overstated negations of the unthinkable idea that St.  Thomas might have entertained an unholy, scandalous, and bold thought is  designed not only to pre-empt misunderstanding, but, also precisely to trigger  a certain frisson of readerly anticipation of an utterance that will pleasurably  and perversely demonstrate those very qualities. Once posed, Thomas’s asser- tion is all the more shocking for the homely and familiar register it deploys:  “Christ was so much the cause of his own death, as he is of the wetting, which might  and would not shut the Window when the rayne beates in.” What fullness or emp- tiness abides within the ontology of this “so much”? What did Christ do in the  negative space opened out by this “willing not” to do something preventative?  Was this an action? Was this a cause? What forces rain down upon the reader  through this open window within the text? What has Donne “let in” through  this citational hole within the body of his own writing? The focus upon the negative, already signaled upon the title page, repeats  itself here, with Christ’s charitable acceptance of his own situation, his refusal  to refuse it, functioning here as a sine qua non of the crucifixion and death he  suffered.  Had he not “opened the window,” the rain would not have been able  to wet him down. Christ’s death becomes a death by exposure, a death caused  by an opening or openness to the surrounding fallen world. Having cleared his  throat with the catalog of Church fathers, Donne goes on to affirm this basic  ur-responsibility in something more like his own voice: “And that it is a  Heroique act of fortitude, if a Man when an urgent occasion is presented, ex- pose himself to a certayne and assured Death, as he did” (BT 130). Christ is  thus imagined not as actively killing himself, but he is, I think, here pictured as  committing a kind of “suicide by cop.”  I do not use this phrase to be trivial. If we telescope backwards through the  Gospels and consider the provocations and refusals that ramp upward toward  the arrest and across the stations of the cross, we can see a slow form of passive- aggressive presentation of the self before the authorities that borders upon  what the Black Panther activist Huey P. Newton described in his memoir of  the same name as “revolutionary suicide”:  </page> <page sequence="10"> 114 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 Revolutionary suicide does not mean that I and my comrades have a death  wish; it means just the opposite. We have such a strong desire to live with  hope and human dignity that existence without them is impossible. When  reactionary forces crush us, we must move against these forces, even at the  risk of death. (3)  The certainty and assurance that Donne invokes is mirrored in Newton’s  full recognition, and acceptance, of death. But Christ goes beyond the Black  Panthers in an absolute certainty about the necessity of a fatal outcome that  eclipses the calculated potentiality for survival still implicit in a word like risk.  This willful self-exposure to death and risk has already been recognized by  readers of the Gospels, as when, in A Noble Death: Suicide and Martyrdom  Among Christians and Jews in Antiquity, Arthur J. Droge and James D. Tabor  cite Jesus’s reprimand in Matthew 26.52–53 to those of his followers who at- tempt to use violence to prevent his arrest: “Either thinkest thou that I can not  now pray to my Father, and he wil give me mo then twelve legions of Angels?  How then shulde  the Scriptures be fulfilled, which say, that it must be so?” 7 Christ’s  rejoinder betrays not just passive acceptance but a willingness to be perse- cuted, captured and executed; implicitly, those events are treated as the de- sired completion of a pre-ordained plan, rather than as an occupational hazard  of political resistance.  Opening the Window to “Communitas” Setting aside this presentist juxtaposition of Christ and the Black Panthers,  here I wish to leave the window open and run a further calculated risk of my  own, in offering the tendentious claim that Donne’s selection of St. Thomas’s  metaphor of the open-window, reinforced as it is by Donne’s own use of the  term exposure to imagine Christ’s openness to his own death, constitutes an  early modern theological mirror of a more modern theory. Specifically, Roberto  Esposito’s theory of the constitutively subtractive force of community itself as  an “opening” toward a radical exteriority, a crease or twist that Esposito  identifies as the crossing point of nihilism and community in his text,  Communitas: the Origin and Destiny of Community, and in particular in the  compressed but suggestive appendix to that volume, titled “Nihilism and  Community.” In that text, Esposito rejects theories of community as a shared  property or as a collectively aggregated substantial assemblage in favor of a  </page> <page sequence="11"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 115 darker vision of the “no-thing-in-common” that underwrites the social. It is my  speculation that Esposito’s excursus upon nihilism might offer a means to  counter the materialist and vitalist turn implicit in recent thought on political  ecologies, and so I propose it in the context of this issue to mark out an  alternative, or at least a boundary, to the emphasis upon vibrancy implicit in  that critical tendency, even up to its encounters with dead rats. Not in order to  say that it is somehow better, more subtle, more supple overall, but simply that  it is locally better suited to examining the theological ontology of negativity  and death in play within Donne’s text.  I offer Esposito’s position as a kind of contemporary vantage point from  which to think backward, hoping that it boomerangs through Donne’s open  window and then circles back, returning us to a present where it offers an alter- native to the assemblage and network-oriented ways currently critically preva- lent as means to think about the social. (I have in mind here a broad range of  thinkers including not only Jane Bennett but also Bruno Latour and Manuel  De Landa.) While I find Esposito’s position perversely appealing, I have no  particular desire to pervert him myself, so here is his own extended passage of  self-summary: According to the originary valence of the concept of community, what the  members of a community share, based upon the complex and profound  meaning of munus, is rather an expropriation of their own essence, which  isn’t limited to their “having” but one that involves and affects their own  “being subjects.” Here the discourse follows a crease that moves from the  more traditional domain of anthropology or of political philosophy to that  more radical terrain of ontology: that the community isn’t joined to an ad- dition but to a subtraction of subjectivity, by which I mean that its mem- bers are no longer identical with themselves but are constitutively exposed  to a propensity that forces them to open their own individual boundaries  in order to appear as what is “outside” themselves. (138)  To be joined to a community is not to possess some positive characteristic but  to be cut open, exposed to an “outside.” Subjectivity becomes a negative space,  what is definitively partitioned off as subjects are joined—together—toward  an exteriority.  For Esposito, the “no-thing-in-common” that ontologically  grounds community is a sort of syntax, a relational spacing that produces this  breaching experience of an openness, a facing toward . . . what? Not a facing  </page> <page sequence="12"> 116 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 toward an Althusserian hailing or interpellating authority figure or some other  sovereign emissary of power, but instead an “outside” that has no content, no  “thing” to ground it. Paradoxically, this subtractive opening onto the outside is  the “no-thing-in-common” characteristic of community as such.   It is my further speculation—going beyond Esposito—that for this rea- son the act of suicide, an act that both cancels the subject and confirms its  irreducibility, also constitutes the point at which the communal propensity to  open individual boundaries toward that very “outside” achieves its most thor- ough and complete expression. Suicide dissolves the subject into a total, radi- cal exteriority without reserve. In this sense, suicide—far from simply delim- iting the social or attacking it—constitutes the purest possible conclusion to  the project of opening already in play at the heart of community itself.  Lest this rather heady assertion of the negative political affordances of sui- cide’s potential for the creation or reinforcement of social bonds seem unclear,  let me cite a single contemporary name by way of recent example: Mohamed  Bouazizi, the Tunisian street vendor whose self-immolation on 17 Dec. 2010, in  a public square in front of a government building in Sidi Bouzid in protest  against his humiliation and harassment at the hands of police precipitated a  massive public uprising in solidarity.8 Less than a month after his death, the  regime of Tunisia’s president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was brought to an end,  and the success of this political transformation is widely held to have provided  a blueprint for subsequent uprisings and demonstrations in Egypt, Yemen,  Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Libya, and beyond. Explaining and extending the lion- ization of Bouazizi within the region, Western media was seemingly unani- mous in its posthumous re-circulation of his causal efficacy: The New York  Times offered a thinkpiece titled “How a Single Match Can Ignite a Revolu- tion,” Reuters favored the declarative that “Peddler’s Martyrdom Launched  Tunisia’s Revolution,” while CNN referred to “the Tunisian Fruitseller who  Kickstarted Arab Uprising,” treating as a fait accompli his status as prime  mover. Without detaining myself in a lengthy analysis of the Western media’s  representations of Arab experience, I can say that this desire to shrink complex  and wide-ranging social movements down to heroic human interest stories  should not come as a surprise, nor can a Western representation of suicide  within the world of Islam emerge innocently.  That said, the celebration of Bouazizi across the global mediasphere also  triggered anxious reflections from Arab news sources, Arab intellectuals, and  Islamic clerics about where to locate Bouazizi within the complex politico- </page> <page sequence="13"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 117 theological nest of distinctions and overlaps between self-killing, suicide, mar- tyrdom, and sacrifice.9 Copycat incidents proliferated, as did warnings against  them. The troubling exemplarity of Bouazizi’s act unleashed collective experi- ences of identification, mourning, and political action whose consequences are  still reverberating, and a different essay than mine would pursue this act on its  own terms in all of their local complexity.  What I find portable is the undeniable demonstration of the reciprocal and  generative feedback loop between self-killing and collective political feeling, no  less in the present moment than in the fierce polemical debates that Donne  prototyped in Biathanatos and went public with in Pseudo-Martyr, his partisan  critique of Catholic martyrologies on behalf of a militant Protestantism. Vol- untary death cuts to the relationship between sovereign and subject, severing  that bond in a gesture of absolute refusal and total resistance. But from this  singular act, a branching path of consequences radiate outward, re-connecting  the dead political subject to the group. The collective posthumous memorial- ization of such acts ratifies the meaning of the relationship between the iso- lated death of the subject and the social surround as a whole. There are two  common forms that this process can take: either a community closes the  meaning of the individual death over through forgetting, disavowal, and  pathologizing strategies that fix a pejorative meaning upon it as “suicide” or,  alternately, a community can insist upon heroically reifying that death as an  index of a shareable commitment to a broader cause. This second option de- fines an ethos of participation and obligation toward the recuperated meaning  of an individual death as “martyrdom” or “sacrifice.” In the process, such reifi- cation purges the act of its suicidal associations with sin, weakness, despair,  and insanity. Self-killing is not a unity, but a manifold act of signification sus- ceptible to political re-use, revision, and appropriation in which “suicide” and  “martyrdom” struggle over explanatory territory while deforming and resem- bling each other. The anxious circuits of resemblance between these honorific  and pejorative constructions of the “same” act remain heavily guarded and rhe- torically invested because of the symbolic capital potentially afforded by such  powerfully inspiring scenarios, a capital presumably lost to pathologies of  shame by the accusation, or fact, of suicide.  Insofar as community is inherently committed to survival and persistence,  community remains in its very essence determined through a definitive rela- tion to death as its organizing threat. In The Inoperative Community—a text to  which Esposito asserts that Communitas owes “an unpayable debt”—Jean-Luc  </page> <page sequence="14"> 118 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 Nancy influentially argued for their constitutive linkage.10 In order to clarify  the extent to which Esposito’s nihilistic account of community builds upon  Nancy’s articulation of the essential link between community and death, I  have assembled the following catena of sequential excerpts from Nancy: Death is indissociable from community, for it is through death that the  community reveals itself—and reciprocally. . . . Community does not  weave a superior, immortal, or transmortal life between subjects (no more  than it is itself woven of the inferior bonds of a consubstantiality of blood  or of an association of needs), but it is constitutively, to the extent that it is  a matter of a “constitution” here, calibrated on the death of those whom we  call, perhaps wrongly, its “members” (inasmuch as it is not a question of an  organism). Community is revealed in the death of others; hence it is always  revealed to others. Community is what takes place always through others  and for others. . . . The genuine community of mortal beings, or death as  community, establishes their impossible communion. Community there- fore occupies a singular place: it assumes the impossibility of its own im- manence, the impossibility of a communitarian being in the form of a sub- ject. In a certain sense community acknowledges and inscribes—this is its  peculiar gesture—the impossibility of community. . . .  A community is the  presentation to its members of their mortal truth. (14–15)  If in Biathanatos St. Thomas offers both a theological source and a paradoxical  occasion for the demonstration of Donne’s own authorial agency and transfor- mative wit, the same could be said for the utility of Nancy for Esposito. But one  might also rotate this four-part analogy (St. Thomas : Donne :: Nancy : Es- posito) into a monstrously presentist twist by comparing Nancy and Donne  directly. Bracketing their extreme divergence at the level of dogma and context,  it is here on the page that the paradoxical treatises of Jack and Jean-Luc could  be brought together: both Biathanatos and The Inoperative Community exhibit  the self-cancellation of an authorial presence that continually unwrites its own  agency as it works and re-works its claims, producing a gallery of  “peculiar  gestures” that press up against, and occasionally seem to spill over into, non- sense and contradiction, on their way to a thinking of death and community as  equi-primordial partners. However distinct in his aims and vocabulary from  Donne, Nancy’s crypto-liturgical cascade of deconstructive pronouncements  is strategically useful insofar as it offers a means to at once assert and re-  </page> <page sequence="15"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 119 estrange the foundational importance of death as the bonding agent of the  Christian mystery (or rhetoric) of participation. Let us grant the obvious coun- terpoint: the “revelation of a mortal truth,” so crucial to both Jack Donne’s po- etry and D. Donne’s sermons, is always bundled with the compensatory fact of  Christ’s resurrection and the symmetrical possibilities of salvation or damna- tion for the Christian soul. The other side of the subject’s “mortal truth” is  surely Holy Sonnet X’s hopeful declaration that “Death, thou shalt die” (Poems  910).  But Donne’s imagination often becomes the site for an anxiously down- ward pull in which the claims of the body threaten to upstage, even compro- mise, the consolatory force of these outcomes on this side of mortality. This is  a tendency that started early in his career, as the example of his Paradoxes and  Problems—early prose works from his student days—demonstrates. Pre-emp- tively canceling vibrant materialism in favor of a morbid materialism, Donne’s  fifth paradox is titled “That all things kill themselves” and it begins thus:  To affect, yea to effect their owne death all living things are importuned,  not by Nature only which perfects them, but by Art and Education, which  perfects her. Plants quickened and inhabited by the most unworthy soule,  which therefore neither will nor worke, affect an end, a perfection, a death;  this they spend their spirits to attaine, this attained, they languish and  wither. (Selected Prose 10–11)  Donne then works his way up the chain of being, finding in each link another  witty demonstration of his paradoxical thesis, beating to the punch Freud’s  later declaration in Beyond the Pleasure Principle that “The aim of all life is death”  (7). But paradoxes have a predilection for reversibility, and when this resolute  and constitutional morbidity returns most show-stoppingly in Donne’s final  sermon “Death’s Duell,” the passage out of life becomes a noisomely productive  process of material ruin-as-rebirth:  Though this be exitus a morte, it is introitus in mortem: though it bee an  Issue from the manifold deaths of this world, yet is an entrance into the  death of corruption and putrefaction and vermiculation and incineration,  and dispersion in and from the grave, in which every dead man dyes over  againe. (Sermons 235–36) </page> <page sequence="16"> 120 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 Donne cannot, it seems, refrain from “considering too curiously” upon the ma- teriality of the process of death, and, insofar as he finds there a vividly popu- lated scene of “vermiculation” in which activity and emergence bursts forth  within the corpse, this would seem to make him a potentially likely host author  for Jane Bennett’s project of “vibrant materialism.” Surely Donne’s corpse,  writhing with worms, is a case in point of a dead matter that refuses to lie still  and play dead, and could be made to function as an early modern resonating  chamber for rethinking corpses as vibrant agents of their own. But, in fact, the  valence goes the other way: as Ramie Targoff has noted, in “Death’s Duell”  Donne is engaged in a rhetorical process in which the entirety of life is itself  shown to be already consumed and saturated by death, absorbed into an ex- tended process of dying.11 If Bennett wants us to see even the dead rat as suf- fused with a vibrancy, Donne wants us to see even a live rat as already preparing  for its certain material annihilation even while still embryonically “buried” in  its mother’s womb.12   As Donne understood and practiced it, Christianity is itself much pos- sessed by death. The community of Christendom that bears witness in the  present to the meaning of Christ’s suffering and death is founded upon an  originary act of leaving the self open to the world and subject to a material  death, and it memorializes that sacrifice through the yearly observance of Eas- ter services, private meditations upon the Passion, and countless representa- tions of the suffering of Christ, arresting the progression of a narrative arc in a  frozen stance of affective stasis provocatively proximate to melancholy. We  can see this sorrowful suffering and entry into death not only across Donne’s  poetry and sermons but also refracted across early modern culture more  broadly, from Dürer’s engraving of the Man of Sorrows to Milton’s unfinished  poem on the Christ’s Passion. In placing Christ within the suicidal archive of  Biathanatos, Donne explicitly articulated this paradoxical intersection be- tween voluntary death and Christian community, in the process anticipating  the categorical interpenetration of death and community asserted by Nancy  and re-doubled by Esposito.  Donne understands the catalog of martyrdoms he marshals as a sequence  of citations of this original act that resemble and replay its dynamic, stitching  each self-killer back to the Savior, but also binding together Christendom itself  into a web of connections and linkages constituted by these cuttings open and  cuttings away. Yet each act, including those before Christ and those after, reca- pitulates his central and, in this sense, “originary” moment of surrender to  </page> <page sequence="17"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 121 death, a moment that collapses the distinction between martyrdom and sui- cide by relocating the adjudication of these conflicting descriptions within an  unreachably abyssal privacy:  And it is there sayd that Christ did so, as Saul did, who thought it foule  and dishonorable to dy by the hand of an Enemy: And that Apollonia and  others, who prevented the fury of Executioners; and cast themselves into  the fire, did therein imitate this act of our Savyor, of giving up his Soule,  before he was constrayned to do it. So that if the act of our B. Savyor, in  whome there was no more required for Death, but that he should will that  his Soule should go out, was the same as Sauls and these Martyrs actuall  furtherance, which could not dy without that, then we are taught that all  those places, of Giving up our body to death, and of Laying downe the  Soule, Signify more then a yielding to death when it comes. (BT 130)  Here again, Donne does not quite cash out what this “more” positively consists  in, but nonetheless coyly points toward something on the other side of mere  yielding. Such attendance upon the moment of death suffuses the entirety of  Donne’s work. As Donald Friedman put it, “[i]n the instant of parting Donne  found, again and again, the stress, the pain, the terror, that could be chafed into  illumination” (77). Expanding this assertion into an entire monograph that  tracks the poetics of both their union and their valedictory separation within  Donne’s work, Targoff’s John Donne: Body and Soul amplifies the extent to  which both Jack Donne and D. Donne remain enmeshed in an anxious consid- eration of the ars moriendi as the conclusion of a partnership fraught with anxi- ety at its own finitude. As Targoff puts it, with disarming simplicity, “[f]or  Donne, the relationship between the body and the soul—a relationship he re- garded as one of mutual necessity—was the defining bond of his life” (1).  But against the backdrop of that career-long obsession, the particular part- ing of this soul from this body has a definitive, absolute singularity. Donne’s  reference to “Laying downe the Soule” upon the cross recalls Christ’s proleptic  announcement in John 10.17–18: Therefore doeth my Father love me, because I laye down my life, yet I  might take it againe. No man taketh it from me, but I laye it downe of my  self: I have power to lay it downe, and have power to take it againe: this  commandment have I received of my father.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 122 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 Not desire, not choice, but not not those things either. Donne and the Gospel  both register in their own ways an eclipsed and yet indicated decisionist mo- ment in which the Savior pre-empts pure passivity through a granting or giv- ing, a donum. This term has become central to the “radical orthodoxy” of recent  work at the intersection of critical theory and theology. Here I have in mind in  particular John Milbank’s Being Reconciled: Ontology and Pardon, who notes:  Creation and grace are gifts; Incarnation is the supreme gift; the Fall, evil,  and violence are the refusal of gift; atonement is the renewed and hyper- bolic gift that is for-giveness; the supreme name of the Holy Spirit is  donum (according to Augustine); the Church is the community that is  given to humanity and is constituted through the harmonious blending of  diverse gifts (according to St. Paul). (ix) The problem is then the relationship between the gift of incarnation and the  gift of  community. Is the accession to death a completion of the gift of incarna- tion or its refusal?  We cannot know, and we pass here into either a mysticism  or an epistemological abyss of access toward the Savior’s unknown interior: the  answer lies in how we evaluate the will within the mind within the head that  slumps as a Body that is the Being of God giving up its Ghost. If, in Biathana- tos, the possibility that this was an act of self-killing is implied only to be muted  and qualified and hedged, that hesitation does not, in fact, conclude the issue.  In time, unspeakable things have a tendency to be spoken. What had been the  “misinterpretable” and dangerously blasphemous suspicion buried within anx- ious casuistry became, at the end of Donne’s life, in his final sermon in 1631, a  ringing final affirmation: “there was nothing more free, more voluntary, more  spontaneous than the death of Christ” (Sermons 244). Was this voluntary will toward death an example of “exposure” to the ex- teriority that Esposito, and Nancy before him, have alleged is foundational to  community as such? We seem to be at a point where Esposito’s insistence  upon nihilism might seem to render his account minimally congruent with  Donne, for obvious intellectual historical reasons. The Christian tradition of  thinking inclusion and belonging in a spiritual incorporation stands as a kind  of vanished preliminary to the modern philosophical arc that Esposito traces  in Communitas as its gradual displacement. For Esposito, this intellectual his- torical process effectively starts with the fearful contracts of Hobbes and pro- ceeds through the general will of Rousseau, the categorical ubiquity of law in  </page> <page sequence="19"> Daniel • A Political Necrology of God 123 Kant, and the “Mitsein” of Heidegger before coming to rest in a contemporary  moment that Esposito theorizes via Bataille on sovereignty and Nancy on  community. But before his working through of that extended sequence,  Esposito offers a preliminary account of how we are to understand Christian  brotherhood taking place under the shadow of a constitutively prior divine  gift, and it is this moment in which Esposito usefully intersects with both  Milbank and Donne: And it is precisely this “given”—what is given to us, we ourselves as “given,”  “donated, ” born from a gift—that stands in the way of any hasty transla- tion of koinonia into a simple philia- “friendship, ” “fellowship, ” “camara- derie” or “Freundschaft. ” Yes, we are brothers, but brothers in Christ, in an  otherness that withdraws us from our subjectivity, our own subjective  property, so as to pin it, subjectivity, to a point that is “void of subject” from  which we come and toward which we are called, just as long as we remain  “grateful” so as to respond to that first munus with a corresponding gift. . . .  This gift-giving [donativo] inflection of “participation” restores to the  Christian koinonia all of the expropriating drama of the ancient munus;  what one participates in isn’t the glory of the resurrection but the suffering  of the blood of the Cross (I. Cor. 10:16; Phil 3:10). Any possibility of appro- priation is diminished; “taking part in” means everything except “to take”;  on the contrary, it means losing something, to be weakened, to share the  fate of the servant, not of the master (Phil. 3:10–11). His death. (11)  Death is precisely that which links the Christian donum with Esposito’s nihil- istic conclusion. To assert this point of voluntary accession to death as founda- tional to Christian community is to assert the unfinished business that social  ontologies have with their epistemological barriers: we cannot fix the meaning  of that death within the spectrum afforded by “martyrdom” and “suicide” be- cause we are bystanders to it, located in a space apart. To recall the predica- ment of closure that Bennett announced as her own text reached the end of its  rope and asserted a Nicene creed of “one matter energy” without end, I here  reach my own stopping place with a recommendation, if not a benediction.  When vitalist-materialism reaches the end of its rope, it may be time to let go  of activity and vibrancy. It may be time to open the window, and let the rain  beat in.  </page> <page sequence="20"> 124 The Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies • 13:3 n o t e s  1. This question also surfaces, of course, within the book itself, most notably in the ten- sion that drives the fifth chapter, on the vitalism of Driesch. See Bennett 62–82. 2. See Sullivan’s introduction to Donne, Biathanatos (hereafter BT). The textual ed- iting hurdles in assessing Biathanatos are acute, as the text is bifurcated into a Bodleian  MS copied out for Herbert and a posthumous 1674 Quarto edition. In an acerbic critique  of Sullivan’s edition, the textual situation is discussed by Hill. Hill alleges that Donne  continued to work on the text after creating the copy for Herbert, which renders the dif- ferences in 1647 at least provisionally authorial. I cite Sullivan’s because his retains original  spellings, but have consulted both Sullivan’s and Rudick and Battin’s editions in this essay  and indicate which edition is being cited.  3.

In this sense, the response to Bouazizi’s self-immolation inherited the epistemo- logical deadlock surrounding terrorist actions—are they cases of “suicide” or “martyrdom,”  and who decides which term fits? As Hafez notes in his introduction to Manufacturing  Human Bombs: The Making of Palestinian Suicide Bombers, “how one describes acts of self- immolation committed in order to kill others is a task fraught with controversy. Those  who support these acts of violence prefer to call them ‘martyrdom operations,’ and their  perpetrators ‘heroes’ and ‘freedom fighters.’ Those who oppose them prefer to call them  ‘homicide bombers,’ ‘suicide terrorists’ or ‘suicidal murderers.’” (4). Bouazizi only killed  himself, and this makes his act altogether distinct, and yet the ambient contest over seman- tics particular to suicide-terrorism recurred within the debates surrounding his suicidal  exemplarity.  10.
