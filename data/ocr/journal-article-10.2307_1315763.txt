<plain_text><page sequence="1">Steve Baker The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis Introduction What is the relationship between the graphic com- munication and the individual in the spaces of the metropolis?' What are their common interests and what power does either hold in relation to the other? One widely held (but ultimately unsatisfactory) view asserts that we are overwhelmed by the insidious influence of the advertising messages that crowd in on us from all sides, and that the very profusion, excess and inescapability of advertising contributes to the dissolution of the distinctions between 'reality' and its simulacra, between individual desire and media manipulation, and even between the realms of the public and the private. The adherents of this view present it in persuasive terms. We will undoubtedly be appalled by our own complicity in advertising's project if we believe Mark Crispin Miller's claim that nowadays 'all waking experience, urban and suburban, is a virtual palimp- sest of ads', or Jean Baudrillard's assertion that we live in a society which only wants to be happy with itself. Indivisible and consensual. That's why advertising has become such an all-powerful medium-what better means for expressing collective self-satisfaction?2 Such accounts, however, seem almost to grant advertising the status of a new and all-encompassing metropolitan 'Nature', the source of whose mean- ings are beyond question and beyond change-as if, somehow, it might fill the vacuum left by semiol- ogy's earlier expulsion of the concepts of nature and the natural. For Miller this new nature takes hold of the indi- vidual through advertising's domination of the streets of the city: 'Like the modern city, whose heady atmosphere throughout this century has been defined by the vivid skyward glow of advertising, advertising itself aspires to become our total environment'.3 Baudrillard, in contrast, sees adver- tising and modern communications achieving their effect principally via the television screen. He describes that effect as being the virtual erasure of the viewers' bodies and of their immediate environ- ment, so that the individual appropriated by these communications is reduced to the status of 'a pure screen, a switching centre for all the networks of influence'.4 Neither of these positions seems tenable. They deny the individual-as-viewer any role in the construction of contemporary meanings, and they fail to acknowledge that advertising's messages are themselves constructed by individuals. They describe an anonymous manipulative power which may indeed represent advertising's totalizing ambitions in the contemporary world, but which substantially misrepresents its achievements. The effectiveness of the graphic image and of the industry that supports it is far less complete and certain (as Baudrillard has himself acknowledged on other occasions).5 This, it will become clear, is nowhere more evident than in the metropolis. The metropolis is in fact the ideal site for shifting power-and in particular the power of self-descrip- tion-back towards the individual. Advertising, of course, is far from being the only manifestation of manipulative graphic imagery in the metropolis; cor- porate identities, high-street shop fascias and even directional signs also seek to persuade, influence or control the individual. Needless to say, as Marshall Berman and others have ably demonstrated, the modern city provides a wide variety of non-graphic opportunities for the exercise of influence and control.6 But of the graphic manifestations, which are what concern us here, it is the advertising images which are both the least permanent and the most frequently discussed. It is their meanings, therefore, which can most easily (and must most urgently) be shown to be merely provisional, rather than total and systematic. In doing so it will be possible to assign the graphics of the metropolis a role which is at once less coercive and more creative than it may otherwise appear. The Striking Image There is a certain correspondence between the struc- ture of individual experience and the structure of Journal of Design History Vol. 3 No. 4 ? 1990 The Design History Society 0952-4649/90 $3.00 227</page><page sequence="2">commercial display in the metropolis. In this, at least, the proponents of the apocalyptic view of advertising's domination are correct. It is therefore necessary to explore this correspondence in some detail in order to reassess the balance of power between the individual and the graphic communica- tion. Rather than taking the form of the individual's trance-like adherence to the imperatives of the advertising message, the correspondence might better be thought of as an altogether more combative experience, closely related to the kaleidoscopic, chaotic and fragmentary perceptions which defini- tions of modernity (and indeed post-modernity) fre- quently describe as characterizing the experience of metropolitan life. The metropolitan environment has historically been as much of a threat to graphic design as a power base for it. This can be explained as follows. Modern urban graphic design can be defined princi- pally by the existence of a mass audience for its messages. It was an audience which could only be found in the modern city, and which was first properly recognized by writers on design as a result of the international mass poster production of the First World War. Poster magazines during the war carried articles with titles such as 'Poster art and the multitude' and 'Aiming the poster at the multitude', and repeatedly stressed the unprecedented scale of poster production: 'Ten million posters for new loan', and so on.7 After the war, when the unanimity of the war message was replaced by a return to com- petitive commercial imagery on a greatly increased scale, the particular problems of mass graphic com- munication became apparent. In the metropolis the mass audience was not easily reached, since the successful communication of any given graphic imperative was impeded precisely by the prolifera- tion of other such imperatives. The point was noted by W. G. Raffe in his 1929 book Poster Design: The message of the poster can be graded in intensities in direct ratio to pressure of population. In a large city with a great population the attention value of a given poster design will be less than the same design in a small town. The speed is less; the number is smaller, the buildings are smaller and less important, and the whole environment competes less in interest. ... To city people who see very many posters, as well as other printed designs, a special appeal must be made to secure the moment's attention that is asked ... One poster or one hoarding in a provincial town will secure the attention of all with good sight in the town if the site is at a focal point. But even a whole hoard- ing may escape notice in the dense traffic of London. For Raffe there was only one solution: graphic com- munications in the metropolis would have to be 'emphatic and startling'.8 These recommendations for the presentation of the modern poster are comparable in many ways to Georg Simmel's earlier observations on the deport- ment of the modern metropolitan individual. In his 1903 essay 'Die Grosstadt und das Geistesleben' ('The metropolis and mental life') Simmel had specu- lated on the strategies by which the individual managed to maintain a sense of identity amid the speed and chaos of everyday city life. He wrote of the specifically metropolitan experience of 'being different', of standing out in a striking manner and thereby attracting attention ... I refer to the brevity and scarcity of the inter-human contacts granted to the metropolitan man, as compared with social intercourse in the small town. The temptation to appear 'to the point', to appear concentrated and strikingly characteristic, lies much closer to the individual in brief metropolitan contacts than in an atmosphere in which frequent and prolonged association assures the personality of an unambiguous image of himself in the eyes of the other." There is no evidence that Raff6, writing in England, would have been aware of Simmel's essay-his own recommendations seem simply to have been intended as 'common sense' advice to the unwary advertiser. In an earlier book, however, he acknowl- edged at the level of representation what Simmel had seen only as a matter of presentation: the indi- vidual's need to adopt a striking appearance. That book was Raffe's Graphic Design, published in 1927-a book which has been totally neglected by design historians, despite almost certainly being the first book to use the term 'graphic design' in its title. The first illustration in the book depicted a variety of 'Advertising figures' [1], and carried the following caption: 'The graphic design of these important persons demands great care. They must be distinc- tive, and allow reproduction in almost any size and medium. Thus strong checks, spots, and stripes have been prominent'.'0 These preposterous individuals illustrated by Raff6 may not have been quite what Simmel had envisaged on the streets of Berlin at the turn of the 228 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="3">- ----- - 1 'Advertising figures', from W.

There is, none the less, considerable poten- tial for exchange between these exaggeratedly intense and insistently visual signs of the individual and the commercial in the metropolis. Even if the site of this potential slippage between 'reality' and repre- sentation is restricted to its recognition in current theoretical discourses, its influence on our under- standing of these historical appearances will be real enough. That understanding, however, does not need to follow the usual pattern of associating an intensifica- tion of the visual with forms of objectification and dehumanization. It is certainly easy to appreciate Johannes Fabian's concern when he asks despon- dently of visualist tendencies: Once the source of any knowledge worthy of that name is thought primarily to be visual perception of objects in space, why should it be scandalous to treat the Other- other societies, other cultures, other classes within the same society-comme des choses ?1 In the metropolis, nevertheless, it is not necessary to take such a negative view of the primacy of the visual, nor to assume that it entails the alienation of the individual from his or her metropolitan sur- roundings. The Sign of the Self as the Sign of the Other The visual, and the whole notion of visibility, is central to discussions of identity. National and corporate identities, even when they are not given pictorial expression, serve to bestow an imaginary visibility on groups which have lost sight of their presumed totality: their sense of selfhood.'2 The metropolis seems to be something of an exception in this respect. It, too, will have lost sight of its totality-or rather its inhabitants will have done so- and it will have had recourse to all manner of repre- sentations in its attempt to regain a visibility and a sense of order and control. Civic pride may some- times even encourage it to commission its own 'cor- porate identity'. More often, however, the public spaces of the metropolis will witness the display of competing representations of identity, all struggling for acknowledgement and acceptance 'in the eyes of the other'-the phrase is Simmel's, but it also recalls Hegel's emphatic assertion that self-consciousness achieves its satisfaction only in another self- consciousness. The identity of the metropolis, as much as that of any individual within it, might also be likened to Hegel's characterization of self-consciousness in the sense that it is a kind of formless flux within which The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis 229</page><page sequence="4">certain shapes can be determined: 'the simple uni- versal fluid medium is the in-itself, and the differ- ence of the shapes is the other'.'3 It is by visual differentiation that the identity of this other is there- fore initially secured. The visually emphatic repre- sentations of identity in the metropolis-Simmel's striking individual and Raffe's dazzlingly-patterned advertising figure-are thus like the marked terms on an unmarked ground. In this they resemble signs of otherness more than the signs of selfhood which they purport to be. This needs some explanation, because the metro- polis is here upsetting the equilibrium of our expec- tations concerning identity. That equilibrium (in some hypothetical non-metropolitan space) posits an invisible, naturalized self which is opposed to a visible and obtrusive other. Liam Hudson has explained this expectation at the level of individual experience: In our dealings with other people, we automatically use their outward appearance (facial features and expression, bodily shape and posture, clothes) as the format within which to lodge whatever we think or feel about them. In our dealings with ourselves, there is no such format.14 The graphic equivalent of this expectation can perhaps be clarified by setting up a distinction between, say, the categories of the corporate logo (representing a 'self') and of the caricature (depicting 'others'). The pictorial image of the human body is largely absent from corporate logos, and from corporate identity programmes in general. This is despite the fact that the body is the most obvious and the most persistent visual metaphor for the more slippery notion of identity, and also despite the fact that designers invariably discuss organizations in anthropomorphic terms. In contrast, the caricature and other forms of overt pictorial stereotyping are characterized not only by the depiction of the body but by a symbolic violence against it which consider- ably heightens its visibility. This violence serves to mark out the caricature's victims as other, so we are understandably reluctant to turn such a technique against ourselves or those we support. E. H. Gombrich once gave a concise explanation of this thinking: Suppose we take a picture of our favourite champion from today's paper-would we enjoy taking a needle and poking out the eyes? ... I do not think so. However well I know with my waking thoughts that what I do to his picture makes no difference to my friend or hero, I still feel a vague reluctance to harm it. Somewhere there remains the absurd feeling that what one does to the picture is done to the person it represents.'5 On the occasions when this reluctance is overcome, the result can be an image of startling otherness, immediacy and presence [2]. Seen on a street hoard- ing or on the London Underground, this is exactly the kind of striking image which could survive in Simmel's and Raffe's metropolis. Its distinctiveness and difference, however, is achieved only at the cost of the depicted body's sense of selfhood, since the body is deprived of its pictorial integrity and whole- ness. It may be objected that this example is extreme and unrepresentative, and that the metropolis is 2 Poster for the Multiple Scierosis Society, London Underground, April 1988 230 Steve Baker</page><page sequence="5">more often filled with advertising images depicting the idealized body or self: a model of order and success designed specifically for our emulation [3]. Of course it is. But it is precisely in their mass con- formity to an imaginary perfection of the self that such images fail to be striking, and sink back into anonymity and invisibility. In the metropolis, a distinct identity can only be maintained by abandon- ing the characteristic invisibility of the self. In demanding the recognition of another self- consciousness, the metropolitan subject is forced to take on the objecthood which it typically associates with that other rather than itself, and in this un- familiar reciprocity it finds itself (in Hegel's words) 'just as much "I" as "object"'.'1 '.i L e '; ii -S - ' . 1 i- 3 'Manpower' poster, Liverpool, April 1988 The Provisional Metropolis In describing the complex stages through which a self-consciousness must pass, Hegel argues that the eventual mastery of one self-consciousness over another will be preceded firstly by the recognition of their reciprocity, and then by a life-and-death struggle between them: 'They must engage in this struggle, for they must raise their certainty of being for themselves to truth'.'7 Despite its combative nature, this life-and-death struggle for self-realiza- tion in fact represents a brief moment of equilibrium, a momentary deferral of the dynamic of power which will shortly and inevitably lead to the sub- jugation of one by the other. Applied to individuals, this may sound over-schematic and unduly melo- dramatic-an early version of the cliched theme of selfhood achieved in the face of adversity. Applied to the graphic communications of the metropolis, how- ever, it admirably describes their competitiveness and their vulnerability at the instant of potential communication. If their bid for power and identity fails to attract the viewer's attention, that failure will be absolute. As Charles Matlack Price warned at the end of his 1913 survey of European and American posters: A play, a statue, a book, a picture will all have a redeeming value in some unconsidered particular even if they fail in their main purpose. When a poster fails, its failure is utter and irretrievable, and its inevitable destiny is its consign- ment to the limbo of waste paper.'1 This failure is experienced as a collapse of meaning. The moment of the life-and-death struggle, in which self and other are held in effective opposition, is actually the only state in which the identity of either will be intelligible. The visual difference of the metropolitan image can only be registered as a difference from the visual stimuli with which it com- petes. The vitality of the metropolis is truly semiological in this respect; its systematicity is self- regulating, not designed. The significance of the potential collapse of graphic meanings in the metropolis must be explained further. Arguing against the idea of a political strategy of the media, Baudrillard asked in the mid-198os: Are the mass media on the side of power in the manipula- tion of the masses, or are they on the side of the masses in The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis 231</page><page sequence="6">the liquidation of meaning, in the violence done to mean- ing? Is it the media that fascinate the masses, or is it the masses who divert the media into showmanship?'9 Part of the answer could be said to lie in the opposi- tion, posited earlier, of the television screen and the street hoarding. The seductive narrative flow of tele- visual imagery-the rise of the '6o-second narrative' in recent television commercials, for instance-may indeed aim to leave the viewer in a state of numb fascination; the street display, in contrast, must vie for attention through undiluted spectacle and 'show- manship'. The street display is thus a vestige of what Foucault would regard as an older order, though it is one which is still capable of subverting the coercion of the institutional and architectural orders of surveillance and panopticism, which are more usually associated with the spaces of modernity.20 This potential for subversion does not lie in the successes or the ubiquity of modern commercial dis- play: W. G. Raffe was surely wrong to worry that the profusion of advertising in the modern railway station of the 1920S might lead naive travellers to mistake the name of an advertised commodity for the name of the station at which they had arrived!21 It lies instead in advertising's vulnerability, in its intermittent and unpredictable effectiveness-in other words in its very failure to dominate the metro- politan environment. In opposition both to the naturalistic continuity of the television commercial and to the seeming permanence of much of the city's architecture, metropolitan advertising is an exem- plary demonstration that meanings are at best pro- visional and fragmentary. Advertisers may indeed hope that their images will be 'dazzling in their gorgeousness'-the phrase is Miller's-but far more often the image will simply be ignored, or misunder- stood, or blocked from view, or defaced with graffiti or otherwise damaged [4-5]. In its singularity and its resistance to convenient categorization, the damaged image ironically attains a higher visibility than before, though not one that benefits its producer or respects that producer's meanings. These comments are not an attempt to outline an aesthetics or a poetics of metropolitan graphics- akin, say, to that of Mimmo Rotella's decollage. Aesthetics is in fact largely irrelevant to the graphic communications of the metropolis, even when it is their success which is being considered. Raffe recog- 4 Torn posters, London Underground, April 1988 nized this. In the 1920os he objected that much 'fashionable cross-Channel "modernism" is thoroughly inefficient and absurd', and he clearly regretted advertising's shift from nineteenth-century narrative to the 'more arresting' approach of 'the modern style' [6]. Nevertheless, he recognized that in an environment where advertisers trying to reach the motorist 'estimate for three seconds in which to deliver the message', the characteristic directness of modernist graphics was a necessity and not a stylis- tic whim." Little has changed in this respect. It is still identity, rather than aesthetics, which is crucial to the graphics of the metropolis. The provisional truths of metropolitan images can only survive through their constant renewal and constant restatement, like the anxious but determined repetition of a stereotype.

Rightly or wrongly, it seems reassuringly improbable that such a metropolis would easily succumb to the imposition of any kind of totalizing 'truth', or visibility, or control. STEVE BAKER Lancashire Polytechnic, Preston Notes i If this opening question seems a little abrupt, it may help to know that this is a modified version of an essay which was written to accompany Milton Glaser's 'Graphics' section in the exhibition 'Beyond the city, the metropolis' at the XVII Triennale di Milano. It appeared in Beyond the City, the Metropolis, edited by Georges Teyssot, Electa, Milan, 1988, though the present version includes the illustrations which were omitted from the Milan catalogue. The essay also served as the basis for a paper (entitled 'Doubting the ecstasy of communication') given at the Design History Society's study day on 'Advertising: The State of the Art', Birmingham, April 1989. 2 See Mark Crispin Miller, 'The critical pursuit of adver- tising', Word &amp; Image, I, no. 4, 1985, p. 320; and Jean Baudrillard, 'Softly, softly', New Statesman, 6 March 1987, p. 44. 3 Mark Crispin Miller, 'The critical pursuit of advertis- ing', p. 320. 4 Jean Baudrillard, 'The ecstasy of communication', translated by John Johnston, in Postmodern Culture, edited by Hal Foster, Pluto Press, London, 1985, p. 133. 5 See in particular Baudrillard's In the Shadow of the Silent Majorities, Semiotext(e), New York, 1983; and his 'The masses: The implosion of the social in the media', translated by Marie Maclean, New Literary History, 16, no. 3, 1985, which is discussed below. 6 See Marshall Berman, All that is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity, Verso, London, 1983; but also Perry Anderson's review of Berman, entitled 'Modern- ity and revolution', and Berman's 'The signs in the street: A response to Perry Anderson', both in New Left Review, no. 144, 1984. 7 The three articles named here all appeared in the Chicago-based monthly magazine The Poster during 1917 and 1918. 8 W.
