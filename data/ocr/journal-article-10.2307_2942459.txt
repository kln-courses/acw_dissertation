<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ragas of North India. BY WALTER KAUF- MANN. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1968. ix, 625 pp. Illustrations, Bib- liography, Index. Paper, $x7.5o. The aim of this book is to give a detailed survey of the rags (ragas) of North Indian classical music. It contains an Introduction, a short chapter on Sources and History and the remainder of the book (531 pages) is devoted to the description of North Indian rags. The treatment of the rags varies a little; the author sometimes begins with a Sanskrit description of the rag, largely in anthropomorphic terms. This is followed by a brief discussion of its main melodic features, and a few characteristic alap phrases are given in staff notation. Fin- ally, the author quotes the tune of a composed piece, generally from the writings of the emi- nent Indian musicologist, V. N. Bhatkhande, who died about thirty years ago. In all, more</page><page sequence="2">884 JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES than two hundred rigs are discussed, some in more detail than others. Quite a number of these are now virtually "text-book rags" and not normally performed. On the other hand the author omits some of the more modern rags in North India, such as: Hemant, Caru- kesi, Kirvani, Nat Bhairav, KaIi7vati, Gdvdti, Madhuvanti, Rasiya, Yamani and Sivrailjani which are readily available on records. Dr. Kaufmann's treatment of rags follows the pattern set out by Bhatkhande and is, for the most part, a fairly accurate representation of Bhatkhande's tradition. However, where Bhatkhande's interpretation does not conform with the general practice of today, for instance in rags such as Lalit, Candrakaums, and Pat- dip, he adds the modern version, to some extent bringing Bhatkhande's work up to date. Per- haps the only real criticism of Dr. Kaufmann's treatment of rags is his slightly rigid approach, this in spite of his giving a number of variant interpretations of particular rags. At times it is not quite clear whether he is describing a rag or prescribing it. On several occasions the au- thor refers to "performance rules" of rags, but these are much more nebulous than he would lead us to believe. This reviewer has found that each musician has his own individual in- terpretation of a rag which differs, at least in minute details, from other interpretations. Much effort has been expended in attempting to establish standard versions of rdgs, which may be very convenient from the academic point of view, but surely this would stifle some of the creative expression of the indi- vidual musician. It is evident that Dr. Kaufmann treats rdgs as static entities, but an examination of the traditional treatises, some of which are mentioned in Chapter 2, clearly show that rags do evolve. This might well provide an explanation of the many divergent interpreta- tions since one can presume that the rate of evolution would not be constant in all parts of North India. In recent times, of course, with the growing ease of communication and the influence of the radio, there is a levelling of these traditions. Evolution also probably ex- plains why some of the traditional songs seem to be incompatible with the improvised dlap, which of course represents a modern interpre- tation of the rag. Dr. Kaufmann attributes this discrepancy to the inherent fault of com- positions where irregularities are "often caused by the textual syllables which may compel the musician to prolong a basically short note or shorten a stressed note" (p. 25). This does not seem entirely convincing in view of the melis- matic style of Indian vocal music. But in any case, one wonders why the notation of certain songs which differ quite markedly from the alap phrases given, should have been included in the work and then brushed aside with a statement that the song given is not an ac- curate representation of the rag. There are a number of questionable state- ments in this book and some inconsistencies which might confuse the reader. For instance, the "strong" notes in rags are given as the Sa- the first note of the scale, the predominant vddi-"speaker," the samrvddi-"consonance," a slightly less important note (p. 5); visrantis- than-an ending note which has the same function as the vadi (p. 7), and "strong" notes -which "almost assume the functions of vish- rantisthans" [sic] (p. 343). But in rags such as Marvd, the Sa is avoided for long periods, as will be seen from the alap phrases on page 3I6. On page 495, discussing the rig Sindh Bhairavi, its vadi is said to have little or no significance, and on page 492 the sarmvddi is said never to be taken into consideration in all the light rags; in the rig Des'kr the samvadi must not be treated strongly (p. I23). This confusion probably arises because in Bhatk- hanlde's system, vadi and samv7di are not al- ways descriptive terms but are sometimes pre- scribed, somewhat arbitrarily, to fit his time theory of rdgs. The reader might also be dis- turbed by the inconsistent and often inaccurate transliteration of Indian words. There is no comparable work in any of the Western languages, so this book will undoubt- edly be of value to ethnomusicologists. For the specialist in Indian music, too, Dr. Kaufmann has some original ideas in his interpretation of certain details. N. A. JAIRAZBI-IOY University of London</page></plain_text>
