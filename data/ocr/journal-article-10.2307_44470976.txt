General Motors Res. Labs. Warren, Ml ABSTRACT The discovery of the mechanism of impact- induced soft tissue injury has led to our introduction of a Viscous Injury Criterion, which predicts the severity and the time of occurrence of soft tissue injury induced by impact when other criteria have failed. Human tolerance has been defined by the Viscous response, [VC], a time function generated by the instantaneous product of velocity of deformation [V(t)] and amount of compression [C( t ) ] of the body. [VC]max = 1.0 m/s corre- sponds experimentally to a 25% chance of sus- taining severe thoracic injury (AIS &gt;4) in a blunt frontal impact. A similar level of risk for critical abdominal injury (AIS ^5) in a blunt frontal impact is [VC]max = 1.2 m/s. However, human tolerance is defined more com- pletely by the probability function of injury risk versus [VC]max. The Viscous response can be evaluated in the Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy by a straightforward analysis of the chest deflection data. The Viscous Criterion assesses the risk of soft tissue injury by a rate-dependent viscous injury mechanism, and it supplements the Compression Criterion which assesses injury risk by a crushing mechanism. INTRODUCTION An injury criterion can be defined as a biomechanical index of exposure severity which, by its magnitude, indicates the poten- tial for impact induced injury. As such, a valid criterion always implies a specific underlying biomechanical response and mecha- nism of injury. A successful quest for a valid injury criterion, therefore, will also improve our understanding of the mechanism of injury and the time of its occurrence. A sec- ond, more practical reason for studying injury criteria is that mechanical surrogates of occupants used in assessing car safety designs do not provide direct indications of injury severity following a test. They only provide measurements of force, displacement, velocity, acceleration, or their combinations. Injury criteria based on those measurements are, therefore, essential for assessing the effi- cacy of auto safety designs. Once an injury criterion's validity has been established, another important task becomes the definition of human injury risk measured by that cri- terion through a tolerance level or an injury probability distribution. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the currently available injury criteria for the torso, examine their bases and analyze their strengths and weaknesses. We will also review our previous work on the mechanism of soft tissue injury. In particular, we will address an important new criterion, called the Viscous Criterion, which has properly pre- dicted the severity and the time of occurrence of soft tissue injury when other criteria have failed. We will examine the experimental and theoretical bases for the Viscous Criterion, its range of validity and its application in the anthropomorphic dummy. The Acceleration Criterion The Acceleration Criterion is best known for its application in whole-body response studies and in the assessment of chest injury potential in frontal impacts. Since meaning- ful acceleration can only be measured on bony structures, the criterion typically relies on measurement of acceleration of one point on the spine. Human tolerance for severe chest injury is commonly stated as the magnitude of spinal acceleration sustained for 3 ms or longer not to exceed 60 g in a frontal crash. The criterion, therefore, relies on a sustain- able level of acceleration as the index instead of a single maximum value. 5.672 0096-736X/87/9505-0672$02.50 Copyright 1987 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">861882 The basis for the Acceleration Criterion comes from Stapp's early classic experiments (1). To improve protection of military per- sonnel exposed to rapid deceleration, he dem- onstrated the degree of human tolerance to rocker sled acceleration with proper belt restraints worn. Although the tolerance was based on acceleration measured on the sled fixture instead of the occupant, the research demonstrated the effectiveness of safety sys- tems and provided useful guidelines for the development of restraint systems for occupant protection in a crash. Based on the data from Stapp's experiments, as well as from other tests, Eiband (2) demonstrated that the decel- eration tolerance increased as the duration of exposure decreased (Fig 1). 200[ c 100" Severe Injury I ~ Moderate Injury ^ co sn. 3 ® /rrT77&gt;^^, oj Q) Minor or No Injury u 20- Co, 10- ^ O) - &lt;0 O Q 5 - V7W///$' O Magni- / Z'///,%' ' &gt; Magni- tude / / Z'///,%' ' ' t 2 - Duration 1 1 2 5 10 20 50 100 1000 Duration (ms) Fig Is Tolerance of human subjects and animal models to the magnitude and duration of vehicle acceleration (2). 60g for 3ms, the spinal deceleration frequently cited as the allowable human tolerance, borders between the areas of moderate and no injury. The theoretical basis of using acceleration as an injury criterion is Newton's second law, which states that the force on a rigid mass is proportional to its acceleration. The increase in tolerable deceleration for decreased dura- tion of exposure implies that the tolerance is also based on comparable changes in velocity, since an equivalent change in velocity can be achieved by reciprocal changes between the magnitude and duration of acceleration [AV = aAt] . In reality, the human torso is far more complex than a rigid mass, and body deforma- tion plays a very important, if not the prin- cipal, role in injury causation. Such defor- mation cannot be accounted for by the Acceleration Criterion, and injury can be induced well before the peak in the accelera- tion response. Since acceleration cannot be measured on soft tissues as a practical mat- ter, the usefulness of the Acceleration Cri- terion is restricted to predicting the sever- ity of skeletal injury. In practice, the acceleration of the spine indicates the initi- ation of back movement of the surrogate. How- ever, our experience has indicated that spinal acceleration is sensitive to changing impact conditions. Sled experiments, in which the surrogate must attain sled velocity within the course of the impact, always produce greater spinal acceleration than impactor experiments, where the surrogate undergoes negligible whole body acceleration (3), even when injury risks are similar. An important advantage of the Acceleration Criterion lies in its practical value in car testing. Spinal acceleration can be induced by forces transmitted across the rib cage dur- ing sternal impact, or those transmitted across the abdominal viscera during abdominal impact, or those transmitted via the pelvis during knee impact. Spinal acceleration, therefore, is a general indicator of the over- all severity of whole body impact experienced by the surrogate. And for that reason, spinal acceleration is quite sensitive to changes in the delta V of the crashed car, if other parameters of the test such as the presence or absence of restraints remain unchanged. The Force Criterion The reactive force tends to be an aggregate response of the inertial, the elastic and the viscous components of the torso, as described by Lobdell (4) for the chest in his mathematic model (Fig 2). _ Therefore, the force tolerance of the human torso may vary with the impact environment, stiffness of the impact interface and impactor size, in addition to impact severity. However, force tolerance of the human chest in a "typical" automobile crash environment remains critical in the perfor- mance of an energy-absorbing steering column. Ideally, the energy-absorbing steering column is designed to stroke when the force on the occupant approaches a maximum tolerable level. However, the available human tolerance data in the early 1960 's did not provide adequate information of human force tolerance to maxi- mize the energy-absorbing capacity and range of safety functions of the system. General Motors Research Laboratories then collaborated with Wayne State University to develop a crash facility and conduct experi- ments on human force tolerance in a simulated automotive crash environment. The first series of experiments by Patrick et al (5) involved sled tests with embalmed cadavers simulating the response of an unrestrained occupant. The head, the chest and the knees were impacted against padded load cells and provided the first information on human force tolerance to impact (Fig 3). Subsequent 5.673</page><page sequence="3">design of the energy absorbing steering column was based on the force tolerance of the human chest derived from those studies. Later experiments by Gadd and Patrick (6) and Patrick et al (7) with a prototype energy absorbing steering system confirmed that a 3.3 kN maximum hub load on the sternum and an 8.0 kN maximum distributed load on the shoulders and chest minimized chest trauma to only minor risks of rib fractures for a well centered impact . The Force Criterion does not delineate the mechanism of injury fully because of the vari- able contributions of the inertial, elastic and viscous components that contribute to the force measurement. Knowledge of human force tolerance has enabled the development of the energy absorbing steering column which has been proven to be a highly effective built-in safety feature for driver protection (8). The Compression Criterion As evidence from the cadaver experiments accumulated, it became clear that spinal acceleration or impact force did not ade- quately predict the risk of internal injuries which tended to pose greater threats toward Fig 2: Lobdell's model of the human chest con- sisting of inertial, elastic and vis- cous elements (25). occupant survival. Kroell (9 10) analyzed a large data base of blunt thoracic impact experiments using cadavers and found that max- imum chest compression was a superior indica- tor of chest injury severity (Fig 4). Sternal impact was shown to compress the chest until rib fractures began. The reactive force induced by the impact, which was transmitted across the rib cage to the spine, subsequently induced spinal acceleration and movement. In those experiments, spinal acceleration did not predict injury severity adequately. However, the first integral of spinal acceleration, which is a reflection of the relative chest velocity of deformation, correlated almost as well as normalized compression with injury severity (11). Spinal acceleration pen se only indicates the inertial force on the spine and the movement of the back. They are in turn influenced by the occurrence of fractures that alters force transmission. Kroell 's research showed that human volun- teers could sustain 20% of chest compression in quasistatic loading with no injury. As compression induced by a guided impact mass increased above 20% in human cadavers at impact velocity between 5 - 7 m/s, rib frac- tures occurred regularly. Maximum compression of 40% induced multiple rib fractures indica- tive of flail chest. Analysis of those data Fig 3: Experimental set-up for studying human force tolerance for designing energy absorbing steering system (5). 5.674</page><page sequence="4">861882 led Neathery et al (12) to develop a tolerance level of 40% for severe chest injury using the maximum compression, [C]max, as the Compres- sion Criterion. This tolerance level was extrapolated in the anthropomorphic dummy to be a maximum allowable deflection of 75 mm of the Hybrid III chest cavity. Viano (13) sub- sequently recommended a lower compression tol- erance to minimize the risk of multiple rib fractures which breached the stability of the ribcage and exposed the internal organs, such as the lung, the heart and the thoracic great vessels, to serious injury. In Viano' s analy- sis, average [C]max was 40% for those tests resulting in severe injury of internal organs. He recommended a maximum allowable compression of 32% to maintain the minimum level of rib cage stability. Our latest analysis indicates that 40% of maximum chest compression corre- sponds to a 50-50 chance of the occupant sus- taining severe (AIS &gt; 4) chest injury. Since the criterion was derived within a narrow cor- ridor of impact velocity between 5-7 m/s, any effect of changing impact velocity was not determined. Our understanding today is that injury at even moderate impact velocity can occur well before maximum compression, an issue not addressed by the Compression Cri- terion. 6 r- • • *■ • y 5 - * Nr.

If one separates non-skeletal injuries from skeletal injuries (b), non-skele- tal injuries occur at higher compres- sion after the rib cage has been com- promised (13). Evaluation of the force and deformation data of the cadaver chest in the study also helped define the dynamic stiffness of the human chest. The same biomechanical response data allowed Neathery (4) to extrapolate the corridors predicting the impact response for the 50th percentile male (Fig 5) and the 5th percentile female. The 50th percentile male data formed the basis for Foster et al (14) to develop an improved anthropomorphic dummy chest which was ultimately used in the devel- opment of the Hybrid III dummy. Today, the Hybrid III dummy is recognized to have the better biofidelity of all mechanical surro- gates in production, as demonstrated by its application in the evaluation of the steering systems (16). SOFT TISSUE INJURY Since vital organs, such as the heart, the lung, the liver and the central nervous system are soft tissues, understanding the mechanism of soft tissue injury is critical to the improvement of occupant protection systems. Over the years of research, it has become clear that soft tissue injury is induced by excessive deformation that is rate sensitive. 0 i i i i 1 i 0 20 40 60 80 Thoracic Deformation (mm) Fig 5: Dynamic force-deflection characteris- tics of the human chest derived from the UCSD cadaver data projected for the 50th percentile male. The design of the Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy was based on these data (10). 5.675</page><page sequence="5">Therefore, acceleration of a bony structure does not address the mechanism of soft tissue injury and cannot be a good injury criterion for it. Since soft tissue can be injured. by excessive deformation, the Compression Cri- terion does address one of the mechanisms of injury. However, rate sensitivity of soft tissue injury must be accounted for if one wants to understand the mechanism of soft tis- sue injury over a range of impact velocity at which injuries to car occupants actually occur . Rate Sensitivity of Soft Tissue Injury When the velocity of deformation is below 3 m/s, the risk of soft tissue injury can be properly assessed by maximum compression, [C]max. Because of the tight coupling between the occupant and the restraint, belted occu- pants in a frontal crash usually experience loading on the torso within that range of velocity. However, unrestrained occupants in a crash, occupants involved in a side colli- sion, as well as some participants injured in sports, can experience impact to the torso resulting in a velocity of deformation well above 3 m/s. The rate sensitive tolerance to compression of soft tissue injury was clearly demonstrated by a series of experiments on rabbits by Lau and Viano (17). The target soft-tissue organ in that study was the liver. To simplify the interpretation of the impact results, impact velocity was constant for each test throughout most of its stroke. We found that when impact velocity varied from 5 to 20 m/s in frontal impacts, hepatic injury could range from minor to multiple lacerations at a constant maximum ventrodorsal compression, [C]max = 16%, of the abdomen. No discernible injury occurred below a constant impact velocity of 8 m/s for 16% abdominal compression (Fig 6). That 6r i //.

However, the same level of compression can induce critical injuries at 20 m/s. Interdependence between Impact Velocity and Compression The effect of compression on soft tissue injury was then investigated at three constant frontal impact velocities of 5, 10 and 18 m/s. The target soft-tissue organ of this series of tests was the rabbit lung (18). Severity of lung injury was found to increase with chest compression at each constant impact velocity, as the Compression Criterion would predict. Furthermore, less chest compression was required to produce similar injury as the impact velocity was increased (Fig 7). The study also found that the alveolar region of the lung was more sensitive to the rate of loading than the vascular junctional region. Since impact velocity and chest compression were independent variables in that study, they can be represented by the vertical and the horizontal axes on an X-Y plane with injury severity represented as the third, dependent variable (Fig 8). That exercise demonstrated that regions of similar injury severity could be separated by hyperbolas defining a constant product of impact velocity and maximum chest compression. Blunt thoracic impact experiments by Kroell et al (19) on anesthetized swine further substantiated the interrelationship between velocity of deformation and chest compression in injury causation. Rouhana et al (20) observed similar interdependence between impact velocity and abdominal compression in lateral impacts. Such interdependence between impact velocity and compression also has a profound influence over physiologic response of soft-tissue organs such as the heart and the central nervous system. Velocity of impact on the sternum or the myocardium was identified to be a primary determinant of risk of developing ventricular fibrillation by Viano et al (21), Stein et al (22) and Lau et al (23). On the basis of 123 frontal impact experi- ments on anesthetized rabbits and theoretical considerations of rate-dependent responses of tissues, Viano and Lau (24), therefore, pro- posed the concept of a Viscous tolerance. The experiments included constant velocities of loading from 5 to 22 m/s and maximum thoracic compressions from 4 to 55%. Our initial pro- posal for measuring the Viscous tolerance relied on * the product of the constant impact velocity and a function of the maximum com- pression. That proposal, along with the large data base, firmly established the concept of and the necessity for a Viscous Criterion. 5.676</page><page sequence="6">861882 5 r • Vascular Junctional Region ^ o Alveolar Region I4- ® a V) P a ř V = 5 m/s / I3" V = 5 / m J- y / 1 - 0 1 1 I I I 0 10 20 30 40 50 Max Chest Deformation (mm) • Vascular Junctional Region Alveolar Region 5 r 5r • Vascular Junctional Region v = 18 m/s / o Alveolar Region / I 4- . |4_ J f 0) / / / 0) « V = 10 m/s y ř / / co y y ř / / co I3" / y I3" ř 'J / / It /1 / U / ! i,i y *'J/ j o' i 1 1 oL d- i i o 10 20 30 40 0 10 20 30 Max Chest Deformation (mm) Max Chest Deformation (mm) Fig 7: Severity of lung injury as a function of chest deformation at 5, 10 and 18 m/s (18). The Viscous Criterion Defined (Fig 9) As our experience with the concept of a Viscous tolerance accumulated, we settled on the following definition for the Viscous Cri- terion: Viscous Criterion = any generic biome- chanical index of injury potential for soft tissue defined by rate sensitive torso compression. Viscous response = VC, a time function formed by the product of the velocity of deformation, V(t), and the instantaneous compression, C(t). * Ä A Global Injury O40r Ä fc • Junctional Injury C A ^ o Alveolar Injury .230- A CŪ ' £ ' Severe Injury A I20- • ' Q ' ' ! ļj ' Regional ®m '! „ lnjury ■cío- ...Xo „ 0 / w } Minor ' w or No ' X Injury ' 0 CO u0 5 10 15 20 Constant Velocity (m/s) Fig 8: Severity of lung injury as a function of impact velocity and chest deforma- tion (18) . Viscous tolerance = risk of soft tissue injury associated with a specific impact-induced Viscous response, VC. The maximum risk occurs at the peak Viscous response, [ VC] max. V(t) = d [D( t ) ] / dt, the velocity of deformation. D(t) is the instan- taneous deformation along the direction of the applied impact to the torso. C(t) s D(t)/Initial Torso Thickness. Since C(t) is a dimensionless number, the Vis- cous response, VC, has the same dimension as V(t), which is m/s in SI units. One way to apply the Viscous Criterion is to compare the peak Viscous response of a test, [VC]max, against a predetermined level of tolerance for the particular body region. 5.677</page><page sequence="7">È / iL / /' ) Vi ° / ' II 5 /W- ķ) ) Vi |rf &gt; / ' ¿J ^ - II 5 /W- &gt; - Fig 9: The Viscous Criterion defined by the instantaneous deformation. Range of Validity for the Viscous Criterion Our studies (3 18 25 26) have shown that the Viscous Criterion is the best indicator for soft tissue injury in many body regions for velocities of deformation between 3 to 30 m/s (Fig 10). Depending on the impact envi- ronment, the impact velocity can be considera- bly higher than the velocity of deformation. Contact with the interior by unrestrained occupants in frontal crashes and by occupants on the near side in lateral crashes can result in velocity of deformation within that range. When velocity of deformation is below 3 m/s, the influence of impact velocity on soft tissue injury gradually diminishes. And at very low velocity (&lt;1 m/s), the Compression Criterion becomes the best indicator of soft tissue injury. At those slow velocities, injury is essentially induced by crushing of the tissue (27) . When the velocity of deformation approaches 30 m/s, impact velocity becomes such a predom- inant factor in determining injury outcome that the influence of compression becomes sec- ondary. At those very high velocities, blast injury begins to occur first in the lung (28), then to other hollow organs. The presence of an air-liquid interface in the alveolar region of the lung explains its greater sensitivity to changing impact velocity than the vascular junctional region (Fig 7). Some of the inju- ries of military personnel induced by blast waves from detonation of explosives can be explain by the Viscous Criterion.

For the chest, impact response of the 39 unem- balmed human cadavers contained in the series of experiments performed at the University of California - San Diego have been published and discussed in many papers (9-12). The data consist of frontal thoracic impacts with a guided impact mass from 5 to 15m/ s which pro- duced chest compressions from 22 to 49%. Tho- racic injury severity was correlated with the peak Viscous response, [VC]max, derived from those tests. Instantaneous thoracic deforma- tion for the derivation of the Viscous response was determined by film analysis. The data were divided into two groups: those which produced chest injury of severity greater than or equal to 4 on the AIS scale (29), and those with lower injury severity. Using probit analysis of those data, an impact producing a [VC]max of 1.3 m/s was shown to have a 50-50 chance [ED50] of inducing thora- cic injury of AIS &gt; 4 (Fig 11). [VC]max = 1.0 m/s corresponds to [ED25] and may be used as a reference value for human tolerance in blunt frontal impact to the chest. However, actual human tolerance is more fully defined by the probability curve.

Injury tolerance is also dependent on a subject's age. Since the mean age of the cadavers in the study is 62 years, the injury probability function in Fig 11 may have over- estimated the risk for a much younger occu- pant. However, no simple scaling factor exists for the age-dependent injury suscept- ability factor. In a study of motor vehicle trauma around the Cleveland area, Barancik et al (30) observed that hospital admissions per 1000 emergency room cases of motor trauma increased for occupants over 65 and under 20 years of age. In experiments on 41 anesthetized swine subjected to frontal impact of velocity from 8 to 30 m/s and compression from 10 to 30 %, the Viscous Criterion was found to be a superior predictor of heart rupture (31). An impact producing a peak Viscous response of 2 m/s had a 50-50 chance of inducing cardiac rupture. Since myocardial rupture is a critical (AIS = 5) or fatal injury (AIS = 6), the higher peak Viscous response inducing a more severe injury concurs with our assertion of [ED50] for severe thoracic injury to be [ VC] max = 1.3 m/s. The concurrence also suggests that the torso of the swine may be an adequate model of the human torso for tolerance assessment of serious blunt injuries.

However, a series of sled experiments (3 26) were per- formed using the swine as the surrogate. The 20 swine weighed 49.5 ± 2 Kg and were judged to have similar torso size as the human. Analysis of those data indicates that a steer- ing-wheel induced, abdominal impact with a peak Viscous response of 1.4 m/s has a 50-50 chance of causing severe laceration of the liver (AIS £ 5) (Fig 12). We used AIS &gt; 5 in our data reduction for abdominal injury instead of AIS £ 4 used for the thorax because our classification of injury severity adhered to published AIS guidelines; any tear of the Glisson' s membrane, no matter how superficial, was assigned an AIS=4 value. Probit analysis using AIS ^ 4 for the abdomen may be mislead- ing because some of the injury cannot be con- sidered 'severe' on the basis of threat to life. An AIS 5 injury indicates more exten- sive liver lacerations. In the absence of human tolerance data, a one-to-one projection from the data obtained from swine seems rea- sonable and adequate at this time. As in the case for the chest, the entire probability function defines the abdominal tolerance. [ED2 s ] corresponds to [VC]max = 1.2 m/s. If one chooses a single reference for the 'hard thorax' which includes the thorax and the upper abdominal organs partially protected by the rib cage (32), one can use a tolerance level of [VC]max = 1.0 m/s. [VC]max = i.o m/s represents a more conservative impact exposure than [ VC] max = 1.2 m/s, and the probit analy- sis for the abdomen was performed for AIS £ 5, a more life-threatening level of injury than that used for data reduction of the thorax. Inferences of the Viscous Criterion The Viscous response measures the instanta- neous risk of injury induced by compression and the rate of deformation of a body region. As such, the Viscous response rises at con- tact, and it decreases to zero at maximum com- pression, [C]max. The Viscous response, therefore, suggests that injury induced by a rate sensitive mechanism tends to occur early in an impact event, well before maximum com- pression. At maximum compression, although the Viscous response indicates that there is theoretically no risk for viscous injury, crushing injury remains possible. However, crushing injury is induced by excessive defor- mation and strain on the tissue, unrelated to its viscous properties. Occurrence of crush- ing injury is indicated by exceeding human tolerance for maximum compression. An Example using the Lobdell's Model of the Chest Lobdell's viscoelastic model (Fig 2) of the chest was derived mathematically to simulate the impact response of the cadaver chest. Two case studies (25) using Lobdell's model help to demonstrate the importance and the implica- tions of the Viscous Criterion. Each impact mass has identical kinetic energy of 500J. The impact masses are free to decelerate on contact with the chest. Case I - Impact Velocity = 7 m/s, Impact Mass = 20 Kg (Fig 13) The impact mass compresses the chest and produces [C]max = 30% before it expends most of its energy. The maximum force generated by the impact is 4.2 kN. [VC]max, derived from the instantaneous chest deformation, is 0.8 m/s. Maximum spinal acceleration is 16g, and the cor- responding 3-ms plateau is 15g. The max- imum energy stored in the elastic ele- ments (springs) is 120 J, and the viscous elements (dashpots) dissipate 180 J of the impact energy. Case II - Impact Velocity = 15 m/s, Impact Mass = 4 Kg (Fig 14) As in case I, the impact mass com- presses the chest and produces a [C]max = 30%. However, the other kinematics of the impact are very different from the lower velocity impact. The maximum impact force is 7 kN. [VC]max is 1.7 m/s. The 3-ms plateau spinal accelera- tion is 25g with a maximum acceleration of 27g. The maximum energy stored in the elastic elements (springs) is 105 J, whereas the viscous elements (dashpots) dissipate 310 J of the impact energy. Since the two cases produce the same [C]max of 30% which is within human tolerance, a per- son subjected to those impacts probably will not receive severe crushing injury. Although case II yields a higher acceleration level of 25g, it is also well within the accepted human tolerance. However, because of the much higher initial impact velocity in case II, the [VC]max of case II (1.7 m/s) is more than twice that of case I (0.8 m/s). Since [VC]max = 1.7 m/s corresponds to [ED75], a person sub- jected to that impact will probably receive severe soft tissue injury. The higher Viscous response in case II implies a greater contri- bution of the viscous elements of the torso to the total response. That fact is demonstrated by the much higher dissipated energy and the much greater apparent stiffness of the chest in case II. 5.680</page><page sequence="10">861882 VC &amp; V 6 250 Sternal g oe]'/)0' v 6 250 Ih xSoinalg '* ; ' ' VC- I 1 // ' ' ' ?9 i ' i°:;/ ' v. i9 sn ' r i ' ■ ' ' i I, °| Vw -- - V L _0 6 _ 1 io -50¡ - • ^ • -0 O _ 20 t(ms) 40 0 20 t(ms) 40 Force - Compression 50Q Energy 2qq ♦j , ■■ ì 50Q J"' -■-'ri li/ w :/ , I r '- sii : S w :/ I 2 •' ' ^ : S li ® / ! i ! o -X •' ' ' ' x-i o ® / i o •' ' ' o / °0 ^ 10 20 30 o 20 t(ms) 40 C (%) Fig 13: Simulation results of a 20 Kg mass impacting the chest at 7 m/s.

Sensitivity of the Injury Criteria over a Wider Range of Impact velocity The two cases presented are only examples within a wide spectrum of impact velocities from 1 to 300 m/s simulated with the impacting mass varied to maintain the same kinetic energy of 500J. Since the impacting masses are free to decelerate after contact, the velocity of deformation is lower than the velocity of impact in these examples (Figs 13, 14). To study the sensitivity of the injury criteria to impact velocity, [VC]max, [C]max and maximum spinal acceleration, [A]max, are normalized to their recommended human toler- ance value over a range of impact velocity (Fig 15). Since the idealized model offers a one to one correspondence between the maximum spinal acceleration and the sustainable 3-ms acceleration, maximum acceleration is used to represent the Acceleration Criterion in this exercise for simplicity. [C]max is shown to have a much higher nor- malized value than [VC]max or [A]max when impact velocity is below 5 m/s. At velocities within that range, much of the energy of the impactor is used in compressing the elastic elements. Spinal acceleration is minimal, and the rate sensitive viscous elements (dashpots) do not offer much resistance. However, [C]max never quite reaches the accepted human toler- ance.

At velocity within that range, much of the energy of the impactor is now dissi- pated in overcoming the impedance of the vis- cous elements and expended in accelerating the spinal and sternal masses. Between 8 and 120 m/s, [VC]max exceeds its recommended tolerance level. Normalized [A]max exceeds normalized [VC]max beyond 180 m/s but always stays within its recommended tolerance level. [C]max becomes insensitive to impact velocity and actually demonstrates 'reduced injury risk1 as impact velocity exceeded 10 m/s. The correct interpretation of this misleading 'risk reduc- tion' is that the probability of crushing injury indeed diminishes as the impact veloc- ity exceeds 10 m/s. However, injury potential to the occupant is actually greater and has become viscous in nature. At an impact veloc- ity of 20 m/s, [VC]max is more than twice the accepted tolerance and corresponds to a prob- ability of over 90% of sustaining chest injury of AIS &gt; 4. Therefore, for a 500J impact at velocity between 10-30 m/s, the probable injury will be sustained by the soft tissue, and it will be induced by rate-sensitive com- pression before maximum compression has been produced. When impact velocity goes much above 30 m/s, the validity of the injury criteria is not known. The validity of Lobdell's model at those velocities is also untested. The model demonstrates the sensitivity of each criterion to changing impact velocity. The validity of the criteria must still be based on experimen- tal data which include quantification of injury severity from animal or cadaver models. Those data form the basis for Figure 10. This exercise only explains and gives credence to those experimental findings. An Example using the Human Cadaver Model From the same University of California - San Diego data set used to derive human toler- ance, we could extract data from two different impact conditions - a 23.0 Kg mass striking the chest at 4.9 m/s and a 19.3 Kg mass strik- ing the chest at 10.1 m/s respectively (Fig 16). Of the four tests at the lower velocity, none of the cadavers sustained severe chest injury (AIS £4). But four of the five cadav- ers impacted at the higher velocity sustained severe chest injury. The average [VC]max for the higher velocity test was 1.4 m/s, corre- sponding to a 60% chance of severe chest injury (Fig 11) . The average [VC]max for the Fig 16: The Viscous Criterion, [VC]max, from high velocity [10.1 m/s] (Runs# 96, 99, 178, 190, 191) (a) and low velocity [4.9 m/s] (Runs# 171, 177, 189, 200) (b) impact on cadavers. 5.682</page><page sequence="12">861882 lower velocity test was 0.6 m/s, corresponding to less than a 10% probability of sustaining severe chest injury. Although the example illustrates the impor- tance of impact velocity and of the Viscous Criterion, it does not represent an exact par- allel of the earlier example using Lobdell's model . The kinetic energy of the higher velocity tests was 3.7 times that of the lower velocity tests. Analysis of the Viscous Criterion using Me- chanical Theories The human torso is far too complex to be analyzed by linear theory. Therefore, we are not using mechanical theories to justify the Viscous Criterion. Rather, we are using them to explain the meaning of the criterion within the context of those theories. In a Voigt model (Fig 17), energy stored in the spring is proportional to the square of the deformation. ES(t ) « y2 (t ) (1) The energy dissipated by the dashpot is by definition: d [ED( t ) ] = F(t) dy. Since the force on a dashpot is proportional to its velocity [F( t ) Œ y(t)], energy dissipated by the dashpot can be eventually reduced to (20): ED(t ) « ý(t)y(t) - R(y,y) (2) The first term in equation 2 is the Viscous response with a second residual term. There- fore, the Viscous Criterion is associated with the maximum instantaneous energy dissipated by the viscous elements representing the torso.

Application in the Hybrid III Dummy The Hybrid III dummy is the most advanced mechanical surrogate of the occupant in pro- duction today for its frontal chest dynamics. It contains a chest deformation transducer which measures the instantaneous displacement between the sternum and the spine. Since the instantaneous chest deformation contains the necessary information to compute the Viscous response, present technology is sufficient to apply the Viscous Criterion to assess poten- tial for thoracic viscous injury. However, the proposed human tolerance was derived from cadaver data which measured the anteroposte- rior dimension externally. Because the chest thickness varied from one cadaver specimen to another, chest deformation had to be normal- ized by the initial chest thickness to obtain meaningful representation of compression in the original derivation of human tolerance. By contrast, Hybrid III data should be normal- ized to represent the injury risk to a 50th percentile male, whose force-deflection char- acteristics the Hybrid III mimics. To correlate the internally measured Vis- cous response to an externally measured one, we impacted a seated Hybrid III twice with a 23.4-Kg pendulum at an impact velocity of 6.7 m/s. We followed the procedures for calibra- tion of the Hybrid III at the high velocity response corridor. High speed movie of the lateral view of" the impact was recorded. The external chest deformation was then measured from the movie. Following the procedure out- lined (Fig 9), the Viscous response was com- puted using the instantaneous chest deforma- tion data normalized to an anteroposterior dimension of 229 mm, the chest thickness for a 50th percentile male (12). The impact pro- duced a peak Viscous response of 1.09 m/s (Fig 18). The instantaneous internal chest defor- mation was obtained by the Hybrid III trans- ducer. The internal Viscous response was again derived by using the same 229 mm as chest thickness. The resultant peak Viscous response was 0.82 m/s. Since the thoracic subcutaneous tissues represents additional viscoelasticity to impact, the internally derived Viscous response can be used to assess occupant risk only if it can be scaled to cor- respond to an externally derived one. Scaling of the internal [VC] to correspond to the external [VC] can be achieved with fol- lowing the logic: 5.683</page><page sequence="13">VCint = (Dint/229). (dDint/dt) 1 VCext = (Dext/229) . (dDext/dt) 2 where Dint and Dext are the internally and externally measured instantaneous deformation of the Hybrid III chest; VCint and VCext are the internally and externally derived Viscous responses. The following scaling factors can be intro- duced between 1 and 2: Dext = (82/68) Dint =1.2 Dint 3 dDext/dt = (6.1/5.8) dDint/dt = 1.1 dDint/dt 4 Basis: At maximum deformation, external deformation was 82 mm whereas internal deformation was 68 mm. At maximum velocity of chest deformation, external velocity of deformation was 6.1 m/s whereas internal velocity of deforma- tion was 5.8 m/s. Therefore substituting equations 3 and 4 into 1 and 2 yields: VCext = 1.3 VCint 5 If one uses equation 5 to scale the internally measured [VC]max of 0.82 m/s, one obtains the corresponding estimated external [VC]max of 1.07 m/s, which closely approximates the actual measured external [VC]max of 1.09 m/s. Therefore, equation 5, along with the nominal chest dimension of 229 mm, allows one to use the Viscous response measured by the chest deflection transducer of the Hybrid III to assess viscous injury risk to an occupant in a frontal crash. There remains differences between the internal and external Viscous responses. For the initial 7 ms, the external Viscous response is higher than the internal one because the sternal subcutaneous insert is the first compliance (represented by K12 in Fig 2) to react to the effect of the approaching impactor. That force takes time to be trans- mitted through the mechanical impedance of the thorax before it deforms the thoracic cavity. Therefore, the internal Viscous response lags the external Viscous response at the onset of the impact. From 10 ms to the time of maximum compression, the two Viscous responses are very similar. The correspondence between the internal and external Viscous response may also vary depending on the severity of the impact exposure. We have chosen here the most relevant impact exposure near the recommended human tolerance for our conversion between the two responses . 8r ^ .

Hybrid III dum- mies are used as surrogates for the unres- trained driver and right front passenger. The driver sustains an impact to his chest which produces a [C]max twice that of the right front passenger. Both are within the accepted human tolerance. However, the greater threat to the driver is measured by [VC]max. For the driver, the [ VC] max produced by the impact was 1.0 m/s, which represented [ED25] for sustain- ing severe soft tissue injury in the chest. The impact on the right passenger produced a [VC]max of only 0.2 m/s, well below the recom- mended tolerance. Despite the greater thora- cic injury risk for the driver measured by the Compression and Viscous Criteria, spinal acceleration, [A] 3ms, is 89g for the right front passenger and only 55g for the driver. Femur load on the right front passenger is also higher. This is an example of the Accel- eration Criterion measuring primarily the effects of whole body deceleration, which hap- pens to be higher for the passenger than the driver in this example. Our analysis here deals only with injury risk of the chest. The overall injury risk has been shown to be somewhat lower for the driver than the right front passenger (33). 861882 Application in Studying Steering Wheel Induced Impact Since the current Hybrid III dummy lacks the necessary transducers for measurement of abdominal deformation, an anesthetized animal surrogate* (the swine) was used in a study of abdominal impact by the steering system (Fig 20). We used a segmented, instrumented wheel with an upper spoke, a separate lower spoke of ad]ustable stiffness and a load measuring hub, which allowed separation of the measured load and deformation of the chest from those of the abdomen. Lower rim stiffness was found to significantly affect abdominal injury. Sled tests at 9 m/s using the wheel with the softer lower spoke resulted in little or no abdominal injury, whereas those using the wheel with the stiffer lower spoke resulted in severe abdomi- nal injury. The time course of the impact responses provided clues to the mechanism of abdominal injury (Fig 21). Rim impact of the abdomen generated the abdominal Viscous response. Likewise, subsequent hub impact of the thorax generated the thoracic Viscous response. The peak dynamic loads on the abdomen and the tho- rax corresponded better with the respective [VC]max; they preceded [C]max. That temporal correspondence is an indication of the impor- tance of the Viscous response in understanding ~ 61 A " A ~ 1 " ' ^ 1 A 8&lt;- ' ' #31 ° A A Š ' ° ' P ' or 2- ' P b Q , ' V e or 2- ' ' Q , ' § ļ - ^ X - - E?) 1 ~ I X / Ld O I / / Ld X 0 I o 0 50 100 150 200 0 • - - - - - i - ■ - i TIME Tiur (ms) /M A 0 50 100 150 200 TIME Tiur (ms) /M A 0 50 TIME 100 (ms) ~75 r- 100 3 m S g -le vel . 3 ms g-level ; ; i- 1 A'' Mi "5° ^ &amp; °-3"j I ij a 75 i- 1 A'' ^ I w ^ !

The energy absorbing (EA) column was designed to compress at the level of force below the limit for serious thoracic injury. That level of force could be developed only by hub impact of the thorax. Initiation of column compression in these tests coincided with [VC]max and thereby prevented the thoracic and abdominal Viscous response from further increase with either wheel. Those experiments, therefore, also attested to the efficacy of the EA column. However, in the stiff er-spoke wheel case, abdominal Viscous response had already exceeded abdominal tolerance before the onset of column compression. The softer-spoke wheel reduced the abdominal Viscous response and * The rationale and experimental protocol for the use of an animal model in this program have been reviewed by the Research Labora- tories' Animal Research Committee. The research follows procedures outlined in U.S. DHEW's, "Guide for the Care and Use of Labo- ratory Animals," or U.S. DHEW-NIH's "Guidelines for the use of Experimental Ani- mals," and complies fully with USDA regula- tions in the Laboratory Animal Welfare Act of 1970 and 1976 (PL 89-544). injury potential by wheel deformation at the critical time between rim contact and column compression (Fig 21b). Abdominal protection requires an energy absorbing wheel tuned to perform before the EA column can begin to stroke. That conclusion can be drawn only with a good understanding of the Viscous response and its application. Acceleration of the upper or lower spine lagged hub contact with the sternum. Spinal acceleration in gen- eral indicated the initiation of back movement and was induced by forces transmitted across the abdomen and the rib cage following rim impact of the abdomen and hub impact of the sternum. In separate experiments (3), we had simu- lated the early phase of abdominal impact by the stiff er-spoke wheel using a pneumatic impactor with the lower rim as the abdominal impact interface (Fig 22). Those experiments had indicated that abdominal injury occurred early, within the initial 15 ms of rim impact of the abdomen. Therefore, the maximum abdom- inal injury potential concurred with the peak abdominal Viscous response. The temporal cor- respondence between the peak Viscous response and injury causation indicated that abdominal injury was induced by exceeding a tolerance comprised of combined velocity of deformation and compression. Those experiments also dem- onstrated that the assessment of injury poten- tial by the peak Viscous response is quite independent of the impact environment (Fig 23). Since the impactor produced minimal whole body acceleration, spinal acceleration was less than half of the values measured in sled experiments, despite similar abdominal injury severity. The example is offered here to demonstrate the application of the Viscous response as a continuous measurement of risk for soft-tissue injury, and it is not considered to be an optimal wheel design. By using the lower spoke as the deformable element in those experiments, there was evidence of potentiated thoracic trauma. This was judged to be due to the non-alignment of the wheel plane following spoke deformation and consequent loading of the hub on the thorax. The optimal safety design of the steering system must comprehend a wide range of factors in occupant protection such as the various body contacts, the differ- ent force tolerance for the face, the chest and the abdomen, the use of restraints, the seating positions and the size of an occupant. 5.686</page><page sequence="16">861882 Ò- &lt;ř o'- J' Jb «s?

Over the course of evolution of the criterion, other indices for measuring the potential for soft tissue injury had been used by us, as well as by others. Vmax . Cmax This index comprises the product of the maximum velocity and the maximum compression. In most impact situations, the maximum veloc- ity is also the initial velocity. This index also evolved from our original experiments (18 20). Since those experiments were designed to maintain a constant velocity throughout most of the stroke, Vmax. Cmax in those experiments approximated [ VC] max, which simplified data reduction. However, most pendulum or s'led induced impacts do not maintain a constant velocity after contact, and they will produce a higher Vmax. Cmax than [VC]max for a given torso. There is no one to one correspondence between Vmax. Cmax and [ VC] max because their relationship depends on the time course of a specific impact. Furthermore, the impact environment in a car crash can be far more complex than that induced by the stroke of a pneumatic impactor or a pendulum. The instrument panel, the EA steering system and the knee bolster can all appear soft initially and then stiffen up after their energy absorption capacity has been saturated. The reverse situation can occur if a stiff, brittle structure is used as a break-away surface. Both sequence of events can produced rapid unloading and reloading of the torso, with which Vmax. Cmax cannot cope (Fig 24). With the chest deformation trans- ducer in the Hybrid III dummy, computing the Viscous response is actually simple and straightforward, and it provides more informa- tion than Vmax. Cmax can. A second advantage of the Viscous response over Vmax. Cmax is that the former constitutes a time function. It, therefore, allows a con- tinuous assessment of the viscous injury risk. Vmax. Cmax lacks that capability. In the exam- ple involving the swine model, the Viscous response from the abdomen first led us to suspect and later confirm that impact of the abdomen by a wheel rim could produce abdominal injury in the initial 15ms of the contact before the column could begin to stroke. Countermeasures could be contemplated only after we knew the time of maximum injury risk. Rouhana et al (20 34) used Vmax. Cmax, as an injury risk index, to study the lateral impact injury potential in rabbits. The mechanism of injury with a rigid impact interface and the addition of a force-limiting material was found to be different for liver and kidney injuries. Stalnaker et al (35) also validated the Vmax. Cmax form of Viscous tolerance mea- surement for subhuman primates in frontal and side impact of the abdomen. Mooney et al (36) utilized this form of the Viscous criterion in the design of an abdominal insert for the Hybrid III dummy. [vc/(l-C)]max This index was the initial form of Viscous Criterion first proposed by Viano and Lau in 1983 (24). The index shares many of the advantages of [VC]max with one added benefit. Inclusion of (1-C) in the denominator increases the role played by compression for slow crushing injuries. Maximum compression is restricted to below 100%, the practical limit. [VC/( 1-C) ]max thus incorporates the Compression Criterion into its formulation. The index was proposed after analyzing data from 123 rabbits subjected to a frontal impact. More recent analysis indicated that [VC]max, the peak Viscous response, provided injury correlation as good as the original proposal. The simplicity of the Viscous response offers some advantage when it is sup- plemented with the Compression Criterion, which monitors the risk of the slower crushing injuries. [VC/(1-C) ]max remains a viable index of rate sensitive injuries. 0.3 0.2 i ^ " « ^ 0.1_ I 1 " - 'ýr~ -0.11 r I 1 1 0 50 100 150 200 TIME (ms) ii ft -i-I 1 1 T 1 0 50 100 150 200 TIME (ms) Fig 24: An example of the Viscous response derived from the Hybrid III chest deformation transducer in a barrier crash test at 30 mph.

Although the Acceleration Criterion has only minimal basis on skeletal forces and injury, it is least dependent on the impact location and is a reasonable indi- cator of whole body response and the general severity of the crash. That advantage alone may merit its retention. Therefore, we are not advocating the abolition of the Accelera- tion Criterion. However, even if an occupant has his back strapped to a hard seat, which severely reduces sudden spinal acceleration, he can still be injured if his torso were crushed. The Compression Criterion is, there- fore, needed to address those possible inju- ries. Our research has shown that the Com- pression Criterion becomes inadequate when the velocity of deformation exceeds 3 m/s. At a high velocity of deformation, an otherwise tolerable level of quasi-static compression can become lethal. The Viscous Criterion is, therefore, also necessary to address those mechanisms . Scenarios where the Viscous Criterion may be the most sensitive index of soft tissue injury in an automobile crash environment include: an unrestrained occupant in a fron- tal crash, a restrained or an unrestrained occupant in a lateral impact, and impact by inflatable restraint deployment against an occupant directly above it. Analysis of available data indicates that human tolerance [ED25] for the chest is [VC]max = 1.0 m/s (AIS ^ 4) and for the abdo- men (severe laceration of the liver or spleen) is [VC]max = 1.2 m/s (AIS £ 5). For reasons stated, a tolerance level of [VC] = 1.0 m/s may also by used for the 'hard thorax', which includes the thorax and the upper abdominal viscera. Current technology in the Hybrid III dummy is sufficient to monitor the three criteria for the chest in well centered frontal impacts. The Viscous Criterion has also been shown to be a good predictor of soft tissue injury potential in side impacts. Since the Viscous response assesses injury risk as a time function, countermeasures can be focused on a specific event within the course of time varying occupant kinematics. Implementation of the Viscous Criterion is necessary to assure that the impact severity can be exam- ined from the most appropriate view point: The Compression Criterion assesses the prob- ability of crushing injury. The Viscous Cri- terion measures the risk of soft tissue injury induced by a rate-dependent mechanism in an impact. For an impulsive impact inducing high velocity of deformation but low or moderate torso compression, the Viscous Criterion is the only index that will indicate the poten- tial for life-threatening injuries.

Appendix: To Compute VC from Hybrid III Chest Deflection Transducer 1* Digitize 'Chest Deflection' data at a rate of 10 000 points per second. The result is Chest Deformation. Units in mm. 2. Differentiate Chest Deformation using the trapezoidal rule. Filter the result with SAE60. The result is Velocity of Deforma- tion. Units in m/s. 3. Multiply [1] by [2] and divide the product by 229 mm, the 50th percentile male chest dimension. Scale the result by multiplying the product by 1.3. The result is the Vis- cous response of that particular impact which can be cross referenced with human tolerance probability. Units in m/s. 5.691</page></plain_text>
