<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURE OF A WHEWELLITE-RICH ROCK CRUST ASSOCIATED WITH PICTOGRAPHS IN SOUTHWESTERN TEXAS Jon Russ, Warna D. Kaluarachchi, Louise Drummond and Howell G.M. Edwards Summary-A whewellite-rich rock crust covers vast areas of limestone inside dry rock shelters and under rock overhangs throughout the Lower Pecos Region in southwestern Texas (USA). The natural rock crust, com- posed primarily of whewellite and gypsum with lesser amounts of quartz and silicates, encapsulates the paints of the extraordinary pictographs at more than 250 rock art sites in the region. The authors propose a model that describes the origin of each crust constituent and the evolution of these surfaces. Furthermore, they describe the relationship between the ancient paints and crust matrices, information that is necessary for the development of sound conservation strategies. Introduction The calcium oxalate minerals whewellite (CaC2O4.H20) and weddellite (CaC204.(2+x)H20) are now realized to be common on rock surfaces. The substrates on which they are known to occur include granite, marble, limestone and sandstone, as well as glass, plaster and wood. Geographically, oxalate coatings have been reported in the northern Mediterranean (Greece, Italy and Spain) [1-4], Australia [5, 6], and the southwestern United States (California [7], Utah [8] and Texas [9]). In Europe the oxalates are generally associated with stoneworks [3] but also exist on natural rock outcrops [10], including those with ancient rock paintings [11]. In Australia and the United States, the minerals have been identified on rock surfaces associated with pre- historic pictographs. The origin of whewellite and weddellite on exposed surfaces is not fully understood. Proposed sources include natural processes such as biological activity of organisms living on or within the stone [1, 2, 10, 12], reactions of organic compounds in rain or aerosols at the atmosphere/rock boundary [5, 6], reactions and/or deposition of dissolved organic mat- ter in runoff [11], and animal urine [13]. Artificial sources such as purposeful applications of oxalic acid, casein or other substances to preserve or enhance stonework have also been proposed in some cases [2, 13]. There is general agreement, though, that oxalate coatings associated with prehistoric rock art were produced naturally [6, 11, 12]. However, the disparity in crust characteristics suggests they were formed via different mechanisms. In cases where the oxalate-rich crusts are associ- ated with pictographs, the ancient paints are gener- ally encapsulated within the crust matrices [6, 7, 9, Received December 1997 14] causing the artifacts to appear faded or be obscured completely, yet the patina may also protect the paintings from weathering and fix the paints to the substrate. Therefore, the development of conser- vation strategies aimed at enhancing and/or preserv- ing rock art requires that the association of the paint and crust constituents be known. Finally, there is substantial potential that oxalate coatings can provide important information such as the age of pictographs [14, 15] and palaeoclimate data [12]. These methods involve radiocarbon analy- ses, therefore there needs to be a consistent model that describes the source and evolution of the carbon in the. dated substances. The aim of this paper is to describe the origin and evolution of the whewellite-rich crust associated with prehistoric rock paintings in the Lower Pecos Region of southwest Texas. The natural rock crust, which also consists of gypsum (CaSO4.2H20), quartz (SiO2) and silicates, encapsulates the ancient paints, and we describe the relationship between the paint compo- nents and crust matrices. The Lower Pecos Region The Lower Pecos Region is generally described as the area surrounding the confluences of the Pecos and Devils Rivers with the Rio Grande (Figure 1). The area is at the southwestern edge of the Edwards Plateau, a massive Cretaceous limestone platform with steep canyons incised by rivers and tributaries. Along the canyon walls are numerous rock over- hangs and dry rock shelters. The limestone surfaces in the shelters and under the overhangs, i.e., surfaces that do not receive rain or runoff, are coated with a whewellite-rich crust, while a dark stain occurs on the surfaces exposed to liquid water (Figure 2).

The current climate is semi-arid, with a mean annual rainfall of 498mm.yr-' and mean annual temperature of 20.5'C. Palaeoclimate reconstructions indicate the region experienced a rapid climate change at the end of the Pleistocene, followed by a general warming-drying trend with several reversals to wetter and/or cooler climates during the Holocene [16-19]. The Lower Pecos has an extensive, nearly continu- ous archaeological record that spans the Holocene [20, 21]. More than a thousand archaeological sites have been identified, about 250 of which contain rock art. The dominant rock art form is pictographs, Figure 2 Photograph of a typical rock overhang along Pressa Canyon in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park. The light-brown whewellite-rich crust covers the surface under the overhang while a dark stain coats rock exposed to rain and runoff. although petroglyphs have also been identified in at least eight sites [22]. The pictographs occur mostly along the back walls and ceilings of dry rock shelters and under rock overhangs, and so are associated with the whewellite-rich crust. Five distinct pictograph styles have been defined for the Lower Pecos, each attributed to separate cul- tural occupations [23]. The oldest and predominant rock art style, the Pecos River Style, is characterized by large, polychromatic anthropomorphic and abstract figures (Figure 3). Turpin [23] argued this style was produced between 3000-4000 years ago when the human population in the region was at a maximum. Radiocarbon dating experiments utilizing a low-temperature, oxygen plasma to isolate organic carbon in Pecos River Style paints yielded '4C AMS dates that range between 2950-4200 years BP [24-26], ages that agree with the archaeological interpreta- tion. The dominant colours of Pecos River Style pic- tographs are red and black, with lesser use of yellow, orange and white. The paint pigments are inorganic, primarily iron oxides and manganese oxides for the red and black, respectively [27, 28]. Recent studies also suggest that an organic substance was added to the original paint mixture to suspend the mineral pigments in a liquid medium and/or to act as a binder [9, 29]. Analytical methods Crust samples were collected from surfaces inside dry rock shelters and under rock overhangs, includ- ing archaeological and non-archaeological sites. The surfaces sampled were generally inaccessible to ani- mal contact. Small flakes containing red or black paint were also collected from pictographs at two Figure 3 Photograph of a Pecos River Style anthro- pomorphic pictograph in Fate Bell Shelter (41 VV74) located in Seminole Canyon State Historical Park. 92 Studies in Conservation 44 (1999) 91-103</page><page sequence="3">The nature of a whewellite-rich rock crust associated with pictographs in SW Texas rock art sites (41VV576 and 41VV129).* The paint samples were from Pecos River Style pictographs, hence the paints are expected to be between 3000 and 4000 years old. Also included in this study were samples of rock surfaces from two shallow rock shel- ters that contained recent lichen activity. The lichen was tentatively identified as Aspicilia calcarea [12]. The crust mineralogy was obtained using a Rigaku computer automated D/MX IIIV BX X-ray powder diffractometer (XRD). Samples were prepared for analysis by removing the crust from the substrate with a dental pick or Dremel tool, then grinding into a powder with an agate mortar and pestle. The distribution and morphology of the crust and paint constituents were established using a JEOL 6400 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with a Noran I-2 Integrated Imaging X-ray Microanalysis System (EDS). We used two-dimen- sional EDS maps of polished thin-sections to ascer- tain the relative distribution of principal minerals present, with the exception of whewellite. We mapped elements diagnostic to the minerals, which include sulphur for gypsum, silicon and aluminium in combination for silicates, and silicon alone for quartz. Iron and manganese were mapped to show the location of paint layers. The distribution of phosphorus was also ascertained because it is com- monly observed in whewellite-rich rock crusts [2, 5, 30]. Whewellite could not be mapped directly because calcium, oxygen and carbon are ubiquitous in the samples; however, the distribution could be inferred in many cases based on the absence of the other minerals. Crust and paint micromorphologies were studied using SEM/EDS by analyzing broken sections mounted on lcm aluminium stubs and Au/Pd coated. Samples were analyzed systematically by pro- ducing a continuous series of photomicrographs (-2000 x ) in cross-sectional view, extending from the crust surface into the substrate. The elemental com- position of each constituent observed in the pho- tomicrographs was ascertained using EDS spot analysis which was then marked directly on the pho- tomicrograph, creating a continuous, high magnifica- tion compositional/morphological map of the crust in cross-section. Samples were also studied using a Bruker IFS66 Fourier-transform Raman spectrome- ter with a FRA106 Raman module and Raman microscope attachment. The FT-Raman analysis provided additional data on the distribution of whewellite and the nature of the paint materials. Magnified (400 x ) surface and cross-sectional views were analyzed, with good quality Raman spectra Figure 4 Optical photomicrographs showing (a) spherical protuberances on the surface of the whewellite-rich crust, (b) the surface of a lichen (tentatively identified as Aspicilia calcarea) found inside two shallow rock shelters in the Lower Pecos Region.

The utility of this technique for analyzing oxalate encrus- tations and pigments has been demonstrated [31]; furthermore, this method allowed in situ analysis of organic matter in paint layers [9].

The crust was thin, usually less than 0.5mm but up to I1Omm thick, with a colour that ranged from very pale brown (10 YR 7/4) to reddish brown (5 YR 4/4). The surfaces were generally cov- ered with small spherical protuberances extending about 0.5mm above the surface, giving a botryoidal appearance (Figure 4a), although in some shelters the surfaces appeared smooth and/or coated with dust. Most samples studied had only a single crust layer, though several showed stratification. Whewellite was the primary component of the crust. Weddellite was not present in any of the crust samples analyzed using XRD, although wed- dellite was reported at one site (41VV83) in the region based on XRD analysis [28]. Gypsum was the second most abundant crust component, and quartz and silicates were minor constituents. The pruina on the lichen samples proved to be weddel- lite. Whewellite was found only in the crust layer- there was no evidence of whewellite in the sub- strate. The micromorphology of the whewellite was generally equant microcrystalline; however, distinct whewellite microstructures were observed in sam- ples from three sites, features strikingly similar to TO PM Aw1,LC" Figure 6 SEM photomicrographs of A. calcarea collected from a shallow rock shelter. The high mag- nification view shows thallus structures that are strik- ingly similar to features observed within the crust (see Figure 5). the thallus of the lichen A. calcarea (Figures 5 and 6). Whewellite also formed an outer shell of the spherical protuberances on the crust surface, while the interiors were generally filled with gypsum. In one case, though, features similar in form to lichen hyphae were observed within the spherical protub- erance (Figure 7). Gypsum occurred at the surface of essentially all crust samples studied here. The mineral also occurred within the crust as conglomerates with whewellite, as micro-veins and independent strata in the crust, and within cracks and voids in the sub- strate (Figures 8 and 9). Gypsum appeared platy in SEM images and was easily distinguished from the other crust components. While quartz was mainly native to the limestone substrate, several samples contained silica skins at the substrate/crust interface (Figure 10). Silica skins are common on rock surfaces [32]; however, this is the first evidence of this type of crust in the Lower Pecos. Silicates occurred mostly within the whewellite phase of the crust and at the crust sur- face, but were also present within the substrate. The morphology of silicate constituents was indistin- guishable from surrounding materials. The majority of samples contained elevated con- centrations of phosphorus within the crust, as observed in EDS spot analyses and EDS maps (Figures 8 and 9) of both crust and paint samples. However, no phosphorus-containing mineral was indicated in XRD diagrams, nor were there distin- guishing features in the crust in the areas that con- tained the element. Origin of the Lower Pecos rock crust Each principal crust constituent was likely the result of an independent process. We propose the following crust-forming mechanisms. 94 Studies in Conservation 44 (1999) 91-103</page><page sequence="5">The nature of a whewellite-rich rock crust associated with pictographs in SW Texas .* ~ 4 1,?JC~ * ,*1 ":?"i '1~;C3 r,, L??

Edwards Origin of whewellite The pervasiveness of whewellite in the Lower Pecos, covering vast areas of limestone, indicates a natural origin for the organic mineral. The most probable source of the oxalate was an epilithic lichen, either A. calcarea or a similar species, that proliferated in the sheltered microhabitats. We base this hypothesis on the following evidence: ii(i) Lichen are well known to produce oxalate coatings (pruina) and to colonize special habi- tats such as rock shelters with little or no pre- cipitation [33]. Although the pruina on the A. calcarea studied here consisted of weddellite, this mineral phase is metastable and spontan- eously dehydrates to whewellite [34]. i(ii) The surface of the crust, specifically the spheri- cal protuberances, resembles the surface of the lichen (Figure 4b). These features were proba- bly isidia, ascocarps or lobules which are com- mon on lichen surfaces [35]. (iii) Whewellite microstructures in the crust, which we suggest are fossils of the original source of the oxalate, resemble the thallus of A. calcarea. Although such observations were not common, water moves through the substrate and crust episodically which would partially dissolve and reprecipitate the oxalate causing a reorienta- tion of the original structures. (iv) Hyphae-like features within spherical protuber- ances (Figure 7) are consistent with the pres- ence of fungi. Since there is insufficient organic matter in the substrate for an unlichenized fun- gus to thrive, these structures were likely formed by a lichen mycobiont. i(v) The presence of phosphorus in rock crusts could be an indicator of biological activity; moreover, A. calcarea is known to concentrate phosphorus [36]. (vi) Radiocarbon analyses indicate a biological source of the oxalate carbon, ruling out an inorganic source for the carbon. Furthermore, the 14C data (Figure 11) demonstrate that the oxalate was produced episodically during the mid and late Holocene, specifically during peri- ods of dry climate [12]. This is consistent with a biological source such as a lichen that is sensi- tive to fluctuations in environmental conditions. Origin of gypsum Turpin [37] first noted the detrimental effects of gypsum subflorescence on Lower Pecos pictographs. Our evidence, which showed gypsum integrated within whewellite and in fissures and voids in the substrate, is consistent with an efflorescence/sub- florescence mechanism [38]. Furthermore, the occur- rence of gypsum within surface protuberances and as conglomerates with whewellite suggests the min- eral precipitated within voids in the lichen structure and cavities left after the organism decayed. Efflorescence would occur primarily during wet climate conditions when pore water percolating through the limestone carries sulphate ions to the rock surface, which would result in gypsum precipi- tating at or near the stone surface as the surface water evaporates. Samples that showed gypsum stratification (Figure 9) further suggest that this process occurred episodically. It is unlikely that the gypsum in the Lower Pecos crust was the result of reactions of atmospheric SO, [39, 40], since the distribution and morphology of the mineral showed that sulphate migrated from the substrate toward the stone surface. Future studies of the stable sulphur isotopes could provide defini- tive results as to the source of the sulphate [41]. Origin of silica skins Proposed sources of silica skins in Australian sites include precipitation of dissolved silica from the substrate and biogeochemical processes [42]. In both cases the presence of water is an important criterion for the formation of the skins. The sporadic findings of silica skins in the Lower Pecos were insufficient to determine its origin, but the presence of quartz and silicates in the limestone is consistent with the substrate being the source of the silica. The silica skins were observed in two samples (sites 41VV576 and 41VV129) both of which showed silica at the crust/substrate interface and well below the paint. This stratigraphy demon- strates the skin formed prior to the oxalate and the application of the paints. Radiocarbon ages of whewellite from sites 41VV576 and 41VV129 were 3020 ? 70 and 3220 ? 60 BP, respectively, hence the silica skins formed prior to these dates. Silica skins are considered important to rock art conservation since the coatings protect rock art from graffiti and bind paints to the basal rock [42]. In Lower Pecos sites, silica skins may play an important role in keeping the crust (and paints) attached to the substrate; thus further investigations on the nature and occurrence of the skins are war- ranted. Origin of silicates Silicates, predominantly kaolinite, were common in the crust, occurring mostly within the whewellite phase and at the crust surface. The most likely source of this component was aeolian material adhering to surfaces while damp with dew or fog, 96 Studies in Conservation 44 (1999) 91-103</page><page sequence="7">The nature of a Ihewellite-rich rock crust associated with pictographs in SW Texas ~i+~ri t0i low, ir JK_ __ _ Figure 10 SEM photonmicrograph of silica skin observed in a sample from 41 VV576. The accompan- ying EDS spectrum shows the preponderance of sili- con in this feature. then becoming fixed, a mechanism proposed by Curtiss et al. for silica-alumina crusts in semi-arid regions [43]. Many dry rock shelters that contain rock art also have dirt floors that can contribute substantial quantities of silicates to the rock sur- face and obscure the rock art. At two extensively visited sites, 41VV73 (Fate Bell Shelter) and 41VV187 (Parida Cave), site managers have placed rubber mats on trails inside the shelters to reduce airborne matter during visits; however, the vast majority of sites do not have such preventive mea- sures. Origin of phosphorus Phosphorus was a common component in the majority of samples studied, as established by EDS spot analyses and EDS mapping (Figures 8 and 9), although the phosphorus-containing compound was not determined. Phosphorus has been identified in many oxalate coatings [2, 5, 13 (and references within), 28, 30], but neither the mineralogy nor the source of the component has been determined. We suggest phosphorus in Lower Pecos crusts was the result of A. calcarea, since this lichen and others are known to accumulate the element, although the original source is not known [36]. We can definitely rule out proposed sources of phosphorus outlined by Salvadori and Realini [13] such as milk, bone, casein, urine, guano, pigeon droppings, or any materials purposely applied, based on the nature of the Lower Pecos crust. Phosphorus was also present in each of the paint samples analyzed, although not necessarily in the paint layer (Figure 9). Recently, it was speculated that phosphorus in paint samples from Panther Cave (41VV83) was the result of bone fragments introduced into the paint during preparation of the paint mixtures [28]. However, since phosphorus was common in samples that do not contain paint and not always associated with the paint layer, it is far more likely that it is a natural constituent of the crust. Since lichen and microbes can concentrate phosphorus, further studies of the source of the ele- ment could provide key evidence of specific biologi- cal activity. Evolution of the Lower Pecos rock crust Each accretion process likely occurred during spec- ific time periods and climate conditions. Indeed, the periods of oxalate production established by radio- carbon dates of whewellite correlate with periods of warm/dry climate predicted by various palaeocli- mate reconstructions for the Lower Pecos [16-19], while gaps in the data correlate with cool/wet con- ditions. Hence, we propose the following model based on the distribution of the crust components, 14C data and palaeoclimate models for the evolution of the Lower Pecos rock crust (Figure 11). Prior to the Holocene, the primary weathering process on the surfaces inside rock shelters was Studies in Conservation 44 (1999) 91-103 97</page><page sequence="8">J. Russ, W.D. Kaluarachchi, L. Drummond and H.G.M. Edwards exfoliation due to freeze-thaw cycles that caused substantial surface spalling [44, 45]. With the ameli- oration of the climate at the onset of the Holocene, the limestone surfaces inside the shelters began to stabilize. The initial crust to form on these stabi- lized surfaces was likely a silica skin, which we sug- gest formed during the early Holocene (10 000 to 6000 years BP) when the climate was considerably wetter than any time since. The formation of silica skins overlapped episodes of freeze-thaw exfolia- tion, producing the discontinuous, sporadic coating currently observed. During this same period gyp- sum efflorescence would have occurred also, con- tributing to the instability of the rock surfaces during this period. The production of whewellite began about 6000 years ago (the oldest oxalate 14C age is 6440 ? 50 BP), which also coincides with the onset of the Holocene Climate Optimum when summer temper- atures were 2 to 40C higher than at present throughout continental North America [46]. Since A. calcarea is a xeric, epilithic species, the organism would thrive in dry climates, specifically when the substrate was dry, obtaining requisite moisture by the uptake of water vapor [33]. Thus, Lower Pecos shelters were ideal niches for the lichen during xeric climate episodes, and the organism flourished throughout the dry middle Holocene. The late Holocene was characterized by at least two, possibly three, reversals to cooler/wetter cli- mate. Wet conditions would severely limit the vital- ity of A. calcarea due to a variety of physicological reasons including response to freezing water [47] or a water imbalance that limits the mycobiont or photobiont components of the lichen [33, 48]. Furthermore, the lichen would be inundated with water from the substrate saturated with calcium and sulphate ions which would be detrimental to the organism. Hence, during wet climate regimes the lichen would become dormant or die, and gyp- sum efflorescence would become the dominant accretion process. The first major reversal to cooler/wetter climates occurred around 2500 years BP [16], which corresp- onds to a gap in the oxalate 14C data between 2730 and 2080 years BP. We also predict a second short mesic interlude based on a gap in the oxalate 14C ages between 1840 and 1440 years BP, although there are conflicting palaeoclimate data on whether there was a shift in the climate during this period. The final gap in the data begins at 730 years BP, which corresponds to the onset of the Little Ice Age, a period when global temperatures were markedly lower than at present [46]. There is no evi- dence of later oxalate production, as shown by the lack of '4C data, so the last crust constituent formed was gypsum, which is observed on the sample sur- 0 Gypsum efflorescence - 730 1000 - 890 1070 Whewellite deposition - 1330 1440 - 1840 Gypsum efflorescence (?) 2000 2000 2000 Whewellite deposition 2080 2080 _ Gypsum efflorescence - 2730 3000 - 2870 2860 3220 3020 3510 3410 - 3760 4000 -- -3990 4130 4410 Whewellite deposition 5000 - = 5240 5300 - 5570 6000 - - 6440 7000 - 8000 - Silica skins form 9000 000 Limestone becomes stable 0000 mestone unstable due to Limestone unstable due to freeze/thaw cycles Figure 11 Schematic showing the evolution of the Lower Pecos rock crust.

The primary asso- ciation of silicates with whewellite could be due to the larger surface areas of the lichen, longer expo- sure times, and/or more aeolian matter during dry climate conditions. The majority of the rock paintings were produced between 3000 and 4000 years BP, thus there was a significant chance that the paints were applied to surfaces with whewellite and/or the mineral was subsequently produced on the paint surface. Furthermore, the paints experienced two, possibly three, episodes of gypsum efflorescence. 98 Studies in Conservation 44 (1999) 91-103</page><page sequence="9">The nature of a whewellite-rich rock crust associated with pictographs in SW Texas Relationship between prehistoric paints and rock crust Paint samples were analyzed to ascertain the rela- tionship between the paint constituents and crust matrices.

(d) Silicates were omnipresent within both red and black paints, suggesting clays were either added as an extender in the original paint recipe or a natural component of the pigment source. Analysis of extenders in palaeopaints from European sites has proved useful in establishing relationships between rock art panels and indi- vidual motifs [49] and could thus prove fruitful in the case of Pecos River pictographs. (e) The FT-Raman analysis showed that organic matter was present in the black paints from the two sites, although not present in red paints (Figure 12). Organic matter is often assumed to be a necessary component in ancient rock paints for suspending mineral pigments in a liquid medium and/or to fix paints to the stone. The FT-Raman results show clearly that organic matter was present, as evidenced by prominent peaks in the spectra between 2500 and 3400cm-' due to aliphatic v(CH3) and v(CH2) vibrations, and a weaker band at 2720cm-' assignable to the v(C(CH3)2) group. The study of the paints from the two sites also showed characteristics unique to each site, which we describe below. Site 41 VV576 Samples from this site, which is under a rock over- hang in a dry canyon tributary of the Pecos River, had a single crust layer 250-550tm thick covered with numerous spherical protuberances. Most of the crust was a whewellite/gypsum/silicate conglom- erate, although several areas showed micro-veins of gypsum within whewellite. Silica skins were also observed in samples from this site. The paints were generally ~100jtm thick, and located ~100~tm below the crust surface. The paint layers occurred above either a whewellite/silicate mixture or whewellite/silicate/gypsum conglomerate. The interpretation is that the paint was originally applied to a whewellite/silicate surface, then gypsum migrated into this existing material, including the paint layer in some cases. EDS maps of a sample from this site showed gypsum present at the crust surface, within the crust matrix, and in the substrate (Figure 8). The maps also indicated elevated concentrations of phosphorus in the crust, and high concentrations of silicates and quartz under the crust and in the sub- strate.

In cross-section, the crust showed distinct stratification, with the strata composed of conglom- erates, including two layers primarily of whewellite and two of gypsum. The relatively thin paint layer (50-80?tm thick) was located -Imm below the crust surface and incorporated within the lower whewellite stratum. We radiocarbon-dated the two layers of whewellite separately, obtaining ages of 2000 ? 60 and 3220 ? 60 years BP for the upper and lower strata, respectively. Thus, the age of the lower whewellite layer was consistent with the expected age of the rock paint. This further demonstrates the utility of radiocarbon-dating oxalate laminae to obtain estimates of rock art ages [15]. The EDS map of iron showed a discontinuous paint layer (Figure 9), although under the optical microscope the paint appeared continuous. The map of sulphur showed clearly that the crust sur- face was predominately gypsum, with significant quantities of the mineral throughout the crust. Phosphorus was also indicated in EDS maps, but in the crust, not in the paint. Quartz was present in only a small area in the substrate under the crust in the samples analyzed. Conclusions The aim of this paper was to describe the nature of the whewellite-rich crust associated with prehistoric pictographs in the Lower Pecos Region. We present evidence for a lichen source of the whewellite, mainly fossil microstructures observed in the crust and a logical correlation between dry climate condi- tions and oxalate production. While we can rule out many previously proposed sources of oxalate such as purposeful application of substances to pre- serve the rock art, animal urine or contact, and organic matter in runoff, there is insufficient evi- dence to negate reactions of organic matter in atmospheric aerosols at the rock surface or activity of other microbes. Whewellite- and weddellite-rich crusts have often been implicated as having detrimental effects on stone surfaces, destabilizing the substrate and caus- ing surface exfoliation. The oxalate-rich crust in the Lower Pecos has persisted in many sites for thou- sands of years, and even longer periods in Australian rock art sites [25]; thus, the presence of calcium oxalates should not be categorically deemed deleterious to surfaces on which they occur.

Zusammenfassung-Im gesamten Gebiet der Lower Pecos in Saidwesttexas (USA) finden sich whewellitreiche Felsenkrusten, die weite Teile von Kalkstein in trockenen FelsenhAhlungen und unter Felsenilberhdngen bedecken. Diese natarlichen Felsverkrustungen, die sich hauptsdchlich aus Whewellit und Kalk mit geringen Anteilen von Quartz und Silikaten zusammensetzen, bedecken die Farben von auJfergew6hnlichen Piktogrammen an mehr als 250 Standorten mit Hdihlenmalerei in dieser Region. Die Verfasser entwickeln ein Modell zur Beschreibung des Ursprungs jeder dieser Schichtbestandteile und zur Entstehung dieser Oberfldchen. Darfiberhinaus erkldren sie den Zusammenhang zwischen den alten Farben und der Krustenstruktur, Informationen, die fir die Entwicklung fehlerfreier Konservierungsstrategien bendtigt werden. Resumen-Extensas areas de caliza en el interior de abrigos rupestres y bajo salientes de rocas, a lo largo de la regi6n del bajo Pecos, en el suroeste de Texas (USA), se encuentran recubiertos de incrustaciones en forma de costras de roca ricas en whewelita. Los componentes primordiales de estas incrustaciones, la whewelita y el yeso con cantidades menores de cuarzo y silicatos, recubren las pinturas en forma de extraordi- narios pictogramas de mds de 250 enclaves de arte rupestre en la regi6n. Los autores proponen un modelo que describe el origen del constituyente de cada incrustaci6n y la evolucion de estas superficies. Se describen ademas las relaciones entre las pinturas antiguas y las matrices de las incrustaciones, informaci6n necesaria para el desarrollo de estrategias de conservaci6n bien fundadas.
