<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART FROM THE NAVAJO LOOM The William Randolph Hearst Collection Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County March 25- September 5, 1988 In 1942 William Randolph Hearst donated his important collection of Navajo weavings to the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles Coun- ty. Through the generous support of the May Company California, a grant from the Chase Manhattan Corporation, and an anonymous gift, a portion of the collection was exhibited for the first time since its acquisition by the museum. Dramatically presented, the show wrapped the visitor in a mantle of Navajo art and history. The Navajo weaving industry has flourished for over 300 years and has become a significant feature of the culture. The blankets and rugs reflect an evolutionary attitude, with every tex- tile revealing the imaginative development of the individual within a larger cultural tradition. Through sixty dazzling masterworks, careful- ly selected by Nancy J. Blomberg, the mu- seum's Assistant Curator of Anthropology, "Art from the Navajo Loom" traced 120 years of Navajo innovative genius and highlighted the contributions Hearst made toward preserv- ing this historically important Native American art form. In 1900, Hearst enlisted the services of the Fred Harvey Company Indian Department to help secure woven fabrics representing South- western and Mexican weaving cultures from circa 1800 to 1920. Over the next 40 years he col- lected over 200 textiles, including 18 serapes, 39 "chief" blankets, 43child's, or saddle, blankets, and 30 striped and banded Navajo blankets. Pueblo garments, Spanish Saltillo serapes, and blankets from the Rio Grande Valley in New Mexico round out the collection. In a notation by Blomberg in her catalogue, Navajo Textiles: The William Randolph Hearst Collection (see review, p. 27), it is clear Hearst actively worked toward establishing a balance that would repre- sent not only the rarest but also the most accomplished phases of the loom art. Birds, cows, crosses, Vallero stars, human and holy forms, and trains billowing smoke were all part of the design scenario in these weavings. Such elements were curiosities, 98</page><page sequence="2">however, and the more typical banded and striped patterns provided balance. As one scrutinized the textiles, it became clear that despite a uniquely Navajo orientation, each also shared a tradition with other cultures: the weav- ings exposed one to a visual panorama of ex- periences within and beyond the Navajo world. Designs in blankets and rugs documented what the weaver observed, and a reaction to either an individual or group experience. Overall, Navajo textiles reflect intracultural innovation as well as cross-cultural influence. This characteristic was particularly evident in one example made between 1860 and 1870. Identified as a pictorial tapestry, it exhibited a curious mix of Navajo and Hispanic cultural characteristics. More importantly, it may be the first Navajo textile to capture an image of one of their holy beings. This is especially significant because of the cultural taboos against such ac- tion and because this phenomenon did not occur again in Navajo weaving until about 1896. The highly stylized "Yei" figure was posi- tioned midpoint at the top of this poncho-style textile. Six other anthropomorphic forms, all appearingtorepresentEuroamericans (possibly Hispanic), were also featured in the upper por- tion. A Spanish-defined structural layout and the longer serape size further substantiated cross-cultural influence. Used singly or com- bined, eight simple elements helped to con- struct the design: the terraced triangle, the square, the rhomboid, the rectangle, the zigzag and straight lines, the chevron, the diamond, and irregular shapes. These forms are found in all Navajo blankets and rugs. Thick in texture, the textile incorporated native handspun wool with a three-ply im- ported Saxony yarn. Dye analysis has revealed the use of cochineal (a resin secreted by the cochineal beetle), indigo, and two other untested colorants in yellow and green. The yellow may be a derivative of the rabbit brush shrub commonly used by the Navajo, while the green is probably a mix of the rabbit brush and indigo. The colored motifs and elements were enhanced by a white ground. This serape, then, like so many others collected by Hearst, pro- vided important information on the history of Navajo weaving. In addition, the number of so-called chief blankets assembled in this exhibition testified to the evolutionary development of a single style. If the works of highly individualized Navajo weavers were united by any factor, it was the continued development of this textile type. Placed side by side in chronological sequence, each example revealed the scope of the commerce it created. In fact, the name "chief" is believed to be commercial in origin. Merchants conveying these textiles to non- Navajo trading parties, particularly Plains Indian chiefs who coveted them for their wives and daughters, probably provided this label. Neither archaeological nor ethnographic in- vestigation has demonstrated any relationship between the blanket and Navajo social organization. The chief blanket is a man's shoulder garment whose origin stems from two traditions, Pueblo Indian and Spanish. Its wider-than-long pro- portions were modeled on the Pueblo woman's shawl. While its basic banded and striped design was also common to these neighbors, the layout is observed on blankets worn by later LEFT NAVAJO PONCHO, ca. 1865-75.

This diffusion of ideas for the chief style into Navajo weaving technology and patterns was gradual. Even- tually a design system and the incorporation of imported materials such as baize and saxony resulted in a blanket that became uniquely Navajo. The evolution continued, and eventually the basic banded and striped blanket gave way to rectangular blocks and terraced triangles and diamonds. These early styles were developed before Navajo internment at Bosque Redondo and expressed a quiet confidence in the art form. After the Long Walk, the weavers, torn forever from the cultural isolation of the past, began producing chief blankets in frenzied colors with Germantown yarns and bolder designs. Crosses and serrated, zigzag, eye- dazzling features became prominent. This development was brilliantly conveyed in the museum's presentation. Navajo exposure to new ideas and new materials during and after the Bosque Redondo experience penetrated the very core of their weaving. The consequences of this single historical event were vividly portrayed in the examples on exhibit. Commercially processed predyed woolen goods provided by newly sup- planted reservation traders began replacing or, at the very least, supplementing native ma- terials. With the desperate Navajo economic situation, choices had to be made. The weavers made it quite dear their art would continue. The years 1870 to 1900 became a period of ex- perimentation and transition. Government issues and a competing market for rugs quick- ly absorbed and eliminated the Navajo wearing blanket. The rugs in this exhibition reflected the styles encouraged by Indian traders, among them J. Lorenzo Hubbell at Ganado, J.B. Moore at Crystal, and C.N. Cotton in Gallup. "Art from the Navajo Loom" provided a comprehensive story that was beautifully in- tertwined with the threads of in-depth research and knowledge. Each textile in the show quietly transmitted thoughts from the Navajo Beauty- way. There is "beauty above you, beauty below you, beauty all around you."
