<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Anamorphic Phallus within Ledoux's Dismembered Plan of Chaux PAULETTE SINGLEY, Princeton University Claude Nicolas Ledoux's proposals for a House of Pleasure in Paris and for an Oikema in the ideal city of Chaux are enigmatic projects distinguished by their overtly phallic configurations. Offering humorous anecdotes to less bashful professors, these two brothel projects remain neglected in more serious architectural discussions. I will attempt to demonstrate that the phallic configura- tions of these plans offer tangible insights into Ledoux's ideal city, the place of women during the late eighteenth-century and his own ambivalence between monarchy and democracy. Fundamentally, the phallic plan of the Oikema offers a clue to interpreting the ideal city of Chaux as a fragment of the human anatomy. Responding to the exigencies of the Revolution, Ledoux has dismembered the classical anthropomorphic analogy and replaced it with a hybrid plan caught between monarchical centralization and a more democratic attempt to disrupt the dominant center with a series of satellite developments. Inverting the metaphor of decapitation by dissecting the body from a preexisting head Ledoux nevertheless organizes in his ideal city a confrontation between these two regimes. Author's Note: I wish to express my gratitude to Professor Anthony Vidler for his constant advice and encouragement during the writing of this article. Death, in the person of the dead king, was transformed into solar radiance, trans- formed into indeterminate being. The pyramid is not only the most lasting monument, it is also the equivalent both of the monument and of the monument's absence, ofa passage and ofoblit- erated traces, of being and the absence of being. -Georges Bataille As A SYMBOL OF THE DECAPITATED SOVEREIGN representing both absence and being, Georges Bataille's pyramid corresponds strik- ingly with Claude-Nicolas Ledoux's design for the Director's House centrally located in the Saltworks of Chaux. As much as it im- plies the material presence of monumental surveillance, the truncated pyramid delineates an obliterated trace that is revealed to evoke the sublimity that so characterizes Ledoux's architecture but is hidden as a fragile triangle stretching invisibly from heaven to earth (Figure 1). Seen and unseen, such apparent duplicity is equally manifest in Ledoux's unbuilt projects for a House of Pleasure in Paris and for an Oikema in the Ideal City of Chaux wherein these two designs operate as calligrams read under erasure (Figures 2 and 3). Explicitly phallic configurations embed- ded within the plans, these premature erec- tions remain expertly concealed from all but the select initiates privileged to view Ledoux's sumptuous etchings. This simultaneous exposure and con- cealment suggests reexamining Edmund Burke's notion of the sublime through its lin- guistic affinity with sublimation. While Burke's description encompasses thoughts of pain, sickness, and death as promoting the sublime sensations of terror or horror, alter- native definitions emphasize the lofty sub- lime as reflecting notions of truth belonging to the highest regions of thought and inspir- ing awe through grandeur, beauty, or physi- cal elevation.2 In fact, when discussing the Oikema, Ledoux describes virtue as a "sub- lime ideal" that multiplies man's values and "raises them to their highest fulfillment."3 Likewise, although sublimate means to lift, elevate, or exalt, it coincidentally suggests expressing or repressing undesirable habits in constructive, acceptable forms to such an ex- tent that, as Sigmund Freud summarizes, "it has the power to replace its immediate aim by other aims which may be valued highly and which are not sexual."4 Thus, although the sublime connotes an exalted terror, subli- mation refers to purification, repression, or displacement. In other words, awesome sen- sations arising from displaced sexuality may be controverted into an economy of produc- tive repression wherein the object of sublime reflection functions as an efficient mech- anism for sublimating eros. Ostensibly, the very title of Ledoux's publication, L 'architecture consideree sous le rapport de I'art, des moeurs et de la legislation (1804), specifi- cally treats the causal effects of art upon mo- res. When describing the Oikema and stating that "viewed from nearby, vice influences the soul no less strongly: by the horror it instills it causes the soul to react toward virtue," Ledoux speaks of the horrific or sublime act of sexual depravity as being sublimated within his spatial diagram for virtuous social conduct.5 Along with investigating the sublime, Ledoux is perhaps most recognized for his at- tempts to develop a legible architecture ar- ticulated across the tensions of form and ornament, symbol and allegory, dogma and fantasy. Located most explicitly in several projects he proposed for the new town of Chaux, what would later come to be referred to as his architecture parlante, in fact, func- tions as a Foucaultian calligram insofar as it cancels the oppositions of showing and nam- ing, shaping and saying, looking and read- ing.6 The city itself, envisioned even before Ledoux's 1793-1795 imprisonment but completed after his release, mirrors the half- circle plan of the Saltworks already built at February 1993 JAE 46/3 1 76</page><page sequence="2">1.

Arc-et-Senans between 1773 and 1778. Ledoux transformed this vehicle of produc- tive surveillance, originally intended to en- force the lucrative tariffs controlled by royal monopoly with an architectural solution to regain the revenue lost by salt smuggling, into a prescient interpretation of the factory town. Among the dozens of new building types he proposed for Chaux, Ledoux con- ceived of an architecture transparent enough to speak of its destination through a chain of fundamentally natural signifiers. Yet, inas- much as Ledoux may have been influenced seriously by eighteenth-century efforts to clarify language, reading the Cooper's and Coal Burner's Houses as abstract barrels or stacks of wood equally evokes humorous re- sponses encouraged by the less-than-sober proposals for the Oikema and House of Plea- sure. While the plans for the post-Revolu- tionary Oikema and the pre-Revolutionary House of Pleasure might easily be dismissed as mere witticisms, wit often performs as veiled political commentary. Suspended between the sublime and the ridiculous, then, these delightfully phallic plans, instrumental in conveying the build- ings' programs as brothels, overtly describe a tension inherent in architecture parlante that exists between notions of playful conceit and serious proposition, parlor game and biting commentary. Fragments of the human anatomy and palpable mechanisms for trans- forming pleasure into production, these two disjecta membrae of Ledoux's L 'rchitecture consideree ... describe the combined polem- ics of vaginal sublation, sovereign decapita- tion, and anatomical urbanism. The Truculent Virgin and the Corpulent Whore Although (certain) women had secured increasingly tangible power under the mon- archy, the Revolutionary patriarchy trans- formed their actively political roles into unattainable models of chaste truth-such as the Republican Marianne-or into examples of dissumlating degeneracy exemplified by the numerous prostitutes converging on pub- lic spaces such as the Tuileries.7 Outlining the inequalities of the Revolution's patrimonial rhetoric, Olympe De Gouges points out in her Declaration of the Rights of Women (1791) that man, "bizarre, blind, bloated with science and degenerated . . . into the crassest ignorance, .. . wants to command as a despot a sex which is in full possession of its intellectual faculties."8 In her attempt to fill the void created by the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789), Olympe not only voiced the charges of recent feminists and developed an alternative cri- tique of the Enlightenment as blinding and bloating men, but she also gave up her head for openly proclaiming these "dangerous" opinions. As a public body requiring sublima- tion, Dorinda Outram contends, women were understood both as a founding weak- ness of the previous regime and, therefore, as "a justification for the revolution itself."9 In this respect, the aesthetic return to classical antiquity not only expressed Republican val- ues, it also sanitized the arts from the despica- bly feminine Rococo. Women were thought to corrupt the political arena with their bou- 1 77 Singley</page><page sequence="3">doir politics, most conspicuously in the cases of Madame de Pompadour and Madame Du Barry, insofar as these royal Mistresses-re- garded as prostitutes-were understood to have exerted considerable influence upon Louis XV. The mixture of political skill and licentious activities has a long tradition in France. For example, Francis I (1494-1547) had attempted to suppress the body of court prostitutes by asking ladies to take their place; "the ladies of town followed the ex- ample of those of the court, and but little was wanting that every woman in France be- came a prostitute."'0 In particular, historians have accused Catherine de Medicis (1519- 1589) of implementing her policies with the aid of prostitutes and establishing sexual practices "which had been common among the Hetaerae of Athens" to such an extent that "with the Medici many of the mon- strous vices which have been peculiar to Italy ever since the age of Imperial Rome were im- ported to France."" Madame Du Barry, mistress to Louis XV, was reputed to have ascended from the ranks of street walkers converging at the no- torious site of the Palais-Royal, and both she and Madame de Pompadour were rumored to have enticed the King into seducing young men and women at the pleasure pavilion, Parc aux Cerfs. Du Barry, in fact, was one of Ledoux's principal patrons, and it was she who commissioned him to design the infa- mous setting for illicit encounters known as the pavilion at Louveciennes, initially in- tended to house Jean-Honore Fragonard's se- ries of alluring love scenes curiously rejected by Du Barry in favor of a more modest group by Joseph-Marie Vien. Finally, the horror of courtesans ruling the country extended into Louis XVI's reign to such an extent that Marie Antoinette, his wife, came to be re- garded as yet another prostitute corrupting the crown. Whether in the salon, the street, or the theater, women were mistrusted under the 3. Plans, section, and view of Oikema at Chaux.

Literally stating that a woman's place is in the home, Jean Jacques Rousseau also wrote that women caused men to lose their sense of ini- tiative and, in a statement with fearful over- tones of castration, further argued that if they could not be men then they would try to make men into women.12 Worse yet, until the birth of an heir in the eleventh year of his reign, there had been serious concerns regard- ing Louis XVI's sexuality, ranging from whether or not he was interested in women at all to the possibility that he suffered from a form of phimosis, or an irretractable foreskin. The combined impact of opinions such as these fostered a prevailing belief that mascu- line virtue would have to conquer feminine vice for the Revolution to succeed and, ulti- mately, Ledoux's Oikema functioned as just such a mechanism for displacing female sexual puissance.13 Expanding upon this view of women as sordid, in The Pornographer of 1769-sub- titled "a gentleman's ideas on a project for the regulation of prostitutes, suited to the prevention of misfortunes caused by the pub- lic circulation of women"-Retif de la Bretonne proposed the Parthenion as a gov- ernment supervised brothel established "so that no 'fille publique' appear in the streets or at a window."'4 Although Retifs provocative analysis might superficially appear to be a laudable attempt at lessening the evils of an evidently despicable trade, in many cases prostitution was a liberating profession, al- lowing women to run their own businesses independently. Rather, one might view Retifs text as an attempt to control women's single most accessible commodity while si- multaneously expelling them from the public domain.5 Although Ledoux's clients, such as Madame Du Barry and Mlle. Guimard, of- fered him the opportunity to design their pri- vate houses of seduction, nevertheless the House of Pleasure and the Oikema would cleanse society from the pollution of prostitu- tion and, as in Retifs proposal, purge public spaces of these working women. When Ledoux refers to the Oikema as a "fragment of a Greek temple," he places himself in the tradition Retif established with his Parthenion, equating carnal knowledge and modern prostitution through nomenclature with the sexual rites of Greek religion. As Ledoux explains, the Oikema, or "Temple Dedicated to Love," was the theater where adolescents could abandon themselves to the "torrents of counterfeit pleasures, dash- ing along to destruction," to such a degree that this excessive depravity would act as a purifying catalyst for monogamy.16 This Venus's-flytrap first lures impetuous youths inside and then "confronts them with the starkest depravation" to rekindle sleeping vir- tue.17 Yet, the Oikema functions as an educa- tional element only for men, and it offers no redeeming rituals for women.'8 It presents a marked incongruity when compared with Ledoux's Temple of Memory, which com- memorates the honor and glory of woman- hood. Each corner of this temple is defined by a tower. Ledoux requested to be buried in its center, thereby engendering this monu- ment supposedly dedicated to feminine vir- tues with typically masculine forms and displacing its function with that of a sepul- chral monument to Ledoux himself. Observing that he failed to consider brothels designed exclusively for female plea- sure is not necessarily an anachronistic criti- cism of Ledoux's program. The Marquis de Sade had proposed in his Philosophy in the Bedroom (1795) that "there will be houses in- tended for women's libertinage and like the men's, under the government's protection: in these establishments there will be furnished all the individuals of either sex women could desire."'9 Ledoux's specific designation of a house for male pleasure places him in a dis- tinctly patrimonial position framed by alter- native views toward sexuality existing within his own time. The appellation itself of the word Oikbma outlines this inherent dilemma. Originally meaning house, dwelling, temple, prison, or place of debauchery, it also refers to oeconomy, which Rousseau points out is derived "from oikos, house, and nomos, law."20 Thus, Oikema contains an etymologi- cal affinity between the naming of the brothel, the idea of woman as commodity, and the notion of the house as her prison. This museum of vice eventually "leads man to the altar of virtuous Hymen who em- braces and crowns him."2' Of the many di- vinities he might have chosen-Priapus or Venus Physizoa, for example-Ledoux se- lected Hymen. Rather than the god of gen- eration or the goddess of living nature, Ledoux underscores his moralizing tenden- cies when selecting the male god of marriage and chastity as the deity for a temple alleg- edly dedicated to wanton activities. Although he locates a flaming tripod taken from the Temple of Venus in the entry of his brothel and although he may have included images of the goddesses Perfica and Pertunda on bas- reliefs, the penultimate goal of the Oikema- second to the sublimation of eros-is to foster an embrace between men. Further- more, another ritual is implied in separating young men from their mothers as a rite of passage, and it is noteworthy that Marie Antoinette, seen as an unfit mother, was ac- cused of incest during her preexecution trial and of teaching the dauphin, Louis-Charles, to masturbate.22 The House of Pleasure may function as a simple cipher in reevaluating the balance of Ledoux's architecture as generated by mas- culine and feminine principles. Projects such as the Hotel Thelusson could be seen as a quasi-phallic form on axis with its vaginal grotto, and the barrieres might be understood as encircling the city as a womb to be pen- etrated through protective gates. In fact, the highly geometric designs for Guingettes and the Country Houses seem to suggest that 1 79 Singley</page><page sequence="5">4. Guingette and squaring of circle to join the two sexes, from Scrutinium chymicum (1687). Ledoux was developing the alchemical sym- bolism of squaring the circle as a union of man and woman (Figure 4). But his polysemous use of these geometries across utilitarian buildings and monumental edi- fices dilutes the possibility that he was think- ing of the circle and the square as anything other than what he refers to as allographs of his architectural alphabet. While he may well have been intending to develop an epicene utopia, Ledoux's language actually instills a dystopic aphasia-one which, though hardly virginal in a strict physiological interpreta- tion, is ruptured only by the repeated sym- bolic defloration of the woman's sacrificial hymen within Hymen's phallophoria. In his first proposal for the House of Pleasure, a gendered architecture does indeed operate within the theme of penetration where the circular womb improbably engulfs all of the male genitals-sadly out of propor- tion with the space surrounding them. This first project, with its private bedrooms thrust- ing out from the circular ring, transforms Montemartre into an artificial Acropolis sub- limely elevated with an elaborate path leading up to the highest terrace. A symbolic deflora- tion, the post-Revolutionary design for Chaux, now sited in a valley, is a lonely phal- lus lacking the animated female ring. Featur- ing the hypertrophied organ, this second project sublimates both elevated site and fe- male gender. Thus, Ledoux has regendered the City of Chaux-after the reign of an emasculated King turned into a woman by women-with a didactic symbol of virility in which the individual citizen is now crowned merely for being a man. Unveiling the Phallus During the latter half of the eighteenth cen- tury, women in Sicily were discovered to be actively worshipping phallic votive objects, which they kissed before placing them upon the church altar. Affectionately referred to as "big toes"-informing Bataille's fascination with this part of the anatomy-these objects attracted the antiquarian interest of a colorful group, including Baron d'Hancarville, Rich- ard Payne Knight, and Charles-Francois Dupuis, each of whom published thinly veiled pornography on phallic cults from Far Eastern to Greco-Roman antiquity (Figures 5 and 6). Early archaeologists uncovered wall paintings at Pompeii and Herculaneum that graphically depicted ritual aspects of the Priapic cult; they also found "vases, lamps, everyday utensils, and the most necessary ar- ticles of furniture [that] became . . . accom- plices of their libertinism, by showing them its crude simulacrum ... intended for bawdy houses."23 Although Catherine de Medicis was accused of achieving this some 200 years earlier, modern scholars imported ancient sexual license in publications that contained detailed illustrations of the objects excavated from these ancient brothels, or "lupanaria." Designed before the courtyard houses of Pompeii had been published, however, the fountain of nymphs that Ledoux envisioned for the courtyard of Franz-Joseph d'Hallwyl's Hotel certainly suggests that his aesthetic re- turn to Roman antiquity was not entirely lacking salacious motivation (Figure 7). D'Hancarville was among the first to depict the votive objects discovered in south- ern Italy, and his observations form the basis of Payne Knight's analysis, which was pub- lished in A Discourse on the Worship ofPriapus and Its Connection with the Mystic Theology of the Ancients (1787). For Knight, the phallic object represents an anticlerical doctrine re- lating Christianity to the pagan worship of fertility. Anticipating Adolf Loos's reference to the cross as representing the horizontal woman and the vertical man penetrating her, Knight argues that this Christian icon re- ferred to the sexual act of copulation.24 Simi- larly, Dupuis, writing on the origins of religious cults, combines the sexual symbol- February 1993 JAE 46/3 1 80</page><page sequence="6">ism of the phallus with the astrophysical sym- bolism of solar movement, suggesting that life and fertility form the basis of religious thought.25 Within this scholarly venue, an elite homoeroticism evolved as these limited publications, each containing numerous views of the male member, were circulated among a limited audience of select males. Oscar Reutersvard writes on the late eighteenth century's interest in neoclassical architecture as motivated by a similar interest in masculine virility, and he explains that cer- tain Greek temples were thought to be "places for the cult of the male and the sacri- fice of women under magnificent sacred forms" (Figure 8).26 Despite all of the docu- mentation regarding these cults, antiquarians remained unsure of the temple's specific form. While the monumental phalluses at Delos indicate the site for Dionysian ritual, Reutersvard speculates that Priapic temples may have been constructed as temporary pa- vilions for specific festivals, therefore explain- ing why no archaeological evidence exists (Figure 9). Supporting this argument, Francesco Colonna depicts an ithyphallic Priapus inside of an ephemeral temple built of branches and leaves that, in turn, is circled by a parading festival of chariots (Figure 10). Although Colonna's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili (1467) was published in France as early as 1600, Giovanni Battista Piranesi's Campo Marzio of 1762 offers a prototype for the mysterious architecture of phallic worship that more closely resembles the houses of pleasure. More exuberant than Ledoux's de- signs, Piranesi's architecture of sexual ritual locates two phallic plans penetrating the semicircular cubicula forming the Bustum Caesaris Augusti (Figure 11). Piranesi con- ceived of the Bustum Caesaris, according to Reutersvard, as the location for the celebra- tion of virility and regenerative male power. He relates this site to the cult of dead emper- ors wherein cremation and the regenerative power of male gods would be sanctified in a 5.

Liber was thought to protect males and to promote animal fertility and was worshipped during ceremonies called "liberalia" that cel- ebrated the initiation of young Romans into manhood.27 Although the Oikema was not a loca- tion for women to worship in a forest of phalluses, the Revolutionary spirit that re- quested Virility to be ordained by the Na- tional Convention along with Reason, Truth, and Stoicism translates Ledoux's plans into representations of liberty. Although Liberty is represented by a female figure, a central theme of the Revolution and not surprisingly of the Augustan death cult, virtus and virility were sacred male attributes related to the worship of Liber. Appearing at first glance as a critique of contemporary morality, the Oikema also functioned as a document out- lining the Revolution's preoccupation with the polarities of vice and virtue, its conflation of liberty with virility, and its collapsing of political into bodily symbols.28 Speculation on religions originating from phallic cults prompted theorists, nota- bly Denis Diderot and Johann Joachim Winckelmann, to evaluate modern morality as based upon arbitrary rules and sensual love as the basis of religion.29 Along these lines, when proposing to eradicate Christianity, de Sade suggests placing "at the entrance to a se- cluded wood, Venus, Hymen, and Love," who, "erected beneath a rustic temple, will receive lover's homages."30 Considering these observations, the Oikema, as a religious edi- fice, offered an alternative theism to the Cult of the Supreme Being. During the Revolution, there was a general ambivalence regarding erotic free- dom, a contradiction that supported demol- ishing moral theology while simultaneously affirming a positive morality.31 Emerging from an age of libertine excess, a dominant repression legislated laws banning onanism and attempted to restrain what were regarded as sexual perversions such as incest, bestiality, and homosexuality.32 While promising sen- sual indulgence of every sort in his houses of pleasure, it is unlikely that Ledoux would have followed de Sade in encouraging such extremes as physical torture or pedophilia; his ultimate goal after all was the ritualized invo- cation of virtue. The Oikema would not only eliminate the desire for extramarital affairs, it would arrest the youthful act of auto- eroticism and promote a healthy heterosexu- ality within Hymen's guarding patriarchy.33 In addition to the Oikema and the House of Pleasure, Ledoux also encountered the exigencies of prostitution and ancient sexual ritual when designing a theater for BesanSon. Describing the need to reform the theater, Ledoux states, "They made it a crime in Greece to build monuments to lubricity whereas here one sees altars on which the priestesses of corruption burn the insipid in- cense of impurity under the cover of a piece of gauze."34 Relocated from under this piece of gauze, into the colonnade of the theater at Besanson, and finally situated behind the Oikema's pedimented portico, the fragment of a Greek temple signifies the transfiguration of corrupt prostitutes into devout priestesses and private iniquities into public value. Fundamentally, the Oikema's public legibility is questionable to such a degree that referring to it as architecture parlante would be a gross fallacy. In an age of libertine dis- course one might consider the Oikema to be lascivious erudition. Yet, when compared with Jean-Jacques Lequeu's pornographic vi- sions, Ledoux's imagination seems quite re- strained. More important, since the phallic shape can only be read in plan, the "speaking architecture" is silent here. Perhaps a tower, typically symbolic of public munificence, would have been inappropriate for this pri- vate domain where Ledoux specified that the "tranquil walls hide the agitation inside."35 In this sense, Ledoux seems to have castrated the most communicative element in his signify- ing chain. Then again, his wit persists in the space between the flaccid exterior and the rigid plan where the implied secret promised in something hidden enhances the fascina- tion of erotic legibility. Offering a more appropriate, if not en- tirely more revealing, solution to the mystery of Ledoux's missing erection, Jacques Lacan explains in The Significance of the Phallus that although the phallus is a privileged signifier for its tangible and symbolic relationship to copulation, it functions only when veiled; it is a signifier that inaugurates with its disap- pearance. This concealment is necessary be- cause shame arises, as with the "famous painting in the Villa di Pompeii," at the mo- ment when the phallus is unveiled, "marking it as the bastard offspring of this signifying concatenation."36 This notion of shame par- allels the eighteenth-century aesthetic notions of convenance and decorum insofar as express- ing the phallus with an exterior element would be to silence it as shameful representa- tion, and embedding it within a plan grants it veiled signification. The space between the missing exterior and the erect interior phallus suggests the strategy of an anamorphic paint- ing that remains invisible when viewed fron- tally but, when moving toward the appropriate oblique view, slowly becomes erect. Disappearing into the edifice and rising out of the plan, the Oikema fluctuates with the virtuosity of an anamorphic erection. Procrustean Bed and Surgical Theater The divine body of the monarch was the ulti- mate sign; so the king represented both cor- poreal government and a mythical body politic in which subjects functioned as the or- gans or appendages to the anointed head. Al- though before Louis XV's and Louis XVI's reigns the monarchy had come to be re- garded as debauched, this perception in- 1 83 Singley</page><page sequence="9">creased during the Revolution when the king's body and therefore the corporeal state were understood as diseased; after attempting to heal the state by means of regicide, the pre- vious notion of a unified political body was subject to necessary revision.37 Considering the similarity between the Saltworks at Chaux and baroque palace de- signs such as Karlsruhe or Versailles, Ledoux's plan expresses the Sun King's power in a provincial capital.38 Merging the eyes of God and the King in a centralized ges- ture of omniscient surveillance, the Director's House also contains a chapel. In fact, if we at- tribute the plan of Chaux to an antique the- ater such as Claude Perrault published in his 1684 edition of Vitruvius, the workers are both actors performing to the king's box and an audience waiting to view his representative (Figure 12). Stating that "the manager has preempted the place of the Prince," Colin Rowe and Fred Koetter complement this in- terpretation of Chaux as royal representa- tion.39 The Saltworks and the Ideal City present two different programs of pre-Revo- lutionary sublime and post-Revolutionary sublimation insofar as Ledoux, like Burke, had seen enough of terror. When describing the pyramidal form of the Director's House, Ledoux identifies the Saltworks with the king and the anatomical analogy, stating, "Power that does not wear a crown makes but a slight impression. What is a body without its head?"40 This highly ironical statement cer- tainly bears some relationship to Ledoux's nearly losing his head while in prison and to the decapitation of the king, Madame du Barry, and other noble patrons. We might re- spond to Ledoux's question by asking in- stead, "What is a head without a body?" The body as an urban analogue exists in diverse forms such as a social body, a po- litical body, or even planned as a physical body.

Renaissance theorists such as Fran- c;sco di Giorgio Martini in his Trattato di architettura civile e militare (1470-1480) imagined the city as a male body. Francesco's anatomical structure, however, places archi- tecture at the stomach, heart, head, hands, and feet, but locates no building at the geni- ti's (Figure 13). Furthermore, there was con- husion regarding the center of man; was it the "-'vel or the pelvis? Comparing Cesare di Lorenzo Cesariano's 1521 interpretations of the Vitruvian man in a square and in a circle illustrates this dilemma possibly resolved by the - ace of an erection (Figure 14). A near r!ter-porary of Francesco di Giorgio, Anto- nio di Piero Averlino, also known as Filarete, or "lover of virtue," offers a possible building type for the male genitals when he places a tower in the center of a preliminary design for the city of Sforzinda. Later in his treatise he develops a similar panoptical tower of vice and virtue that includes a brothel, lecture halls, an observatory, an academy, a theater, and much more, all with the combined in- tention of contributing to the morality of the citizens (Figure 15). Indefatigably planning this entire city around an anatomical analogy, Filarete also places a crowned head in a golden box containing the foundation myth of Sforzinda.41 In fact, like Ledoux, Filarete had been imprisoned; "apparently he was tried, tortured and released" for accusations that he had attempted to steal the reliquary of John the Baptist's head from S. Silvestro in Rome.42 Despite the marked difference be- tween the tower's dual paths of vice and vir- tue and the Oikema's single path of achieving virtue through vice, the similarities between Sforzinda and Chaux are noteworthy: circu- lar configurations located in a valley next to a river and a primitive hut, both accompanying texts also refer obliquely to decapitation (see Figure 15). Before the Revolution, Ledoux built a head, and afterward he constructed an ideal city, but in so doing he dissected the classical body in his surgical theater. Although one might view Chaux as a formal decapitation, where Ledoux has planned his city around a bodiless head, given the sequence of events perhaps a more accurate interpretation is to view it as a ruthless dismemberment.

Site plan of Chaux (A), site plan of Sforzinda (B), and plans (C), elevation (D), and section (E), of Filarete's House of Virtue and of Vice. standing the violent castration within this drawn and quartered town plan. This idea would certainly correspond to Quatremere de Quincy's invectives against Ledoux's barrieres as denatured architecture. Discussing Quatremere's position, Anthony Vidler states that Ledoux tortures architec- ture, dismembering the organic body in a game of "heads, bodies, and legs to give birth to a proto-Frankenstein monster."43 Support- ing this thesis, Chris Baldick writes in In Frankenstein s Shadow (1987), "When politi- cal discord and rebellion appear, this 'body' [the body politic] is said to be not just dis- eased, but misshapen, abortive, monstrous."44 Mary Shelly's creation, in this sense, also serves as a useful metaphor for the Ideal City where, for example, Ledoux relocates the House of Pleasure from within Paris to the outskirts of Chaux and disperses other civic monuments, such as the Pacifere, the Panaretheon, the House of Union, and the Temple of Memory, throughout the countryside. For these projects Ledoux offers neither a specific site nor any marked rela- tionship to the city; we cannot locate them in relation to Chaux. But our question remains: By ripping the torso from the head of the pre-Revolu- tionary Saltworks, is Ledoux providing not one but many bodies in bits and pieces? Outram's discussion of the Revolution's po- litical transformation forms a model for Ledoux's spatial configuration of Chaux: "Monarchic supremacy of the conscious in- tellectual centre is replaced by a federation of February 1993 JAE 46/3 1 86 B</page><page sequence="12">many bodily centers. The brain remains the source of ideas but it is no longer autono- mous or completely dominant."45 From the rule of one to the crowned rule of many, from the single focus of a baroque Versailles to the multifocus of a Paris envisaged by Pierre Patte, Ledoux is creating a series of polytheistic constellations encircling the great floating solar-head of Chaux: rendered as a levitated object casting shadows upon the ter- rain over which it hovers. His parricidal dis- memberment may be interpreted as a critique of utopian anthropomorphism or of the over centralization of France; it may be a response to the requirements of a revolutionary archi- tecture; it may be nothing more than a dis- guised royalist appeal to the crown where the head of state still speaks after its separation; or, finally, it may be that Ledoux is replacing the single divine body with Newton's heav- enly body of constellations. Regardless of these inextricable possibilities, Ledoux has sublimated the city's erotic body. Penal or Penile Eye? Concluding with a fragile triangulation based upon this corpus delicti, the Saltworks at Chaux are built in the plan of a theater that, as at Besancon, functioned as a site of de- bauchery and prostitution. With protean ar- tifice, Ledoux presents the site of this theater through an eye that carries the penile gaze. Chaux, in turn, contains a penal eye, and likewise, the House of Pleasure forms a panoptical plan with an unseeing eye in the middle. Here the head of the phallus presents a blind eye that cannot look through the solid walls into the bedrooms beyond. Nearly responding to Olympe de Gouges's assess- ment of Enlightenment man or written as an allusion to his own fear of castration, Ledoux writes that upon awakening from a twelve- year sleep, "my newly opened eyes are hurt by the new light: they see nothing."46 Like Ledoux, the Oikema at Chaux presents a see- ing eye that can no longer comprehend the new immutable order through the scattered political debris and now must rely on accept- ing insight through blindness.

Maza states: "Under the Revolution the image of the public woman as a protean, erotic creature was struck down and replaced by the female allegory of the Republic, a warlike virgin wielding a pike or sword.... These ab- stract representations of Liberty of the Republic amounted to a complete denial of the sexual connota- tions of public woman-hood: by virtue of their very conspicuousness, the bare feet and exposed breasts of Liberty or Marianne paradoxically denied eroticism, thereby forcing allegorical meaning onto the female form."

Also see Vidler, Claude- Nicolas Ledoux, 8; and Mark Wigley, "Postmortem Ar- chitecture: The Taste of Derrida," Perspecta 23 (1987): 164. Vidler explains: "Etymology also allowed for the creation of neologisms, which, invented to characterize ideal institutions of Ledoux's imagination, became the 1 87 Singley</page><page sequence="13">verbal counterparts of his utopian designs. Thus the 'Oikema,' from the Greek 8Xti7uaX meaning variously 'house,' 'dwelling,' 'temple,' 'prison,' or more signifi- cantly, as used by Herodotus, Plato, and Xenophon, 'place of debauchery,' was the name Ledoux gave to his imaginary house of pleasure, the ideal brothel of Chaux." Wigley cites Jean Jacques Rousseau's A Dis- course on Political Economy with the following quota- tion: "The word Economy, or Oeconomy, is derived from oikos, house, and nomos, law, and meant origi- nally only the wise and legitimate government of the house for the common good of the whole family." Wigley then explains: "The philosophical economy of disguised consumption is a domestic economy, the economy of the domestic, the family house. To deconstruct that economy is to locate a certain domes- tic violence within it." 21. Lemagny, VisionaryArchitects, 124. 22. Hunt, Eroticism, 114-15. 23. Kendrick, Secret Museum, 9. 24.

Regarding Piranesi's knowledge of this, he also explains: "There is no doubt that he must have read and meditated on the well-known text in- scribed on a marble slab on a tomb by the Via Appia be- tween Porta Latina and the Church of St. Sebastian: 'CVSTOS. SEPVLCRI. PENE. DESTRICTO. DEVS PRIAPUS. EGO. SUM. MORTIS. ET. VITAI. LOCVS.' These two iambic lines of verse bore witness to the conception of the grave as a place which stood un- der the protection and the power of the god of Virility which prevailed during the early Italic and Etruscan time and which survived in Hellenized connections." 28.
