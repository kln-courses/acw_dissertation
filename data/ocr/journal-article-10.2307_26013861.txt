ISBN 0 19 285364 3. The second half of the twentieth century witnessed a protean growth in the study of the Crusades throughout the western academic com munity, but especially in the United Kingdom, an interest in no small measure stimulated by what has been described by Sir Steven Runciman as the last great medieval chronicle. First published in 1995 with lavish illustrations. The Oxford History of the Crusades bears witness, in the editor's own words, to this 'phenomenal rise in the number of British crusade scholars'. This collaborative work, drawing together an impressive array of knowledge, expertise and talent, is testimony to a particular feature of much of the work produced in Britain over recent decades, not least by the editor and his pupils, five of whom contribute to this volume. The concept of 'Crusade scholars' assumes the discrete existence and an enhanced conceptualization of the phenomenon, points especially vigorously asserted here by Jonathan Riley-Smith and Norman Housley. For the former, crusading existed as a pervasive as well as radical ideology; for the latter, as reviews of the first edition have noted, it adopted independent, anthropomorphic characteristics such as 'adaptability', 'resilience' and 'panache'. Even Simon Lloyd, whose own researches on England and the Crusades are far from senti mental, ideological or bombastic, catches the mood, the effects of the Crusade being 'almost limitless'. Although now stripped of most of its gorgeous apparel of photo graphs, even in civvies the Oxford History invites discussion on the nat ure of its subject which receives direct treatment only cursorily in the editor's introductory and concluding chapters. Collaborative volumes in their nature tend towards radical or divergent revisionism (as in conference papers) or attempted marmoreal orthodoxy (as in The Cambridge Medieval History, ancient and modern). In this instance, the synthetical narrative surveys of crusading and its ideology from 1095 to 1700 by Marcus Bull, Lloyd, Riley-Smith, Jonathan Phillips and Housley, which vary in interest and quality while consistently full of arresting detail, assume agreement on a now not so new 'maximalist' interpretation of crusading as embracing all holy wars that attracted papal plenary indulgences, wherever fought over a period of at least 500 years, a chronology and history extended even further by tracing War in History 2001 8 (2) 233-247 0968-3445(01 )WH2290A © 2001 Arnold</page><page sequence="2">234 Book Reviews the continuity of the military orders to Napoleon's expulsion of the Knights of Malta in 1798 and beyond in their subsequent guises as elitist aristocratic clubs or hard-working charities. Yet there remains a subtext of proselytizing. Here the lack of a different historiographical perspective, French, German, Italian or Israeli, limits the value of some of these contributions for the unwary student while emphasizing that this appears as a very British history of the Crusades. More unequivocally useful are chapters which bring together research not easily available in one place: the excellent pieces on the military orders 1120-1798 by Alan Forey and Anthony Luttrell, Peter Edbury's typically erudite yet lucid account of the Latin East 1291 1669, Denys Pringle on the architecture and Jaroslav Folda on the art of Outremer. Michael Routledge enticingly scratches the surface of the relationship of crusading motifs and popular literary culture in his chapter on songs, which demonstrates how much historians can learn from the methodology as well as conclusions of medieval literary tex tual scholars. Another variant approach is offered by Robert Irwin's tour de force of compression and exposition in putting the Crusades in their place in his chapter on Islam and crusading 1096-1699. A bonne bouche is provided by Elizabeth Siberry's sketch of the use of crusade images, stories and language in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Intriguingly, perhaps, not least in view of the work of Smail, Marshall, France, Rogers and others, there is no separate consideration of crusading warfare, a recognition here at least of a lack of distinc tiveness in the operation of the negotium cruris. More surprising is the absence of a chapter on Byzantium. It is also regrettable that OUP has failed to take the opportunity to add a list of important or relevant books and articles published since 1995, most obviously H.E. Mayer on the chancery in the kingdom of Jerusalem and R. Ellenblum on Frank ish rural settlement. That such a criticism can be made, however, indicates the general justification for the work. Study of crusading in its widest forms shows no sign of lessening even if the aspects investigated cannot always fit neatly into a category labelled 'crusade history'. Books and articles con tinue to pour from the presses, popular as well as academic. In 2000, one enterprising American even persuaded a reputable publishing house to publish a fictional account of 1095-1291, subtitled a 'Chronicle of the Crusades', written as if composed by Jean de Join ville. Certainly bad history, probably equally poor literature, such cod historicism reveals both the challenges and the failures of 'Crusade scholars'. The academic community has left the judgementalism of Runciman or Grousset behind, but the image of the Crusades among the literate public remains stubbornly wedded to such past certainties (witness the BBC's archly old-fashioned series fronted by Terry Jones a few years ago).
