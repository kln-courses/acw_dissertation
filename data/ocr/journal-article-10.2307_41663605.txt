<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ART AND ARCHITECTURE OF CHINA, by Laurence Sickman and Alexan- der Soper. xxvi, 334 pages, 31 figures, 190 plates. Penguin Books, Baltimore 1956 (The Pelican History of Art) $8.50 This is a welcome and much needed addition to the impressive Pelican His- tory of Art which eventually will total over forty volumes. It has been many years since any work has ap- peared that rivals the present one for comprehensiveness, detail, use of cur- rent Chinese sources and readability. It is the joint but not collaborative work of Laurence Sickman and Alex- ander Soper, recognized authorities in their fields. Well over half of the text and three quarters of the plates are devoted to the section on art. A concentrated and highly informative introduction sets the stage, and Mr. Sickman then covers some three thousand years of Chinese art in a masterful manner. Students of Chinese archaeology will be disappointed, however, at finding only two paragraphs on the rich and varied pottery of Neolithic China. Perhaps this is because the section on ' art carries the narrowing subtitle of "Painting and Sculpture." But even with this limitation there should have been at least one plate illustrating some of the anthropomorphic or other designs painted on this superb Neo- lithic pottery. This reviewer feels that just be- cause the section on art is limited to painting and sculpture more space should have been devoted to Chapter HESPERIA ART 2219 St. James Place, Philadelphia 3, Pa. HESPERIA ART specializes in antiquities and coins from Greece, Rome and the Near East. HESPERIA ART issues a fully illustrated cata- log, the HESPERIA ART BULLETIN. Annual subscription for four issues is two dollars, payable by check, money order or cash. Sample copy on request. Attic Nolan amphora, red- figure, in the manner of the Phiale painter.

Most of this sculpture is in low relief and closely related to the drawing and painting of that time and deserves, because so few actual paintings exist, more than the few pages devoted to it. It is true that the excellent notes and bibliography can guide the stu- dent, but there still is one serious omission. There is no mention of the numerous reliefs discovered in Honan Province beginning in 1927, now gen- erally referred to as the Nanyang reliefs. Many of these differ markedly from the traditional style of Shantung and Honan, showing more freedom and imagination, and emphasizing the animal style. They are known through two Chinese publications, but the whole Nanyang series will soon be available in an English monograph. Bronzes and pottery, too, usually in- cluded in works on Chinese art and certainly of major importance, are un- duly neglected - probably due to the limitation noted above. The section on architecture, like that on art, gives a chronological sur- vey. In spite of the lack of remains of early stone buildings* Professor Soper traces the evolution of Chinese archi- tecture through more than three thou- sand years. This is the best survey available in a western language, and because the architecture of China is not so well known as its painting and sculpture, one cannot help but wish that this section had not been limited in size by editorial *policy. It is* in fact, a matter of regret that both of these superb contributions are not full- sized volumes. Richard C. Rudolph University of California Los Angeles</page></plain_text>
