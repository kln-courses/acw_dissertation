<plain_text><page sequence="1">JUSTIFYING A CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE The Problem of the 1844 Marx DANIEL BRUDNEY University of Chicago IN THIS ARTICLE, I point to a problem in the claims about the good life in the work of the 1844 Marx, the Marx of the "Comments on James Mill, Elemens d'economie politique" and the Economic and Philosophic Manu- scripts of 1844. The problem concerns Marx's ability to appeal to the stand- point of a true communist society as the grounding for his conception of the good life. The problem is not that, here and now, in a capitalist society, one simply can't take the standpoint of a true communist society, that is, can't have the beliefs or the consciousness of the agents in such a society, that there is a metaphysical bar to doing so (e.g., "being determines consciousness"). In fact, in Marx's work of 1844, there is no metaphysical bar either to having the beliefs of the agents in a communist society or to having what will turn out, for our purposes, to be the crucial part of a communist consciousness, what Marx calls a communist "sensuous consciousness." The problem is one of justification. It concerns the reasons, or rather the lack of reasons, at least here and now, in a capitalist society, to accept the beliefs or to trust the consciousness that agents in a communist society would have. To see the nature of Marx's problem, we must begin with a sketch of Lud- wig Feuerbach's analyses of Christianity and philosophy. What lands Marx in trouble are his Feuerbachian conception of justification and his Feuerbachian rejection of philosophy, combined with his claims about the good life and the constraints, on Marx's own view, on what practical life-the daily work life of ordinary people-can show us under capitalism. After pre- senting Feuerbach, I go through the 1844 Marx's claims about the good life AUTHOR'SNOTE: Iwould like to thank Michael Hardimon for his helpful comments on an ear- lier version of this article. POLITICAL THEORY, Vol. 29 No. 3, June 2001 364-394 ( 2001 Sage Publications 364</page><page sequence="2">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 365 and examine the nature of his justificatory problem; at the end, I argue (very briefly) that-without inconsistency with his other beliefs and despite his antipathy to it as a mode of thought-Marx actually could (and should) accept philosophy as a possible solution to that problem.' SECTION I 1. Feuerbach's The Essence of Christianity was first published in 1841. The book should be seen against the backdrop of the German scholarly scru- tiny of the gospels that began in the eighteenth century. Through impressive historical and literary research, a number of writers challenged the coherence and plausibility of the gospel stories. Some attributed these stories to such things as contemporary legends and/or messianic hopes or even to the literary creativity of the evangelists.2 Others gave rationalist accounts of events in the gospel stories, proposing thoroughly naturalistic rather than miraculous explanations of those events.3 Feuerbach's book is also hostile to Christianity, but the angle of incision is different. Feuerbach makes no attempt to disprove the historicity of the gos- pel stories, nor does he question their plausibility. Rather, he attempts to deci- pher what he takes to be their underlying meaning. He treats them as psycho- logical projections, and his goal is to prompt the reader to recognize them as such. For Feuerbach, the interest of Christianity is in what it encodes. He claims that if one treats the gospel stories and, indeed, Christian doctrine in general as messages to be decoded, one finds in those stories and that doctrine the idealized descriptions of certain human capacities and the expression of certain human wishes. Let's start with the wishes. Feuerbach's prime example is the wish for per- sonal immortality. This seems unattainable; Christian doctrine purports to explain how it can nevertheless be attained. Christ risen from death is the emblem of this possibility, shows it to us as real, thus satisfying our deep desire "for an immediate certainty of [one's] personal existence after death-personal immortality as a sensible, indisputable fact" (WC 220/135; in this article, all emphases in quoted passages are in the original). The appeal of Christianity is its ability to give us what we desperately want but think we cannot have. As for capacities, if "human" is taken to refer to the species past, present, and to come, then Christian doctrine reveals certain human capacities. For instance, God's omniscience is human omniscience, the unboundedness of scientific knowledge (G ?12, 279-80/17): in principle, there is nothing</page><page sequence="3">366 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 human beings cannot come to know.4 Feuerbach's claim is that our concept of God is anthropomorphic. We construct it by projecting onto it our own ideals, specifically, the extreme form of those capacities-e.g., knowledge, power- which are in fact increasingly possessed by the human species as a whole. For Feuerbach, then, the question to ask of Christianity is not whether its particular claims are likely to be true when measured against historical evi- dence or scientific theory but what the desires and ideals are that those claims conceal. 2. Now Feuerbach's decoding of Christian stories and doctrine is, in effect, an interpretation of those stories and that doctrine. So one needs a rea- son to think that his interpretation is more compelling than its competi- tors-for instance, than the orthodox claim that the gospels narrate historical, including miraculous, events along with the teachings of the son of God. Here, one might think that history and science would be relevant, that an interpretation that fits well with what history and science tell us would be more plausible than one that does not. However, Feuerbach explicitly eschews such resources. He does not ask his reader to weigh the reasons pro and con the competing interpretations. His thought is, rather, that when pre- sented with his account, the reader will recognize the psychological source of her impulse to believe the orthodox interpretation-and with this once acknowledged will be unable to affirm that interpretation and will instead affirm Feuerbach's. In effect, he will have disclosed to the reader her own latent atheism. Take Feuerbach's treatment of miracles: I do not ask what the real, natural Christ was or may have been.... I do not ask whether this or that, or any miracle can happen or not; I only show what miracle is, and I show it not a priori but by examples of miracles narrated in the Bible as real events; in doing so, however, I answer or rather preclude the question as to the possibility or reality or neces- sity of miracles. (WC 26/xli-xlii) Feuerbach thus does not assess historical evidence ("I do not ask what the real, natural Christ was or may have been"), nor does he engage in rationalist criticism ("I do not ask whether this or that, or any miracle can happen or not"). If his reader sees that Christ is "nothing else than" a product of the human mind (WC 26/xli), she will not be tempted to wonder whether Christ performed miracles. The question will be "precluded," will not arise. On my reading, Feuerbach is not arguing against the Christian. He is try- ing to get her to see the world differently. He is trying to produce a conver- sion. I read him as the atheist counterpart of the fideist, someone for whom what is crucial is an immediate experience of God's presence or, rather,</page><page sequence="4">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 367 absence. Feuerbach stresses that proofs of God's existence can "give no satis- factory certainty" (WC 317/204), and he seems to think that proofs of God's nonexistence are in the same boat. With them, too, one can always look for weak points, challenge premises or inferences, continue to withhold full con- viction from the conclusion-not be certain that God doesn't exist. Feuerbach is, then, demanding more than the considered judgment that he thinks is all that a proof can provide in such matters. He is demanding utter conviction, more specifically, a conviction that removes all doubt of God's nonexistence in practice, that is, in daily life. In her daily life, the true believer simply knows that God exists; in her daily life, the true nonbeliever simply knows that he does not. Now Feuerbach thinks that sensory perception involves the kind of con- viction that has this practical force. Whatever one might do in philosophy class, in daily life one does not doubt what is before one's eyes. For the true believer, Feuerbach thinks, God's existence is not inferred. It is perceived in the world. Jonathan Edwards describes the way the world looks after he has had a religious experience: "the appearance of everything was altered; there seemed to be . . . [an] appearance of divine glory, in almost every- thing ... clouds, and blue sky; in the grass, flowers, trees."' Feuerbach wants there to be the appearance that everything is not filled with divine glory but is solely and only the material world. He wants God's nonexistence to be as clear and obvious as what is before one's eyes. 3. The point of Feuerbach's insistence on a perceptual-a noninferential certainty is that the nonbeliever is not merely to hold particular convictions but to live a particular kind of life. Jacob Burckhardt writes, in 1852, that the transition in late antiquity from pagan to Christian beliefs involved a change in how people related to the world: The time was come for human beings to enter into a new relationship to sensuous [sinnlichen] as well as to supersensible [ibersinnlichen] things, for. . . sexaration from things earthly to take the place of older views of the gods and the world. I take Burckhardt to be claiming that a human being has a basic stance or ori- entation toward the material world-a way of relating to objects in the world and, indeed, to the material world as a whole-that informs one's life. The pagan relationship to sensuous things was changed by Christianity. Feuerbach's goal is to prompt yet another such transformation.7 The relationship toward sensuous things that Feuerbach wants to leave behind involves the belief that the material world is a realm fit only for our lower nature, a realm that is mere testing and preparation for a later, purely spiritual existence. It involves seeing the world as an intrinsically alien place,</page><page sequence="5">368 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 a place that, although it may be shot through with divine glory, is not our true home. The relationship to be embraced involves rejection of any belief in a distinct, nonmaterial realm and in an afterlife. The idea is to relate to the world materialistically: it is as if Feuerbach wants us palpably to feel our essential nature as bodily creatures, our embodiment. We are supposed to feel "at home" as material beings in a purely material world. Coming to see oneself solely as a material being in a material world might seem profoundly disenchanting (as Weber might put it). Feuerbach, however, finds it inspiring, for among the things that one would see would be other human beings, and-ideally-they would have, for one, a certain resonance. One would identify with the human species and be oriented to the material world as the site of that species' life. During this period, a number of thinkers (e.g., Auguste Comte, J. S. Mill) proposed a "religion of humanity," and Feuerbach has often been read as replacing Christianity with just such a thing. This is largely correct, but it is important to stress that, for Feuerbach, gen- uine religious conviction determines not just what one believes but also what one perceives. He thinks that the Greeks saw their gods and that Christian true believers see God's presence in the world. Miracles, he says, require the "senses and organs" for seeing them (G ? 15, 286/23). In eras in which agents have these senses and organs, faith needs no proofs. Similarly, the religion of humanity should need no proofs. The Christian sees God's presence in the material world. The devotee of the religion of humanity would see humanity's. The Christian sees in the world something more than the world: she perceives the presence of something enormously meaningful and valuable.8 The Feuerbachian humanist, too, would perceive something enormously meaningful and valuable, namely, human beings. And the material world as the place where we (that is, we, human beings) live our lives would be taken as-would (ideally) be perceived as-for that rea- son, meaningful and valuable. In a sense, the world would remain enchanted. 4. So Feuerbach gives an interpretation of Christianity. But why think his readers will accept it? His goal is to prompt a transformation. But why think his readers will be transformed? Feuerbach's answer is that, in fact, his readers already effectively accept his interpretation, are already all but transformed. He is, he thinks, merely telling them what they already believe but are too fainthearted to admit. Their lives-the lives of ordinary Europeans in the 1 840s-are in fact not the lives of genuine Christians: rather, they live materialistic and atheistic lives. In their practical dealings with the material world, for instance, in their approach to their health or to their business affairs, they do not rely on God but on human power, knowledge, and cooperation (e.g., when they are sick</page><page sequence="6">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 369 they don't just pray, they call the doctor). "Christianity has in fact long van- ished, not only from the reason but from the life of humanity" (WC 29-30/xliv). He thinks that his contemporaries' ostensible faith is merely a way of concealing from themselves their actual atheism (NRP 216/146). They have lost the senses and organs for real Christianity and gained those appropriate to the lives of purely material beings. Feuerbach is trying to prompt acknowledgment of this fact. Thus Feuerbach does not worry about-in fact, seems oblivious to-the possible genetic fallacy in his view, namely, that the psychological impulses to faith are irrelevant if there is a sufficient basis (cogent argument, powerful religious experience) for faith. For he is not trying to convince the uncon- vinced but to reveal to agents their own half-repressed, antireligious beliefs (NRP 218/148). In principle, one could acknowledge the psychological impulses Feuerbach points to and yet still be a Christian. In practice, he is confident one won't. 5. Now for Feuerbach, Christianity is not the only spiritual ailment of the age. Philosophy, at least taken in a certain way, is equally problematic. And so in 1843, he publishes Provisional Theses for the Reformation of Philoso- phy and Principles of the Philosophy of the Future. These are intended as an analysis of philosophy in strict parallel to the analysis of Christianity. These texts are not sober, academic treatises. Indeed, they read more as manifestoes.9 There is little argument, and crucial claims are made via mere table thumping. For instance, Feuerbach rejects Cartesian doubt with such ringing declarations as, "Indisputable and immediately certain is only that which is an object of the senses, perception andfeeling" (G ?38, 320/55); and "Only through the senses is an object given in a true sense" (G ?33, 316/51). Such pronouncements might be taken as asserting (without adequate argu- ment) an empiricist rather than a rationalist position. One would then see Feuerbach as engaged in the usual academic swordplay-staking out one philosophical position against another-but just doing it rather badly. I will not read him this way. Aside from the principle of charity-taken as academic pieces, the Theses and the Principles are quite poor-there are three reasons not to do so. First, Feuerbach insists that the method of the analysis of philosophy is the same as that of the analysis of Christianity (VT 244/157). If the latter abstains from the usual forms of argumentation and rests on the idea of transforming the reader, so should the former. Second, I make no brief for Feuerbach's analytical acuity, but he is hardly philosophically ignorant. Before writing The Essence, he had published, among other things, The History of Modem Philosophy from Bacon to Spinoza, a book that contains a chapter on Descartes. He can hardly be</page><page sequence="7">370 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 unaware that baldly to insist on the reliability of "that which is an object of the senses" is less than philosophically respectable. Third, Feuerbach explicitly exhorts his reader to do more than digest intel- lectual theses. His new philosophy, he says, involves "the following categori- cal imperative: Desire not to be a philosopher, as distinct from a human being; be nothing else than a thinking human being ... think as a living and real being" (G ?52, 334/67; see also UWC 441). And in his Fragments Con- cerning the Characteristics of My Philosophical Development, he declares, "True philosophy does not consist in making books, but in making human beings" (Fr 180/295). In line with this last point, consider also Feuerbach's description of philos- ophy's subject matter. "Philosophy," he says, "is the knowledge of what is. Things and essences are to be thought and to be known just as they are-this is the highest law, the highest task of philosophy" (VT 251/162). This seems quite traditional, an echo, presumably, of Hegel's claim that "to comprehend what is, is the task of philosophy.""' But in fact what is, for Feuerbach, are merely material beings in a material world: what is is what is there to be seen directly and on the surface, to be registered by the senses. By contrast, Hegel spends many a dark page explaining what is. And Feuerbach is quite con- scious of the contrast, stressing that to those with academic blinders his way of doing philosophy will seem superficial. To have articulated what is such as it is, in other words, to have truthfully articulated what truly is, appears superficial. To have articulated what is such as it is not, in other words, to havefalsely and distortedly articulated what truly is, appears profound. (VT 251/162; see also WC 17/xxxv and G 264/3) Feuerbach's claim, of course, is that, taken properly, his is the genuinely pro- found view. And, crucially, he insists that properly to grasp what is-"the real in its reality and totality"-involves something more than mere intellectual competence: one must be a certain kind of person, namely, "a real and com- plete being" (G ?50, 333/66). I am not denying that Feuerbach has a "philosophy." In their very titles, the Theses and Principles assert that he does. But the philosophical genre here is different from the usual one. "Truthfulness, simplicity, and determinacy," Feuerbach says in the Theses, "are the formal marks of the real philosophy" (VT 251/162). Locke and Hume might claim that their philosophies are truth- ful and even determinate, but no reader of Locke's Essay or Hume's Treatise is likely to think of their philosophies as "simple," in the sense of being straightforward and nonabstract. In their philosophical genre, Feuerbach's</page><page sequence="8">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 371 Theses and Principles are as different from them as from Hegel's Logic or Phenomenology. 6. The Theses and the Principles are, then, something other than bad attempts at defending one philosophical position against another. Rather, in these texts the point of Feuerbach's treatment of philosophy-just as with his treatment of Christianity-is to transform his reader. And just as with his Christian reader, Feuerbach thinks he can transform his philosophical reader because he thinks that, in practice, she already accepts his claims, is already all but transformed. Take the question of the existence of the external world. Feuerbach thinks that if in our daily lives we in fact relate to the world as strictly material beings, then we can easily come to acknowledge ourselves as such beings, and if we do so, we will also "acknowledge that. . . seeing is also thinking, that the senses too, are the organs ofphilosophy" (AP 145/137). Now, by the claim that the senses are the organs of philosophy, Feuerbach means several things. Most straightforwardly, he sees the senses as the instruments of natu- ral science through which we learn truths about the material world. But Feuerbach also means more, and in particular he means that the deliverances of the senses are reliable. And if that is so, then the external world exists. The move here is not supposed to be inferential-the agent affirming the reliability of her senses, noting that her senses seem to register an existing extramental world, and then concluding that such a world exists. Rather, if the agent acknowledges the nature of the life she actually leads-a life in which she constantly interacts with and increasingly controls a material world regis- tered via the senses-philosophical doubts will not arise. One will simply acknowledge what one is, that is, a material being in a material world. Of course, it would not be incoherent to wonder whether the external world exists, anymore than it would be incoherent to wonder whether miracles had occurred; Feuerbach's claim (as before with miracles) is that in fact, one won't. Feuerbach has, in effect, dismissed the problem of the existence of the external world or at least dismissed it as an abstract question to be answered by abstract theorizing. What he objects to is seeing abstract theory, separated from practical engagement in the world, as the road to truth about the most important matters, e.g., the nature of being. The real issue here is not some particular philosophical position but the belief that the most profound truths are arrived at in the study. Feuerbach does think that there are profound truths. And one can correctly attribute to him philosophical theses, e.g., materialism. However, I take his claim to be that the point of being a "materialist" is not so much the accep- tance of a theoretical proposition but, rather, how one comes to relate to the</page><page sequence="9">372 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 world, one's "relationship to sensuous ... things," in Burckhardt's phrase. If one relates properly to sensuous things, one will be a materialist in practice, and to acknowledge one's own practical materialism will be to "solve" the philosophical problem. The modern philosopher, according to Feuerbach, says that abstract thought is the road to truth, just as the modem Christian says that Christian doctrine is. But neither actually relates to the world as her official view pro- claims. In practice-in daily, practical life-Feuerbach thinks that agents take neither religious doctrine nor philosophical abstractions as their guide. Rather, they rely on the senses, and this reliance expresses their practical materialism (as it expresses their practical atheism). The senses are organs of philosophy here-"seeing is also thinking" here-not in the sense that agents take the deliverances of the senses as evidence for the truth of a theoretical proposition but in the sense that if agents were to acknowledge their practical life in the material world (the life they lead through the senses) as their real and essential life, then philosophical questions, e.g., about the nature of being, would be taken to be so obviously and completely answered by the deliverances of the senses as to forestall further reflection. And so the flight to philosophical abstraction would never take wing. SECTION 2 1. The Essence of Christianity was published in 1841. It had an immediate impact. According to Friedrich Engels, its effect was "liberating.... Enthusi- asm was general; we all became at once Feuerbachians."" In 1842, Marx insists that "there is no other road for you to truth andfreedom except through the stream of fire [den Feuer-bach]" (LSSF 208/95). In this and the following section, I look at the 1844 Marx's view of the good life for human beings (implicit there being his criticism of capitalism as at odds with that life), at his Feuerbachian account of the means by which such a view can be justified, and at the problem of justifying that view by those means.'2 2. There are many elements to Marx's view, and my presentation must be selective. I will focus on the following theses: 1. The good life for human beings crucially involves engaging in a certain kind of activity, namely, the transformation of the material world in order both to express one's individu- ality and to sustain the existence of oneself and other human beings at an increasingly high material level. This is the central activity through which we realize our nature, which I equate, for the 1844 Marx, with leading the good life for a human being. 13 Marx calls this activity the "human species-activity"(OpM 542/302).</page><page sequence="10">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 373 2. The proper structure of this activity involves a particular relationship between produc- ers and consumers. 3. The proper justification for (1) and (2) comes via the practical lives of agents in a com- munist society. In her daily, practical life, such an agent would "see" the truth of (1) and (2). 4a. In a capitalist society, agents' practical lives provide insufficient reason to believe (1) and (2). 4b. In a capitalist society, agents' practical lives provide insufficient reason to believe (3). I take Marx more or less explicitly to hold theses 1 through 3. There is also some textual evidence that he holds (4a) (see, for instance, OpM 544-45/304); in any event, I will argue that he is committed to both (4a) and (4b). Jointly, these theses are not inconsistent. All could be true. Still, (4a) and (4b) raise the question of whether it is rational to believe (1) through (3) here and now, that is, in a capitalist society. In a capitalist society, Marx's preferred mode ofjustification for (1) through (3) is unavailable, and if (4a) and (4b) are true, agents' current practical lives are no substitute. Moreover, it will turn out that Marx rejects the obvious alternative mode of justification, namely, philosophical argument. So, by Marx's own lights, it seems unclear why, here and now, we should believe (1) through (3). In this section, I discuss (1) and (2); in section 3, I deal with (3), (4a), and (4b), as well as with Marx's rejection of philosophy. I close with the thought that, in the end, Marx does not have sufficient reason-even on his own premises-to reject philosophy as a way to justify his claims about the good life. 3. Thesis 1 says that there is a specific activity that is central to the good life. That activity differs from those usually picked out for this role. It is not the activity of philosophical contemplation or religious devotion; nor is it the exercise of political authority. Marx's thought is that human beings are most essentially creatures who interact with the material world. To privilege philo- sophical contemplation or religious devotion would deny this. And to privi- lege the exercise of political authority would accord priority to the exercise of control over other human beings. The 1844 Marx does care about human cooperation whose point is to control something, but that something is the material world. Marx prizes the cooperative exercise of human powers through which those powers take a material form, that is, become objectified in (as a result of the transformation of) the material world. Marx's emphasis on the transformation of the material world raises a question. Is the favored activity the transformation of the material world in order to provide for one's own and the species' survival, or is it the trans- formative activity that one engages in after survival is assured?</page><page sequence="11">374 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 Labor to ensure survival is necessary labor in two related senses. First, someone has to do it. Second, its content is constrained: one must produce food, clothing, shelter, not books or video games. Subsequent labor not only need not be performed, but, for that reason, its content is comparatively unconstrained. On the other hand, one can derive a special satisfaction from overcoming natural necessity. Such overcoming shows palpably that (at least to some extent) one can be nature's master, not her subject. It is sometimes said to be the achievement of a kind of freedom. So which activity is central to the good life? Which is the human species-activity? Marx's 1844 texts point both ways. On the one hand, he attacks earlier writers for seeing in "labor-that is, industry" merely " 'vulgar need'" (OpM 542-43/303), and he declares that "the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of human essen- tial powers" and that "ordinary, material industry" involves the "essential powers of human beings" (OpM 542-43/302). Such remarks seem like an endorsement of necessary labor as the human species-activity. On the other hand, Marx seems to endorse nonnecessary labor when he claims that ani- mals produce "only under the domination of immediate physical need, while the human being produces even free from physical need and only truly pro- duces in freedom from it" (OpM 517/276). I see three reasons why, on balance, the 1844 texts should be taken to favor necessary labor as the activity central to the good life."' First, Marx insists that his account differs from traditional ones, but tradi- tional accounts agree that necessary labor is not the sphere of the good life. Whether one should philosophize, worship, or rule, these activities are all distinct from necessary labor. If Marx is merely favoring some other nonnecessary activity, his view is less distinctive than he thinks. Second, much of Marx's 1844 work consists of a criticism of labor in a capitalist society. This criticism is of the labor that workers must do to earn a wage, and such labor is clearly the production of basic consumption goods, the labor necessary for the species' survival. Now, the 1844 Marx's primary criticism of this labor under capitalism is not that it exists at all-that its quantity should be reduced or that it should be entirely eliminated (perhaps done by machines)-but that it is "alienated" (see OpM 510-22/270-82). This is supposed to be a deep and fundamental criticism of capitalism, to show that capitalism is essentially at odds with a good human life, but it can be this and show this only if the labor in question is a deep and fundamental part of human life, only if it is essential to a good human life. Finally, in the "Comments," Marx describes what it would be like if we produced "as human beings" (AM 462/227). He sketches communist pro-</page><page sequence="12">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 375 duction and depicts how, through such production, agents would realize their nature. The labor described here is clearly necessary labor, and the intended contrast is clearly to the same labor under capitalism.'5 Thesis 1, incidentally, ties the 1844 Marx to Feuerbach's materialism. Feuerbach demands acknowledgment of our nature as material beings in a material world, including as beings with increasing control over that world. Marx extends this last point, demanding acknowledgment of our nature as beings who increasingly control the world through continually transforming it to meet our needs. He puts the stress on a particular way in which we are material beings in a material world. 4. Let's turn now to thesis 2. It says that the good life for human beings requires not only that one engage in a particular type of activity but that in engaging in this type of activity, one's relationship to other human beings be of a particular kind. This is a vital requirement. According to Marx, the activ- ity central to the good life is the transformation of the material world, the transformation of nature, to produce material goods. The vast bulk of human- ity, however, has always done this, yet Marx does not think it has always led the good life. The required relationship has two aspects, an objective and a subjective. Let's begin with the objective aspect. This, in turn, has two parts. First, agents must cooperate with one another in the transformation of the material world, that is, in the production of goods. In his work of 1844 (and more virulently later), Marx attacks the division of labor on the ground that it turns agents from beings with a multiplicity of capacities, capable of many forms of satis- faction and self-expression, into beings who do one small thing over and over (see OpM 473-74/237-38 and 476/240). Nevertheless, Marx cannot be opposed to any and all division of labor, for then ideal human production would not be cooperative production. I don't think Marx envisions commu- nist workers as each producing a product in its entirety. Beyond its ineffi- ciency, that would not be cooperation, and, for Marx, one of the achievements of capitalism has been to bring agents out of their isolation and into coopera- tive activity, to make possible the joint transformation of the material world. Marx surely thinks that communism will alter the division of labor so that no one is condemned to a life of enervating, repetitive toil, but I don't think he would call for its elimination. A communist society would not be one of utterly distinct, individual producers. The first objective requirement for proper human relations, then, is that agents jointly produce products. The second is that agents produce for one another, in the sense that they not produce only for their own use. Agent A should (jointly with others) produce something agent B will use, and B should (jointly with others) produce something C will use. Under commu-</page><page sequence="13">376 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 nism, products would not be traded with an eye to profit, but there would be some way that goods would end up consumed by agents other than their origi- nal producers. These two objective requirements are substantially satisfied by industrial capitalism. The requirements of the subjective aspect, however, are not satis- fied. I call these requirements "subjective" because they concern agents' beliefs and aims. What is at stake, for the 1844 Marx, are proper relations between producers and consumers. Such proper relations involve producers and consumers having certain beliefs, producers having certain aims in pro- ducing, consumers having certain beliefs about producers' aims, and produc- ers having certain beliefs about consumers' beliefs, including about consum- ers' beliefs about their-the producers'-aims. More specifically, the subjective requirements are the following: a. Agents in general-both producers and consumers-believe that the transformation of the material world is the way that human beings realize their nature, i.e., is the human species-activity. b. In producing, producers in general take as a central aim the production of things that will be used by others to advance their (the consumers') own ends; producers are producing for others, not merely earning a wage. 16 c. Producers in general believe that consumers believe that the transformation of the mate- rial world is the way that human beings realize their nature, i.e., is the human spe- cies-activity-that is, producers believe that (a) is satisfied by consumers. d. Consumers in general believe that (b) is satisfied. e. Producers in general believe that (d) is satisfied. These requirements amount to the claim that the conditions for an agent to realize her nature are not only that she be engaged in and have the correct belief about the human species-activity but also that she (correctly) believe that other human beings both recognize and appreciate her engagement in that activity-she needs others' recognition and appreciation of her activity under the description "the human species-activity." 17 And so agent A can realize her nature only if agents B, C, etc. have certain beliefs about the human species-activity as well as about A's activity qua producer, and A believes that they have those beliefs. I attribute this recognition and appreciation requirement to the 1844 Marx because otherwise it would be possible for an agent under capitalism, includ- ing a factory worker, to realize her nature, and I take the 1844 Marx to deny this. Capitalism satisfies the objective requirements for an agent to realize her nature, and perhaps an agent could also bring herself to hold the beliefs (about the human species-activity) and to have the aims (in producing) that are requisite for realizing her nature. What she cannot do, however, is control</page><page sequence="14">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 377 other agents' beliefs and aims (including their beliefs about her beliefs and aims). If, as we shall see in section 3, under capitalism these are unlikely to be of the right kind, then under capitalism the agent cannot realize her nature. Note that it is not sufficient for others merely to believe that one is engaged in producing objects that others do in fact use. Capitalism satisfies that condi- tion: when A goes to the factory in the morning, other agents believe she will be producing objects that other human beings will use. In addition, however, agents must believe (i) that such production activity is the human species- activity, and (ii) that a central aim of A's production activity is to produce something for others to use. In effect, if she is to see her activity as recognized and appreciated, A must believe-assuming that, for her, individually, requirements (a) and (b) are satisfied-that requirement (a) is generally satis- fied by consumers, and she must believe that consumers in general believe that (b) is satisfied (i.e., she must believe that (d) is satisfied). For producers in general, then, to see their activity as recognized and appreciated, not only must (a) and (b) be satisfied, but producers must believe that (a) is satisfied by consumers (and thus (c) must be satisfied); moreover, consumers must believe that (b) is satisfied (and thus (d) must be satisfied), and producers must believe that (d) is satisfied (and thus (e) must be satis- fied). In section 3, I point out that, on Marx's account, agents under capital- ism are unlikely to have the necessary beliefs and aims for these requirements to be satisfied. Under communism, however, both the objective and subjective require- ments listed above would be satisfied. And in that case, agents would "com- plete" and "confirm" one another, as Marx puts it, via the production (with certain beliefs and aims) and consumption (with certain beliefs) of objects-they would help one another to realize their nature. According to Marx, if production and consumption involve the requisite beliefs and aims (by producers) and beliefs (by consumers), then, in producing, I would ... become recognized and felt by you yourself as a completion [Ergdnzung] of your own nature and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently would know myself to be confirmed [best&amp;tigt] both in your thought and your love.... In my individ- ual life-expression [i.e., the production of a product] I would have directly created your life-expression, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly confirmed and realized my true nature, my human nature. Our products would be so many mirrors reflecting our nature. This relationship would moreover be reciprocal; what occurs on my side has also to occur on yours. (AM 462-63/227-28) I want to focus on the "confirming" relationship here (for a few remarks on the "completing" relationship, see section 3.2). Note the following:</page><page sequence="15">378 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 First, confirmation here seems to be a kind of ultimate validation or ratifi- cation: so to speak, it finishes off a particular activity, ratifies that it has come to full fruition. In this case, the activity is the human species-activity, and coming to full fruition amounts to realizing one's nature. Second, confirmation here is noncomparative. One is confirmed qua transformer of the material world who produces products for others' use, and there is no suggestion that agents are ranked in this respect. Third, such confirmation would have to be notional. No producer could follow her product to its ultimate consumer, and no consumer could know the producer (actually, the many producers) of any object she consumes. Fourth, the idea of confirmation in the other's "love" presumably does not involve feelings of personal affection. Again, producers and consumers do not know one another. Ideally, economic relationships would be exchange relationships in the way that friendship can involve exchange relationships. Friends often make one another gifts, and it is better that they do so than that each spends the money on herself. Even if each winds up with what she would have bought herself, the exchange of gifts adds something: it expresses the fact that these agents matter to one another. I think Marx's idea is that com- munist economic relationships would have the same structure. Agents would not have intense personal feelings for unknown strangers, but a structural "friendship" would be built into economic relationships.'8 Finally, there is a contrast to accounts of the good life that are individual- ist, accounts according to which an agent could, in principle, lead the good life on her own. Most human beings need other human beings-both to help produce the means of existence and for emotional sustenance. Yet one could imagine a person with few desires, no taste for companionship, and enor- mous material resources. On some philosophical views, such an individual could realize her nature alone (e.g., by engaging in philosophical contempla- tion). Not so for the 1844 Marx. For him, the agent needs someone else for whom to produce and whom she can see as confirming her nature qua pro- ducer.'9 As a conceptual matter, agents cannot lead the good life alone.2" SECTION 3 1. On the 1844 Marx's view, the good life consists in engaging in a certain kind of activity, i.e., the transformation of the material world (thesis 1), with a certain kind of relationship to others (thesis 2). Such a claim needs justifica- tion. What can Marx offer?</page><page sequence="16">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 379 He, himself, thinks that the proper justification would occur in the practi- cal lives of those in a communist society. Here, he is heavily Feuerbachian. Feuerbach thinks that our senses interpret the world differently in different eras (see WC 317-20/204-06, G ?15 286/23). Marx agrees: "The sensuous consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of the Greek, because his sensuous existence is different" (OpM 552/312). Feuerbach also says that the senses can be the organs of philosophy (AP 145/137). Again, Marx agrees: in a communist society, "the senses have ... become theorists directly in their practice" (OpM 540/300). In such a society, "the essential reality of human beings in nature ... has become evident in practice, sensu- ously perceptible" (OpM 546/305). For Marx, as for Feuerbach, the proper justification of claims about the human essence, and so about the content of the good life for human beings, occurs in practice, that is, through living a certain kind of life ("the solution to theoretical riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice"; OpM 552/312). In a communist society, one would, in effect, be transformed, live a different life, and in that different life the truth of theses 1 and 2 would be "sensuously perceptible," self-evident (just as Feuerbach thinks God's nonexistence is now self-evident). Marx takes this to be the proper justification of theses 1 and 2. That is thesis 3 (see section 2.2). 2. Marx's desired justification of theses 1 and 2 comes via communism, but it would surely be nice if Marx could justify his claims here and now.2' Marx's desired justification comes via agents' practical lives, and so a sensi- ble justificatory attempt here and now might seem to be to appeal to our prac- tical lives here and now, to appeal to the practical lives of agents under capitalism. Unfortunately for Marx, here and now the evidence would be against him. In the practical lives of most people under capitalism, necessary labor does not seem central to the good life. Marx himself stresses that under capitalism, workers consider labor a chore to be avoided, to be "shunned like the plague" (OpM 514/274). For most people, the good life begins at quitting time. Most people would reject thesis 1 (thus making thesis 2 moot). Feuerbach claims that an obvious fact about human beings-that we are embodied beings in a material world-is more than an obvious fact; it reveals what is essential to our nature. Marx is also claiming that an obvious fact-that we transform the material world-reveals what is essential to our nature. Feuerbach thinks that we can easily come to see the second, the nor- mative point. We can be converted to it here and now, can immediately "have the unclouded light of truth before our eyes" (WC 415/275). Could Marx appeal to something similar? Could he appeal to some current experience that</page><page sequence="17">380 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 would be sufficiently close to communist experience that it could count as sufficient justification of, or at least as significant evidence for, his claims about the good life? Could we somehow, here and now, take (something suffi- ciently close to) the standpoint of communism? Now, it is standard commentary to assert that Marx thinks that there can be no change of consciousness prior to social change. Thus existing conditions, that is, capitalism, would forestall a Feuerbachian-style conversion. Only under different conditions, that is, communism, could one "see" that the good life is as Marx claims. There is a sense in which this standard view is correct, but not because "being determines consciousness," at least not because it does so in the sense of making certain concepts unavailable under capitalism. However, to see the real nature of Marx's problem, some details need to be spelled out. In particu- lar, we need to examine two issues: agents' experience as evidence for theses 1 and 2, and the possibility of changing one's "sensuous consciousness." In this subsection, I deal with the former; in the next subsection, with the latter. Consider thesis 1, the claim that necessary labor is the activity central to the good life. Agents' experience under capitalism is dramatically at odds with it. Under capitalism, necessary labor tends to be poorly paid and unpleasant. Moreover, one has little choice about the kind of labor one does. One needs a job, and most workers must take whatever job is available.22 Agents' practical lives seem to give them good reason to reject thesis 1. Still, suppose one finds a decently paid job, doing an enjoyable task. Sup- pose one produces something one knows others will use to meet their basic needs, and suppose producing something for others' use is a central aim of one's activity. Suppose even that one believes that one's work is a central component of a good life. This sounds close to the communist ideal. Couldn't one now say that one's experience is sufficiently like the experience of com- munist necessary labor that it could provide at least some evidence that Marx is right that such labor is central to the good life? One's experience would indeed be some evidence for thesis 1 (although so exceptional under capitalism as not to provide much reason to accept that the- sis). But it would be no evidence for thesis 2, and that is crucial. Thesis 2 makes Marx's a distinctive view. It highlights the structural "friendship" in communists' producer/consumer relationships, communists' deep interde- pendence for the realization of their nature (see section 2.4). It is what makes Marx's view different from a mere celebration of honest toil. Now, one's experience would be no evidence for thesis 2 because that thesis deals with the producer/consumer relationship, and the right form of that relationship cannot be instantiated under capitalism. This is worth dwelling on.</page><page sequence="18">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 381 To begin with, from the producer's end, the proper form of the pro- ducer/consumer relationship requires believing that consumers believe both that a certain activity (material production) is central to the good life, is the human species-activity, and that, in producing, producers take as a central aim the production of things for others' use. In a capitalist society, however, agents in general see labor merely as a means to get money; they don't see it as the human species-activity. Moreover, in producing, producers in general don't have as a central aim the production of objects for others' use; their aim is solely to earn a wage. And agents don't see others as different, in these respects, from themselves-they don't believe that other agents either see labor as the human species-activity or in producing have as a central aim the production of objects for others' use. Putting matters in terms of the require- ments listed in section 2.4, requirements (a) and (b) are not satisfied in a capi- talist society; moreover, agents in general don't believe that (a) and (b) are satisfied. Producers thus don't believe that (a) is satisfied by consumers, i.e., (c) is not satisfied, and consumers don't believe that (b) is satisfied by produc- ers, that is, (d) is not satisfied. And assuming, as seems plausible, that produc- ers don't believe that (d) is satisfied, then (e) is also not satisfied. So none of the subjective requirements for agents to realize their nature is satisfied. In a capitalist society, then, it would be irrational for any producer to hold the necessary beliefs about consumers' beliefs, in particular, the necessary beliefs about consumers' beliefs about the producer's own beliefs and aims. It would be irrational even for our fortunate worker to do so (and even if she, individually, satisfies (a) and (b)). It would be irrational for our fortunate worker to believe that others recognize and appreciate her activity in the req- uisite way-for they almost certainly do not. It would thus be irrational for her to think that, qua producer, she and other agents (potential consumers of her product) are in the requisite relationship. And so it would be irrational for her to think that her production experience is evidence in favor of Marx's claim that a particular producer/consumer relationship is crucial to the good life (thesis 2). Under capitalism, no one's production experience can be evi- dence in favor of that claim, for no one can (rationally) see herself as being in that relationship. There is a similar problem from the consumer's end. Part of realizing one's nature, for the 1844 Marx, is being "completed"-as he puts it in the "Comments" (see AM 462/228,460/226, and 451/217)-by others, through their production of objects for one's use. I take the thought to be this. The con- sumer needs the product the producer makes to attain her individual ends, to pursue her individual projects. Suppose now that the consumer believes that the producer produces for her (as under communism the producer would:</page><page sequence="19">382 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 Marx stresses the importance to communist workers of producing something that meets another human being's need; AM 462/228). The consumer would then (so Marx's thought seems to be) see the producer as, in effect, deliber- ately helping her to attain her individual ends, to complete her individual projects23 -and so, in a sense (and perhaps by a stretch), as helping to com- plete her.24 The crucial condition here, from the consumer's perspective, is that one must make use of objects with the belief that the objects' existence is neither mere happenstance nor the result of the invisible hand's interlocking selfish- ness but, rather, the result of other agents' activity with the aim that one (any- way, that someone) use the objects to further one's own (someone's) ends.25 But under capitalism, qua consumer, it would not be rational to believe that producers have this aim (the aim that is requisite to seeing producers' activity as one's own "completion"), for under capitalism producers produce merely to earn a wage and would not produce otherwise. In effect, one knows that requirement (b) is not satisfied. Thus, under capitalism, one also cannot (rationally) believe that one has experienced the consumer component of the desired producer/consumer relationship.26 Of course, one could subscribe to theses 1 and 2. The relevant concepts are clearly available under capitalism, so I see no conceptual bar to affirming these theses. But, on Marx's account, it would not be rational to do so, for, at least based on one's own and other agents' experiences-on agents' practical lives, Marx's emphatically preferred source of evidence-one has insuffi- cient grounds to do so with thesis 1, and one has (and, prior to communism, can have) no grounds whatsoever to do so with thesis 2. 3. Let's turn now to "sensuous consciousness." Marx insists that our cur- rent sensuous consciousness does not accurately tell us the essential features of human beings. Indeed, these features are currently "incomprehensible," he says, because they are at odds with "everything tangible in practical life" (OpM 545/304). But under communism, what is tangible in practical life would change; that is, one's sensuous consciousness would change. It would be different because one's life would be different. And then one's senses would become the accurate organs of philosophy-they would then accu- rately tell us what is essential to being human, which would include, presum- ably, registering the truth of theses 1 and 2. Now I have noted that an agent could accept Marx's claims about the good life prior to communism (although her experience under capitalism could not provide sufficient reason to do so). Suppose she were somehow to change to a communist sensuous consciousness. Would that enable her to "see" the truth of Marx's claims, here and now? And could she change to a communist sen- suous consciousness here and now?</page><page sequence="20">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 383 Let's start with the second question. The orthodox Marxist says, no: first institutional change, then change of consciousness. Here, the orthodox Marxist relies on a metaphysical theory that is distinct from the views of the 1844 Marx. But one can see why that Marx might agree. The 1844 Marx's sensuous consciousness is quite similar to Burckhardt's "relationship to sen- suous . . . things." This represents a pervasive orientation, a fundamental stance to the world. And that does not seem easily altered. Altering it would seem to involve a deep transformation in how one lives. One might think that if agents' lives under communism are very different from their lives under capitalism, it would be impossible to have a communist sensuous conscious- ness in a capitalist society. One would need to live a different form of life-which would require living in a society with a different form of life. On the other hand, in many ways the 1844 Marx's communism will not be so different from capitalism. There won't be differences in basic scientific beliefs (e.g., communist physics won't be different from capitalist) or, indeed, in many other beliefs about the world, and technological arrange- ments will presumably be quite similar. Along many axes, the change from capitalism to communism will be considerably more modest than earlier world-historical changes. Feuerbach claims that the change from the pagan to the Christian world involved changes in cosmologies and in the explana- tions of events in the material world and that the change from the Christian to the modem world involved similar changes. The change from capitalism to communism will involve none of this. So, although it might be puzzling just how one would go about doing so, it is not clear that one couldn't, here and now, adopt a communist sensuous consciousness. Let's assume that one could. That brings us back to the first question. Would one have sufficient reason to believe that one was thereby changing to a correct sensuous consciousness, sufficient reason to believe that what one would "see" (e.g., about the good life) would be the truth? I think not, at least according to the 1844 Marx. Here we should note a cen- tral difference, for him, between a capitalist and a communist sensuous con- sciousness. Under capitalism, Marx thinks, one relates to the material world-one relates to nature-as merely an object from which need satisfac- tion can be extracted: the human relation to sensuous things is, in practice, purely manipulative and instrumental, purely a question of use (OpM 540/300). Under communism, however, although the agent would continue to transform nature to provide for human needs, she would relate to nature very differently. She would not see it as something external to and distinct from herself, something that is a source of "mere utility" (OpM 540/300); rather, she would see herself as part of it, as integrated into it (OpM 537-38/298). Although she would relate to objects as things that had been (or</page><page sequence="21">384 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 might come to be) transformed by human labor for human use, she would simultaneously value objects, would acknowledge and prize-as it were, aesthetically-their various properties, their "specific nature" (OpM 542/302). One's senses, Marx says, would "relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing" (OpM 540/300). Marx's-fairly opaque-thought is that the human use of the world would involve a harmonious rather than a purely instrumental relation. And so one's communist (harmonious) sensu- ous consciousness would be quite different from a capitalist (instrumental) 27 sensuous consciousness. Suppose now that the agent somehow changed her sensuous conscious- ness while remaining under capitalism. Her sensuous consciousness would then be at odds with her society's. She would be oriented to the world differ- ently from her fellows. Moreover, Marx emphasizes that a communist sensu- ous consciousness would be at odds with the demands of agents' current practical lives (see OpM 544-546/304-306). It would thus be at odds (1) with the way that agents in general relate to the world and (2) with the way that agents seem to have to relate to the world, given the demands of job finding and job keeping (as well, no doubt, of continuous profit seeking)-the perva- sive and unyielding instrumental imperatives of a capitalist economy. In a capitalist economy, Marx thinks, one has no choice (the vast majority of peo- ple, anyway, have no choice) but to relate to the world instrumentally. So the agent's changed sensuous consciousness would seem abnormal because it would be abnormal, both statistically and in the sense of being inappropriate to the demands of her practical life. Of course, the agent could nevertheless believe that her changed con- sciousness, despite its difference from others', is correct, that hers is right and everyone else's is wrong. Would Marx believe she should simply trust her own highly nonstandard sensuous consciousness? I don't think so. With respect to particular deliverances of the senses, Feuerbach insists that agents must corroborate one another's perceptions. "That which I alone perceive I doubt; only that which the other also perceives is certain" (G ?42, 324/59). Marx does not directly address the issue, but his 1844 praise of all things Feuerbachian makes agreement very likely (and some evidence of agreement is at OpM 570/328).28 I think both Feuerbach and Marx would say that others must corroborate the agent's sensuous consciousness. But if the agent changed that consciousness, others couldn't corroborate it, for theirs would be different. So, for Marx, the agent would have no reason to think her change was an epistemic improvement; on the contrary, she would have reason to think it wasn't. In a communist society, one would trust the deliverances of one's commu- nist sensuous consciousness, for those deliverances would be in tune with</page><page sequence="22">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 385 one's practical life and would be corroborated by others; not so for a commu- nist sensuous consciousness in a capitalist society. But then, on Marx's account, one would have no reason to trust the deliverances of such a con- sciousness in a capitalist society. Even if one could somehow change one's sensuous consciousness here and now, that would not provide a justification that Marx could endorse. For the 1844 Marx, the difficulty about moving, under capitalism, from capitalist beliefs and consciousness to communist beliefs and consciousness is not metaphysical. The 1844 Marx is not committed to the thesis that, as a conceptual matter, beliefs and sensuous consciousness cannot change prior to social revolution. It seems clear that one's relevant beliefs could change, and although it would surely be difficult to bring about, perhaps one's sensu- ousness consciousness could as well. In this and the previous subsection, however, I have argued that according to the 1844 texts, such belief change could not stem from, and such consciousness change could not provide, the 1844 Marx's desired kind of justification for theses 1 and 2.29 4. For Marx himself, then, agents' practical lives under capitalism (their experience of necessary labor and their sensuous consciousness) cannot jus- tify his claims about the good life. And if, then, as Marx desires, we keep only to what we register in our practical lives, there is, here and now, insufficient reason to accept theses 1 and 2. And so, on Marx's own premises, we reach thesis 4a. Presumably, there is also insufficient reason to accept thesis 3-our practical lives give us no reason to accept that a standpoint we do not now occupy and that would deliver beliefs at odds with current beliefs is the cor- rect route to knowledge of the good life. And so we also reach thesis 4b. The justificatory pinch stems from Marx's Feuerbachian insistence that agents' practical lives are the route to the truth (in effect, a privileging of the widely shared and pragmatically appropriate beliefs of daily life) com- bined with the various shortcomings, in this respect, of present practical life (see sections 3.2 and 3.3 above). But why put such a premium on practical life? Isn't there another way to justify theses about the good life? The most obvious-the traditional-way would be through philosophical argument. Philosophers have often ignored the content of practical life and gone on to argue for accounts of the good life quite out of keeping with ordinary beliefs (e.g., it consists in doing philosophy). Can't Marx take a similar route to defend theses 1 and 2? Or take thesis 3. Even if one is not in a communist society, couldn't one accept that the proper justification for claims about the good life comes via the practical lives of agents in such a society? And couldn't one have a plausi- ble hypothesis about the claims that would be justified in that way, say, the</page><page sequence="23">386 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 1844 Marx's hypothesis? Armed, then, with a standard of justification for claims about the good life and a plausible hypothesis about what that stan- dard would justify, one could accept theses 1 and 2. Of course, one would need a reason to accept that standard, but here, too, couldn't the philosopher come to one's aid? After all, philosophers have been known to adduce as the justificatory standard for claims about the good life what agents would regis- ter if they could only attain to some highly idealized and currently very rare or even nonexistent standpoint. Marx would reject any such philosophical assistance. Why? Qua philosopher, Hegel is Marx's explicit target. Here, his complaint is straightforward. Hegel gets human nature wrong. He fails to see human beings as essentially material beings, and, as a consequence, he sees agents' ordinary activity in the material world-necessary labor-as intrinsically problematic, not as problematic merely in its capitalist form. For Hegel, Marx says, necessary labor is inevitably a kind of alienation (OpM 572/331). Hegel thus fails to register the correct account of the good life. Still, other philosophers have other accounts. Why think that Marx's antipathy to philosophical theory is-like Feuerbach's-all encompassing?3" The reason is that Marx believes that appeal to abstract theory to answer certain types of questions is a symptom of life in a capitalist society. He thinks that such questions are asked as abstract questions only because their answers are not straightforwardly clear in the lives we lead-as they would be under communism. Consider, for instance, the question of the relation of our bodily, our sen- sory nature to our mental nature, what Marx calls the question of the "abstract enmity between sense and spirit [zwischen Sinn und Geist]." This is a ques- tion that is "necessary," Marx says, only "as long as the human sense for nature, the human sense of nature, and therefore also the natural sense of the human being [i.e., one's sensuous consciousness]" are not what they would be under communism (OpM 552/312). As long as agents are alienated both from their central activity in the material world (necessary labor) and the products of that activity (OpM 515/275), as well as, more generally, from "the sensuous external world" (OpM 515/275), that is, as long as we don't live in a communist society and so don't have a (mutually corroborated) com- munist sensuous consciousness, we will not have an adequate "sense" for the sense/spirit relation, and so it will be natural to ask a question-one that quickly mounts the ladder of abstraction-about that relation. Under com- munism, by contrast, agents would acknowledge that our lives involve an</page><page sequence="24">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 387 interweaving of sense and spirit in the process of the transformation of the material world, and for our communist sensuous consciousness that obvious fact about our lives would have a certain power: it would seem, Marx thinks, a sufficient solution to the question of the sense/spirit relation, would thor- oughly scratch the philosophical itch (for an analogous "solution" in Feuerbach, see section 1.6). And so there would no longer seem to be any "enmity between sense and spirit," and agents would no longer be motivated to ponder the abstract question of the sense/spirit relation. The claim is that philosophical questions are asked as abstract questions only because our current lives are problematic. Feuerbach invokes "the human being who is and knows himself to be the actual (not imaginary) abso- lute identity of all contraries and contradictions" (VT 259-60/168). Similarly, Marx affirms communism as "the genuine solution to the conflict between human being and nature and between human being and human being" (OpM 536/296), and he asserts that under communism, "subjectivity and objectiv- ity, spirituality and materiality, activity and passivity [would] lose their anti- thetical character, and thus their existence as such antitheses" (OpM 542/302). There would thus be no need for resolution of such antitheses via abstract theory. Feuerbach distinguishes between "a need of humanity" and "a philosophi- cal need" (NRP 215/145). The former points to questions that truly need to be answered, have a human importance, the latter to questions that arise only within the framework of academic debate. Feuerbach thinks that few (if any) standard philosophical questions express a need of humanity. Marx's claim is that they seem to do so only because of the distorted conditions of our lives. Alter the conditions, and the questions will no longer be asked. Like Feuerbach, Marx thus objects to a way of approaching certain questions-the retreat to the study-regardless of the philosophical "position" at issue. Under communism, the usual philosophical questions would not be unin- telligible. I don't think the 1844 Marx believes (and he need not and should not believe) that one couldn't speculate about such things as the sense/spirit relation. Rather, one wouldn't. One's perception of the interweaving of sense and spirit (of sensory and mental activity) in the process of the transformation of the material world would seem a sufficient solution. It would have a force that would forestall the question (just as Feuerbach thinks that if one feels the force of his analysis of Christianity, serious consideration of the possibility of miracles would be "precluded"). One would see no need of humanity to satisfy.</page><page sequence="25">388 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 * Here is where we have come to. We have seen that the 1844 Marx's pre- ferred form of justification for his view of the good life (for theses 1 and 2) is unavailable here and now and that the capitalist analogue-workers' practi- cal lives under capitalism-provides no reason to accept that view (perhaps should even make one doubt that view). Philosophical argument would be an obvious alternative mode of justification, but Marx rejects it. So Marx seems to have nowhere to turn to defend his view. In closing, I want to ask whether in fact Marx must really forswear philo- sophical defense of theses 1 and 2 (leaving thesis 3 for another day). That is, let's assume that the 1844 Marx is correct that philosophical thought about certain questions, including about the good life, is symptomatic of an alien- ated society. Assume that such questions would not be asked under commu- nism. Does that commit Marx to holding that, here and now, philosophy can- not provide good enough reasons to accept his conception of the good life? Granting that revelation-the immediate perceptions of the agent in the prac- tical life of a communist society-is the optimal route to believing theses 1 and 2, couldn't reason-philosophy-here and now be an acceptable alterna- tive? Feuerbach wants to generate the immediate and complete conviction that his claims are true; Marx, too, would like such conviction. But even if philosophical argument cannot provide this, must it be, for Marx, not merely suboptimal (failing, as Feuerbach puts it, to provide "satisfactory certainty"; WC 317/204) but actually wrongheaded? I will consider four claims as to why it would be a mistake to argue philo- sophically for the 1844 Marx's theses about the good life. No doubt these don't exhaust the grounds Marx might have for rejecting philosophy, but if these claims fail, there is at least some basis to think that he should reject his rejection. i. Engaging in philosophy makes one think (mistakenly) that that activity is central to the good life. ii. Philosophy is abstract thought. Abstract thought cannot provide good reasons to believe that the good life consists centrally in something nonabstract, namely, the transforma- tion of the material world. Therefore, philosophy cannot provide good reasons to believe that the good life consists centrally in something nonabstract, namely, the trans- formation of the material world. iii. Philosophy is abstract thought. To think abstractly is to stand back from practical life. That is not the correct way for human beings to relate to the world. Any claims arrived at through such a way of relating to the world must be false. iv. Agents currently engage in a particular activity, philosophy, only because they have an incorrect sensuous consciousness. Therefore, that activity, philosophy, cannot be a via- ble road to truth.</page><page sequence="26">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 389 All these claims are weak. Take (i). It is surely not generally true. Some people are captivated by philosophy, but others-most?-are not. Engaging in it convinces the latter that philosophy is not central to the good life. More- over, those who find philosophy appealing are presumably capable of accept- ing a cogent philosophical argument that shows philosophy not to be central to the good life. As for (ii), all one can do is to try, through philosophy, to provide good rea- sons to accept Marx's claims about the good life. Surely, one needn't assume from the start that all such attempts must go awry. As for (iii), Marx never rejects mathematics, but arcane mathematical inquiry involves standing back from practical life. So (iii) must be the claim that a specific form of abstract thought, philosophy, cannot arrive at truths and, in particular, at the truth that the good life is as Marx says. Assuming, now, that to arrive via abstract thought at the truth of proposition P is also to arrive via abstract thought at good reasons to believe P, then (iii) becomes the claim that philosophy cannot arrive at good reasons to believe that the good life is as Marx says. But that is, in effect, (ii), and once again the proper response would seem to be to try, through philosophy, to provide good rea- sons to accept Marx's claims. As for (iv), in some cases this kind of claim would have force. Suppose that the good life consists in the intellectual contemplation of the Christian god. I assume that to have this belief about the good life, one must believe in the Christian god's existence. Now suppose (a) that having incorrect sensu- ous consciousness S inevitably involves engaging in an activity, T, that, absent S, would not be engaged in, and (b) that engaging in T inevitably leads to atheism and so to some other-that is, to some false-belief about the good life. Agents with S would have false beliefs about the good life and would have them because of S. Let's assume-what is manifestly not true-that the analogue of (a) applies: with a capitalist sensuous consciousness, agents inevitably engage in a certain activity, namely, a certain form of abstract thought, philosophy, that otherwise would not be engaged in. However, the analogue of (b)-that engaging in that activity inevitably leads to a false belief about the good life-applies only if that form of abstract thought does inevitably lead to such a false belief. And here, yet again, the proper response would seem to be to try, through philosophy, to provide good reasons to accept Marx's claims. Philosophy, then, even if it is conceded to be inferior to the ideal justifica- tory method, has not been shown to be intrinsically suspect. And because here and now the ideal method is unavailable, it looks as if the 1844 Marx has reason to try to justify his claims about the good life through philosophy.</page><page sequence="27">390 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 NOTES 1.

Perhaps there are important cultural and historical differences in the ways that human beings relate to sensuous things. However, I am skeptical that for any given civilization (e.g., that of ancient Greece) one would find some single dominant way of relating to sensuous things. But that is a topic for another time. 8.

As an aid to the reader, let me briefly situate my interpretations of Feuerbach and the 1844 Marx. The usual reading of Feuerbach sees him as holding some variant of a common philosophical view (metaphysical materialism) and attempting to argue for it in more or less con- ventional (if not especially compelling) fashion. One finds this reading even in such fine recent commentators as Marx Wartofksy (Feuerbach [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1977]) and Eugene Kamenka (The Philosophy of Ludwig Feuerbach [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1970]) and certainly in older commentators such as Friedrich Lange (History of Material- ism and Criticism of Its Present Importance [London: Trubner, 1877-81]). Even writers who question Feuerbach's metaphysical materialism still cast him in the standard philosophical cate- gories, merely attributing to him a more complex combination of those categories (see, for instance, Simon Rawidowicz, Ludwig Feuerbach's Philosophie: Ursprung und Schicksal [Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1964], especially 146-50). By contrast, on my reading, Feuerbach is less concerned to affirm a metaphysical view than to "convert" his reader to a more concrete ori- entation to the world, as it were, to change his reader's life. As for Marx, many writers have pointed out his 1844 stress on human beings as producers (a few among the many are Hannah Arendt, The Human Condition [Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1958], Allen Wood, Karl Marx [London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1981], and Louis Dupre, Marx's Social Critique of Culture [New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1983]). What has been overlooked are (1) the 1844 Marx's conception of the proper relationship that human beings should have in the production/consumption process (but see David Archard, "The Marx- ist Ethic of Self-realization: Individuality and Community," in Moral Philosophy and Contem- porary Problems, ed. J.D.G. Evans [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987]) and (2) the role, for the 1844 Marx, that being in that relationship plays in providing evidence for the truth of his claims about how human beings realize their nature. Commentators have certainly noticed a general problem with the justification of Marx's nor- mative account: it seems to require that one take the standpoint of a true communist society, but</page><page sequence="29">392 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 the claim that "being determines consciousness" seems to make doing so impossible here and now, i.e., in a capitalist society (for a subtle variant of this problem, see Shlomo Avineri, The Social &amp; Political Thought ofKarl Marx [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1968], chap. 3; for a suggestive discussion, see R. N. Berki, Insight and Vision: The Problem of Communism in Marx's Thought [London: J. M. Dent, 1983]). What has not been noticed is the particular form that this problem takes in the work of 1844, the specific justificatory-not metaphysical--diffi- culty that the 1844 Marx has generated for himself. There is, for the 1844 Marx, (a) a particular activity and (b) a particular relationship among human beings that is properly tied to that activity, and together these are the way to get what Marx thinks is the right kind of evidence for his view of the good life. But under capitalism, the activity tends to be deeply distorted; indeed, one cannot engage in it in the right way, namely, with the right relationship to others-thus one cannot have access to the right kind of evidence. Moreover, under capitalism, one cannot rely on the deliverances of the kind of consciousness Marx wants, ideally, to privilege, even if one could find a way to attain it. And since, like Feuerbach, the 1844 Marx rejects appeal to philosophical justi- fication, he seems-by his own lights-to end up with no way to justify his claims. My stress on Marx's 1844 rejection of philosophy also points to a difference between my reading and Louis Althusser's. Althusser holds that Marx's "break" from philosophy comes after 1844 (see especially ForMarx [New York: Vintage, 1970]). On my reading, the "break" (if that is what one wants to call it) has already happened by 1844 (indeed, one can see it in 1843). Both Althusser and I agree that the 1844 Marx is heavily Feuerbachian, but a proper understanding of Feuerbach shows that the 1844 Marx's Feuerbachianism pushes him to do his level best to keep philosophy at a distance. Althusser's reading of Feuerbach is fundamentally mistaken and leads to an equally fundamental misreading of the 1844 Marx. For further discussion of the differences between Althusser's and my own reading of Marx, see my Marx's Attempt to Leave Philosophy (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998), 318-22. 13. 1 am thus attributing to Marx a self-realization account of the good life. Other commenta- tors who attribute such an account to Marx are Allen Wood, Karl Marx, and Jon Elster, Making Sense of Marx (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985). 14. Later, in Capital, Marx's view is different. There, he says that the good life is not to be found in necessary labor but, rather, "beyond the sphere of actual material production" (Kap III 828/820). 15. For the view that Marx is not primarily concerned with necessary labor, see George C. Brenkert, Marx's Ethics of Freedom (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1983), 90-92. 16. Thesis 1 already includes this requirement. It refers to transforming the material world in order "to sustain the existence of... other human beings." I bring in the requirement here because I want to stress that it is among the conditions for the producer/consumer relationship that Marx desires. Of course, as I noted in the initial statement of thesis 1, for the 1844 Marx there is also a second central dimension to agents' production under communism. Production is also the basic form of individual self-expression. Unfortunately, there is not space to go into this aspect of the 1844 Marx's view. 17. On the general question of Marx and the need for recognition from others, see John Plamenatz, Karl Marx's Philosophy of Man (Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 1975), 101-02. 18. For a discussion of what he calls "Marxian sociality," see Richard Schacht, Alienation (Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1970), 88-90. Schacht says of such sociality that it is "direct and personal." Despite the occasional sound of his 1844 texts, I think Marx's view should be con- strued in a less implausible way. In the "Comments" and the Manuscripts, Marx is clearly talking about fairly large-scale production and distribution, not about small, self-enclosed communities. Marxian "friendship" via economic relations should be seen as structural not personal.</page><page sequence="30">Brudney / CONCEPTION OF THE GOOD LIFE 393 19. Marx also stresses another feature of proper production relationships. Agents, he says, would be one another's "mediator" [Mittler] with the species (AM 462/228). Here, however, there is not space to explicate and assess this claim (although I do say a few words about it in note 24). For a discussion, see my Marx's Attempt to Leave Philosophy, chap. 5. 20. I have sketched Marx's 1844 ideal of communist relationships. For a sketch of a some- what different Marxian ideal (not derived from the 1844 texts), see G. A. Cohen, "Marxism and Contemporary Political Philosophy, or: Why Nozick Exercises some Marxists more than he does any Egalitarian Liberals," Canadian Journal of Philosophy 16 (Supp. 1990): 381-82. 21. Marx, himself, may have felt little need to justify his claims in his precommunist present for he believed that material conditions would soon drive the workers to revolt, and so commu- nism would soon arrive. But surely one could ask, prior to communism, for ajustification, and it would be good if Marx could offer one. 22. On the worker's attitude to his work under capitalism, see Plamenatz, Karl Marx's Phi- losophy of Man, 124-32. 23. This way of construing "completing" the other suggests that Marx is not talking solely about necessary labor. An agent's projects surely go beyond survival, although of course they also require the products that necessary labor provides. The passage in question (AM 462-63/227-28) is primarily focused on necessary labor, and in fact most (at least in Marx's time) of what producers would provide for consumers would be necessities. Still, the relationship at issue involves products that go beyond necessities. As in other places, here Marx has not entirely sorted out whether his concern is necessary or nonnecessary labor (or, perhaps, both). 24. Now in producing.for her, Marx thinks that the producer is also the "mediator" for the consumer with the species (see AM 462/228) and so is also completing the consumer in a differ- ent sense than the one discussed in the text. By producing for her, the producer makes the con- sumer aware that another human being (as it were, a representative of the human species) is help- ing to satisfy her needs, and so the producer makes the consumer aware of the fundamental tie that they have qua human beings: the consumer comes to feel the producer as a part of herself qua human being (AM 462/228). I take the idea to be that through recognizing that another human being has produced for her, she comes to see herself as deeply part of a larger group, the human species as a whole. Coming to see herself this way, as deeply identified with the species as a whole, is a crucial element in what it is for the consumer to have her nature, qua human being, be realized, and so, one might say, to have her nature be "completed." Of course, this requires- what is not the case under capitalism-that the consumer have reason to think the producer is producing.for her. 25. For consumers to confirm producers, producers must believe that consumers believe that the transformation of the material world is the way that human beings realize their nature. For producers to complete consumers, must consumers believe that producers believe that the trans- formation of the material world is the way that human beings realize their nature? I don't think so. In talking of A completing B, Marx seems focused on the idea that A is deliberately doing something for B (and B believes this) rather than on the idea that A has certain beliefs about his own activity (and B believes that). On the other hand, in a communist society, consumers would presumably have correct beliefs about the production process, and so they would in fact (cor- rectly) believe that producers believe that the transformation of the material world is the way that human beings realize their nature. 26. I am taking for granted that the 1844 Marx would not regard as proper evidence for his claims the experience of producers or consumers who mistakenly or irrationally believe that they are in what he would consider the right kind of relationship with others. 27. It is not clear to me that the desired communist consciousness is actually less "instrumen- tal" than a capitalist consciousness. That one appreciates the aesthetic properties of the material</page><page sequence="31">394 POLITICAL THEORY / June 2001 objects one uses is, I suppose, a good thing, but I don't see how it makes one's relation to those objects any less instrumental. 28. There, Marx praises Feuerbach for taking as the basic principle for "true materialism" and "real science," what Marx calls "the social relationship of 'human being to human being.' " 29. One might wonder whether Marx's justificatory problem would, ironically enough, be less severe (or might even disappear) from the standpoint of a nonworker, from the standpoint of a capitalist or other person not engaged in necessary labor. In fact, the problem would remain. To begin with, it is hard to see how the experiences of those not engaged in necessary labor could show that necessary labor is central to the good life. Moreover, although nonworkers might tend to find their jobs more satisfying than do workers, no more than an individual worker can an indi- vidual nonworker have control over the beliefs of the mass of consumers and producers; nor can she control others' sensuous consciousness. The problem I diagnose in section 3.2 stems from the failure of the mass of producers and consumers (under capitalism) to have the proper beliefs and aims when producing and consuming. The problem I diagnose in section 3.3 concerns the absence (under capitalism) of a communist sensuous consciousness on the part of other people and so their inability to corroborate as true the deliverances of one's own communist sensuous consciousness (assuming one were to have such a sensuous consciousness). These problems are independent of where one fits in the class hierarchy. 30. 1 am not, of course, attributing to the 1844 Marx a rejection of all theory. Clearly, he wants to develop a theoretical account of society (including a social psychology). I am denying only that he wants to develop a philosophical theory, the sort of thing one finds in Hegel's Phenomen- ology or Locke's Essay.
