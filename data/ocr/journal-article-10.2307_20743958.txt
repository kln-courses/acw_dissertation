ROLETT Keywords: archaeology; monumental architecture; religious sites; Marquesas Islands Abstract Structurally similar but functionally different religious and residential monumental architecture sites pose a central problem in archaeologically-based investigations of Marquesan chiefdoms. This paper examines the problem by identifying and discussing cultural and environmental traits useful for distinguishing among Marquesan religious and residential sites. The problem is further explored through a case study from Vaitahu Valley on Tahuata in the southern Marquesas. The case study site, Mataie'e, embodies certain distinguishing characteristics of religious sites within a unique layout that defies attempts at simple classification. A single radiocarbon date from limited excavations dates construction of the site to either shortly before the arrival of Captain Cook in 1775 or more likely to the early to mid-nineteenth century historic era. Early historic era chiefdoms of the Marquesas Islands were marked by a blurred boundary between the sacred and secular elements of society (Thomas 1990). In contrast to more typical Polynesian chiefdoms such as those of the Society Islands, achieved status was comparatively important in the Marquesas while the role of ascribed status based on genealogy was of diminished significance. By the time of European contact, Marquesan chiefs (haka'iki) had lost the right to claim "first fruits", a share of each harvest that in most Polynesian chiefdoms was a hereditary privilege and a major source of power. Spiritual priests (taua) and warriors (tod) gained status, apparently at the expense of chiefs, but their prestige and power was largely achieved rather than ascribed. Thomas (1990) uses the ethnohistoric literature to describe in detail the social aspects of competition among chiefs, priests, and warriors. However, efforts to understand this dialectic from an archaeological perspective are still in the early stages, with perhaps the most notable study to date on this subject being that by Kirch (1991). A potentially rewarding archaeologically-based approach for investigating competition among chiefs and other individuals vying for power is to examine aspects of Marquesan monumental architecture. This is because most residential, as well as religious sites consisted of structures placed on raised stone platforms (paepae). At the time of European contact it was clear that the overall size of the paepae, as well as the size of the individual boulders used in the main retaining wall were viewed as a reflection of social Status. In some cases, especially in the northern Marquesas, quarried slabs of red or yellow volcanic tuff (ke'etu) were added as an embellishment, usually as facing stones separating the back of the platform from the front. This embellishment, like the use of large boulders in the main retaining wall, was also associated with high social status. Thus a quantitative and qualitative comparison of paepae within the territory of a specific chiefdom should be revealing in terms of the perceived social status of its high ranking leaders. Yet since individual leaders actively competed for power, differences in the monumentality and embellishment of paepae structures likely reflect social competition as well as actual status. There is one primary obstacle that hinders implemen tation of this archaeologically-based approach for investigating social relations and competition among the leaders of Marquesan chiefdoms. The problem is how to distinguish residential paepae of the secular leaders (e.g. haka'iki and tod) from structures linked with religious sites, especially meae, which were the realm of the tau'a. In most of central east Polynesia, the principal religious sites consist of walled enclosures and a stepped altar (ahu). Such sites are typified by the marae complexes of the Society Islands (Emory 1933, Sinoto 1996). Marquesan religious architec ture is the exception to this general pattern. In the Marquesas, raised stone platforms of the principal religious sites (meae) are often structurally similar to residential paepae (e.g. Linton 1925). The problem for archaeologists, therefore, is how to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different meae and paepae platforms. Most of the paepae in residential complexes are paepae hiamoe, a term for which the literal meaning is a paepae for sleeping. Paepae hiamoe are usually rectangular and distinguished by a paved veranda, behind which there is an unpaved sleeping area that was enclosed within the house built on the stone platform. Figure 1 illustrates both a paepae hiamoe and another paepae (square and without a sleeping area) which likely did not support a house structure and which is of unknown function. Paepae hiamoe are also associated with tohua koina, tribal centers for assembly and public festivities highlighted by dancing, singing, and feasting. Tohua koina generally consist of a large, rectangular courtyard surrounded on all sides by terraces and stone platforms, including paepae hiamoe. Although they were not permanent residential sites, tohua koina housed large groups during the public Department of Anthropology, University of Hawaii rolett@hawaii .edu 94</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1. Two paepae associated with the Paeoa architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands. Rectangular structure at right is a paepae hiamoe (note unpaved sleeping area). Square structure at left is a paepae which likely did not support a house structure (photo by B. Rolett). festivities. And while they were not religious sites (which were tapu to most of the population), they are often associated with meae. Construction of the tohua was a massive public works effort organized by the chief. Tohua koina may be defined as ceremonial, to distinguish them from religious and residential sites. Thus ceremonial tohua koina are structurally distinct and readily identifiable, so that the difficulty for archaeologists lies in distinguishing among religious and residential sites. This is a pervasive problem in the study of Marquesan monumental architecture, one that has been addressed by scholars including Bell wood (1972), Chavaillon and Olivier (2007), Kellum-Ottino (1971), Linton (1925), Millerstrom (2005,2006), Otttino (1990,2005), and Suggs (1961). Until now, however, there has been no explicit attempt to synthesize information relating to this problem in the existing literature. This paper represents a first attempt, and one of my goals is to identify cultural and environmental traits that are useful for distinguishing among Marquesan religious and residential sites. My discussion of these traits is followed by a specific case study from Vaitahu Valley on Tahuata in the southern Marquesas. The case study site, Mataie'e, was selected because it is a fascinating example of an atypical religious complex which embodies certain distinguishing characteristics of meae within a unique layout that also differs in important respects from most other documented religious sites. Distinguishing traits of Marquesan religious and residential sites Because of the difficulty in distinguishing among structurally similar but functionally distinct monumental sites, archaeologists beginning with Linton (1925), as well as earlier scholars including von den Steinen (1928) and Tautain (1897), have relied heavily on local informants for the identification of meae and other religious sites. By far the greatest number of sites identified are meae, which are not only more numerous but also of greater cultural significance than other religious sites, of which fishermen's shrines (Millerstrom 2005), or mahia avaia, are also notable in terms of their frequency. Meae were the most tapu locations on the Marquesan landscape, making them strictly off limits to the vast majority of the population and frequented only by the tau a and their assistants (Thomas 1990). The sensitive nature of the tapu is undoubtedly the main reason that information identifying meae has been transmitted through oral traditions even to the present. For example, one of my most reliable guides on Tahuata firmly believed that a massive, accidental fire in the mid-1990s on land where one of his family's meae is located was directly connected to the untimely death of his grandfather some months later. Ritual activities conducted at meae included funerary rites involving human sacrifices, divination, and communication with the ancestral deities (Rolett 1986, Thomas 1990). Some meae also served as residential areas 95</page><page sequence="3">for the tau'a, but this was not always the case. Interestingly, the overall monumentality of a site, as judged by criteria such as the height of retaining walls and the size of boulders used in construction, is not a reliable predictor of site function. Meae, like residential paepae hiamoe, vary greatly in the amount of labour invested, and some of the most important meae consist of a modest series of terraces without anything that could be considered monumental in scale. Based on observations of meae securely identified though oral traditions, a number of cultural and environ mental traits stand out because of their association with religious sites (Table 1). First, perhaps because they were tapu to most of the population, meae are often situated in isolated locations far from the centre of residential life, in places where habitation sites are indeed scarce or absent.

Main sources: Chavaillon and Olivier 2007; Linton 1925; Millerstrom 2005,2006; Millerstrom and Edwards 1998; Otttino 2005; Ottino-Garanger 2006; Rolett 1986 and personal observations from 1981-2008; Suggs 1961; von den Steinen 1928. Religious sites are defined as places of ritual activity that were tapu to most of the population. Residential sites are defined as general habitation areas, including sites that were tapu to various segments of the population based on gender or social status. Residential sites are universally associated with paepae hiamoe, raised stone platforms with sleeping areas. However, religious sites and ceremonial sites (tohua koina) are also often associated with paepae hiamoe, so that platforms with sleeping areas are not necessarily diagnostic of residential sites. Non-diagnostic: Overall size of structure, walls, boulders; adze-grinding stones. However, there are many exceptions to this general trend and some meae lie in the midst of densely populated residential areas. The most diagnostic marker for identifying meae is the presence of a banyan tree. In many cases, banyans have been planted directly on one of the stone structures of a meae complex. A typical example is the banyan growing on the retaining wall of meae Te I'i Poka on Nuku Hiva (see photographs in Rolett 1986:82-83). During his extensive survey of Marquesan monumental architecture in 1920-1921, Linton observed "Banyans appear on nearly all meae and their position and alignment prove that many of them of have been planted" (Linton 1925:34). Some of the banyans are so large that their distinctive canopies can be seen from far away, such as from a high ridge or from offshore. Marquesans consider it tapu to cut banyans or other trees growing within the grounds of a meae, or to burn vegetation in such an area (Linton 1925:34; Suggs 1961:69). This prohibition is still observed in Vaitahu Valley. Banyan trees associated with mortuary meae contained human skeletal remains placed within the thick tangle of aerial roots close to the trunk. Skeletal remains in the trees, still quite common in the 1920s (Linton 1925), have now disappeared through exposure to the elements but skulls and long bones placed in the walls or rubble fill of meae paepae are still present. More rarely, human skeletal remains are also associated with paepae hiamoe in residential sites. Some of these residential area secondary burials contain artefacts dating them to the historic era (e.g. Suggs 1961:51). Because many of the paepae hiamoe were abandoned during this time, as Marquesans suffered enormous mortality due to introduced diseases, it is possible that these burials date to after the sites had ceased to function as residential areas. Square or rectangular veranda pits (pakeho) built into stone platforms are associated with both meae and residential paepae hiamoe. Surveys by Linton (1925:35) and Chavaillon and Olivier (2007) suggest the pits are more common among Hiva Oa meae than among those recorded on Nuku Hiva. Veranda pits are extremely rare on Tahuata and Fatuiva. Linton refers to certain veranda pits on Hiva Oa as skull pits, observing that they are usually on paepae that did not support house structures and that they served as "repositories for the skulls of the tribe" (1925:38-39). Other veranda pits likely were used for the disposal of tapu objects (Linton 1925:35). These pits are associated with both meae and residential paepae hiamoe, especially on Nuku Hiva. Linton writes: The most interesting feature of the meae on Nuku Hiva is the close resemblance which they bear to the ordinary habitations of that island. Even the sacrifice pit is paralleled by the pits which are found in the platforms of dwellings of the better sort (1925:35). Suggs (1961:48-53) excavated two square veranda pits associated with an early historic period high status residential area on Nuku Hiva. One pit contained a human burial in primary context, underlain by evidence suggesting earlier use of the feature for cooking. The second pit 96</page><page sequence="4">contained human skulls and long bones representing secondary burials. Suggs (1961:53) suggests that the burials coincide with or post-date abandonment of the paepae hiamoe as residential structures. Ottino (2005:129-132) excavated another, somewhat larger (1.6 x 1.6 m) veranda pit dug into the paved terrace of tohua koina Te Fi Poka, also on Nuku Hiva. In this case, the pit was built after construction of the terrace, by removing pavement stones, digging the pit, and then using various pavement stones to line the interior walls. There is a large banyan (in which human bones were noted) growing on the tohua koina and this same complex is near one of the most important meae in the valley. Excavation of the pit revealed fifteen human skulls, numerous turtle bones, and smaller numbers of pig, dog, and fish remains. Ottino (2005:131) suggests the skulls represent historic era secondary burials dating to after the site had ceased to serve as a ceremonial site. An alternative explanation, consistent with the presence of a large banyan, is that the pit is part of a meae directly associated with the tohua koina, and the bone assemblages, including the skulls, are remains of sacrificial offerings connected with ritual activities at the site. It is worth noting that the square veranda pits are structurally and functionally different from another category of pits used for the underground storage of fermented breadfruit paste (ma). The latter, termed ua ma, are circular pits usually dug directly into the red lateritic clay substrate typical of most Marquesan landscapes (Linton 1925:102 103). They vary widely in the steepness of the walls and in overall size but are nearly always located on small ridges or slopes. The choice of location was obviously related to drainage patterns, as ma must be kept dry and flooding of the pit would ruin its contents. Some ua ma are found on paepae but apparently always in the context of a residential area (von den Steinen 1928:37, photograph). Anthropomorphic representations (tiki) are a highly diagnostic marker of meae. Tiki, carved from a single tree trunk or block of stone, mainly represented deified haka'iki and taua (Tautain 1897:673, 677). Wooden tiki were once common features of mortuary meae, especially on Nuku Hiva (Stewart 1831:290; Tautain 1897), but these have now long since disappeared from the sites themselves and today can be seen only in museums. There are around ninety-five documented stone tiki remaining in the Marquesas (Linton 1925, Millerstrom 2006, Millerstrom and Edwards 1998, Suggs 1961, von den Steinen 1928). The majority of these are on Hiva Oa and Nuku Hiva and they are almost without exception associated with meae. Petroglyphs are widespread in the Marquesas, occurring in both religious and residential contexts (Millerstrom 2006). The association between turtle motifs and religious sites, especially meae is well documented (Millerstrom 2005, Rolett 1986). The cultural context of other motifs suggests a pattern linking petroglyphs to high-status residential sites (Millerstrom 2006). Quarried slabs of red or yellow volcanic tuff (ke'etu) are widely associated with both religious and residential sites. The transport costs for ke'etu slabs represent a considerable investment, making them indicative of wealth and high status, but they have little diagnostic value in distinguishing religious from residential sites. Similarly, ke'etu slabs embellished with bas-relief carvings of tiki also have little diagnostic value. Far more significant are stone uprights, which are rare in Marquesan contexts. When they are found, however, they are closely associated with meae and mahia avaia sites, as well as some tohua koina, but apparently not general habitation residential areas (e.g. Millerstrom 2005, Suggs 1961:62-63). Both vesicular basalt and columnar basalt uprights are present. The distinction between rock types may be meaningful judging by Handy 's (1923:351) observation that the Marquesan term keho refers to a "basalt column planted in the ground to serve as a backrest". Such uprights have a well documented association with Society Islands religious sites. According to Oliver (1974:100), Society Islands stone uprights including basalt columns likely served as backrests for priests or other high-ranking individuals, and also as the resting places for visiting spirits, especially those of deceased chiefs. Stone uprights are also diagnostic because, although scarce in the Marquesas, they are characteristic of early East Polynesian religious sites (Green 2000:88-89), as well as religious sites throughout much of the Tuamotus (Emory 1934). Large columnar basalt uprights (up to 2 m or more in length) were an important element of many Society Islands marae (Emory 1934, Oliver 1974:100). In his insightful comparative analysis of East Polynesian religious structures, Green notes a change through time in the frequency of stone uprights, involving: ... a loss of, or a high degree of loss of stone uprights, not only in Leeward Island marae of the Society Islands, but also throughout the islands of the Marquesic sub-group of languages (Marquesan, Mangarevan, Hawaiian). Thus stone uprights are infrequent or entirely lacking on most later monumental religious structures of that region in later periods (2000:90). Backrest stones differ from stone uprights in that they are usually set at an angle and built into a paepae or terrace wall, rather than freestanding. These are also scarce in the Marquesas, generally associated with tohua koina and meae, but not residential sites. The Mataie'e case study: Interpreting sacred and secular elements of a Marquesan religious site Mataie'e, an architecturally unique religious complex in the southern Marquesas, is ideal as a case study in the interpretation of Marquesan monumental architecture. Mataie'e is located in Vaitahu Valley on Tahuata. The site was mapped and excavated in 1996 and 1997 by an Andover Foundation for Archaeological Research/University of Hawaii project conducted in collaboration with the local community of Tahuata. Mataie'e is one of a group of major architectural complexes located in the interior of Vaitahu Valley. This archaeological landscape is nearly untouched by modern development, since the interior of the valley has been uninhabited for the past 100-150 years. We investigated all of the sites within a study area that follows 97</page><page sequence="5">the main river over a distance of about 260 metres, and which includes the narrow valley floor and lower reaches of the steep slopes rising toward the north and south ridges. Most of the work consisted of survey and mapping, with excavations to date the principal architectural complexes while also revealing information about construction techniques and activities associated with use of the structures. The Mataie'e site is situated on a series of three terraces cut into the south slope rising above the channel of the main river (Figs. 2,3). The main terrace (Tl) (Fig. 2) is 22 metres long and 8-9 metres wide. It is supported by a massive, stepped retaining wall (Rl) and the fill consists mainly of earth cut from the slope above it. The lower step (RIA) averages about 1.5 m high; the second step (RIB) is somewhat toller, around 1.8 m high. The wall construction is quite rough, with boulders piled in such a way as to take advantage of naturally occurring rocks and protruding outcrops. The northern sector of terrace Tl is supported by rubble fill. This forms the base for two low platforms (PI and P2) on a roughly paved area retained by a one meter Figure 2. Site map of the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands. 98</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3. Reconstruction view of the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands (drawing by R. Rhodes and J. Nakama). high wall along the northern limit of the site. The entire northern sector is slightly elevated above the rest of the main terrace, which is an open space except for a low enclosure (El) at the north end. A boulder for polishing adzes, with deeply worked faces and grooves, lies within this enclosure (Fig. 4). The south end of the main terrace opens to a gentle slope lying outside the terraced area, providing convenient access to the site. A low walled enclosure (E2) in the southeast corner of the main terrace was built recently using pavement stones and other rocks taken from the central terrace (T2) located adjacent to and above it. The central terrace is in many ways the focal point of the site and the surrounding landscape. In contrast to the main terrace, which was built mainly with earthen fill, the central terrace is entirely filled with rubble. The lower retaining wall (R2) is well constructed with closely fitted boulders of vesicular basalt. The quality of construction is reflected by the near perfect preservation of this wall, which is about 1.5 m high on average, reaching a maximum height of 1.9 m. About thirty percent of the rocks in the retaining wall facade have a maximum dimension greater than 75 cm, and forty percent are in the 50-75 cm size range, while the remaining thirty percent consist of smaller stones. Figure 4. Adze grinding stone associated with the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands (photo by B. Rolett). 99</page><page sequence="7">Figure 5. Stone pit built into rubble-filled terrace of the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands (photo by B. Rolett). A rectangular veranda pit built into the second terrace is the most visually impressive architectural element of this site (Fig. 5). The pit opening measures 3.6 m by 2.4 m and it is 2 m deep. A striking characteristic of the pit is that the rubble-filled terrace was built around it. In other words, the closely fitted stones lining the interior of the pit were placed level by level as the terrace was built from the ground up. Thus the pit was designed and engineered as an integral feature of the terrace which is 22 m long and 3.75 m wide, containing around 125 m3 of rubble-fill. The entire surface of the central terrace is paved, although much of the pavement has been disturbed. At the north end there is a small raised platform (P3), the surface of which is about 50 cm above the terrace. The carefully aligned stones forming the walls of this feature consist mainly of vesicular basalt but also include an alignment of three rectangular Figure 6. Stone upright of columnar basalt associated with the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands. Slabs of red keetu in background (photo by B. Rolett). slabs of red ke'etu. Although the ke'etu is notable, more significant is a stone upright of columnar basalt (Fig. 6) firmly planted in the terrace adjacent to platform P3. Only the base of this stone upright remains intact. Its fire-altered discoloration, as well as the presence of fragments of prismatic basalt scattered on the disturbed terrace pavement, suggest the column shattered in the heat of an intense fire. In addition to platform P3, there are two poorly constructed rubble-filled mounds (Ml and M2) on the central terrace. The walls supporting these mounds include six ke'etu slabs and two adze-grinding stones. The adze grinding stones were obviously removed from their original setting because both are now standing on edge so that the polishing surfaces cannot be used. The ke'etu slabs in these walls were also apparently removed from their original context. Both of the mounds may be recent burial features, but this is undetermined and no skeletal remains were observed. We opened a 2 m by 3 m excavation pit with the primary goal of obtaining chronological and stratigraphic data. The excavation was positioned on the main terrace abutting the lower retaining wall of the rubble-fill terrace (Fig. 7). The stratigraphy reveals a single cultural deposit (40-60 cm deep) consisting of dark brown loamy sediment rich in charcoal, underlain by a sterile layer of red clay. Several undisturbed pavement stones were exposed near the ground surface at the base of the wall. The largest of these pavement stones, all of which were clearly in situ, measures 60 cm by 60 cm. A large slab of red ke'etu was also on the ground surface but it was obviously not in its original context. After removing the pavement stones we found an adze-grinding stone, apparently in situ and measuring 120 cm by 70 cm, with a thickness of 30 cm. The top surface of the grinding stone was 5 cm below the base of the largest pavement stone. Because the base of the pavement stones corresponds with the base of the largest boulder in retaining wall R2, the adze-grinding stone predates construction of the wall and the central terrace. An isolated chunk of charcoal (with a maximum dimension of 4 cm) collected from the base of the adze-grinding stone was submitted to Beta Analytic for radiocarbon analysis. The sample (Beta 105312) yielded a dating result of 120 +/- 40 BP with a 95.4% probability age range of 275 - 9 cal BP (OxCal v4.1.3). This dates construction of retaining wall R2 and the associated central terrace and pit to either shortly before the arrival of Captain Cook in 1775 or more likely the early to mid-nineteenth century historic era. The excavation yielded very few artefacts, none of which are chronologically diagnostic. It is worth noting, however, that although no glass, iron, or other trade goods were recovered, we found eight basalt adze flakes and adze fragments, together with a single poi pounder fragment during the excavation. Five more adze fragments and another poi pounder fragment were collected from the surface of the site during mapping. As shown in our reconstruction view (Fig. 2), there are no paepae hiamoe in the Mataie'e architectural complex. This interpretation is based on the absence of the typical paepae hiamoe layout, characterized by a rectangular paved terrace 100</page><page sequence="8">Figure 7. View of excavation area situated at base of retaining wall R2 of the Mataie'e architectural complex, Vaitahu Valley, Tahuata, Marquesas Islands (photo by B. Rolett). in front of the house combined with an adjacent unpaved sleeping area behind it. Thus Mataie'e is clearly not a residential site. We can also be quite confident that the site is not a ceremonial tohua koina. There are two nearby tohua koina in Vaitahu Valley and both display the usual layout of a an assembly plaza bounded by seating areas and paepae hiamoe. Two elements, the stone pit and the columnar basalt upright, highlight the religious significance of the Mataie'e complex. While stone pits are not uncommon among large, well-constructed platforms in the northern Marquesas and on Hiva Oa, the Mataie'e pit is the only one known in Vaitahu and one of only a very small number observed on Tahuata. Moreover, while monumental architecture on Tahuata rarely matches the scale of that found on Nuku Hiva and Hiva Oa, the area (8.6 m2) and volume (17.2 m3) of the Mataie'e pit are larger than that of any comparable feature on these other islands. The columnar basalt upright is also highly unusual for Tahuata; only one other comparable stone is known. In summary, three findings show that Mataie'e is best interpreted in the context of a religious site: 1) the stone pit, which was likely for the disposal of tapu objects, 2) the columnar basalt upright, which likely served as a backrest for priests or as the resting places for visiting spirits, and 3) the absence of paepae hiamoe. Conclusions The interpretation of Mataie'e as a religious complex raises a number of questions that bring us back to the criteria for distinguishing among religious and residential sites. First, how to explain the absence of a banyan, perhaps the most useful trait for identifying meae! And the fact that neither the landowners nor others in the Vaitahu community identify Mataie'e as a meae! Two definite meae, both with banyans and both identified as dangerously tapu by the landowners, are located close to Mataie'e, within our Vaitahu study area. One site had human skeletal remains in the banyan tree within recent memory, and the second has four tiki. Mataie'e differs from these nearby meae not only in the absence of a banyan but also in the presence of the pit and columnar basalt upright, as well as the open space resembling an assembly area on the main terrace. In this sense, despite the convincing evidence for a religious context, Mataie'e is too different from these other sites to be classified as a meae. Indeed, Mataie'e's superior level of architectural engineering, as witnessed by the twenty-two metre long central terrace built from the ground up around an extraordinary veranda pit, and the site's other unique features defy any attempt at simple classification. Rather, Mataie'e seems to embody the conflict and tension of social competition during the late prehistoric and early historic eras, with fluid, blurred boundaries between the sacred and secular.
