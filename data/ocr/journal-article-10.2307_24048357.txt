Behind the croup of the bull are two partially preserved legs, presumably those of an acrobat who has jumped off the bull's back. In the lower register there are two human figures. While the hunting scene on the base depicting mountain goats pur sued by a dog closely resembles scenes on late Assyrian seals/ the representation of a Bactrian camel, popular in Bactria and Margiana, is com pletely foreign to Mesopotamian art. If Togolok 21 was a temple connected with cultic libations and a fire cult, we can assume a connection with the milieu from which Zoro astrianism might have sprung. However, these elements, so important in Zoroastrianism, do not permit us to view this structure as a true Zoro astrian temple, for nowhere in the Avesta is there a mention of temples. The observance of cultic rituals in temples seems to have been a feature of the religious life of the inhabitants of both Margiana and Bactria, who were largely related and shared a similar culture and religious beliefs. Thus at the site of Dashly-3, in southern Bactria, one of the monumental structures was clearly a fire temple. This is a circular building whose nine-towered central portion contains rooms with podium-platforms, of which room 2 repeats in its details the "prayer houses" 8 and 36 of Togolok 21. Also in the center of Dashly-3 there was a special hearth raised on a brick platform in which remains of ashes were found, pointing to its func tion as a fire altar. One might also note the sup posed temple connected with a fire cult that has been excavated in northern Bactria at Djarkutan. It appears that the Indo-Iranian peoples who lived in Bactria and Margiana before the time of Zoroaster built temples which differed in their layouts and consequently in ritual practices. In Zoroastrianism, we see continuations not only of the fire cult but of the haoma cult. The evidence from Togolok 21 indicates that during his reform of old Indo-Iranian religious practices, Zoroaster could not ignore the traditions connected with cultic libations. Although the practice of eating sacrificial meat sprinkled with the beverage was not condoned, the haoma ritual not only was included in Zoroastrianism but became one of its most distinctive features.
